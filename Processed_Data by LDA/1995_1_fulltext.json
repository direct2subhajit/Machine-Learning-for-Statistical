TROOPS -- White House Denounces Serbs; Aides Voice Fear for Pilot's Fate", "body_text": " **********The White House upbraided the Bosnian Serbs today for shooting down an American F-16 jet fighter, calling them \"outcasts and international pariahs.\" Officials said they feared the pilot had been killed or captured. **********Only a few hours later, on a day of shifting emotions and confusing developments, the White House press secretary, Michael D. McCurry, applauded the reported release of more than 120 United Nations peacekeepers whom the Bosnian Serbs had been holding as hostages. But he demanded that the rest of the hostages, who numbered more than 200, be freed at once. **********The events in Bosnia and Herzegovina clouded this evening's meeting at the White House between President Clinton and his two top military advisers, Defense Secretary William J. Perry and Gen. John Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to discuss future American actions in the region. The two Pentagon officials left afterwards for a gathering in Paris on Saturday of ministers from countries that have contributed peacekeepers. **********Mr. Clinton said little about the loss of the aircraft and nothing about the  hostages or the meeting. Appearing briefly in the Rose Garden at midday, he said he was \"very concerned\" about the fate of the pilot. He made no mention of reprisals, but in such situations retaliatory air strikes on enemy anti-aircraft sites are usually carried out. **********If hostages are still being released, one ranking Administration official said, retaliation might have to be postponed or eliminated altogether to avoid stalling the release or harming the hostages, most of whom are British and French. **********A senior military officer, briefing reporters tonight, said that air strikes  would be difficult in the next few hours, given what he called the \"fluidity\" of the hostage situation. **********Referring to his offer, announced this week, to deploy American troops to help move peacekeepers to safer positions, the President said, \"I want to reiterate and make absolutely clear that our policy on Bosnia remains firm.\" Mr. McCurry said Mr. Clinton believes the United States has \"a moral obligation\" to  support allies \"who have troops on the ground in Bosnia who might come under peril.\" **********Nonetheless, the downing of the F-16 greatly complicated his situation. **********As he attempts to placate Capitol Hill, which has roundly condemned the new policy, and to convince the American public that he is not being sucked into a debacle like that in Vietnam, the President is confronted with unwelcome evidence of how dangerous a place Bosnia can be. **********If the pilot is not rescued, he would be the first American casualty or prisoner-of-war of the intractable four-year conflict, and a rallying point for  those who oppose involvement. Dozens of French, British and other troops have died in Bosnia since the peacekeeping mission began more than two years ago. **********Mr. McCurry said that the downing of the warplane was \"one more piece of evidence that, in a wanton and irresponsible way,\" the Bosnian Serbs \"are making themselves outcasts and international pariahs.\" **********Pentagon officials said that the F-16 Fighting Falcon was on a routine patrol, of a type flown more than 20,000 times since a no-flight zone was created over the former Yugoslavia in April 1993. The single-seat fighter was flying, the officials said, at about 20,000 feet, in the region of a heavily defended Serbian air base at Banja Luka when it was hit by a Russian-made SA-6 missile. **********According to the Pentagon, the pilot of a second F-16 flying in formation with the first did not see a parachute before the stricken plane exploded in clouds below, but the pilot could conceivably have ejected out of the wingman's  view. **********A Bosnian Serb military source quoted by The Associated Press said a chute had been sighted shortly before the plane crashed on the outskirts of the town of Mrkonjic Grad. Adm. Leighton Smith, the NATO commander in the region, told the Cable News Network that he had an unconfirmed report that the pilot had been captured by Serbs. **********Search and rescue efforts launched by helicopters from the amphibious assault ship Kearsarge, in the Adriatic, were initially hampered by stormy weather and clouds, then curtailed by darkness. The hunt was expected to resume at dawn. **********An officer accompanying Mr. Perry said aboard his plane that it seemed unlikely that the pilot had survived. He had probably not had time to take evasive action, the officer said, because he had been flying just above the cloud cover when he was hit. **********Reaction in Congress to the Serbs' attack was muted. **********Sen. John Warner of Virginia, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said in Richmond that he was puzzled by the Serbs' success in downing as sophisticated a plane as an F-16. Mr. Warner, a Republican, said \"we have adequate assets in the region to suppress enemy missiles.\" **********Considerable confusion remained about whether the Europeans would ultimately  ask formally for American help in strengthening and repositioning the peacekeepers. **********In the Balkans, it was taken for granted that such a request was coming. But  some American officials expressed doubts. One said that Britain and France had had second thoughts about pulling out of enclaves such as Gorazde, where more than 400 British troops are encircled and cut off by Bosnian Serbs. **********Plans for such an extraction have been formulated. They would involve several hundred American troops on the ground, with American helicopters lifting the peacekeepers to safety and American jets flying cover. But that sort of redeployment would constitute a retreat and might expose the enclaves to almost  immediate takeover by the Bosnian rebel forces. **********Saturday's meeting in Paris is expected to reach no final decisions. A main topic will be the rapid-reaction force sponsored by the French and British, to which the United States will contribute equipment but no personnel. The meeting  will also serve to include the French, who have said they will not attend the meeting of NATO foreign ministers scheduled for Thursday in Brussels. **********Mr. Clinton met at the White House from about 5:40 P.M. to 7 P.M. with Mr. Perry and General Shalikashvili to discuss contingency planning, the status of the F-16 pilot and the hostage situation, White House aides said. The three also discussed the Paris meeting."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/11/world/terms-of-muslim-croat-alliance-are-set-at-dayton-talks.html": {"writer_name": "Roger Cohen", "pub_date": "1995-11-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 858, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Terms of Muslim-Croat Alliance Are Set at Dayton Talks", "print_headline": "Terms of Muslim-Croat Alliance Are Set at Dayton Talks", "body_text": " **********A wide-ranging agreement to invigorate a tenuous Muslim-Croat alliance in Bosnia was announced today by senior Administration officials and portrayed as an important step toward an overall Bosnian peace settlement. But the effectiveness of the accord and the strategy behind it remain uncertain. **********Secretary of State Warren Christopher, on a one-day visit to the peace talks  here, said the accord would bring the Muslim-Croat federation established last year \"to life\" and described it as \"an essential building block of peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina as a whole.\" Up to now, the federation has done little more than stop the fighting that raged in 1993 between Muslims and Croats. **********The agreement, signed after 10 days of negotiations here that have scarcely  begun to address the most contentious issues of an overall Bosnian peace, amounts to the first serious attempt to divide authority between the central Government of Bosnia and the federation, establish the rudiments of economic life, and integrate divided Muslim and Croatian communities. **********But it hardly touches on one of the most difficult questions: the degree of integration between Croat forces and the Muslim-dominated Bosnian Army. During a recent offensive in western Bosnia, fighting twice broke out between Croatian and Bosnian units, bringing the federation to the verge of collapse. **********Moreover, it remains unclear whether the American strategy of strengthening the military and economic power of the Muslim-Croat federation as a counterbalance to the Serbs will ultimately prove compatible with the stated American aim of maintaining Bosnia as a single state. The stronger and more integrated the federation becomes, the more the Serbs of Bosnia may feel their future lies elsewhere. **********\"If the federation can succeed as a multi-ethnic democracy, then so can Bosnia-Herzegovina as a whole,\" Mr. Christopher said. But if this is to happen,  then the relationship between the Muslim-Croat federation and the Serb republic  within Bosnia foreseen in any peace plan will have to be one of cooperation rather than hostility. **********It is far from clear how such cooperation will be worked out in that the basic aim of the Serbs' current leaders remains that of ruling themselves with a view to eventual confederation with Serbia or secession. **********As the agreement was signed today by the Bosnian President, Alija Izetbegovic, and the Croatian President, Franjo Tudjman, Croatia moved troops and heavy artillery close to Eastern Slavonia, the one remaining Serb-held part  of Croatia. **********The troop movement may amount to no more than saber rattling. But it nevertheless underscored the fragility of the negotiations here. President Tudjman has vowed to retake Eastern Slavonia by the end of this month through negotiation or military might. **********The agreement signed today gives the federation government extensive powers,  including control over defense, justice, customs collection, taxation, agriculture, health and internal affairs. **********The central Bosnian Government, whose form and function remain to be defined  in any overall peace accord, would retain control over foreign policy, foreign trade, air traffic control, immigration and citizenship, and monetary policy. **********Over the last 20 months, since the formation of the federation, Croats and Muslims have argued over how authority should be divided. The Muslim-led Government has been reluctant to cede any real authority to the federation, while Bosnian Croats have seen the federation as a means to weaken the Government and strengthen their ties with Croatia. **********In practice, Croatian-controlled areas, amounting to about 20 percent of Bosnia and Herzegovina, have been governed by the self-styled authorities of Herzeg-Bosna and have pushed ahead with integration with Croatia. **********The agreement seeks to undo this process by dissolving the institutions of Herzeg-Bosna. At the same time, four federation ministries -- commerce, traffic  and communications, energy and industry, and education, science and culture -- are to be established in Mostar. **********Every fourth session of the federation's government, which is to meet weekly, will be held in Mostar. The remainder will be held in Sarajevo. **********In one of its most important stipulations, the accord says a new customs system is to be set up by Dec. 10 and internal customs checkpoints between Croatian and Bosnian Government-controlled areas removed. **********Because Croatia and Herzeg-Bosna control geographic access to landlocked Bosnia, Croats have been able to take an enormous cut on all goods going into Bosnia. This practice has infuriated the Bosnian Government. Beginning with the  1996 budget year, the agreement says an agreed proportion of customs revenue will accrue to the central budget of the Bosnian republic. An annex to the agreement establishes steps to bring about the reunification of Mostar, the magnificent city on the Neretva River whose Old Bridge, a marvel of Ottoman architecture, was destroyed by Croatian shelling during the 1993 war. The city has remained divided along the front lines of that conflict. **********On the central issue of military integration, the agreement calls only for greater integration between senior Croat and Muslim commanders. It adds that \"international assistance\" will be sought in the creation of a \"joint planning staff.\" **********In practice, \"international assistance\" almost certainly means American help. This in turn raises the difficult issue of how American military aid to the federation will prove compatible with a large American presence in the NATO force that would be sent to police any overall settlement."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/26/world/on-quebec-border-fear-of-secession.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Farnsworth", "pub_date": "1995-10-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 911, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "On Quebec Border, Fear of Secession", "print_headline": "On Quebec Border, Fear of Secession", "body_text": " **********Like many of his confreres, Raymond Durocher, 45, a quality control manager in an Ontario polyester yarn plant, commutes to work every day across the Ottawa River from this small border town in Quebec. **********During lunch recently at the Grand Papa restaurant on the Quebec side of the  two-mile bridge to Hawkesbury, Ontario, Mr. Durocher and other diners were fretting about the possibility of frontier controls should Quebec secede from Canada in a referendum on Monday. **********What a hassle that would be,\" Mr. Durocher complained over a sandwich and fries at a table by the window. \"Imagine a green card and proofs of citizenship  every time you cross. It would be a real hardship on people here. Like entering  the States every day to go to work.\" **********A few weeks ago, that scenario seemed far-fetched. Opponents of independence  for Quebec had a comfortable lead in a referendum campaign led by a separatist provincial government seeking to make Canada's largest province a nation to preserve its cultural identity. **********This is the second time in 15 years that Quebec has gone through a wrenching  sovereignty exercise. In 1980, 60 percent of voters were against breaking away and only 40 percent voted in favor of secession. **********Fearing a second defeat could doom their cause, secession strategists have boosted the emotional content of their campaign, playing to Quebecers' fears of being overwhelmed by a sea of North American English-speakers. **********Polls now show the separatists' gaining momentum, and in some soundings they  actually lead, a development that has rattled financial markets in advance of what could be the greatest geopolitical changes in North America since Canada's  confederation in 1867. **********But the large number of undecided poll respondents, which has been estimated  at as many as 10 percent, raises questions about the reliability of the polling  results. In 1980, when the Yes side was also deemed to be ahead, undecided voters flocked to the No side. And even after the vote, it is not clear what would happen. Only a simple majority is necessary for the secessionists to win,  but a small majority could lead to something short of sovereignty -- legal challenges, a second referendum, or even extended constitutional negotiations. **********Any changes that would lead Quebec to nationhood seemed to be the last thing  anyone having lunch at the Grand Papa craved. Diners were troubled by a recent warning from Ontario's Premier, Mike Harris, that if Quebecers voted in favor of the \"divorce,\" new border posts could affect the flow of goods as well as people between Ontario and Quebec. **********\"If Quebec were suddenly no longer part of the country, there would be no reason for the rest of Canada to consider Quebec's interests,\" Mr. Harris said.  He suggested that secession might lead to a system of border controls similar to the one that exists between Canada and the United States. **********Sitting with Mr. Durocher was Phil Theriault, who owns Bonichoix, a mini-supermarket on the Grenville side of the bridge. It does $2.5 million a year of business, much of that in beer sold to Ontarians after provincially-owned liquor outlets have closed for the day at 6 P.M. **********\"If you had an international border here,\" fumed Mr. Theriault, \"that Ontario business would dry up, and I might even have to close my store.\" **********For the last 50 years the family of Jacques Desforges has run the Desforges Funeral Home in Grenville. Though most of the 100 funerals a year at Desforges are for Quebec families from Grenville, a town of 1,400, most of those people die across the river in Hawkesbury, a town of 15,000 with a hospital and nursing homes. Grenville is too small for such services. **********\"A border would be particularly bad news for us,\" said Mr. Desforges, a former member of the Grenville town council and a leader of the Grenville No committee. \"Can you imagine the red tape in transporting dead bodies across a national frontier?\" **********In all the talk about new customs and immigration procedures and identity checks on people, secessionists accuse the federalists of scaremongering. **********Henri Tetu and his wife, Anita, live a few miles east of Grenville along the  shores of the Ottawa River. Ontario spreads out a canopy of gray-green fields across the water. A bright red, yellow and green \"Oui\" sign is nailed to a tree  on his front lawn. **********Mr. Tetu, a retired Ottawa civil servant, invites a reporter into his sunny living room to assert with a gallic shrug, \"The border business doesn't bother me a damn bit. It will be a little tougher for a while, but it will readjust itself because business interests on the other side of the river are still there, and the people here who work in Hawkesbury and live here will have to carry on with the job. If you're a good nurse and have a job in Hawkesbury, I don't see how they would kick you out because you reside in Grenville.\" **********On one point, there is no disagreement: the deteriorating condition of the 64-year-old, two-lane span that represents the only fixed link between the two provinces in more than 100 miles. **********A new $45 million bridge is supposed to replace it. Financing has been settled -- two-thirds by the federal government and one-third by the two provincial governments. **********\"It took years to work out that formula,\" said Mr. Desforges. \"Can you imagine how long it would take to work out a new agreement with an independent Quebec?\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/13/business/market-place-analysts-say-allmerica-financial-came-to-market-at-a-low-price.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1995-10-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 691, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place;Analysts say Allmerica Financial came to market at a low price.", "print_headline": "Market Place;Analysts say Allmerica Financial came to market at a low price.", "body_text": " **********LIKE many companies making their stock market debut, the Allmerica Financial  Corporation was priced to sell, and its 11-million- share offering on Wednesday  was quickly snapped up by a relatively small number of favored customers at the  securities firms handling the sale. **********When Allmerica Financial stock rose $3.625, or 17.3 percent, in the first two days of New York Stock Exchange trading to a closing price of $24.625 yesterday, it was good news not just for the favored few who bought the initial offering but also for about 100,000 life insurance customers -- soon to be shareholders -- of the State Mutual Life Assurance Company of America, the predecessor company of Allmerica, based in Worcester, Mass. **********In the next few weeks as State Mutual converts from a mutual company owned by policyholders to a stock company owned by shareholders, it will distribute 37.4 million shares to policyholders. They will want to know why the stock was so attractive to professional investors. **********\"All you really need to know is that Allmerica's businesses appear to be at least as good as the industry average, but its shares were offered at $21 while  the book value was over $29,\" said one Boston portfolio manager, who spoke on condition he not be identified. On average, other insurance company stocks trade at prices above their book value. **********Many analysts said the offering price was a low-cost way to buy into the life insurance company. Allmerica Financial has a stake in a fellow company, Allmerica Property and Casualty. Because more than $16 of every new share of Allmerica Financial represents the value of Allmerica Property and Casualty stock, investors paid less than $5 a share for the life insurance and related businesses of the old State Mutual, which earned $52.6 million before taxes in the first half of this year, up $30.7 million from the comparable period last year. Allmerica Property and Casualty was 58 percent owned by State Mutual and 42 percent by public investors. **********The Allmerica companies are being overhauled and growing faster as new managers, led by John F. O'Brien, formerly a top executive at Fidelity Investments, have cut expenses and developed new products. **********Dan Theriault, an insurance analyst at T. Rowe Price Associates, the Baltimore-based mutual fund company, said Allmerica Financial was willing to set a low price for the new shares \"because they will probably be back to the market with other offerings, perhaps to buy a mutual fund company or asset manager, and they want to leave investors with a good feeling.\" **********He added that \"if Mr. O'Brien has one iota of the success at Allmerica he had at Fidelity,\" then the Allmerica Financial stock should do very well indeed. **********Unlike some other insurance companies that have at times traded well below book value, Allmerica Financial does not have problems like bad real estate investments or unpaid claims for environmental cleanups hanging over its balance sheet. **********Before the new stock offering, the reorganization of State Mutual had already caught the eye of some investors. Three years ago, State Mutual said it planned  to merge with the property insurance group and simultaneously de-mutualize, but  dropped the merger idea to simplify the de-mutualization. **********Many investors expect the merger plan to be revived, and some, including Archie F. MacAllaster, chairman of the securities firm MacAllaster Pitfield MacKay, expect Allmerica Property stock to be bought at about $27 a share, even  as high as $30. Allmerica Property closed yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange at $23.375, down 37.5 cents, somewhat below its peak of $24.625 on Sept. 26. **********An alternative, said Ira Zuckerman, an analyst at UBS Securities, would be for Allmerica Financial to sell its stake in the property and liability insurer  at a price well above its current level. And if there is no sale or merger of the property insurer, he said, \"you still have a company with a good record and above average earnings potential.\" **********Mr. Theriault of T. Rowe Price expects that Allmerica Property is likely to be merged with its namesake, but doubts that the terms of that combination will  be much of a windfall for investors in the property insurer."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/19/world/us-is-cast-in-the-role-of-serbia-s-new-best-pal.html": {"writer_name": "Jane Perlez", "pub_date": "1995-12-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 692, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Is Cast in the Role Of Serbia's New Best Pal", "print_headline": "U.S. Is Cast in the Role Of Serbia's New Best Pal", "body_text": " **********In a play that is drawing packed houses here, the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic, returns from the peace talks in Dayton, Ohio, with a souvenir bed cover fashioned from an outsized American flag. **********And his wife, Mira Markovic -- played by a man in drag with a Stalin mustache -- jealously berates her husband about the new love affair he seems to be having with Richard, as in Richard C. Holbrooke, the Assistant Secretary of State, who  held lengthy tete-a-tete sessions with Mr. Milosevic on the Bosnia peace plan. **********In creating their script, the writers were only satirizing what has become the official line: Washington has suddenly become Serbia's best friend, a notion that overturns four years of propaganda that portrayed the United States as the  archenemy. **********The morning after the signing of the Bosnian peace accord in Paris, a portrait of President Clinton and one of President Milosevic were displayed cheek by jowl on the front page of Politika, the state-run newspaper. **********The juxtaposition of the photographs was viewed as the kickoff of a new campaign in the media that Mr. Milosevic controls very closely. **********The same day, an article by the newspaper's defense correspondent, Miroslav Lazanski, said that Serbia should be considered as a candidate for NATO. **********\"What are we waiting for?\" Mr. Lazanski asked in an article headlined \"More Than a Flirt.\" He cited past Yugoslav cooperation on military training and equipment with the United States as well as a pact Yugoslavia signed under Tito  in the 1950's with two other NATO members, Greece and Turkey. The article was viewed here as a reflection of the military's desire to be included in the Partnership for Peace, created for East European nations as a step toward possible NATO membership. **********After Mr. Milosevic delivered on major ingredients in the Bosnia peace accord, the Clinton Administration no longer relegated him to the pariah status  he had even a few months ago.

Mr. Milosevic is expected to push very soon for admission to the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, all of which have declared the seat held by Yugoslavia to be vacant. **********For Mr. Milosevic to achieve any of this, Washington is looking for the Bosnia accords to be carried out and for an improvement in the human rights policies toward ethnic Albanians in the Kosovo region, an Administration official said. **********In Belgrade, the sudden emphasis on friendly ties with Washington is seen as  a power play by Mr. Milosevic, a former Communist who shows no signs of privatizing the state-run economy that is now in a shambles. **********\"The United States is the only way for Milosevic to secure his place in power,\" said Milan Portic, the director of the Center for Serbian Studies, a small research group financed by expatriate Serbs. \"His whole system is collapsing here -- the politics, the economics. He's in trouble and he needs the biggest power in the world to show to the people that he's respected.\" **********The United Nations sanctions, which made misery out of the daily lives of many Serbs, was seen by much of the population as the fault of Washington. Until very recently, many Belgrade taxi drivers, upon discovering their passengers were Americans, would vent their anger at the United States on the riders. **********But the metamorphosis was easy, said Milan Dozic, the chief adviser to Vuk Draskovic, the opposition leader who supports Mr. Milosevic's peace plan. **********\"As a pragmatist, Milosevic knows that all satellites of the United States are in a better position than those that are not satellites,\" Mr. Dozic said. \"It's a clumsy but aggressive try to fix relations with the United States.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/28/business/airbus-competitor-for-the-boeing-767.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-11-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 173, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Airbus Competitor For the Boeing 767", "print_headline": "Airbus Competitor For the Boeing 767", "body_text": " **********The European plane maker Airbus Industrie said today that it would develop a  long-range version of its A-330 twin-engine jet, a model that would directly compete with the Boeing 767. **********The Airbus consortium said it would cost an estimated $450 million to develop the new version of the wide-body aircraft. **********Its supervisory board decided on Friday to press ahead with the new jet, which has no orders yet but is expected to enter service in the spring of 1998. **********The new model, called the A330-200, is to carry 256 passengers in a three-class configuration and with a range of more than 6,400 nautical miles.

But then Mr. Sauvageau himself wasn't saying how he voted either. **********Sharon Leclair, a physical education teacher, watched Mr. Chretien emerge from voting in the suburb of LaFlorette. Like the Prime Minister, she opposes separation, but did not try to convince her neighbors. \"People don't talk about  it objectively anymore; they're too close,\" Mrs. Leclair said. \"Even at church yesterday, there were tears in their eyes.\" **********In Shawinigan, as in other towns, young Quebecers embraced the notion of a sovereign Quebec more vigorously than their elders. \"For the young people, the yes option presents to them a different way of thinking,\" said Guy Laliberte, an engineer who worked in the pro-sovereignty campaign. \"They have diplomas from university and they are unemployed.\" **********Shawinigan has been battered by economic decline for the last quarter of a century. With plentiful power from hydroelectric dams on the bend of the St. Maurice River, the town prospered until the 1970's, when the chemical industry moved out, leaving some aluminum and paper mills. The unemployment rate is estimated at 13 percent or more, forcing young people to seek jobs elsewhere. **********But Dominic Levasseur, who is 19, voted to remain part of Canada because, he  said, \"it's my country and I don't want to lose it.\" **********\"A lot of young people my age want to vote yes because it is fun, but they really don't know why,\" said Mr. Levasseur, a college freshman. \"Canada is not perfect, but I don't know any country on this planet which is perfect, so we have to work on it.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/29/world/british-and-irish-break-ulster-jam.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Stevenson", "pub_date": "1995-11-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 987, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRITISH AND IRISH BREAK ULSTER JAM", "print_headline": "BRITISH AND IRISH BREAK ULSTER JAM", "body_text": " **********The British and Irish Governments broke a logjam in the Northern Ireland peace effort tonight, forging an agreement that they said should lead to participation by political representatives of the Irish Republican Army in negotiations over the future of the embattled province. **********But in a clear sign of how difficult the path toward full-fledged negotiations remains, tonight's agreement deferred any immediate attempt to resolve the issue that has held up the start of talks for months: Prime Minister John Major's insistence that the I.R.A. give up some of the weapons it used in its long guerrilla campaign against Britain if it wants its political wing, Sinn Fein, to have a seat at the talks. The I.R.A. has refused to turn over any weapons. **********The agreement came just hours before President Clinton was to arrive here for the start of a four-day European trip that includes a visit to Northern Ireland on Thursday. **********Its main achievement was to set a target date of the end of February for the  start of the first full-scale negotiations among the British and Irish Governments and political parties representing both the province's Protestant majority and its Catholic minority. **********The Governments said they would try to deal with the weapons issue by creating an independent three-member international commission, to be headed by former Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, to study the question and make recommendations to the Governments by mid-January. **********The recommendations would be nonbinding and the British Government could still postpone the start of full negotiations if the I.R.A. proves unwilling to  give up any guns or bombs or the two sides cannot reach a compromise. **********The deal also called for an immediate start to \"preparatory\" talks in which the parties will discuss with one another in various combinations how full-fledged negotiations would proceed. Mr. Major and Prime Minister John Bruton of Ireland said the combination of the independent commission and the preparatory talks would give the peace effort new momentum after months of stalemate. **********Leaders of unionist parties representing Protestants in Northern Ireland said the agreement was a \"fudge\" that provided no assurances that the I.R.A. would renounce violence completely. **********Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, said he had not seen the text of the agreement. **********\"When Sinn Fein is briefed on the detail of tonight's agreement, we will explore this as positively as we have all other propositions to reestablish the  peace process,\" he said. **********The agreement came after days of negotiations between London and Dublin. After reaching a deal around 8 P.M. today, Mr. Bruton flew to London from Dublin to announce the agreement alongside Mr. Major in a late-night news conference at No. 10 Downing Street. **********The two Prime Ministers said they had not been pressed by the American Government to reach a deal before Mr. Clinton's arrival, although they were clearly happy to have done so. Mr. Bruton said the Clinton Administration, which has taken an active role in the peace effort and has sought to portray progress  as evidence of its growing foreign policy prowess, had played some part in working out tonight's compromise. **********A White House official said tonight in London that Administration officials \"played a facilitating role,\" but that \"credit belongs to the Governments.\" **********As he left the White House tonight to fly to London, Mr. Clinton saluted the  leaders of Britain and Ireland \"for their vision, their courage and for their leadership for peace.\" **********He said that today's announcement \"brings the people of Northern Ireland one  step closer to the day when the only barriers that their children will face are the limits of their dreams.\" **********The agreement was reached 15 months after the I.R.A. unilaterally announced that it would halt its campaign of bombings and other attacks in favor of trying to negotiate a political settlement. **********Both Prime Ministers said at the news conference that their aim was to restore momentum to the peace effort without forcing any side to compromise any  of its principles at this point. **********\"Reaching this agreement has been neither easy nor quick,\" Mr. Major said. **********Mr. Major has long argued that unless the I.R.A. is willing to give up some arms as evidence that it has forsaken violence for good, the Protestant Unionist parties that support keeping Northern Ireland part of Britain will never agree to take part in negotiations involving Sinn Fein. **********In a gesture to the Ulster Unionists, the largest of the Protestant parties and one that Mr. Major relies on as a political ally in Parliament, the agreement mentions that the preparatory talks could include consideration of creating an elected Northern Ireland Assembly, an idea promoted by the Ulster Unionist leader, David Trimble. **********The preparatory talks are to take place simultaneously with the work of the independent panel studying the weapons issue in what British and Irish diplomats call the \"twin track\" approach. **********Mr. Major said he was in no way signaling any change in his position on the need for the I.R.A. to turn in some weapons. The agreement also explicitly rejects a demand by Sinn Fein that the presence of British troops and police forces in Northern Ireland be considered as part of any disarmament moves recommended by the international commission. **********The agreement said the commission would \"identify and advise on a suitable and acceptable method for full and verifiable decommissioning\" of weapons and would \"report whether there is a clear commitment on the part of those in possession of such arms to work constructively to achieve that.\" **********The Governments said they would agree on two other members of the panel. British officials said that they would probably be a Scandinavian and a Canadian, and that they would be appointed in coming days. **********Both Britain and Ireland are clearly hoping that Mr. Clinton's visit to Belfast and Londonderry on Thursday will help strengthen opinions among both Protestants and Catholics in the province that there should be no return to violence and that both sides will need to compromise to forge a lasting peace."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/26/business/earning-it-michael-ovitz-the-5-million-option-man-at-walt-disney.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-11-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 771, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EARNING IT;Michael Ovitz: The 5 Million Option Man at Walt Disney", "print_headline": "EARNING IT;Michael Ovitz: The 5 Million Option Man at Walt Disney", "body_text": " **********SO just how much will Michael Ovitz make at Disney? That's been the big question since he stunned Hollywood, where money is a serious topic indeed, by leaving his mighty empire at the Creative Artists Agency. **********After all, when Mr. Ovitz was being courted by Edgar Bronfman Jr., president  of Seagram's, to run MCA, the numbers being tossed about would have made even Bill Gates notice, with the rumor mill putting a possible pay package around $300 million. But whatever it was, it wasn't enough, and in June Mr. Ovitz declared that nothing could lure him from his beloved agency. **********But in August he was indeed lured away. How -- in cold, hard numbers -- did  Disney do it? Nobody was talking at first, but the Walt Disney Company did let on two weeks ago that Mr. Ovitz had been granted options to buy five million of  its shares. Options are nebulous things, though; you can't run out right away and buy groceries, or Ferraris, with them. Disney won't say what they're worth,  so some figuring is in order. **********Who better to turn to than Graef S. Crystal, relentless tallier of corporate  pay -- and critic of pay that's too high. **********Mr. Crystal, as it happens, helped work out Mr. Ovitz's pay package -- as a favor to Michael Eisner, Disney's chairman. But Mr. Crystal had a condition: that he be allowed to comment freely after it became public. \"You'll make those  comments anyway,\" Mr. Eisner said, agreeing to the inevitable. **********The options give Mr. Ovitz the right to buy the stock at $57, about what Disney shares sold for when the options were granted. One could argue that since the stock might not go up, the options could wind up worthless. But as Mr. Crystal points out, even if Disney goes, say, from $57 to $77 in 10 years, for a feeble 3.1 annual rise -- if, as Mr. Crystal puts it, \"he only hits a slow grounder\" -- Mr. Ovitz still pockets $100 million. **********So those options are clearly worth something, and Mr. Crystal, of the University of California at Berkeley, uses what he calls an \"elegant mathematical model\" based on projected stock action for estimating that value. Here's what he came up with: **********For one thing, \"to say he has five million is a misnomer,\" Mr. Crystal said,  because Mr. Ovitz gets access to a million options a year starting after three years, and he has a five-year contract. \"Suppose in five years Disney said, 'Hey, Michael, you didn't do as well as we'd hoped' and let him go? He'd forfeit two million of them.\" **********So Mr. Crystal treated the first three million separately. Those, his formula told him, were worth $23.65 each, or $71 million. Because of the uncertainty, he put a lower, \"purely arbitrary\" value on the remaining two million: $18 apiece,  or $36 million. That makes a grand total of $107 million, about a third of the rumored MCA deal. **********But that's still serious money -- up there with the $111 million that Mr. Crystal estimates Ted Turner is getting over five years at Time Warner. It would put Mr. Ovitz far ahead of other No. 2 executives. **********Mr. Crystal would have preferred more moderation -- that's a big crusade of his. And, as he said, \"the Disney board would have loved to get Ovitz on the cheap.\" But the agent is a \"great bargainer,\" he said. **********\"That's how he made his living,\" Mr. Crystal said. \"And you can bet he was plying his negotiating skills to the hilt.\" **********And Mr. Ovitz, he said, \"had tremendous bargaining power -- he wasn't your typical No. 2, a faceless M.B.A. with a good track record running the steam turbine division.\" Also, he added, you must factor in \"the grim-reaper factor\" -- the fact that Mr. Eisner had heart surgery recently and Disney was desperate  for a strong No. 2. **********For all the huge numbers, Mr. Crystal ticked off some goodies that Mr. Ovitz  didn't get: an upfront bonus or a guaranteed future bonus, both increasingly common. **********You can bet there will be a hefty bonus, though. Mr. Eisner's has averaged $5.7 million for 10 years, and Mr. Crystal's rule of thumb is that No. 2 executives get roughly 75 percent of the boss's bonus -- an added $4.3 million a year. **********And his salary? \"Your eyebrows will not rise when you see it.\" Mr. Eisner gets $750,000 and has for years, and Mr. Crystal said Mr. Ovitz's will be in that range. But you can probably get by on such a paltry paycheck when you've already been given a $100 million welcome."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/06/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-comedy-central-account-in-review.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1995-12-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 131, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;Comedy Central Account in Review", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;Comedy Central Account in Review", "body_text": " **********The Comedy Central cable television network said yesterday that it was talking to several New York agencies about its account, which has been at Korey  Kay & Partners in New York for the last two years.

Cohen arrived in Eldersburg, Md., as chief executive of the London Fog Corporation, the raincoat maker. He soon announced that he was closing the company's five plants there, moving production overseas  and the headquarters to Darien, Conn. **********\"The reality is that the fashion industry is located in Manhattan and we wanted to move closer,\" Mr. Cohen told reporters. **********The reality is also that Darien is even closer to Westport, Conn. -- about a 20-minute drive -- than to New York's Fashion Avenue. And Mr. Cohen had a home in Westport. **********In August 1994, with the company dizzy and near financial collapse, Mr. Cohen, who said his predecessors had decided to move to the New York area, exited. In January of this year, only two months after the migration was completed, a new chief offered a new idea, since adopted: head back to Eldersburg. **********An isolated case? Hardly. London Fog's move was just one of many corporate relocations in which a declaration of high corporate purpose happens to coincide with making the boss's life more convenient. **********Earlier this year, Albert J. Dunlap, an avid golf and tennis player, announced plans to move the Scott Paper Company from Philadelphia to Boca Raton, Fla. The announcement came just days after he bought a $1.8 million home there.  Over dinner before the move, he had told a local member of Congress that it could be his first home or his second. Mr. Dunlap confirmed recently that his wife was not so coy. According to an account that he did not dispute, she had said, \"I don't know about you, Al, but it's going to be my first home.\" **********Just last month, Tenneco Inc. announced a move from Houston to Greenwich, Conn. Dana G. Mead, the chief executive, said he wanted to shuck his company's oil-patch image. Yes, he lived in Greenwich for four years until he joined Tenneco in 1992, he said, but wanting to go back there played no role in the decision. **********Mr. Mead might study the example of Armco Inc. , the steelmaker. The company, wanting to diversify and distance itself from its smokestacks, moved in 1985 from Middletown, an Ohio steel town, to Parsippany, N.J. Eight years later, after continuing losses, the company moved back to steel country, to Pittsburgh, under a new chief, a Pittsburgh native. **********Executives seldom need prompting to provide business rationale for relocations. But many bosses seem most alert to the rationale for moving to Connecticut's executive havens or, increasingly, to southern Florida's beachfront resort areas, where the golf season never ends. Larry Pelton, a business recruiter in Palm Beach County, which includes Boca Raton, boasts that  he is in relocation talks with four Fortune 500 companies whose top executives all have local homes. **********Although statistics are few, relocation specialists and attentive investors say corporations are becoming more mobile, with executive fancy figuring ever larger in their moves. \"It seems to be escalating,\" said Anne S. Hansen, deputy  director of the Council of Institutional Investors, representing pension funds with $800 billion in assets. \"It's our money, and it's being used to pay for moving expenses we are not really convinced are necessary.\" **********Having fought to limit executive pay, shareholders are starting to watch out  for bosses who turn a headquarters move into another perk. \"It's just a sneakier way of getting more compensation,\" Ms. Hansen said. \"Now that people are attuned to these sky-high compensation agreements, you're getting paid in different ways. One of the current ways to escape scrutiny for higher compensation is to move the company to your favorite place to live.\" **********The ability to manage by telephone, fax and computer has made it easier for a core of executives to plop down in a verdant suburb or resort, leaving everyone  else behind. Mr. Mead's new headquarters, for just 100 employees, will have the  latest in video-conferencing gear, allowing the Greenwich bosses to glare at division managers in places like Evanston, Ill.; Newport News, Va., and Houston. **********Companies moving only their top management put the cost at a few million dollars to $25 million, depending on how many go, whether the new headquarters are bought or leased and what the company considers as a relocation expense. But that does not include the human costs of dislocation or layoffs for underlings. **********As much as 90's-style chief executives talk about re-engineering, right-sizing and maximizing shareholder value, real estate agents sense a different message. \"That's always been the big joke in the real estate business,\" said Randy Strait, a senior vice president with the Transwestern Property Company in Houston. \"You try to find out where the chairman lives and show him a building nearby.\" **********This inspiration helps Palm Beach County convince many an executive that the  business climate is as balmy as the beaches. Besides Scott Paper, in the last few years the county has snared W. R. Grace & Company and the Thompson Medical Company from New York, and several more concerns, including the Wackenhut Corporation, from the Miami area. **********Two years ago, county planners quietly began approaching virtually any executive with a local home valued at $1 million or more. \"They don't have to live in the Northeast nine months of the year and visit here three months,\" said Mr. Pelton, with the Business Development Board of Palm Beach County. \"They can reverse that, and just visit the Northeast for three months.\" Instead of blowing its budget on a national publicity campaign, the development board has found it can reach all the right people just by advertising in The Palm Beach Post over the winter. **********W. R. Grace became the first big corporation to hit the local beaches when it moved to Boca Raton from New York in 1991. Chuck Suits, a spokesman, says the company's chairman at the time, the late J. Peter Grace Jr., and J. P. Bolduc, then the president, were absolutely not influenced by having vacation homes nearby. \"The decision to relocate was part of an extensive three-year study of 100 cities on the Eastern Seaboard,\" he said. **********It was Mr. Bolduc, Mr. Dunlap said, who helped lure him and Scott Paper. Mr.  Dunlap had bought a home and moved to Boca Raton, wanting to retire there. In April 1994, Scott Paper hired and brought him to Philadelphia, buying his Boca Raton home for $3.3 million. **********But Philadelphia proved too chilly for Mr. Dunlap. In a December speech at the Union League Club, he derided the wintry climate and the city's failure to appreciate his rescue of Scott Paper and the huge payoff for shareholders. Instead, he said, reporters vilified him, presenting the plaints of workers caught in vast layoffs. **********Other cities, he said, named buildings for him, held parades for him. \"Of course,\" said John Claypool, executive director of Greater Philadelphia First, a business development group, \"those were situations where he had moved companies  to town.' **********Having slashed the size of the office staff, Mr. Dunlap next wanted to dispose of Scott's tranquil 55-acre headquarters in Philadelphia. \"We had a pond, we had geese, we had walking trails,\" Mr. Dunlap said recently. \"It was idyllic, except nothing much happened there.\" **********Development officials of Boca Raton took full advantage of Mr. Dunlap's discontent, offering $780,000 in local and state subsidies. Local bankers, developers, medical leaders and politicians trooped up to see him. In March, Mr. Dunlap closed on a $1.8 million mansion at the Boca Raton Hotel and Resort. A week later, he announced that he was moving the company, too. **********\"My decision to move down here was done solely on economics,\" Mr. Dunlap said. And any demands from his wife? \"She had zero influence.\" **********Then, four months later, Mr. Dunlap agreed to sell the company to the Kimberly-Clark Corporation for $7 billion. The merged company will keep enough jobs in Boca Raton to justify the incentives, he said. **********Tenneco, however, has decided to go for the geese, reversing the usual, southward course of the corporate flock. **********As an executive of the International Paper Company, Mr. Mead had a major role in moving the company from Manhattan to Purchase, N.Y., in 1987. He lived across the Connecticut border in the Cos Cob neighborhood of Greenwich until Tenneco recruited him as president in 1992. **********When he became chief executive of Tenneco early last year, he followed through on his predecessor's search for a new corporate home. He announced the move to Connecticut, costing as much as $25 million, last month. The destination is an estate once owned by Henry R. Luce, the co-founder of Time magazine. There, a flock of Canada geese will find a new protector. **********Mr. Mead, a Midwesterner, said Tenneco was becoming less of an energy company than a maker of auto parts, packaging and other goods, and thus needed to be near New York deal makers. \"This is a business decision,\" he said. \"We clearly picked a place where we'd like to live. But when you get down to it it's one word: New York.\" **********Or maybe two or three words, among them \"Greenwich.\" Greenwich, Mr. Mead said, is \"as close as you can get to New York and still be in Connecticut.\" **********The consultants who help corporate chiefs choose their new quarters can readily serve their own cause, too. As Moran, Stahl & Boyer, the relocation agency, prepared to move out of Manhattan in May, it was pulled in two directions. Charles K. Elliott, the second-in-command, lives in Irvington, N.Y.  But the agency's new chief lives in Atlanta. **********Trust the consultants to find a solution. Several members of the firm are going to Atlanta and others to Valhalla, N.Y., the home of the agency's parent company, a unit of the Prudential Insurance Company. Valhalla is about 15 minutes from Mr. Elliott's house. **********\"We didn't think this out strategically,\" said W. Kurt Foreman, a consultant  at Moran, Stahl & Boyer. \"We sort of did the Boca thing.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/22/business/senate-puts-off-a-vote-on-veto-of-securities-bill.html": {"writer_name": "Neil Lewis", "pub_date": "1995-12-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 494, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Senate Puts Off A Vote on Veto Of Securities Bill", "print_headline": "Senate Puts Off A Vote on Veto Of Securities Bill", "body_text": " **********The Senate tonight put off until Friday a vote on whether to hand President Clinton the first veto override of his Presidency, as both sides in the legislative fight to rewrite the nation's security laws remained unsure of the depth of their support. **********Senator Christopher J.

A spokesman for Senator Jeff Bingaman, a New Mexico Democrat, said that the President had briefly spoken to Mr. Bingaman today but failed to persuade him to change his vote. **********Mr. Dodd is also the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, and his comments assailing the President were an unusually harsh and public display of impatience with Mr. Clinton. \"In all the months of discussion, in all the hours  of negotiations with the White House, these issues never came up,\" Mr. Dodd said of Mr. Clinton's reasons for vetoing the legislation. **********Just before the legislation would have become law at midnight on Tuesday without his intervention, Mr. Clinton said he thought the measure had serious flaws that would mean small investors would not even get past the courthouse door to test their claims of fraud. **********He urged Congress to modify the measure, saying he would sign a new version if a few changes were made.

It is a subsidy that is extended to every mother in France regardless of economic or marital status. **********Two years ago, when Ms. Tweig became pregnant again, the subsidy doubled, and it will continue until her two boys reach 18. Throughout pregnancy all Ms. Tweig's medical needs, check-ups and medication were free of charge and free of  burdensome paper work or delays at a government-financed clinic not far from her upper-middle-class neighborhood around Avenue Daumesnil in Paris. **********Last year Ms. Tweig's companion, Alfred, a photographer, was seriously wounded covering the conflict in Chechnya. He was flown back to France and spent nearly two months in a specialized hospital for war wounds in Paris, incurring no expenses, then recuperated at home for another two months with full pay guaranteed by the state. **********Ms. Tweig went to the Office of Family Allocations in her neighborhood to explain that she needed some help around the house to cope with her convalescing companion, her job as a free-lance writer and her children. After an hourlong interview, she was assigned a housekeeper for a few weeks. She paid about $3 an  hour and the social security fund picked up the remaining $7 per hour. **********\"This is the foundation of our Republican system,\" Ms. Tweig said in an interview. \"It goes back to the French revolution. Equality and fraternity are not mere slogans here.  For me the engagement by the state is an expression of solidarity that gives us values.\" **********Indeed, the message that people matter more was at the heart of a three-week  strike by public workers and the hundreds of thousands of demonstrators who filled the streets of every major city in France. The strike, the country's most serious labor unrest in a decade, was called to protest Prime Minister Alain Juppe's proposal to slash medical, social welfare and benefit payments in an effort to plug a widening budget deficit. **********The Government, and most economists, say the very economic strength that has  permitted France's generous benefits is in serious jeopardy. But the attitude of citizens like Ms. Tweig, multiplied millions of times over, shows why France appears headed for more confrontation over spending policies. **********\"I think most French people want France's values to be decided by this spirit, not by cold, remote, economic summits that speak of deficits and competition,\" says Ms. Tweig. \"That was the message of the strikes. People are worried the Government is retreating with its austerity plans and talk of balanced budgets.

The Government pays for moving expenses, care at home for older people, subsidized apartments, and even dishwashers and washing machines for those who cannot afford them and have large families. **********In the greater Paris region, where people are encouraged to use mass transit, employers are required to pick up half the commuting cost for their employees. Apartment building owners cannot evict tenants who are unable to pay the rent during winter months and are granted tax breaks to alleviate the financial burden until warmer weather. **********Welfare includes issues like the right of each office employee to have a window from where the person can see \"either sunset or sunrise.\" Five weeks of vacation is mandatory. In so-called high-stress jobs, like medical professions or journalism, vacations extend to nine weeks and are complemented by tax breaks. **********Throughout France, citizens are entitled by law to free schooling through a university education.  From day care through high school, subsidized meals are included. Together these benefits and many others constitute a form of subsidy that, in the end, allows people of limited income to stretch their life style beyond their means. **********Ms. Tweig says the safety net has allowed her considerable peace of mind. More importantly, she says she believes that it fulfills an essential social purpose. **********One of the most memorable comments on the upheaval cited by many here was made by a middle-aged railroad worker whose income is about $1,400 a month.

Many people explained that they supported the strike because the Government's austerity programs are stripping layer after layer of subsidies that permitted French families of even the most modest means to sample the cultural and culinary treasures that only the rich can afford. The strike and the protests were a defense of a way of life that brought cohesion and social peace to France for decades. **********With the strike now slowly winding down, sociologists, labor union leaders and most politicians agree that the three weeks of unrest will remain a decisive moment that political leaders can ignore at their peril. They see the public solidarity as a wake-up call comparable to other uprisings like the 1968 student-worker upheaval or even, some say, the French revolution itself. **********\"The French have rediscovered they can revolt after years of listening to politicians telling them that such bursts of anger produce catastrophes,\" said Dr. Gerard Miller, a psychoanalyst and political commentator. \"The message was:  market rules are not our problems, and don't expect us to be 'reasonable' anymore or put ourselves in the place of our bosses.\" **********In an editorial, the left-leaning French daily Liberation wondered: \"At this  point what is the fight about?

Since 1989, the company has been offering to pay its employees half the value of the ticket. Ed Sterba, director of corporate travel, said the program had saved Unisys about $200,000 to $400,000 a year out of its $50 million annual air travel budget. About 200 to 400 people are in the voluntary plan, he said. **********Corporations that adopt a buyback program generally follow a 50 percent rule. It works like this: If employees need to take flights with a lowest available fare of, say, $600, they can choose to use their own frequent-flier mileage and  are paid $300 to do so, less the income tax, Social Security tax and other payroll taxes on that amount. **********But the programs do meet resistance. Airlines object strongly, for example, noting that frequent-flier mileage is not supposed to be purchased, sold or bartered. **********\"It is definitely outside of our rules and violates the spirit of our agreements,\" said Tim Smith, a spokesman for American Airlines, who added that it was a difficult problem to police. **********Nine out of 10 companies allow employees to keep their miles, according to recent surveys by American Express and Runzheimer International, and workers often oppose efforts to take them away. **********Texaco, for example, perceived that the mileage from employees' flights was its property. But the oil company quickly backed away from any action after deciding that the destructive effects on morale and the administrative headaches were not worth the savings. **********\"Most companies throw in the towel,\" said Rolfe Shellenberger, senior consultant in travel management for Runzheimer. In some cases, Mr. Shellenberger said, companies that keep frequent-flier miles find that the policy hurts recruiting efforts.    BUT the forces pushing for buyback plans are also powerful. Industry experts  say the plans can save companies 10 percent of their travel budgets. **********Many companies have also been concerned that when employees are allowed to keep frequent-flier mileage, they may be tempted to take longer or more expensive trips to pad their mileage accounts. **********Such a concern helped the Boeing Company decide to keep mileage for its own use ever since frequent-flier programs were introduced in the early 1980's. **********\"To put our employees in that kind of subtle tug on their integrity is something we don't think is a healthy thing,\" Bob Jorgensen, a spokesman for Boeing, said. **********To counter the argument of Boeing employees that the mileage should be a form of compensation for business trips that cut into weekends, the company told them to travel only during workdays. If they travel on Saturday or Sunday, they are paid overtime. **********There have been other corporate initiatives that have put employee frequent-flier miles at risk. A group called the Business Travel Contractors Corporation, for instance, is trying to help companies use their collective buying power to strip air fares of traditional costs, like commissions, and base them on distance flown. **********One of the group's early proposals had been to cut out frequent-flier mileage. It has since dropped that idea, because the airlines said such a move would dilute the value of the programs, and they have refused to negotiate about it. **********\"We jettisoned it as a requirement because we didn't want to throw the baby out with the bath water,\" said Kevin P. Mitchell, president of Business Travel.  \"The objection from the airlines was strong.\" **********Use or Lose **********A reminder to members of American Airlines' frequent-flier program: Some of your miles may be worthless on Jan. 1. **********According to the rules of American's mileage plan, which has about 28 million members, miles earned in 1992 expire at the end of this calendar year. Although  other airlines also have time limits, American is the only major airline with an end-of-year deadline. **********Some members may have enough miles for a certificate for a free trip or an upgrade that would be valid for another year. Members can also donate miles to various charities with which American is affiliated. **********The toll-free number for American's frequent-flier program is (800) 882-8880."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/05/world/deadly-virus-spreads-from-horses-to-men-in-australia.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Shenon", "pub_date": "1995-12-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 828, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Deadly Virus Spreads From Horses to Men in Australia", "print_headline": "Deadly Virus Spreads From Horses to Men in Australia", "body_text": " **********Troy Rail, 24, an Australian jockey, was born to race. His father, Vic Rail,  was a renowned horse trainer along Australia's sun-soaked Gold Coast, where thoroughbred racing is a sporting obsession second only to surfing. **********Despite their shared mastery of horse care, neither father nor son could figure out why the horses in the family's stables outside Brisbane were beginning to die. **********They wouldn't eat,\" Troy Rail said. \"That was the first sign that something was wrong -- and then they really began to suffer.\" He shuddered at the memory of the animals' tortured deaths last year. \"First they'd get a twitch,\" he said. \"Then they began to shake, bashing themselves into the wall.\" **********Within days, 14 horses had died, their lungs filling with so much blood and other fluid that they drowned. And whatever killed the horses was beginning to kill Vic Rail. The 49-year-old trainer died a week after he entered the hospital in September 1994, his lungs dissolving. **********Only a few months before the attention of the world's scientists was drawn to an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in the central African country of Zaire last spring, Australian scientists were scrambling to solve a viral mystery of their own. **********It has turned out to be among the most ominous medical mysteries in this country's history -- a threat to human lives as well as to Australia's $2 billion horse racing industry. **********After a yearlong investigation that is considered a model of its kind, Australian scientists have identified the killer, a cross-species virus related  to measles, and believe they know how it was spread from the horses to Mr. Rail. **********But the threat may not have been contained. Investigators were startled in October when a 35-year-old Australian horse farmer in Mackay, about 475 miles northwest of here, died after contracting the virus. Investigators say it may have lain dormant in his body for several months before killing him. **********\"There is no sense of panic, but there is a sense of urgency about this,\" said Steve Bishop, a spokesman in Brisbane, the capital of the state of Queensland, for the state Health Ministry. \"There is a desire to determine exactly where this comes from.\" **********The organism has been identified as a morbillivirus, the viral family that includes canine distemper and human measles. Equine morbillivirus, as the Australians called it, is the first member of that virus family to afflict more  than one species. **********It is also the first member of that virus family discovered in humans since measles were first described nearly 1,000 years ago by the Persian physician Rhazes. **********Dr. Keith Murray, chief of the Australian Animal Health Laboratory, which first isolated the virus, said investigators were trapping and taking blood samples from small animals in Queensland to test a theory about the source of the virus -- that the virus thrives in the bloodstream of small animals and becomes deadly only when transmitted to horses, humans and other large creatures. **********\"Everybody would love to know what the source is,\" Dr. Murray said in an interview at the high-security animal laboratory outside Melbourne, its futuristic autopsy rooms and crematory reachable only through a series of air locks and bolted steel doors. \"If you know what the source is, you know how to deal with it.\" **********Investigators say the farmer who died this fall, Mark Preston, may have been  infected when he took part in the autopsy of a horse last year, a bloody procedure that would have allowed for transmission of the virus. **********Mr. Rail, the first victim, apparently contracted the virus when he force-fed the dying horses in his stables, pushing his hand down their throats. **********\"Vic Rail was very dedicated to his horses and trying desperately to save them,\" said Chris Baldock, an epidemiologist who was a member of the scientific  team sent to the Rail farm. \"So he was left with scratches all over his arms and hands.\" **********Medical investigators were called to the stables on Sept. 22, 1994, and took  samples of lung, spleen and blood from horses that had died hours earlier. Initially, investigators suspected that the horses had died of poisoning. **********But tests on the samples showed that the cause was a previously unidentified  virus that caused the cells lining the blood vessels of the lungs to clump together, creating holes in the vessel walls so that fluid leaked into the lungs. **********The Government declared a emergency, placing horses in other nearby stables under quarantine, and ordered a halt to racing around Brisbane for several days. Later tests on humans and horses in the area found no sign of the virus, which had apparently been contained by the quick action of the investigators. **********But the scientists' peace of mind was shattered this fall with the death of Mr. Preston.

But suddenly the company is finding itself heading down the treacherous road already traveled by several implant makers. **********Just a few months ago, the giant chemical company figured that its liability  would be, at worst, the $330 million value of its 50 percent stake in the Dow Corning Corporation. Dow Corning was the largest producer of breast implants in  the country, but a much smaller company than Dow Chemical, which last year had $20 billion in revenues. **********Also, Dow Chemical had not had to contribute to the $4.25 billion class action settlement on implant claims reached in late 1993, and Judge Sam C. Pointer Jr. of Federal District Court in Birmingham, Ala., had effectively dismissed it from liability in other breast implant lawsuits. **********But in the world of high-stakes litigation, events can quickly turn. **********In rapid succession, Judge Pointer reversed his decision, the global settlement failed and Dow Corning plunged into bankruptcy. **********Then, this week, a Nevada jury ordered Dow Chemical to pay $14.1 million in compensatory and punitive damages to a woman who said she was injured by breast  implants, the first time the company has been held solely liable in such a case. **********The company, which contends that it had nothing to do with the development or testing of the implants, has said that it will appeal and will fight every breast implant case. **********The Nevada case has focused a sudden light on the long and sometimes tangled  relationship between Dow Chemical and Dow Corning. And it has raised questions about Dow Chemical's strategy in the litigation and its eventual cost. **********More than 13,000 implant suits are pending in which Dow Chemical is the defendant or co-defendant, and even company lawyers acknowledge that it is only  a matter of time before some more come to trial. **********Referring to the Nevada case, Herbert L. Zarov, a lawyer for Dow Chemical, said, \"This decision will encourage plaintiffs.\" **********The award has already caused some jitters. On Monday, James Wilbur, a chemical industry analyst with Smith Barney, downgraded Dow Chemical stock to \"neutral\" from \"buy,\" citing falling chemical prices and the short-term uncertainty produced by the Nevada case. Dow's stock price dropped 87.5 cents on Monday and $1.25 yesterday, ending at $68.625, on the New York Stock Exchange. That represents a two-day loss of 3 percent of its value. **********As part of its defense in the Nevada trial, Dow Chemical pointed to numerous  studies that failed to find a link between silicone and serious health problems. But it also made clear that it was ready to play legal hardball. Its lawyers argued, for example, that the injuries claimed by Charlotte Mahlum, the plaintiff in the case, had resulted from spousal abuse rather than her implants. **********But the jury proved more interested in the relationship between Dow Chemical  and Dow Corning, one that dates back to 1943, when military officials asked Dow  Chemical and Corning Inc. to produce silicone coatings to insulate the electrical wiring of high-altitude aircraft. That military marriage created Dow  Corning, and the two larger companies have continued to hold equal stakes in their offspring. **********Until the recent bankruptcy filing, Dow Chemical and Corning each held five seats on Dow Corning's board, with the other five filled by Dow Corning employees. But because Dow Corning and Dow Chemical have headquarters about four miles apart in Midland, Mich., the chemical company's role as a parent may have  been the closer one. **********Some Dow Chemical employees had temporary assignments at Dow Corning and, at  times, the smaller company used its parents' laboratories, court papers indicate. Also, as the debate over the safety of the implants intensified in 1992, Keith McKennon, a Dow Chemical executive who had weathered the litigation  over Agent Orange, was appointed Dow Corning's chief executive. **********Initially, lawyers representing women with implants tried to shift liability  by holding the larger and richer Dow Chemical and Corning responsible for the action of their offspring. But Judge Pointer turned back that bid in late 1993,  holding that traditional \"corporate control\" theories were not applicable because Dow Corning was not a joint venture or partnership. **********Undeterred, plaintiffs' lawyers returned to Judge Pointer's courtroom last year, providing what they said was new evidence showing that Dow Chemical was involved in the development of silicone and knew about the dangers of breast implants. **********Earlier this year, Judge Pointer held that Dow Chemical could be held directly liable in breast implant cases because of its involvement in silicone work. Mr. Zarov, the Dow Chemical lawyer, said the company had asked Judge Pointer to reconsider because of what he said was misleading information provided by plaintiffs' lawyers. **********He said that Dow Chemical had performed tests in the 1950's on the types of silicones that were eventually used in breast implants but that the company had  no idea at the time about that future application. **********\"Dow Chemical was never asked to opine on the safety of breast implants and never did,\" he said. **********Whatever the case, a legal storm has broken over Dow Chemical, which appears  headed for skyrocketing legal costs and, potentially, more jury awards. With lawsuits against Dow Corning frozen, Dow Chemical is the stuff of a plaintiff lawyer's dream. That raises the prospect that Dow Chemical may change its tactics, said Judith Resnik, a law professor at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. **********\"In this litigation, the science is still new, and when there is a battle of  experts who disagree, juries say, 'Manufacturers, you bear the risk,' \" Ms. Resnik said. \"Dow Chemical's choices are to take the line that this didn't happen on our watch, or explore forms of settlement that adequately recognize any role they may have played.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/25/business/market-place-investors-frown-but-snapple-distributors-see-a-new-age.html": {"writer_name": "Barnaby Feder", "pub_date": "1995-10-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 846, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place;Investors frown, but Snapple distributors see a new age.", "print_headline": "Market Place;Investors frown, but Snapple distributors see a new age.", "body_text": " **********WHEN Philip A. Marineau resigned abruptly as president and chief operating officer of the Quaker Oats Company on Monday, many on Wall Street assumed he was walking the plank for what Business Week had recently rated as the worst billion-dollar deal of the 1990's -- the acquisition of Snapple, the iced-tea and fruit-drink subsidiary that has sorely disappointed Quaker and Wall Street since Quaker paid $1.7 billion for it last year. **********But Mr. Marineau, 49, said that his decision to resign after 23 years with the company had not been sudden, that in view of the company's recent restructuring and the sale of its pet-food operations, he simply \"concluded there were no longer two jobs here,\" for him and the company's 57-year-old chairman and chief executive, William D. Smithburg. Mr. Smithburg will now oversee the company's beverage businesses, including Snapple and Gatorade, as well as the rest of Quaker's food and international operations. **********The company depicted the resignation of Mr. Marineau as an efficiency measure. But the move did nothing to help the company's cause on Wall Street. Quaker's shares tumbled $1.25, to $33.50, on Monday and even though they edged up 12.5 cents, to $33.625, yesterday, they were still about one-third lower than they were before the Snapple acquisition last year. **********Tomorrow, Quaker is expected to report, along with its earnings, that Snapple's sales are up for the first time since the acquisition, and perhaps even that the unit has finally begun contributing to profits. Still, most analysts say it will be too little, too late to make Quaker attractive to investors. **********But those in the trenches, including Snapple distributors and the Quaker managers they are just getting used to working with, do not share Wall Street's  pessimism. They see a powerhouse just starting to roll. **********\"People have to understand that the game has only just begun,\" said Ken Adamson, chief executive of the Capital Coors Company, a beer and beverage distributor based in West Sacramento, Calif. \"Quaker has mapped a really excellent game plan for 1996.\" **********That represents a big change from previous years, Snapple distributors said.  Quaker came on the scene just as Snapple was reeling from its first substantial  competition since it had almost single-handedly created the \"new age\" category of teas and fruit drinks. Until then, Snapple's main problem had simply been to  keep up with demand. The more than 300 distributors experienced huge sales leaps each year, despite minimal support or direction from Snapple. **********By 1994, with giants like Coca-Cola and Pepsico plunging into the field and new competitors like Arizona iced tea springing up, the investors and managers who controlled Snapple were focusing their attention on finding a deep-pocketed  backer. **********But by the time the deal closed last November, there was no time to plan an effective sales and marketing campaign for 1995. The transition was also hampered by an inevitable culture clash. For Gatorade, Quaker relied primarily on a highly efficient, warehouse-based distribution system to fill sales orders  taken by brokers and Quaker sales teams. Snapple relied on sales and distribution by independent businesses, many of which had little familiarity with the kinds of detailed market research Quaker took for granted. **********\"There are a lot of differences in the distributors' desire and abilities to  move Snapple forward,\" said John Marquardt, a Gatorade veteran who now manages Snapple distributors in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic states. Some relied on Snapple for 90 percent of their business, others only 5 percent. Winning agreements from such a varied group and communicating promotion plans to retailers proved daunting. **********The results were brutal. In the canned and bottled tea segment, Pepsico's Lipton brands raced by Snapple. Information Resources Inc., which tracks supermarket sales, said Lipton's sales rose more than 20 percent, while Snapple's fell nearly 10 percent in the selling year that ended in mid-August. Snapple also lost ground to smaller brands that grew even faster than Lipton, including Arizona. **********Now Quaker has gradually whittled away at the confusion and suspicions among  the distributors, demonstrating superior operating skills. Where they once waited up to three weeks for Snapple to fill orders and often ran out of popular products, companies like Millrose Distributors Inc. of New Brunswick, N.J., now  get 72-hour service. **********Quaker has also been introducing programs to cut down on breakage and to stimulate investment in vending machines. New packaging innovations, like 12-packs, and products like Snapple cider teas, intended for sale this fall to extend the peak summer selling season, have also helped win over distributors. **********\"We'd be in much bigger trouble if Snapple hadn't sold to Quaker,\" said Joseph Rosamilia, Millrose's chief executive, adding that a strong rebound starting in August had lifted this summer's results 30 percent from last year. **********Still, Mr. Rosamilia's results were exceptional, and Quaker needs a lot more, including a substantial increase in Gatorade sales through the Snapple system, to quiet critics of the acquisition. **********Of course, if Snapple finally starts to outperform Wall Street's diminished expectations, it is Mr. Smithburg's reputation as a manager that will benefit, not Mr. Marineau's. \"That's life in a big corporation,\" Mr. Marineau said cheerfully yesterday."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/23/business/a-zapata-director-resigns-in-dispute.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-11-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 142, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Zapata Director Resigns in Dispute", "print_headline": "A Zapata Director Resigns in Dispute", "body_text": " **********A director of the Zapata Corporation resigned last week because of his disagreement over the energy company's plans for entering the food services business. **********In his Nov. 16 resignation letter, the former director, Peter Holt, accused Zapata officials of planning to change the company's direction without adequately informing the board and after \"misleading\" shareholders about new investments. **********The resignation letter and a lengthy rebuttal from the company were included this week in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. **********Zapata officials said their proposed plan to invest in or combine with the two restaurant companies in which the company's chairman, Malcolm Glazer, owns substantial interests, were in keeping with stated and board-approved plans. **********Zapata, based in Houston, has already sold some of the oil and natural gas production assets held in its Energy Industries Inc. and Zapata Energy Industries L.P. units."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/24/business/international-business-british-water-utility-accepts-bid-from-france.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-11-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 297, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;British Water Utility Accepts Bid From France", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;British Water Utility Accepts Bid From France", "body_text": " **********Lyonnaise des Eaux announced today that Northumbrian Water Group had accepted its $1.28 billion takeover offer. **********Lyonnaise, the first French water company to agree to buy out a big British counterpart, said it had won unanimous approval from Northumbrian's board and would pay Northumbrian shareholders L11.65 ($18.22) a share and a special dividend of 14 pence.

The front was subsequently outlawed by the Government and its top leaders jailed. **********The offer from Mr. Kebir constitutes a significant retreat by the Islamic party. Previously, it repeatedly called for the resignation of Mr. Zeroual's Government, contending that that the only way to end the conflict between secular and religious political forces in Algeria was to form a national unity government. **********While Mr. Kebir is very influential, it is not certain whether he speaks for  all of the militant factions that have been fighting the Government. **********The front and two secular opposition parties called on Algerians to boycott the elections, only to find that -- according to Government figures -- 75 percent of the Algeria's 16 million eligible voters cast their ballots. Mr. Zeroual defeated three candidates, including two moderate advocates of Islamic rule. **********The moderates would accept coexistence with the secular parties. The militants demand a state in which there would be no tolerance for secular practices. **********Mr. Zeroual ran on a platform of continuing to fight radical Islamic militants while widening the political spectrum to include the secular and moderate Islamic opposition. **********Several French, Western and Arab experts view the high turnout and the results as reflecting Algerian weariness with the civil conflict and a desire to have a strong Government in place to reform the economy and to maintain stability. **********Mr. Kebir appeared to concede that the Algerian Army, which Mr. Zeroual represents, emerged as the strongest political entity in Algeria, with a degree  of popular support that cannot be ignored. **********\"The Islamic Salvation Front is ready for a global solution negotiated between the effective power and opposition, a solution that could lead to peace  and stability,\" Mr. Kebir said in written answers to questions forwarded by the  Reuters news agency. **********He did not repeat earlier charges that the Government had tampered with the election or doctored the voter turnout figures. **********Election observers, including representatives of a number of Western and Arab Governments, said the voting had been reasonably orderly and that the results by and large appeared to reflect a fundamental change in the mood of the electorate. **********Back in 1991, when the first free parliamentary elections were held, voters chose hard-line Islamic opposition candidates, giving them 40 percent of the vote. **********By comparison, in Thursday's presidential election the two moderate Islamic candidates, Mahfoud Nehnah and Nouredin Boukrouh, received a total of 25 percent. Saeed Saadi, a secular candidate, won 9 percent. **********Algerian and Arab journalists and diplomats say the shift reflects a conviction among Algerians that the Islamic militants have been largely responsible for the blood spilled in the civil strife during the last four years, with attacks on artists, journalists, writers, teachers, unveiled women and other civilians. Islamic opposition forces often accused Government troops of indiscriminate violence against their civilian adherents, but commentators place most of the blame on the Islamic forces. **********\"Between the last elections and this election, four hard years have gone by in which around 40,000 Algerian were killed,\" said Jihad al-Khazen, editor of the London-based Arabic daily Al Hayat. \"The Islamic Salvation Front has paid the price for the rocky road it has chosen. **********\"While the militants threatened to turn ballot boxes into coffins, Algerians  responded in the only way that was decisive: by going to vote in a large proportion, which must have been a surprise even for the Government.\" **********Commentators have praised Mr. Zeroual for daring to give his people a free choice. \"He could have sat on his presidential seat without taking risks and declared the familiar 99 percent triumph vote like other Presidents in the region,\" wrote Abdel rahman al-Rashid, editor of the Saudi-owned London weekly Al Mijallah. **********France, the former colonial power in Algeria, which has suffered from terrorist bombings by Algerian militants in recent months because of its support of Mr. Zeroual's Government, endorsed the results but urged Algeria to move on toward municipal and parliamentary elections. **********Prime Minister Alain Juppe said the vote legitimized Mr. Zeroual. But he said the Algerian Government should engage in a discussion with all parties that accepted democratic government. He stopped short of saying the front should be included. **********Algerian officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it was too early to say whether Mr. Zeroual would respond to the front's invitation to talk. But they said they expect the President to begin preparations soon for parliamentary elections sometime next year. **********The officials, in telephone interviews from Algeria, said moderate Islamic parties including those led by Mr. Nehnah and Mr. Boukrouh would be allowed to field candidates in the elections. But they expressed little enthusiasm for allowing the front to take part. **********In his remarks to Reuters today, Mr. Kebir said it was too early to disclose  his party's negotiating positions if Mr. Zeroual accepted the proposal for talks.

That group, which included the General Electric Company and the Walt Disney Company, has offered $250 million, or $5.50 a share, in exchange for a 50 percent stake in the REIT. **********And it follows a proposal made on Thursday by Gotham Partners L.P., an investment firm that is one of the REIT's largest shareholders. The Gotham proposal would recapitalize the REIT through a rights offering that would not dilute the holdings of existing shareholders. It is intended to raise up to $150 million. **********\"We have had a very long-term involvement with both this company and this REIT, and we think that by combining our forces with Tishman-Speyer, we are bringing together very capable financial and property management expertise,\" said Daniel M. Neidich, the Goldman partner who manages Whitehall. \"The involvement of David Rockefeller should put to rest anyone's concerns about our  long-term interest in this property.\" **********Gotham's proposal seems to have served as a catalyst to the Whitehall proposal. Under Gotham's plan, Whitehall would end up with at least a 20 percent stake, but it has aimed to gain control of the property. **********Shareholders, who have favored using a rights offering to recapitalize the company, said the simplicity of the Whitehall proposal and the fact that it was  an all-cash offer made it attractive.

Whitehall previously proposed a more complex recapitalization plan that was rejected by the REIT. **********Tishman-Speyer, a New York real estate developer and manager, would manage the property and likely have a minority stake. Previously, Tishman-Speyer allied itself with the Mitsubishi Estate Company, the current controlling owner of the  property, to buy control of the REIT. **********While Mr. Rockefeller is probably putting up some money, most importantly he  is lending his name to the proposal. That gives Whitehall some very respectable  window dressing. And it provides Mr. Rockefeller a chance to polish his reputation and restore his family's ties to the property, which was built by his father, John D.

We're crazed.\" **********Mark Schwabber, president of Skyscraper Mortgage, mortgage brokers with offices in Connecticut and New York, said 28 percent of his business was now refinancing, compared with 5 percent a year ago. Toward the end of 1993 -- considered the height of the refinancing market -- he said refinancings made up  35 percent of his business. **********Within the last few weeks, bond yields, to which many mortgages are keyed, hit the lowest they have been in 24 months. And a drop in short-term interest rates this week by the Federal Reserve, followed by lower market rates, contributed to the public's perception that the timing might be right to take another look at the terms of home mortgages. **********These rate drops are \"setting the stage for a New Year's gift\" for consumers  and mortgage lenders alike, according to Paul Havemann, vice president of HSH Associates, an organization that tracks the mortgage industry. **********Currently, Mr. Havemann said, refinancing makes up about 25 percent of all mortgage loans. Last year, he said, refinanced mortgages were \"negligible, trivial, hardly anything\" statistically. **********And more refinancing business is expected, he said, echoing the voices of others in the mortgage business. \"It's a real possibility that rates could come  down more,\" Mr. Havemann said. **********He pointed out that the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in January 1995 stood at 9.33 percent -- while this week the national average was 7.23 percent. **********Today's upswing in refinancing is coming not only from people who missed the  last wave of refinancing. Some other homeowners refinanced last time with 30-year mortgages carrying rates that are adjusted ever three years -- and the three years are up. Another group of customers refinanced only a year or two ago, but are trying to get an even better deal. **********\"The conventional wisdom,\" Mr. Schwabber said, \"was that it pays to refinance only if your new rate will be at least two percentage points less than your current rate. That thinking is now out the window. There are people refinancing  with only one point lower -- and saving money.\" **********As an example, Mr. Schwabber said a homeowner might have received a mortgage  for $100,000 at 8 percent interest earlier this year. The mortgage rate for the same loan is now at 7 percent, he said, and if the person refinanced now, he could borrow $110,000 -- for $2 less a month. **********Increasingly, buyers are taking advantage of a procedure called Consolidation Extension and Modification, he said. Under this procedure refinancers can switch to a lower rate mortgage and pay only $300 in lawyer's fees and $500 for a title update. For a $200,000 mortgage taken out a year ago for a percentage point higher, the homeowner now could save $1,656 a year. Even with the refinancing costs figured in, the homeowner could break even in less than a year and start saving money, the mortgage broker said. **********\"Customers with mortgages over $500,000 are refinancing with one- half percent difference,\" Mr. Schwabber said. **********Nevertheless, mortgage brokers and lenders point out that rates are still higher than they were for houses or apartments bought or refinanced at the end of 1993. While a home buyer who closed on a house at the beginning of January 1994 might have gotten a 30-year fixed-interest loan at 6.75 percent, in today's market, that same loan would be almost a full percentage point higher. And while one-year adjustable loans were written back then as low as 4 percent, the same loan now averages 5.64 percent interest. **********Yet Abe Eisner, executive vicepresident of GFC Mortgage Bankers Inc., a company lending in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Florida, still sees a definite boom right now and predicts \"it will continue into 1996 as rates are projected to come down even more.\" **********While there appears to be a boomlet in refinancing, mortgage brokers also report more new purchases, which they say reflects an upturn in the residential  real estate market. **********But whether they are buying or refinancing, mortgage brokers say customers seem to be more creative than ever in shopping for deals.

The gyrscopes had apparently been disposed of in the canal to avoid detection. **********Mr. Ekeus said the missile parts, which may have been imported earlier this  year, were similar to those in a shipment enroute to Iraq that was intercepted by Jordan in November. Iraq is prohibited by the United Nations from producing missiles with a range longer than 90 miles. **********Iraq has failed to provide convincing accounts of what happened to dozens of  Scud missile engines and other missile components, the commission says. **********Mr. Ekeus, presenting the commission's six-month report to the Council, also  said that Iraq had experimented in the late 1980's with radioactive bombs, and that 80 of the bomb casings were unaccounted for. Three bombs were tested before the Iraqis decided the radioactive material -- irradiated zirconium oxide -- did not travel far enough from the bomb crater to be a significant deterrent to enemy troops. **********The Iraqi Government, already embarrassed in recent months by new disclosures of its chemical and biological weapons programs during and since the 1991 Persian Gulf war, has now admitted it produced much larger quantities of a lethal nerve agent known as VX than it had acknowledged earlier, the report says. The fatal nerve agent, which enters the body through the skin, cuts off nervous transmissions and ultimately causes victims to stop breathing. **********On biological weapons, the Iraqis are still failing \"to provide definite figures on amounts of biological weapons agents and munitions produced, weaponized and destroyed,\" the commission report said. **********Under a cease-fire resolution of April 1991, Iraq was required to account for and eliminate all its weapons of mass destruction before Baghdad would be allowed to resume selling oil. This embargo and other sanctions imposed since August 1990, when Iraq invaded Kuwait, have crippled the Iraqi economy, causing  hardships and suffering. **********Although the Security Council has offered Iraq opportunities to sell oil under United Nations supervision to pay for urgent civilian needs, President Hussein has refused, saying these plans would infringe on Iraqi sovereignty. **********Repeatedly over the last four years, Iraq said it had given the inspection commission \"full, final and complete disclosures\" of its weapons programs. A year ago, several members of the Security Council, especially Russia and France, began to argue for an easing of the oil-sale sanction. **********But the commission headed by Mr. Ekeus, a Swedish diplomat, forced Iraq's hand on several occasions by presenting independently collected evidence of Iraqi dissimulations. In the summer, when a high-level Iraqi defector to Jordan  threatened to make revelations about the weapons programs, the Iraqi Government  was forced to turn over thousands of pages of new documents. **********During the period covered in the report, Iraq's credibility has probably been discounted more severely than at any time since the end of the war, diplomats say."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/17/business/market-place-coram-healthcare-surges-after-a-reprieve-from-its-creditors.html": {"writer_name": "Milt Freudenheim", "pub_date": "1995-10-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 651, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place;Coram Healthcare surges after a reprieve from its creditors.", "print_headline": "Market Place;Coram Healthcare surges after a reprieve from its creditors.", "body_text": " **********INVESTORS who bought the Coram Healthcare Corporation's shares on Friday for  $3.125 found themselves with a hefty profit yesterday when Coram's creditors gave the troubled home health care company a five-month chance to straighten up. But even at yesterday's closing price of $4.75 a share, Wall Street analysts said Coram remained a risky bet. **********Coram's chairman, James M. Sweeney, started the year with plans to create a $2-billion-a-year provider of intravenous drugs and nutrition for patients in their homes. By last month, after many setbacks, his revenue goal was closer to  $600 million, and Coram shares had plunged from $26 in April and $19 as recently as July. **********The longterm future of Coram is still very much in doubt,\" said Randall S.  Huyser, a health-care industry analyst in San Francisco with Furman, Selz Securities. **********Still, there is some reason for optimism about Coram. The company announced yesterday that it had hired Donald J. Amaral as president and chief executive of Coram. **********\"Don Amaral has a very good reputation as a turnaround guy,\" said Vivian Wohl, an analyst in San Francisco with Robertson Stephens. **********Robert M. Wasserman of Southeast Research Partners in Boca Raton, Fla., also  praised Mr. Amaral. \"He is a professional manager, and Jim Sweeney is more of an entrpreneur,\" he said. **********Mr. Amaral is a 43-year-old health care executive who ran a number of small companies. Until last month, he was president and chief operating officer of Ornda Healthcorporation, a hospital chain. Ornda had merged with Mr. Amaral's previous company, Summit Health. **********Mr. Sweeney, who watched as the options he held to buy several million shares become worthless when Coram fell below $11 a share, has had turnaround successes of his own. He created Coram by combining four money-losing home health care companies with a fifth, T-Square, which was in trouble with Government regulators. Next he struck a deal with the Caremark Corporation to buy a home-health unit for $209 million in cash, mostly borrowed, and $100 million in  Coram securities. **********That looked like a bargain because Mr. Sweeney had sold the core of that same business to Caremark's parent at the time, Baxter Travenol in 1987 for $580 million. **********But Mr. Sweeney apparently had been having difficulty integrating Coram's first five components. Absorbing the Caremark unit just made those troubles worse, analysts said. Caremark and Coram recently filed lawsuits against each other, contending deception in the deal, and the accompanying airing of dirty laundry seemed unlikely to encourage timid investors. **********By April, Coram was announcing yet another merger, with Lincare Holdings Inc., a company specializing in providing oxygen to home patients. But the deal  with Lincare collapsed and with it, Mr. Sweeney's talk of a $2 billion conglomerate in home health care any time soon. **********Mr. Sweeney said yesterday that Coram's lenders had agreed to restructure $450 million in debt. The creditors, headed by Chemical Bank, agreed to postpone the first payment on the principal until next March 31. The banks were granted warrants for 2.57 million Coram shares. **********Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, Coram's investment banker, agreed to accept additional promises of future payment in lieu of interest on a $150 million bridge loan to Coram. Coram said its banking group also provided a new $25 million credit line. Donaldson, a unit of the Equitable Companies, said it had taken a $25 million pretax charge, apparently related to the deal. **********Some analysts sense an opportunity in Coram's struggles. Theodore E. James of Genesis Merchant Group Securities in San Francisco said Coram might have \"close  to $700 million in revenues and a market capitalization of less than $200 million.\" He reasons that it could be a valuable acquisition for another home care company. **********Mr. Wasserman of Southeast Research was also interested in Coram. \"You can't  look at Coram as a book-value play,\" he said. \"The book value and good will are  probably a negative number.\" But he added, \"We're thinking about jumping back in.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/01/business/kerkorian-bid-for-chrysler-is-ended-at-least-for-now.html": {"writer_name": "James Bennet", "pub_date": "1995-06-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 829, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Kerkorian Bid for Chrysler Is Ended, at Least for Now", "print_headline": "Kerkorian Bid for Chrysler Is Ended, at Least for Now", "body_text": " **********Kirk Kerkorian withdrew his hostile bid of $55 a share for the Chrysler Corporation today, but at the same time announced he had hired an investment bank to advise him on options, including another takeover attempt. **********The only step Mr. Kerkorian's representatives ruled out today was selling his 36 million Chrysler shares, roughly 10 percent of the company. **********Mr. Kerkorian's bid died with a whimper. Because he had lined up no investors to supply the capital he needed and no banks to finance the debt, Wall Street had long since dismissed the offer, made on April 12. **********Withdrawing the offer permits Mr. Kerkorian to wipe the slate clean and perhaps return with a more credible bid, this time with the assistance of an investment bank. He has hired Wasserstein Perella & Company, which built its reputation in mergers and acquisitions. **********Chrysler shares initially fell slightly on the announcement, but rallied with the rest of the auto stocks, closing up $1 on the New York Stock Exchange at $43.625. Investors may have concluded that Mr. Kerkorian would return with a stronger proposal. **********As usual, Mr. Kerkorian did not tip his hand today. \"Withdrawing our offer will permit us to take a fresh look at the situation and evaluate our alternatives,\" said Alex Yemenidjian, an executive with Mr. Kerkorian's company, Tracinda, in a prepared statement. **********But, he said, \"Tracinda's 36 million shares of Chrysler stock are not for sale.\" Mr. Kerkorian, who has been frustrated by the languishing price of Chrysler stock in recent months, would continue to seek ways to enhance its value, Mr. Yemenidjian said. Two weeks ago, Chrysler rejected a proposal by Mr.  Kerkorian to raise the annual dividend to $5. **********Another Tracinda spokesman, Michael Claes, said that Lee A. Iacocca remained  a member of Mr. Kerkorian's team. \"Nothing has changed with regard to Lee's involvement,\" he said, adding that Tracinda had not ruled out another bid for the company. **********Chrysler declined to comment today on Mr. Kerkorian's moves, but company executives had said previously that they did not believe the collapse of the initial bid would cause Mr. Kerkorian to give up. **********Given the lack of other investors, Wall Street was not surprised by today's withdrawal. \"They held a dance, and no one came,\" said Joseph S. Phillippi, auto analyst with Lehman Brothers in New York. \"What do you do? You turn out the lights and go home.\" **********Several of Chrysler's largest investors had backed the company's board in its rejection of Mr. Kerkorian's original bid, valued at $22.8 billion. The company  also enlisted major banks, convincing them not to lend to Mr. Kerkorian. **********Mr. Kerkorian and Mr. Iacocca had said they would contribute their own shares, worth about $2 billion, and seek additional investment of $3 billion. They would then have taken on about $10 billion in debt, and used $5.5 billion from Chrysler's own cash reserves to finance the deal. **********The last provision -- raiding the cash that Chrysler had set aside to sustain it through the next sales downturn -- proved to be a grave miscalculation. It enabled Chrysler to paint Mr. Kerkorian's offer as a threat to the survival of the oft-beleaguered company. Last Friday, Representative James A. Leach of Iowa, chairman of the House Banking and Financial Services Committee, said he intended to hold public hearings on the attempted buyout, if Mr. Kerkorian proceeded with it. **********\"The plundering of Chrysler's reserves would not only result in a financially fragile enterprise, it would also jeopardize the stability of its work force and sap U.S. competitiveness in the auto industry,\" Mr. Leach said. **********Mr. Kerkorian's withdrawal prompted Duff & Phelps, the credit rating agency,  to remove today a watch it had placed on Chrysler for a possible downgrade because of the bid. **********Leaders of the United Automobile Workers Union hailed the development, but added that with Mr. Kerkorian still on the prowl they would \"remain vigilant.\" **********Analysts said they were astonished that Mr. Kerkorian's original offer turned out to be so slipshod. \"The thing was so poorly executed and poorly thought out, I was shocked,\" said Ted Shasta of Loomis, Sayles & Company, a fund manager that owns about three million Chrysler shares. **********In retrospect, Mr. Shasta said, he wished he had sold his shares when they peaked at $48 after Mr. Kerkorian announced his bid, then bought them back at $40 when the price collapsed again. \"I wasn't that smart,\" he said. \"I took this guy very seriously.\" **********Still, he said he was not prepared to count out another bid by Mr. Kerkorian, particularly since he has engaged a strong investment bank. But, he added, Mr. Kerkorian would need to line up at least $5 billion in equity on top of his own  shares to be credible, an extremely high hurdle. **********In a prepared statement, Bruce Wasserstein, chairman of Wasserstein Perella,  said: \"Kirk Kerkorian is a serious long-term investor whose track record speaks  for itself. We hope to provide a new perspective and play a constructive role in achieving Tracinda's objectives.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/23/world/the-un-at-50-clinton-us-freezes-assets-of-cartel-in-new-effort-against-drugs.html": {"writer_name": "Alison Mitchell", "pub_date": "1995-10-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 800, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE U.N.

But its efforts foundered in the face  of a Republican Congress that has been cutting foreign aid. **********Mr. Clinton vowed to keep pressing Congress. \"I don't think the United States wants to be known as the biggest deadbeat in the U.N.,\" he said, speaking to reporters before a meeting with President Nelson Mandela of South Africa. \"That's not the kind of reputation I think we should cultivate.\" **********Mr. Clinton outlined the measures today as an effort to lead by example in calling for an international effort to combat the security threats posed by terrorism, criminal rings, narcotics and weapons proliferation. He urged countries to join in a declaration against international crime, including a pledge of no sanctuary for criminals, terrorists and smugglers. **********Mr. Clinton petitioned more countries to sign anti-terrorism treaties and take more aggressive actions against drug cartels. He also called for a greater  effort against the sale and smuggling of illegal arms and deadly materials like  plutonium and biological weapons. **********United States officials estimate that the Colombian drug group, known as the  Cali cartel, is responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine entering the United States and 15 percent of the heroin. **********Mr. Clinton's measures against the drug traffickers came in an executive order, issued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which allows the President to take action in the case of an \"unusual and extraordinary threat to national security.\" **********The same act was used by President Carter to freeze Iranian assets in the United States after Americans were taken hostage in Teheran and was used by the  Clinton Administration to stop the flow of funds to terrorist groups like Hamas  in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. **********Under the directive, which took effect at midnight on Saturday, American financial institutions must search for and freeze accounts held in the names of  persons or companies determined by the Government to assist or play a significant role in international drug trafficking centered in Colombia. The order also forbids American businesses and officials to trade with those individuals and front companies. **********The United States has so far identified 4 principal figures in the Cali cartel, 33 businesses and 43 other individuals whose property would be subject to the freeze, but they are all based overseas. Administration officials said it was too early to tell which holdings would be affected. The officials could not  say what kind of assets those listed might have in the United States. **********The officials said the ban on trade might prove more damaging to the cartel,  since the firms identified include export-import firms, auto dealers, chemical companies and Colombia's largest pharmaceutical chain. **********\"We have just, by making it impossible for that chain of stores to do transactions in dollars or do transactions with American companies, greatly devalued the market value of that company to the criminals who owned it,\" said Dick Clarke, a special assistant to the President. **********Mr. Clinton also instructed the Attorney General and the Secretaries of the Treasury and State to identify the countries most involved in money laundering.  Officials said the United States would push those countries to enter agreements  that prohibit money laundering or face the possibility of sanctions. **********While the officials declined to publicly identify the countries that would be targets, the United States has long considered a wide range as offenders, including Antigua, the Cayman Islands, Turkey, Panama, Thailand, Greece and Venezuela. **********On Monday, Mr. Clinton is to meet with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia at the Hyde Park home of Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Still, the 750 refugees slowly began to cross into Bosnia, their homeland. **********Behind them was a refugee camp in Croatia that they said was no longer tolerable; forward lay a country where they were hated rebels. **********These refugees took part in a rebellion here in northwest Bosnia against the Bosnian Government, killing thousands of Government troops, many their own neighbors and family members, and maintaining a semi-independent state for most  of the last two years. **********While in other parts of Bosnia it was Croats and Serbs who rebelled against the Muslim-led Government, here it was fellow Muslims who took up arms. And though the agreement reached in Dayton, Ohio, last month requires that any of the 1.3 million refugees who wishes to go home be allowed to do so, right now this is the only place in Bosnia where the side in control is permitting substantial numbers of former enemies to come home. The return here began last week and has already brought some 3,000 people from a camp of about 21,000. **********Today, refugees moved forward past glowering Bosnian border guards. First a few buses, then the chugging tractors with families perched on them and towing homemade wagons with the families' few possessions. **********Finally, the poorest of the refugees came through on horse-drawn carts. They  looked worn out and fragile, bundled in blankets and shaking in the freezing fog. **********Senad Sakanovic, 24, once a soldier in the rebel army, stood next to his horse, both of them sweating from the effort of a 15-mile journey through the snow-covered mountains from the camp, yet shivering from the biting cold. He said: \"The only possible future for all of us is to overcome our differences. We will have to learn how to do that one step at a time.\" **********To help both sides learn reconciliation there are more than a dozen international relief organizations here, including various branches of the United Nations. The Bosnian Government has replaced most of the local military units that fought the rebels here with police officers from other parts of the country. **********In addition, the Government is allowing the work of those police officers to  be monitored by a unit of 200 police officers comprising Croats, Bosnians and Turks. **********Still, the local commander of the United Nations Civilian Police, which has had a post here through most of the war, is skeptical. The commander, Inspector  Kurt Bannerhoff, said that as long as the international community is vigilant it will be difficult for officials to act against the returning refugees, but there is probably no way to protect them from revenge at the hand of their neighbors who supported the Government. **********\"This project is a good idea, maybe it will succeed, but personally I doubt it,\" he said. \"There will be serious problems in the future.\" **********When Yugoslavia began to tear apart in 1991, people in this region here increasingly turned for leadership to the most prominent local citizen, Fikret Abdic. **********Mr. Abdic's business combine provided most of the jobs for the approximately  50,000 residents, and though he was convicted of embezzlement in 1987, he became the economic and political strong man. Then he became a warlord. **********In 1993 Mr. Abdic accused the Government in Sarajevo of being dominated by Muslim fundamentalists. He declared the way to peace was through political and business deals with the Croatian and Serbian governments and with the local military forces those governments were fostering. **********The Bosnian Government disagreed. But in this region most people followed Mr. Abdic, even when he effectively seceded from Bosnia and set about making hugely  profitable business alliances with Croats and Serbs and, to protect his remote dominion, initially successful military alliances with them as well. **********That turned him and his followers into Muslim rebels against the mostly Muslim Government. **********Last August, after the Croatian Government and local Croat militias became Bosnian allies, Bosnian Government forces recaptured the area controlled by Mr.  Abdic. People who had fled because they supported the Government returned as victors and Mr. Abdic's supporters fled to the camp in Croatia. **********He is now reported by diplomats to be running his remaining businesses from Croatia. But here in Velika Kladusa, and the dozens of surrounding villages, people who four months ago were on opposite sides of the firing line are now faced with the challenge of how to be neighbors again. **********Relief workers say so far the reintegration has gone well enough, despite scattered threats by Government supporters and reports that several hundred returning men found themselves almost immediately conscripted into the Government army. **********Even so, watching today's group of refugees returning, Fatmira Keseravic, an  elderly woman who supported the government, did not sound very forgiving. \"Well, if someone has done something wrong, they might have reason to expect trouble,\"  she said. **********Husein Sadikovic, 62, who said his son had joined the Abdic army while he supported the Government, predicted that the hostility would be controlled here  in town but not in the rural areas. **********\"In villages it will be much worse,\" he said. \"No government will be able to  control that, even with all these international forces here.\" **********That is also the fear of many of the relief workers in the camp, especially,  they say, as the mandate of the United Nations is to expire in mid- January and  with the question of what responsibility NATO and other foreign forces will exercise over reconciliation efforts still unclear. **********But the ultimate responsibility belongs to the people here, said Burhan Tansu, the commander of the Turkish police unit. \"My men tell them, sooner or later you will have to live together,\" he said. \"You are a family.

But aviation experts said that unless they found evidence of a bomb or missile, firm information would probably have to await decoding of the \"black boxes,\" the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder. **********The board, which analyzes most recorders from American-built planes that crash, had not heard late today whether the boxes had been found. **********The F.B.I. office in Miami said today that a Caracas newspaper, El Universal, had received a letter on Monday, postmarked from Miami and written in fluent English, expressing hatred of immigrants and threatening to bomb a plane bound to Miami from Colombia or Venezuela. **********The letter said copies would be sent to The Miami Herald and The New York Times. The Times had not received the letter by today, and Paul L. Miller, a spokesman for the F.B.I., said the bureau did not believe that it was connected  to the crash. **********The airline has no theory as to the cause of the crash in Colombia. Nor do Government safety officials. The Safety Board sent a team of five people, and the F.A.A. sent three. **********The weather at the crash scene was good, according to Robert Crandall, American Airlines' chief executive. But in response to a question at a briefing  today in Fort Worth, he said the plane was \"somewhat to the east\" of where it should have been. Other reports put it 13 miles off course and about 40 miles from the airport. **********Jets navigate in Colombia the same way they do in the continental United States, using radio beacons on the ground that tell instruments on the plane which beacon is sending the signal, and what direction on the compass the plane  is approaching the beacon from. The planes also carry inertial navigation instruments to keep track of each turn. **********But there is a difference in air traffic control. In the continental United States and in nearby offshore areas, there is blanket radar coverage, and a plane that strays from its assigned course is likely to be warned by an air traffic controller. **********\"There are areas in Columbia where there is no radar coverage for air traffic control,\" said Robin Deyoe, vice president of BDM International, Inc., a McLean, Va., company that sells air traffic equipment. **********The Federal Aviation Administration said today that neither pilot had any violations or disciplinary actions in his record. The captain, Nicholas Tafuri,  57, of Marco Island, Fla., joined American in 1969, was certified to fly the Boeing 757 in April 1992, and had logged 10,400 hours of flying time.

Gen. William L. Nash gathered military leaders of the three warring factions here today to talk together for the first time about how they will comply with the NATO-enforced peace agreement. **********The hourlong meeting in this front-line village was largely symbolic: The hotel and restaurant, with its toppled brick arches and bullet-battered walls, is part of the Serbian defense position along the road that will carry Americans soldiers from Croatia throughout the sector that will be patrolled by the American contingent. **********General Nash, the commander of American military forces in Bosnia, met with  the three regional military leaders over coffee and cigarettes at a folding table in a room with walls blasted open to the cold and falling snow here, about 35 miles north of Tuzla. **********\"They are professional soldiers gathering together to talk through the issues at hand,\" General Nash said at a news conference later this afternoon at the American base near Tuzla. \"They were very friendly to each other. All of them focused on peace and pledged their determination to succeed with respect to the  peace accord.\" **********General Nash also responded to published comments by Col. Gregory Fontenot, commander of the First Brigade of the First Armored Division, whose troops will  be among the first to reach Bosnia in large numbers. **********In an article today in The Wall Street Journal, Colonel Fontenot was quoted as questioning whether a year would be long enough to make a real difference in  Bosnia. **********\"They think I don't trust them -- and they're right,\" he is quoted as saying. \"These are people who kill women and children and attack their neighbors. They're offended by me? Hell, I'm offended that I had to come here because of all their fighting.\" **********The article depicts him as turning to two black American soldiers and saying, \"It'll be interesting to hear what you two see, because Croatians are racists. They kill people for the color of their skins.\" **********General Nash said he had seen the article, adding: \"I am very disappointed with what I read. I am looking into it.\" **********[In Washington, a senior Administration official said of the statements attributed to Colonel Fontenot: \"They were very serious remarks of serious concern. Clearly if they are accurately reported they represent bad judgment, extremely bad judgment.\" **********[The official said General Nash had instructed Brig. Gen. Stanley Cherrie, the assistant division commander of the First Armored Division, to go to the area where Colonel Fontenot is stationed and find out whether the remarks attributed to him are accurate. **********[\"The direction he went in his comments is totally unacceptable,\" the official said. The official declined to say what action might be taken.] **********After today's meeting here, Gen. Nash shook hands outside with the three officers leading troops in this region, considered one of the most dangerous in  the American sector. **********The men were Gen. Novica Simic of the Bosnian Serbs, Gen. Djuro Matuzovic of  the Bosnian Croats and Col. Efendic Muharem of the Bosnian Army, who was representing the Bosnian Muslim commander based in Tuzla, Brig. Sead Delic. **********On a day when snow buried nearly a week of warm weather and the soldiers at the base bundled up to fight off the cold, General Nash repeated forcefully that the American drive to bring troops into Bosnia was on schedule: He said the pontoon bridge over the Sava River -- a thin floating ribbon that will funnel all ground troops in the area, from Croatia to the north into Bosnia -- should be in place by the end of the month. **********Until the bridge is built, the bulk of the American troops cannot arrive into Bosnia, and some military officials had said the bridge would be in place a few  days before Christmas. But General Nash said he would not move forward until all pieces of the operation were in place, including building ramps on both sides of the river, securing the Bosnian side with advance troops and making sure the operation did not unduly effect local towns. **********\"To create a quagmire would defeat what I am tyring to accomplish,\" he said. **********Despite the extended prologue, he said, troops would begin rolling across immediately after the bridge was complete. **********\"As soon as we put the bridge in and connect the ends and test it -- that will be a very short time, I mean a 20-mintues type thing -- we'll start rolling folks across,\" he said. **********At the meeting with the regional military leaders, General Nash said he presented each with copies of the peace agreement, along with maps of the zones  of separation and areas that must be turned over in the coming months. Some already had copies of the accord, the general said, but he gave them autographed copies anyway. **********The meeting also focused heavily on clearing mines, which is the responsibility of the warring parties. Today, they agreed that the parties would begin clearing main routes, then move on to smaller roads and later to pockets specified by General Nash. **********He said the snow, which began falling at dawn, had complicated the efforts to clear mines, now becoming more crucial because of the wave of troops expected to enter Bosnia in the coming days. **********\"It just increases the danger,\" the general said. \"This will cause us to concentrate even more on where we know there are no mines and work slowly in those areas where there is a possibility there are mines.\" **********The meeting here, in sight of a church and other heavily shelled buildings, was chosen in part because of its location. The restaurant, connected to ditches and fortified by bunkers made of logs, was a Serbian defense point a few hundred yards north of the Bosnian Government line and about a mile west of a major Croatian unit."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/12/business/in-peru-a-fight-for-fresh-air.html": {"writer_name": "Calvin Sims", "pub_date": "1995-12-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1628, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "In Peru, a Fight for Fresh Air", "print_headline": "In Peru, a Fight for Fresh Air", "body_text": " **********Every night before she goes to bed, Anna Gilapa gets down on her knees and stuffs cloth in the cracks around her doors and windows to protect her family from the acrid smoke released by the nearby smelter of the Southern Peru Copper  Corporation. **********Mrs. Gilapa fears for the health of her 1-year-old son, Brian, who suffers from severe respiratory problems and often coughs up thick mucous. And for that, she and other residents of this bleak coastal town 580 miles south of Lima blame the largest local company, Southern Peru Copper, which environmentalists say spews 2,000 tons of sulfur dioxide into the air each day, or 10 to 15 times the  limit for similar plants operating in the United States. **********At times, the smoke from the smelter is so thick that it hovers over the city like a heavy fog, forcing motorists to turn on their headlights during the  day and sending residents to hospitals and clinics coughing, wheezing and vomiting. On those days, children are told to play indoors. **********\"All we want is an end to the pollution,\" said Ilo's Mayor, Ernesto Herrera Becerra, who said emissions from the smelter had ruined agriculture and fishing  in the area. \"This situation would not be allowed to exist in the United States.\" **********But officials of Southern Peru Copper, which is controlled by three big American companies -- Asarco Inc., the Phelps Dodge Corporation and the Marmon Group -- maintain that their smelter is not to blame for the town's health problems and that their workers have never complained. Nevertheless, Southern Peru will spend $151 million on environment projects in the region. **********Environmental groups concede the plant complies with Peruvian environmental standards but say that is precisely the problem. All too often, they say, the absence of strong laws in many developing countries enables giant multinationals -- especially in the mining and chemical industries -- to play fast and loose with the local environment and the local population's health. **********\"I'm afraid these countries are at the mercy of the multinational corporations,\" said Kenny Bruno, a toxins investigator for Greenpeace, the environmental group. **********Although some multinational corporations have voluntarily adopted policies that require their overseas operations to comply with the same environmental standards they must follow in the United States, there are currently no agreements between industrialized nations or policing mechanisms to insure compliance, Mr. Bruno noted. **********As a result, foreign corporations often come under attack from political and  environmental activists in the third world, accused by them of putting profits ahead of ethics. **********For example, Royal Dutch/Shell, the world's largest oil company, has been denounced in both Nigeria and abroad for participating in a $3.8 billion natural gas plant in Nigeria, despite international condemnation of the military Government for the recent executions of Ken Saro-Wiwa, a prominent Nigerian playwright, and eight other critics of Shell's environmental record and of the Government. **********Nigerian courts convicted the nine for involvement in four killings. The men  had insisted they were innocent and had been framed to silence their criticism of the oil industry's environmental record. Shell has defended its role in Nigeria. **********In addition, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, which provides insurance and financing for American companies doing business overseas, last month canceled Freeport-McMoran Copper and Gold Inc.'s political risk insurance  for a huge mining project in the Indonesian province of Irian Jaya because of supposed environmental problems. **********Environmental groups say that the company, a unit of Freeport-McMoran Inc., which is based in New Orleans, has done little to contain the runoff of toxic wastes that they contend have killed fish in nearby rivers. They also say that local villagers can no longer drink water from the river. The company strongly denies the mine tailings are toxic. In newspaper advertisements that appeared recently, it accused \"foreign special interest groups\" of conducting a smear campaign against it. **********For its part, Southern Peru Copper denies that a health problem exists in Ilo. In a recent interview at the company's offices in Lima, Hans A. Flury, its  vice president for legal affairs, said that in the 30 years the company has operated in Ilo, it had never received a complaint from any of its 2,000 workers. That alone, he said, was proof that the environment is healthy. **********But in several early-morning interviews with Southern Peru employees waiting  for company buses to take them to their jobs, dozens of workers said that they and their families suffered respiratory problems, including difficulty in breathing, coughing up heavy mucous and vomiting in reaction to the smelter's smoke. **********The workers, who requested anonymity for fear of reprisals, said they had reported these ailments to supervisors to no avail. They said they continued to  work for Southern Peru because there were no other jobs available. **********Asked how the company accounted for Ilo's health problems, Mr. Flury, the vice president, said: \"I don't live in Ilo so I don't know. I have not been there on one of those smoky days.\" He also declined to comment on environmentalists' estimates of the magnitude of the smelter's discharges, saying the company had made no studies on the subject. **********The company has recently made some gestures to the local residents, including the announcement of a project to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions. But Ilo residents said Mr. Flury's cavalier response was more typical of the way Southern Peru Copper had responded to their cries for help. So they have filed a lawsuit against the company, its owners and its creditors in a Texas court, seeking damages for what they say are decades of environmental harm. Residents said that previous suits filed in Peru had been dismissed or were stalled in the courts. **********Robert Hilliard, a lawyer who filed the suit for Ilo residents, said that Southern Peru Copper had \"visited environmental terrorism on the families of Ilo\" and that the company had destroyed a 12-mile stretch of coastline by dumping 30 million metric tons of untreated mining wastes into the ocean each year. **********Southern Peru declines to comment on the lawsuit. But a walk along Ilo's beaches is an excursion that few local residents make: A narrow stream of blackened water flows into the ocean while a bleak terrain of slate-colored silt stretches in both directions, reflecting fluorescent hues of green, yellow and blue. **********Still, Ilo residents face an uphill struggle in their legal battle. **********Though the provincial health ministry said that respiratory ailments are the  leading health problem reported among the people of Ilo, there are no medical studies showing a direct link between the town's health problems and Southern Peru Copper's operations. The ministry declined to release specific figures, but said that the incidence of respiratory ailments, cancer, urinary diseases, and diseases affecting the circulatory system has risen steadily in the last five years. **********Meanwhile, Southern Peru, the eighth-largest copper producer in the world, remains a vital part of the Peru's economy, providing 5,500 jobs and 17 percent  of the country's export income. **********The company's main owners -- Asarco Inc. of New York, with a 51.8 percent stake; the Phelps Dodge Corporation of Phoenix, with 13.4 percent, and the Marmon Group of Chicago, which is controlled by the Pritzker family, with 16.7 percent -- all declined to comment on the lawsuit and the mining company's practices. The remaining 17.3 percent of the company is traded on the Lima Stock Exchange. **********Southern Peru Copper's profits have boomed recently as copper prices have risen. Net income increased last year to $110 million from $43.6 million in 1993. Revenues in the same period increased to $677 million from $450 million. **********Charles Preble, Southern Peru's president, took a more conciliatory attitude  toward Ilo's residents than his vice president. In an interview, Mr. Preble said that Southern Peru Copper had always operated within the confines of Peruvian law. While he acknowledged that Peru does not set limits on emission rates, he said his company had been \"a good corporate citizen,\" providing workers with housing, education, electricity, water, medical care and food. **********Southern Peru has also announced plans to spend $151 million on environment projects, including a $108 million sulfuric acid plant to reduce sulfur dioxide  emissions at Ilo, a tailings dam near Toquepala, and a water treatment plant and a retention wall to keep waste from entering the Pacific at Ilo. **********\"We have a good relationship with the community, and I'd like to comment further but I can't because of this lawsuit,\" Mr. Preble said. **********Corrine Schmidt, editor of Equilibrio, an environmental newsletter based in Lima, said that Southern Peru \"is being disingenuous to say that they didn't know what was going on.\" She added: \"They knowingly did things that they shouldn't have done but were allowed to do. But the question is who's to blame,  the Government or Southern? Probably both.\" **********The company gets a mixed review from a local environmental group.  Jose Luis  Lopez Follegatti, director of the Association of Civil Labor, said that once built, the tailings dam and the retention wall should eliminate Southern Peru's  pollution of the ocean. But he said that the sulfuric acid plant was expected to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by only 15 percent. **********Southern Peru has built a village for its mostly American and other foreign engineers and executives and their families in Ilo's hills. It has ranch houses, a hospital, school, playground, cinema, and verdant trees and lawns, in sharp contrast to the arid streets of the town itself. **********Women who work as maids in the village say their employers often complain about the smoke and sometimes wear masks in their homes when the smoke is heavy. \"They are comforted by the fact that they only have to spend a few years here and then they move back to the States to clear their lungs,\" said a maid who identified herself as Suzy. \"We are not so lucky.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/06/business/company-briefs-088773.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-12-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 73, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********A.

Simpson? \n\n     As the Simpson case moves from the courtroom to the marketplace, this question arises with some urgency because a cascade of dubious marketing may be about ...", "word_count": 1093, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "VIEWPOINT;The Morals of Marketing Simpson", "print_headline": "VIEWPOINT;The Morals of Marketing Simpson", "body_text": " **********TO what extent is it ethical for a corporation to involve itself with O.J. Simpson? **********As the Simpson case moves from the courtroom to the marketplace, this question arises with some urgency because a cascade of dubious marketing may be about to descend.  Recent press reports indicate that Mr. Simpson's advisers  have plans for a $10 million pay-TV special and hope to receive a multimillion-dollar advance for his next book (in which he will explain \"what really happened\"). Smaller companies have already experienced a surging demand for O.J. memorabilia: T-shirts, posters, sports equipment and autographs. Alas,  notoriety sells. **********The ethical issue lurking in any entanglement with a suspected murderer will not arise for most corporations because they would probably prefer to use Attila the Hun over O.J. as their spokesperson. Public opinion polls tell them that a majority of the country continues to believe that, his acquittal notwithstanding, Mr. Simpson is guilty of two grisly murders. Indeed, some marketers have already backed away. **********Nonetheless, the ethical issues are not self-policing. Many corporations target products and advertising at very specific and narrow audiences, and Mr. Simpson may prove to be a highly marketable figure in minority communities where he remains an icon. Predictably, a corporation will experiment with O.J. endorsing some minority-targeted product (a brand of liquor or cigarette, perhaps, or a magazine); if successful, others may follow. At its worst, this could become the marketing equivalent of \"playing the race card\" -- that is, the use of Mr. Simpson as a defiant symbol precisely to capitalize on its inflammatory effect. **********For media companies, the issues are more problematic. The public demand seems obvious. \"Court TV\" addicts, facing cold-turkey withdrawal from their favorite soap opera, would probably rush to buy a book or consume a TV special that gives Mr. Simpson's \"inside\" perspective. **********So the ethical issue persists for corporations that may want to exploit that  demand. But what precisely is the ethical issue? **********Wrongly defined, it asks: Can an \"ethical\" corporation have any involvement with a person whom its managers and owners believe to be guilty of a terrible crime? The problem here lies not in the predictable response that Mr. Simpson was acquitted (a criminal jury, after all, is only empowered to decide that a reasonable doubt exists). Rather, it lies in the public's right to know. **********Business ethics should not be defined in such a way as to encroach upon First Amendment values. Media corporations can thus fairly claim that Mr. Simpson is no different than a variety of other figures -- some convicted, some acquitted -- whose speech would have historical value (Aldrich Ames on the C.I.A., for example, or Michael Milken on Wall Street). **********Indeed, in striking down New York's \"Son of Sam\" law that required publishers to escrow the profits received by criminals from books describing their crimes,  the Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment cannot tolerate any law that seeks to target and chill a particular form of lawful speech. Although no corporation is required to publish or promote Mr. Simpson, the traditional idea  that the marketplace promotes the search for truth is a legitimate justification for some corporate involvement with him. **********The real ethical issue involves how any corporation associates itself with Mr. Simpson. Simply put, it is ethically permissible to publish Mr. Simpson's book or defense, but sleazy to use someone that management believes to have \"gotten away with murder\" to market a corporate product or service, even to a narrow audience that sees him as an idol. A Barbara Walters interviewing O.J. may be in the tradition of Edward R. Murrow investigating Senator McCarthy, but  a smirking Jay Leno interviewing him is not. The classic idea that a free marketplace of ideas promotes the search for truth justifies the first, but not  the second. **********In publishing or presenting Mr. Simpson, business ethics should also require  truth in advertising. Promoting a Simpson book as the \"true\" story or the \"inside story of what actually happened\" seems dubious without some affirmative  efforts to verify those facts. A publisher need not believe its author, but it cannot ethically present as true what it has serious reason to believe is false. An ethical publisher should distance itself from those statements it doubts. **********Finally, noncommercial associations between the corporation and a controversial figure who remains under a cloud of suspicion also raise ethical concerns. Many corporations use sports and public figures at internal corporate  events -- as motivational speakers at sales conferences, for instance, or as figureheads at annual golf tournaments.  No simple prophylactic rule can address every such situation, but clearly such a use of Mr. Simpson (unlike the publication of a book or an interview on TV) cannot be justified by the claim that it promotes a search for truth. **********Today, more than 90 percent of the largest United States companies have a corporate code of ethics, many of which address issues like truth in advertising or preservation of the company's reputation for integrity. A growing number of such companies -- around 20 percent -- also have formalized ethics committees or a similar body to evaluate fact-specific ethical issues. **********Unfortunately, the focus of these codes and committees has been narrowly legalistic, with the principal intent being to restrict lower-echelon management from engaging in unlawful conduct, like making bribes, payoffs or political contributions, that may injure the corporation. It is not the junior manager, however, who will endanger the corporation's reputation by using Mr. Simpson as  a corporate representative. **********This observation leads to two policy conclusions: First, senior managers must take seriously the mechanisms they have put in place for others and refer any use of or association with a figure like Mr. Simpson to such an ethics review.

In the overall office market in Washington, vacancies are placed at a substantial 18 percent in what brokers consider Class C buildings -- older office buildings. The Class B buildings, older buildings but candidates for upgrading in stronger markets, have a vacancy rate of only 7 percent.

Through Studley and the real estate company of Larson, Ball & Gould, leases were signed with McKenna & Cuneo, a law firm, for 110,000 square feet, and with Hunton & Williams, another law firm, for 80,000 square feet.

It will be faced in glass and green stone from Britain, framed in stainless steel.  The corner entrance is a quarter circle flanked by columns. Within the entrance, a balcony will overlook an interior courtyard. **********Kaempfer is one of Washington's largest builders. It renovated the Warner theater, redone as part of an office complex at Pennsylvania Avenue and 12th Street. The company has built more than three million square feet of office space in Washington. **********\"The pendulum has swung a little more in favor of the landlord,\" said Mitchell N. Schear, senior vice president of Kaempfer. \"In the past six months tenants have started competing for space in existing buildings.\" **********As a result, rent concessions from owners have grown more moderate, brokers report, and basic rent levels are \"edging up,\" in the phrase of brokers. **********Another sign of encouragement to brokers is a rehabilitation project in the office building at 2020 K Street, about a block from the Kaempfer project. Quadrangle Development, the owner, renovated the floors while shifting the tenants within, at a time when the building was largely empty.

But these moves did not seem to fit with Mr. Iguchi's other trading. Although he certainly made large bets, he was ostensibly a straightforward short-term investor betting on the direction of interest rates. **********Last week, the motive for the strange trades suddenly became clear, when Daiwa announced that Mr. Iguchi had racked up $1.1 billion in losses over the last 11 years. **********\"When I saw in the paper what he did, I finally understood what happened,\" said one trader who had done business with Mr. Iguchi at Lehman. **********The effect of those unusual trades, known as basis trades, was actually to help him hide losses in the futures market, say three traders who worked at Lehman in the late 1980's and early 1990's. **********This is a new twist. In fact, Mr. Iguchi appears to have covered his tracks so well that in its initial statements, Daiwa and the United States Attorney's office, which has brought fraud charges against Mr. Iguchi, said he had only traded United States Treasury bonds and had done no trading in futures or any other financial instruments known as derivatives. **********Derivatives are fast and easy ways to make big bets on financial markets and  have been involved in some of the biggest financial disasters of recent years. Indeed, futures contracts were behind the downfall of Britain's Barings P.L.C. when a trader in Singapore lost $1.3 billion trading futures on the Japanese stock market. **********What's more, according to these traders, who spoke on condition of anonymity, those complex trading maneuvers by Mr. Iguchi could well explain a central mystery: how he was able to tap into the bank's long-term bond holdings, and its holdings of customers' bonds, to cover his mounting losses. **********One key point is that Mr. Iguchi was in charge of both bond trading and some  record-keeping. That dual position -- which was specifically criticized as unsound by the Federal Reserve in 1992 and 1993 -- appears to have allowed him to hide even more of his trading tracks. The basis trades apparently permitted Mr. Iguchi to move the futures losses into bond accounts, which he controlled more directly, these traders said. **********In its fraud charges against Mr. Iguchi, the United States Attorney's office  in Manhattan said he had forged a statement from the Bankers Trust New York Corporation showing $4.5 billion of bonds held in Daiwa's account, when the account contained only $3.4 billion. It is that $1.1 billion gap that is said to represent Mr. Iguchi's trading losses. **********But it is still unclear how much of Daiwa's problem came from any futures trading by Mr. Iguchi. While traders at Lehman said he traded both bonds and futures there, traders at other firms remember him mainly for bond trading. **********Daiwa, based in Osaka, Japan, has already been harshly sanctioned by Federal  and New York State regulators, who have virtually closed down its trading activities in New York. **********And it faces further investigation in Japan. Bloomberg Business News reported today that Japanese financial authorities had begun an on-site investigation of  Daiwa offices. The Bank of Japan, the country's central bank, began searching Daiwa headquarters in Osaka and the Ministry of Finance its Tokyo branch, Keizo  Tsujiyama, manager of corporate communications at Daiwa, was quoted as saying. Bloomberg also said Sumio Abekawa, Daiwa's chairman, had quit as head of the Kansai International Airport Company to focus his energy on the bank's review. **********Representatives of Daiwa, Lehman and the United States Attorney's office declined to comment on any futures trades by Daiwa. **********The root of Daiwa's problem may lie in Japan's rush to get a financial foothold abroad. In the mid-1980's, at the peak of Japan's financial rise, Japanese banks and brokerage firms were eager to establish themselves among the  leading players in New York and London financial markets. Mr. Iguchi was one of  a handful of traders who burst on New York's bond market, buying and selling in  huge quantities. Even at the time, this appeared to be more bravado than skill;  most successful traders are as discreet as possible. **********Still, Mr. Iguchi was one of the most active and profitable customers for Lehman's futures desk, Lehman traders said. \"It was a hot, hot account and was handled with kid gloves,\" one trader said. **********On the phone, another trader said, Mr. Iguchi was arrogant and abrupt, but no more so than many others on Wall Street, generally not considered the most polite of places. Those who met him, though, described a shy, reticent man with  a slight build, who often talked about his personal problems -- like an unpleasant divorce. **********What Mr. Iguchi did not talk about, but what appears to have been eating away at him, was a disastrous record as a trader. **********In a rambling 30-page letter that Mr. Iguchi sent to the president of Daiwa in late July admitting the losses, he described a tale of woe. **********\"He must be the worst trader in the world,\" said someone who has read the letter. \"Every time the market moved, he was on the wrong side. He said he saw people making big-time money at other banks and he wanted to trade big as well.\" **********In the letter, filled with guilt and self-criticism, Mr. Iguchi blames his worry about his trading losses for the end of his marriage, said the person who  read the letter, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \"He said he was ready to confess at least four times, but then he didn't,\" this person said. **********Lehman traders said that they could not tell whether Daiwa was making or losing money over all on its trading, but the that unusual basis trades appeared to be a way to cover up his losses in futures. **********\"We would say, 'Is Toshi making or losing money?' \" one trader recalled. \"If  he was losing money, he would do a basis trade.\" **********Because of the peculiarities of accounting for basis trades, such a maneuver  could make it look as if he had lost no money on futures. **********In a basis trade, someone sells futures and receives the actual commodity --  in this case bonds -- on which the futures contract is based (hence the name \"basis\"). The trade could also work in reverse: trading bonds for futures. **********Because they involve a swap of things of theoretically identical value, basis trades do not have to be sent to the brawling floor of the Chicago Board of Trade to be executed at the current market price. Instead, a dealer like Lehman  can merely set the price anywhere between the day's high and low. **********This flexibility appears to have allowed Lehman -- legally -- to get Mr. Iguchi out of some jams. On days when Mr. Iguchi bought futures that subsequently fell in price, he would call Lehman and do a basis trade, selling futures and receiving bonds. And he would ask that the price be set at the day's high. **********That way his futures account would look as if it had broken even or even made a small profit. Of course, these moves did not erase Daiwa's losses; they merely moved the losses from the futures account to the bond account. That is because the cost of creating the appearance of selling futures at a good price was that  Mr. Iguchi had to buy bonds at the same inflated price. **********And this could have helped Mr. Iguchi avoid having his losses detected. In futures trading, traders must cover losing positions every day with cash margin  payments. **********In bond accounts, by contrast, cash moves only when bonds are bought and sold. Moreover, Daiwa said Mr. Iguchi had forged not only account statements but also trade confirmations and other records in the bond account that hid his actions. **********For a dealer like Lehman, swapping bonds and futures is not improper. This tactic is used, say, to move profits to the following year to delay taxes, or to postpone embarrassing losses. **********Traders familiar with Mr. Iguchi's futures activity also suggested that his unusual basis trades could also clear up another mystery: how he was able to tap into the bonds that Daiwa kept at Bankers Trust. **********Under normal circumstances, a custodian like Bankers Trust releases such bonds only when it is notified that cash has been received for them. These payments have to be accounted for on the books of the institution, creating various auditable paper trails. **********But with basis trades, the custodian transfers the bonds to a futures firm and receives a notice that they were part of an exchange for futures. **********Traders who did business with Mr. Iguchi suggest that by using bonds in the custody account to cover losses from futures trading, Mr. Iguchi could well have found an easy way to keep his activity undetected. Other futures-trading experts say that while this is plausible, Mr. Iguchi could have found other ways to tap  into the bonds in the custody account."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/27/world/pacific-islanders-swindled-of-unlikely-riches.html": {"writer_name": "David Stout", "pub_date": "1995-10-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 482, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pacific Islanders Swindled of Unlikely Riches", "print_headline": "Pacific Islanders Swindled of Unlikely Riches", "body_text": " **********This is about the people on a tiny Pacific island who make more money than they know what to do with from a source hardly anyone would think of.

Mr. Morgenthau said that, to get money for the bill, the  swindlers sold a New Jersey businessman a phony certificate of deposit. **********The three who pleaded guilty in State Supreme Court were Frank Decabia, 53, of Scarsdale, N.Y., a former broker with Josephthal Lyons & Ross; Michael McNamara, 48, a broker from Lake Montezuma, Ariz., and Glen Tobias, 45, a Los Angeles broker.

He was taken to a jail  and placed under 24-hour guard. **********Mr. Roh, who took office with the reputation of a reformer and the image of  an \"ordinary man,\" called South Korea's first elections in 16 years when his appointment as President by military rulers in 1987 triggered riots. He split the opposition vote and won a five-year term despite charges of fraud. He now faces a possible sentence of life in prison. **********An indictment is expected within the next 20 days, and Mr. Roh may go on trial very soon thereafter. There is some talk among politicians that he could be pardoned rather than made to serve a long sentence. **********Mr. Roh is accused of soliciting corporate donations to create a political slush fund and also to build a personal fortune based on a web of real estate and bank accounts held in other people's names. **********He is widely believed to know enough to put half of the people listed in any  Who's Who of South Korea in prison for giving or accepting bribes. A few days ago he suggested that he would reveal what he knows, but tonight he seemed to hint that he would keep his secrets in his jail cell. **********\"I am really sorry, and I take full responsibility for this case,\" Mr. Roh declared to reporters as he prepared to enter the car for the ride to jail. \"I am ready to accept any kind of punishment willingly.\" **********\"What pains me the most at this point is that many businessmen have suffered  on my behalf,\" added Mr. Roh, who is 62 and left the presidency in 1993. \"I would like to ask for public understanding so that these businessmen can be given the strength and support they need, so that they do not lose their international competitiveness.\" **********Mr. Roh was summoned from his home on Wednesday afternoon for a long interrogation, and prosecutors said that shortly after midnight he began to talk about the payoffs. The prosecutors said Mr. Roh, who chided aides shortly after  his election for replacing his Korean-made car with a Cadillac, partly acknowledged the existence of secret Swiss bank accounts, and admitted that he had accepted cash from corporate tycoons. **********Officials of 36 leading South Korean companies have been interrogated about money they are accused of giving Mr. Roh, and the top executives of some major conglomerates could go to jail as well. The South Korean public seems torn between a desire to see the culprits punished and a fear of economic chaos if leading business executives are thrown into jail. **********\"The cardinal sin was Roh Tae Woo's,\" said Lee Seo Hang, a professor of international relations at an institute affiliated with the Foreign Ministry. \"The companies were just accomplices.\" **********Mr. Roh's arrest warrant suggests that he took at least $305 million in bribes, including millions of dollars from the head of Daewoo Corporation in exchange for a contract that Daewoo won to build a submarine base. The chairman  of Daewoo, Kim Woo Choong, is expected to be questioned upon his return from Poland, where he is reportedly discussing the possible construction of a Daewoo  auto plant. **********In the broadest sense, the arrest today is seen as a disgrace not only for Mr. Roh but also for all of South Korea. For several decades \"gift-giving\" has been an integral part of doing business in South Korea, with payoffs expected by politicians, bureaucrats and journalists. **********\"It was the system,\" an executive of a major South Korean company said today, arguing that tycoons should not be jailed. \"It was a cost of doing business.\" **********Yet while South Koreans have been deeply shamed by the $650 million slush fund that Mr. Roh has reportedly acknowledged he accumulated as President, it is also possible to see the scandal as an outgrowth of the country's unsteady march toward democracy. **********The scandal came to light because of growing pluralism -- in the form of aggressive investigations and questioning by opposition politicians -- and there is little talk of a coup or other actions to shelter Mr. Roh from prosecution. **********\"This scandal must serve as a catalyst to destroy corrupt structures throughout the nation,\" said Seo Sang Mok, a lawmaker in the governing party. **********Mr. Roh has been given some consideration for his former status, in that he was not handcuffed at his arrest and was given sole occupancy of a cell designed for several people at the Seoul Detention House. Also, Mr. Roh will have no limit to visits by his family or lawyers. **********Prosecutors may also arrest aides and family members of Mr. Roh, and the episode has already damaged the credibility of both President Kim Young Sam and  his main rival, Kim Dae Jung, a longtime dissident whose civil rights Mr. Roh had restored before the 1987 election. **********President Kim's party has admitted that it benefited from $100 million given  to it by Mr. Roh, although it is unclear whether some of that money was then used to help elect Kim Young Sam to the presidency. **********Kim Dae Jung, for his part, has admitted accepting about $2.5 million from Mr. Roh for use in his presidential race against Kim Young Sam. Opposition politicians are pressing for an investigation of how Mr. Roh's slush fund was used. **********Mr. Roh reportedly has refused to comment on the political uses of his funds, and he apparently has said that he does not remember exactly how much money he received from each company. **********\"Unless it becomes clear how Roh Tae Woo's money was spent, it will be difficult to avoid more arrows of suspicion pointing to the President,\" said Park Kye Dong, an opposition member of the National Assembly who broke the scandal a month ago."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/25/world/christmas-in-bethlehem-arafat-at-midnight-mass.html": {"writer_name": "Serge Schmemann", "pub_date": "1995-12-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 902, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Christmas in Bethlehem: Arafat at Midnight Mass", "print_headline": "Christmas in Bethlehem: Arafat at Midnight Mass", "body_text": " **********The night was certainly not silent and it was not always calm as Bethlehem marked its first Christmas under Palestinian control with thunderous fireworks,  choirs, bagpipes, dances and laser lights. **********While the revelry flowed over Manger Square, Yasir Arafat, the chairman of the Palestinian Authority, took his place in the front pew of St. Catherine's Roman Catholic Church, part of the larger complex including the Orthodox Church  of the Nativity, for the traditional Midnight Mass in his role as the new leader of Bethlehem and the Palestinians of the West Bank. **********Sitting impassively in his trademark checkered headdress with his wife, Suha, and Bethlehem's mayor of 23 years, Elias Freij, Mr. Arafat listened as the Latin Patriarch, Michel Sabbah, a Palestinian who is the chief Catholic prelate  of the region, praised him and declared that \"the beginning of Palestinian freedom is the beginning of reconciliation between Palestinian and Jewish people.\" **********Following an ancient tradition, the patriarch was escorted from his seat in Jerusalem to Bethlehem by mounted guards. For 28 years, Israelis escorted him the entire way. But this year, the Israeli horsemen accompanied him only as far  as Rachel's Tomb, on the outskirts of Bethlehem, where a group of Palestinian riders in blue uniforms and black-checkered headscarves took over. **********In brief comments of his own, which he made before the services began, Mr. Arafat referred to Jesus in the Muslim tradition as a prophet, and reiterated the themes of peace and harmony that he sounded on Saturday when he made his first triumphant entry into Bethlehem. **********\"We pray together and we work together for peace which our prophet Jesus Christ worked and struggled for. And I'm very sure that we will achieve this goal, not only in Bethlehem but also in Jerusalem,\" he said. \"Tonight, Muslims,  Christians and Jews will celebrate in the land of peace.\" **********Mr. Arafat was originally supposed to have made his first appearance on Christmas Eve, but he moved up his arrival a day, apparently in order not to compete with the Christmas celebrations. **********In any case, it was outside the church, in the Manger Square, that the real celebrations were taking place, and they were as much about the end of Israeli occupation as they were about the birth of Jesus in a cave here in what was then a little town, and is now a city of 55,000. **********The winding, two-lane roads to the square were ablaze with decorations, with  the majority featuring the Palestinian flag and Mr. Arafat's visage, and chock full of cars and pedestrians making their way toward Manger Square. But hundreds of blue-uniformed Palestinian police officers maintained control. **********While German, Fiji, Finnish and many other choirs took turns singing Christmas carols and songs -- including a lively rendition of \"Jingle Bells\" in  Arabic by a Palestinian choir -- a laser beam traced the words \"Release the Prisoners,\" with the names of Palestinian leaders held in Israeli prisons, on a  large sheet over the square. **********On the square, thick with bottles and debris after three days of almost non-stop celebrations, men linked arms to dance rousing Palestinian steps to a flute or paused at many grills and soda stands. Occasional fireworks would erupt with a deafening bang overhead, sending the crowd into peals of joy. **********\"It's good, it's big, and it's a good deal of money,\" rejoiced a Palestinian  man peddling haroup, a sweet non-alcoholic Arab beverage, from a large backpack  decorated in flowers. \"Everything is different from before. There are many more  people, much more celebration.\" **********Amal Shukri, a Christian Palestinian from Bethlehem, came out with two children, ages 8 and 7. \"I told them this is a very special Christmas,\" she said. \"It's wonderful that Arafat is here. We're very happy to have him.\" **********Though there were far more Palestinians this year and far more revelry, there also seemed to be fewer foreign tourists, presumably because of the uncertainty  over how the transfer of authority from Israel to the Palestinians would go. Christian tourism is the major industry in Bethlehem, and one of the main goals  of Mr. Arafat and Mayor Freij this year was to convince visitors that they could come in safety and comfort. **********\"People in Tel Aviv think we were crazy to come here, but we're here, so we might as well live the experience,\" said Andy Gould, an American who lives and works in Tel Aviv, and who came with a group of Israeli friends. \"There was history going on around, and we wanted to see it. We were a bit apprehensive, but people have been very friendly. They've offered us food, they seem very excited. It's like Independence Day.\" **********The only incident on Christmas Eve occurred at the Israeli checkpoint on the  border of the West Bank, where the police stopped busloads of Israeli nationalists who had wanted to hold a protest against the transfer of authority  to the Palestinians at Rachel's Tomb. **********The protesters held up posters and chanted, \"Land of Israel, Land of Israel\"  as the police blocked their way to the West Bank. **********\"Why can't we go in?\" demanded Judy Pearlman, a Jerusalem resident originally from New York. \"The Arabs are having their celebration worshiping their God. Why can't we worship ours? All we want to do is light candles at Rachel's Tomb on the last day of Hanukkah. We're second-class citizens in our own country.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/04/business/mutual-funds-minding-your-businessstocks-the-next-generation.html": {"writer_name": "Laura Pedersen", "pub_date": "1995-06-04", "snippet": "Q.

I want to invest in stocks for my grandchildren. Should I do this any differently than if they were for my portfolio? A. You certainly should. While fat dividends in Fortune 500 companies may make sense for you, for your grandchildren you should look for maximum capital appreciation. **********That means nice, solid, growth stocks. If you are very conservative, you may want to mix in some United States Savings Bonds, which can offer tax advantages  when used to pay for higher education. But in the long term -- the term that is  relevant for children -- the action is in stocks. Since 1945, when the Dow Jones industrial average hovered at one-twentieth of today's 4,400 level, stocks have  enjoyed average annual returns of roughly 10 percent. For fixed-rate investments, the returns are just 7.5 percent. **********And to make investing real for children, \"why not buy them shares in companies with which they already interact?\" suggests Stephen V. Chaplin, an investment counselor with the Radix Organization in New York. Among others, he said, try Kellogg, Sara Lee, Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Toys \"R\" Us, Apple Computer  and Disney. Disney offers the added appeal of stock certificates adorned with Mickey, Pinocchio, Cinderella -- pretty enough to frame and hang on the nursery  wall. **********Disney, in fact, is one of the few companies that looks at children as future investors, which is what they are. Although some publicly held companies have livened up their annual reports -- Marvel's comic book format, for instance -- most have not. But they should. I still remember the 1973 annual report of Macmillan, the publishing company, which was written in Kid's English. **********However, while buying stocks for your grandchildren is great, maybe the biggest favor you can do is to get them interested in Wall Street. After buying  the shares, sit down with the newspaper stock tables and show them how to locate their investments. Explain how dividends are paid and why it's O.K. to take losses. **********Many books also teach children about investing. Among them are the lavishly illustrated \"Money,\" an oversized book for preadolescents, and \"It's My Money: A Kid's Guide to the Green Stuff,\" by Ann Banks. **********And more books are on the way. This fall Derrick Niederman, a disciple of Peter Lynch, will publish \"This Is Not Your Father's Stockpicking Book.\" Mr. Niederman's message is tailor-made for teen-agers: forget wading through complex financial statements; just watch TV and read the papers and look for trends. **********With college bills threatening to become the \"$64,000 Question,\" your grandchildren need all the help you can afford. But if college costs are a major target of your generosity to your grandchildren, watch out. \"There are definitely flies in this ointment,\" says Kalman A. Chany, author of \"The Princeton Review Guide to Paying for College.\" **********If you put assets in the name of a future college student, he explains, under standard financial-aid rules the school will deem 35 percent of that money as usable for tuition and thereby reduce the student's eligibility for aid. It may  be a better idea to give the money to the parents instead, who will only be tapped for up to 5.65 percent of their savings under the rules. Best to check with your accountant or a financial aid planner. **********Of course, there's another approach. Twenty years ago, parents were thrilled  to get a note from school declaring they had a gifted child. Today, they tremble at what it might cost down the road. I can hear it now as some parents take steps to insure their child prodigy doesn't get into an expensive private college. \"Haven't you been spending too much time on homework lately? Mom and I  think you should get out and play more.\" **********Questions about investing, careers and personal finance can be sent to Minding Your Business, Money and Business, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York 10036.

In addition to conspiring with senior management in the cover-up, the charges included bank fraud involving the $1.1 billion, embezzling more than $500,000 for his own personal use, and money  laundering. **********In pleading guilty, Mr. Iguchi also said there had been a cover-up at higher  levels of the bank. **********The supposed cover-up, which Federal prosecutors said occurred between July 23 and Sept. 18, appears to have been a last-ditch attempt at the big Japanese bank to disguise Mr. Iguchi's huge-scale frauds, which date to 1984, but which he apparently revealed to top management in a letter written only in July. In the letter, he explained how he had lost the $1.1 billion in making unauthorized trades and selling customers' bonds to make up for it. **********The court documents said that the senior managers, after learning of Mr. Iguchi's disastrous losses, filed a false report with the Federal Reserve to cover up the $1.1 billion loss and failed to submit a criminal complaint to examiners, as required by law. They also falsified records and books at the New  York branch, the document said. **********The documents also said that Mr. Iguchi and other senior managers made \"incomplete and misleading disclosures to the Federal Reserve Board and its examiners\" in November 1993 about trading activities. **********The documents did not identify the officials at Daiwa who were said to have conspired with Mr. Iguchi, but said that they included at least one executive of the bank here and one in Japan. **********In a statement released late last night, Daiwa Bank in New York did not address the matter of a cover-up by Mr. Iguchi's superiors. \"Mr. Iguchi has accepted responsibility for his crimes,\" the statement said, adding that \"Daiwa  is continuing its own investigation, and is cooperating with the authorities in  their investigations.\" **********As the scope of the scandal widened, the role of government regulators in policing the bank remained an issue. William J. McDonough, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said through a spokesman yesterday that Mr. Iguchi's name had not come up at an Oct. 4, 1993, meeting at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with Takeshi Ohta, then vice chairman of Daiwa Bank Ltd. The spokesman, Peter Bakstansky, added that Mr. Ohta had also telephoned the Fed earlier yesterday to say that he did not recall the name coming up at the meeting. **********Yesterday, The New York Times, citing a former senior Federal Reserve official present at the meeting, reported that concerns about Daiwa Bank's New York office, including the supervision of its traders and the name of Toshihide  Iguchi, had come up at that Oct. 4, 1993 meeting. The former Fed official also said that it appeared that the Fed did not work hard enough to uncover what Mr.  Iguchi was doing. **********Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, the Senate Banking Committee chairman, wrote to the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, yesterday, expressing \"deep concern over recent events surrounding the activities of Daiwa Bank's New York branch, the lack of cooperation by Japan's Ministry of Finance, and an apparent supervisory lapse by the Federal Reserve and other agencies.\" **********Mr. Iguchi, who was born in Kobe, Japan, began making unauthorized trades at  Daiwa Bank's New York office in the early 1980's, and suffered big losses. Every time he tried to recoup the losses, he dug himself deeper into debt, he said yesterday. **********To hide the debacle from the bank, he devised a way to pay for the losses with bonds the bank held for its customers. Then he forged statements to hide his sale of the bonds. **********The scheme was only possible, he said, because he oversaw both securities trading and the bond-custody and settlement operations at the New York branch. Those tasks are typically performed by different people to prevent traders from  hiding losses or cheating. At least two other traders were involved in making unauthorized trades, he said. **********In his recounting of a cover-up, Mr. Iguchi said that on July 28 he showed copies of account statements he had falsified to hide the lost bonds to a senior official from Daiwa's headquarters in Japan and a senior manager from the New York branch. **********Instead of immediately reporting the losses to bank regulators, as required by law, the executives, according to Mr. Iguchi, told him to keep up the fraud for a few months, at least until November. \"They asked me to continue concealing the losses,\" Mr. Iguchi said as he stood with head bowed before Judge Michael B. Mukasey. **********Three days later, on July 31, the bank filed a quarterly report to the Federal Reserve, falsely saying that it still held $600 million in Treasury bills, the court documents said. In addition, Mr. Iguchi said his superiors told him to continue selling other securities to raise money for the interest payments due on the phantom bonds that Mr. Iguchi had said the bank held. He also forged two more bank statements. **********Included in the criminal information the United States Attorney's office released yesterday were excerpts from Mr. Iguchi's mid-July letter of confession to Akira Fujita, Daiwa Bank's president. The letter, however, was as much an attempt to cover up as a confession because in it, Mr. Iguchi suggested that Daiwa replace the missing bonds and transfer the loss to a bank outside United States jursidication to elude detection. **********Mr. Iguchi also wrote a second letter to Mr. Fujita on July 21, according to  the court papers, urging him again to buy back the missing bonds and shift the loss to an overseas subsidiary. In that letter, Mr. Iguchi said the bank had fooled the American Federal investigators once and could avoid prosecution if it replaced the bonds. **********\"I can clearly say, on the basis of the experience I gained from the Fed inspection the year before last, that there is zero possibility that this case would be found out in the United States if we bought back\" the United States Treasury obligations \"which is short,\" Mr. Iguchi wrote, according to the court  document. \"Short\" is a financial reference to the bonds that Mr. Iguchi had sold to cover his losses. **********During his plea, Mr. Iguchi said the cover-up in July was not the first time  Daiwa officials had misled the Federal Reserve. According to the court documents, regulators first became suspicious of Mr. Iguchi's trading practices  in 1992 and conducted on-site examinations of the bank. **********Just before the examination, Mr. Iguchi said, the bank temporarily transferred securities traders out of Mr. Iguchi's downtown office to the bank's midtown Manhattan office. That ruse was intended to give the appearance that Mr. Iguchi did not oversee the traders, he said, while he was also overseeing the settlements of trades and Daiwa's holdings of customer bonds. **********When the Federal regulators returned in November 1993, a senior Daiwa bank officer assured the examiners in a letter that Mr. Iguchi was no longer supervising the traders. The letter was a lie, Mr. Iguchi said yesterday. **********By the time Mr. Iguchi told his superiors in Japan about the situation earlier this year, he said he had been worn down by his efforts to cover his losses. \"Personally, after 11 years of fruitless effort to recoup losses, my life was filled with fear, guilt and deception,\" he said. \"I saw that no one was coming to stop this. There was no end in sight.\" **********The huge losses at Daiwa Bank, coming so soon after the hidden trading losses of more than $1 billion that caused the collapse in February this year of the venerable British merchant bank Barings, have raised questions about the safety  and soundness of banking systems, and the adequacy of regulation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/30/business/chinese-court-denies-appeal-of-australian.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-11-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 136, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Chinese Court Denies Appeal of Australian", "print_headline": "Chinese Court Denies Appeal of Australian", "body_text": " **********In a case that has raised fears among foreigners doing business in China, an  Australian man lost his appeal this week to overturn a 16-year prison term for embezzlement and corruption. **********The Higher People's Court in Canton said there was sufficient evidence that James Peng embezzled $180,000 from a textile company he founded in Shenzhen, an  economic development zone abutting Hong Kong. **********Mr. Peng, 36, maintains that the charges were concocted by powerful Chinese  officials who coveted his business.

Shortly after he returned from Oxford, Mr. Torsella was tapped to be the issues director for the Philadelphia mayoral campaign of Edward Rendell, whom he had met when he was a college student. Mr. Rendell won, and Mr. Torsella was asked to stay on the staff. One thing led to another, and at the age of 30 Mr. Torsella was no less than a deputy mayor of the fifth-largest city in America. **********But two years ago Mr. Torsella diverged from the usual path. He did it, however, to pursue many weighty questions: Is there a way to make a map so that  it is less awkward to read in the car? Where are people suppose to file all those ATM slips they gather during a month? And is there an easier way to wash and dry lettuce? **********Through his one-man company, Mr. Torsella has yet to come up with answers to  these stumpers. But he has found answers to similar ones, answers that make money.  Take the Spaghetti Smock. **********\"I like to eat pasta, and I'm always splattering myself,\" he says. \"That was  the germ of the idea. I saw a need you could address in a very fun way.\" **********He sketched an attractive cotton smock that attaches at the neck with Velcro. He conjured up a spaghetti-shaped box as a package. Then came lots of hard work. He hired a company to sew the smocks and went from store to store to hawk  them. And when he got his first order, for 200, the bibs were so stiff that he was up in his apartment at 1 A.M. washing, ironing and refolding them before delivery. **********But at $13 each the bib was the kind of success you might expect from a Rhodes Scholar. QVC sold 1,200 in under three minutes. And Mr. Torsella is putting the finishing touches on a deal under which NOW Designs in San Francisco will produce and distribute the smock. **********Nevertheless, he is humble about his new livelihood. He resists the word inventor; \"this isn't penicillin,\" he says. Nor, he says, does he possess an unusual skill. \"I think everybody has great product ideas,\" he said, \"but people think of them and just discard them.\" **********But the simplicity of his new job doesn't mean the change in direction has been smooth. After the frenzy of making and distributing the smock, Mr. Torsella confines himself to coming up with ideas and licensing them to companies for making and selling. \"I now understand,\" he says, \"the headaches that come with manufacturing.\" **********Thus, Mr. Torsella has a contract with one company, Maco of Hillside, N.J., to come up with a variety of paper and label products. He also finds the company's market savvy a big help in the search for salable ideas. When Maco told him videotape labels had good potential, for instance, he hit upon the notion of designing labels that make a row of tapes look like a shelf of classical books. **********Mr. Torsella, who is single, has also designed for Maco a package of colorful stickers so young children and unartistic adults can decorate Halloween pumpkins. He's adapting the same idea to balloons, and has also designed decorative labels for file folders and other office items. **********And the ideas keep coming. In the mill, but without a company backer yet, is  Face Tea: tea-bag-like packages that can be dropped into hot water for home facials.  With his sister Nicole, Mr. Torsella is also working on a better way to carry store-bought flowers than in those bulky, leaking wrappers. And for everyone who has wondered what is on that unlabeled floppy disk, Mr. Torsella and an associate have designed and licensed a plastic clip that can hold both the disk and a paper copy of its contents. **********All in all, the signs suggest Mr. Torsella's detour may be edging closer to the traditional path of the Rhodes Scholar. He has paid back his original business loan, and he supports himself and an office in a fashionable neighborhood in Philadelphia's Center City.  \"I've begun to receive the fruits of my labor,\" he says. **********And although he emphasizes that his chosen field is hardly profound, in discussing it Mr. Torsella can sound almost philosophical. \"It struck me that this was a universal principle,\" he says. \"Things that are utilitarian became decorative.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/29/world/harare-journal-where-roving-circus-goes-rare-african-species-vanish.html": {"writer_name": "Donald McNeil", "pub_date": "1995-11-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1035, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Harare Journal;Where Roving Circus Goes, Rare African Species Vanish", "print_headline": "Harare Journal;Where Roving Circus Goes, Rare African Species Vanish", "body_text": " **********The official logo of the Akef Egyptian Circus is the face of a large lion. But in Zimbabwe, it was the punched face of a tiny 60-year-old woman that stuck  in the public mind. **********Stella Killick's black eye, plastered all over the daily papers after she and other employees of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals tried to seize three dying pythons, probably did more than anything else to get the Akef  family's circus booted out of Zimbabwe, and to draw attention to one of this continent's oddest, and possibly criminal, business ventures. **********Animal rights activists who have been following the five-year African odyssey of the circus say it is not really a circus at all. Its dog-and-pony acts, contortionists and acrobats, they insist, are just a front for its real business: smuggling endangered species. They believe the circus is a link through which chimpanzees, pythons, falcons, gray parrots and perhaps even lion  cubs make their way from the central African jungle to the private zoos of Saudi Arabia or the laboratories of the United States and Europe. **********No one knows how big the animal trade is. But arrests for smuggling chimpanzees are rare enough to make the Akefs, who have had six seized, seem like players. They deny any involvement with chimpanzees or smuggling, and say their animals were acquired in Egypt in 1990. **********Using a circus is an ingenious way to overcome the inconveniences of traveling with animals. Smugglers who deal in ivory or guns do not have to feed their cargo or worry that it will yelp at a bad moment. **********Trading in endangered species is outlawed under a treaty signed by 126 countries, including the United States and most African nations. But because many obscure frontier posts are manned by untrained or bribable officials, smuggling goes on from Cape Town to Cairo. **********Even for a circus, the Akef caravan is a bit bizarre. Most circuses hustle from town to town to sell as many tickets as possible. But the Akef circus moves desultorily. It arrived in Zimbawe in May, gave sparsely attended performances in July and August, and left in early November. **********\"They're obviously not making money as a circus,\" said Steve Thompson, chairman of the Chimfunshi Wildlife Orphanage Trust, which has a chimpanzee refuge in Zambia. **********The route of the circus took it through Djibouti, Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia and Malawi -- dirt-poor countries where few people can afford circus tickets, but rich in animals and scarce in sophisticated policing techniques. **********According to a Zimbabwean veterinarian who shadowed the long train trip to the border, a Mozambican guard deep in a plate of beans in a bullet-pocked shack waved the circus through without even checking whether its dogs, lions and tigers had up-to-date rabies shots, which they didn't. **********At other borders, officials at least count the animals, or demand inoculation certificates. By following this paper trail, animal-protection groups have compiled a dossier that documents the circus's real sideshow. **********\"Mr. Akef arrived in Uganda with five pythons,\" said Meryl Harrison, director of the Zimbabwe Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. \"Then he had two. He arrived in Kenya with seven. He arrived in Zambia with six, then had two. He arrived in Zimbabwe with four.  They're either all dying, or he's flogging them off to buyers.\" **********The number of lions in the circus has been as high as 10 and as low as six; endangered African gray parrots have gone from nine to zero. The only consistent number on the documents is for the four Siberian tigers. Tigers don't live in Africa. **********The Akef Circus follows a pattern, Mr. Thompson said. On arrival, it approaches local companies seeking sponsorship as a \"cultural exchange with Egypt.\" In Zimbabwe, for example, Lever Brothers, the detergent company, advanced it $7,000.  Until the embarrassed corporation withdrew its backing, Lever Brothers flags were raised over the big top. Then, when the circus inevitably gets in trouble, Mr. Thompson said, the Akefs try lying, then offer bribes, and finally claim diplomatic immunity and demand that the local Egyptian ambassador get the \"harassment\" stopped. **********Because the smuggling of chimpanzees is such an international scandal -- the  population has dropped from millions in 25 countries to 250,000 in six -- wildlife activists have concentrated on the circus's role in it. **********The poacher who captures one earns about $50, Mr. Thompson said.  By the time it reaches the Middle East or Europe, the market price is $40,000 or more. **********A 150-pound adult can tear a man apart, so poachers take only babies -- by shooting the nursing mother out of the tree. If the baby survives the buckshot and the fall, the whole family group may attack to rescue it, and the poachers will shoot them all.  For every baby captured, the Jane Goodall Institute estimates, 10 adults are killed, devastating chimp populations. Chimps normally breed only every five years. **********The Akef Circus left Egypt in 1990 with two chimpanzees. Six have been seized en route. Early this year, Mrs. Harrison of the Zimbabwe S.P.C.A. confronted Elsayed Hussein Akef, the head of the family, and he naively showed her bills of sale for babies bought from a known Zairean smuggler. **********As the circus was packing up its scraggly encampment in the Harare fairgrounds, Mohammed Akef, Elsayed Hussein's nephew, offered a quick tour of its battered train containers. The lions and tigers -- all named for Egyptian presidents -- appeared well fed, though they were in tiny cages. **********He said the fight in which Miss Killick was punched started when the circus's Muslim women objected on religious grounds to the attention of a local photographer. Miss Killick was hurt in a shoving match between his \"snake lady\"  and the photographer, he said. (Miss Killick, who is barely five feet tall, says she was attacked by two women, one of whom belted her with a broomstick.) **********Despite the recorded seizures, Mr. Akef denied having any chimps.  \"For a long time, it's not allowed to have chimpanzees,\" he said. **********The circus is now in Maputo, Mozambique. Mr. Akef said it was waiting for a boat to Egypt, but none of the animal groups believe him anymore. Mr. Thompson,  for one, expects him in South Africa soon."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/28/business/judge-approves-implant-accord.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-12-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 168, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Judge Approves Implant Accord", "print_headline": "Judge Approves Implant Accord", "body_text": " **********A Federal judge has approved a scaled-back settlement between three makers of silicone breast implants and implant recipients, removing another hurdle for women awaiting money for health-related claims. **********The decision by Federal District Judge Sam C.

But he rejected calls from his Cabinet to put off a tax increase set to go into effect on Jan. 1 to work off the $46-billion deficit that the health insurance and pension system had accumulated this decade. **********The Transport Minister, Bernard Pons, backed by some other members of Mr. Juppe's conservative majority in Parliament, said before the meeting that postponing the tax increase was \"indispensable\" for the economic growth needed to reduce unemployment. **********Mr. Pons is responsible for the national railroad system, which was shut down for 24 days in a wave of strikes by public-sector employees that began in late November after Mr. Juppe announced plans to reduce a Government deficit of $60 billion by cutting generous social security benefits. **********The rail strike forced Mr. Juppe to shelve a plan to cut French budget deficits by eliminating 3,750 miles of rural branch lines and special retirement rules that allow many railroad workers to start collecting pensions at the age of 50. **********Rail service was back to normal today except in Marseilles, where strikes continue. The Paris Metro was functioning normally, but ticket offices will not  begin collecting fares again until Friday. **********Some of the union leaders meeting with Mr. Juppe this afternoon had been demanding the withdrawal of the rest of a plan he announced last month to eliminate the continuing $13 billion annual deficit in the health and pension system, which covers most people in France. **********The talks had got off to a \"relatively bad start,\" said Marc Blondel, the leader of the Workers' Force union, which led the strikes along with the Communist-oriented General Confederation of Labor. **********Mr. Juppe was tight-lipped in advance of the meeting, which included five labor union leaders and representatives of three employers' associations.

He wants to find ways to reduce the burden the system creates on wages, since it is entirely financed by payroll taxes. Employees pay 6.8 percent of their salaries for health insurance and employers pay 21.7 percent. **********Creating other types of taxes to help finance health care would reduce these  deductions and give workers greater purchasing power, in the Government's view.

Radio broadcasts urged looting and arson, while ordinary people vowed to become guerrilla fighters. Visitors fled a vacation paradise turned war theater. **********Nobody was injured during the 15-day strike in the Galapagos in September, and now the protesters dismiss their own threats as saber-rattling to gain the attention of the Ecuadorean Government, which they say cares more about reptiles than people. **********The clash drew battle lines in a conflict that has been simmering for years between a population swollen with migrants from Ecuador's mainland, whose expectations have grown with their numbers, and conservationists, including some residents, who feel business must bow to ecology. **********\"Now we see a real polarization among the people here,\" said Pablo Larrea, the Ecuadorean Government's representative in the Galapagos. \"People here believe that if you talk about conservation, you don't want people to have jobs.\" **********More than 50,000 tourists flock to this desolate smattering of islands each year, on the lookout for such evolutionary wonders as blue-footed boobies, marine iguanas, and the 39 kinds of finches whose highly differentiated beaks inspired Darwin to write \"Origin of Species.\" **********The animals here are still so unaccustomed to humans that they have not learned to fear them. Pelicans and iguanas do not scurry away when a person appears on their path; mockingbirds flit in and out of offices and houses hunting for insect snacks. The islands are cherished by naturalists as a wellspring of endemic species, with 95 percent of the reptiles, 75 percent of the insects, half of the birds and nearly a fifth of the fish appearing nowhere  else. **********But scientists worry that the rapid growth in the human population, from 2,500 15 years ago to 15,000 now, has taxed the delicate ecological balance. With people have come aggressive plant and animal species -- including chickens, rats and goats -- that are multiplying rapidly, along with the overfishing of lobster, shark and sea cucumbers by local fishermen and large industrial fisheries. **********The influx of newcomers, most of them lured by the possibility of living off  nature through tourism or fishing, has also hardened the debate over the future  of these island and marine reserves. **********\"Everyone wants a piece of the pie, but they have no idea what went into making the pie,\" said Jack Nelson, who came here from California some 30 years ago and who owns the Galapagos Hotel. **********Mr. Nelson and others say that those clamoring for change have brought a frontier mentality to the islands that, unchecked, would destroy the place as a  wildlife sanctuary. **********\"I think Galapagos is the way it is because the big sharks from around the world didn't find it until very late,\" said Andre Mauchamp, chief of the plant department at the Charles Darwin Research Station here. \"The new people who are  coming don't even realize what Galapagos means to the rest of the world.\" **********The immediate spark for the uprising in September was a presidential veto of  a special law for the islands. Its 70 articles would have concentrated money and power over the islands in the hands of the people who live here. About 97 percent of the Galapagos is a national park, with 27,000 square miles of the surrounding ocean belonging to a special marine reserve. For now, many decisions that affect the island are made by the Park Service, and the law would have subjected the Park Director to a board weighted with locally elected politicians and representatives of fishermen and tourist-related businesses. **********It would have also created the political framework for the island's growth, giving it the same governmental structures as Ecuador's other provinces, and taxed tour operators. But the law did not address what conservationists and others consider to be the most important point: a limit on immigration. **********Though protesters backed off from their more dire threats, their strike was the second this year. In January, islanders protesting a ban on the fishing of sea cucumbers occupied the research station for two weeks. As word of the disputes spread, said Eduardo Diez, head of the Association of Galapagos Tour Operators, reservations for the Galapagos, which account for 80 percent of Ecuador's tourism, fell 15 percent. **********Ecuadoreans like Fortunato Ayala, 40, and Miguel Andagana, 46, both fishermen, say they came to this scrubby outpost 600 miles off the coast of Ecuador simply to seek a better life. And they are somehow astonished that anybody would have listened to their threats. **********\"Nobody here is a warrior,\" Mr. Ayala said, and laughed. He recalled that one demonstrator suggested burning a car, and instead the group torched a tire. Somebody else took a can of what they said was water, and poured it around the Park Service building as if it were gasoline. \"It was only a way to put ourselves into the discussion,\" Mr. Andagana said. **********Most homes here do not have publicly supplied potable water, and there is no  sewage treatment. There is no hospital to care for the sick, and the school system -- all sides agree -- is a mess. Electricity on the islands shuts off at  11 P.M. **********Tourists pay $80 to visit the park.  The Park Service doubled the fee two ears ago with a pledge the money would go to improve Galapagos municipalities. But the money never left the Park Service, which used it to raise salaries and to finance other national parks. Soon afterward, the two airports on the Galapagos started charging tourists fees for municipal services. But people complain that that money, too, has done nothing to improve living conditions. **********At the time fees were increased, cruise boats began to dominate the market. Low-budget backpacking naturalists, who once filled the hotels and hired boats for day trips, disappeared. Tourists now arrive at the airport, catch buses to their boats, and visit the sights in what tour operators call a model of harmony between conservation and commerce. **********But for disaffected residents, the equation ignores two problems: the tendency of some boats to dump untreated waste and garbage into the ocean, and the residents' own need to earn a living. **********\"The island may well be the human heritage of the whole world, but the human  heritage won't feed us when it's all over,\" said Eduardo Veliz, the congressman  who led the strike. \"Most likely, what they really want is for us to pack up and leave.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/20/world/communists-gain-in-the-second-tier-of-russia-s-vote.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Specter", "pub_date": "1995-12-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1119, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMMUNISTS GAIN IN THE SECOND TIER OF RUSSIA'S VOTE", "print_headline": "COMMUNISTS GAIN IN THE SECOND TIER OF RUSSIA'S VOTE", "body_text": " **********As if the Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin hasn't heard enough grim news this week, the figures from individual parliamentary races started to pour  in today and the results were more of the same, only much worse. **********It now appears certain that Communists will control virtually a third of Russia's new Parliament, far more seats than even they had hoped for. If their close ideological soul mates in the Agrarian Party are included in the calculations, the figure is even higher. **********We are facing a very difficult situation,\" said Grigory A. Yavlinsky, the leader of Yabloko, the only openly liberal party certain of gaining a place in Parliament. \"At this point it is important to unite all forces opposed to attempts to restore a totalitarian system in Russia.\" **********Almost nobody is talking about returning Russia to totalitarianism, but these days the reform movement does not have much else for building a case. **********When the Russian people elect a Parliament they each get two votes.  One supports an entire party. The other lets voters choose among local candidates in individual races. Although Communists and nationalists were always expected to prevail in the parliamentary vote for the 225 out of 450 seats that is based on  supporting a single party, most experts thought the other half of the seats -- filled in head-to-head races -- would produce far more mainstream victors, as it did in 1993. **********They were wrong. The results so far suggest that the opposition, including Communists, Agrarians and nationalists, will account for nearly 250 of the 450 seats in the new Parliament. The Government party, Our House Is Russia, when combined with its sometime reform rival, Yabloko, will have little more than 100. The rest of the seats will probably be spread proportionally among individuals who have been elected as independents. **********No matter what happens in the end, the Communists are not likely to have enough power to carry their motions over the opposition of reformers, and reformers are unlikely to pass any legislation unless the Communists support it. If only four parties make it into Parliament, as appears likely, then 50 percent of the electorate will have supported parties that did not make it. Despite the  large numbers for Communists, any mandate will be weak. **********\"This is going to be a Parliament all about politics and not about government.\" said Michael McFaul, a senior associate at the Carnegie Moscow Center. \"The whole next six months are going to be taken up with the presidential race.\" **********That means that the Parliament will almost certainly pass a series of bills -- lowering the price of bread, slowing privatization, moving backward on land reform -- that have no chance of Mr. Yeltsin's support. But each failure will be a card that can be dealt during the campaign. **********With 195 of the 225 head-to-head races accounted for, the Communists, with 49 winners, have defeated the Government party, Our House Is Russia, with 10, by five to one. The Communists' Agrarian allies had 19, and the liberal Yabloko had 12. **********When the individual Communists who won are combined with the party list numbers, which are still not final, they will have from 135 to 150 members in the new Parliament. Our House Is Russia is likely to have about 50 to 55 of the  450 seats. The ultranationalist Liberal Democratic Party of Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, which so far has won only a single individual race, will probably have about 50 seats, as will Yabloko in all likelihood. **********None of this is good news for President Yeltsin, but things might get worse.  Most of the results that have already been reported were produced by computer. The rural villages that do not tabulate their vote by computer are not expected  to help turn the tide toward reform. **********Back in seclusion at the hospital where he is recovering from a heart ailment, Mr. Yeltsin met with his Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, today  to talk about the results of the voting. **********Mr. Yeltsin must now decide how to react to a parliamentary vote that has been -- as much as anything else -- a referendum on him. Gennadi A. Zyuganov, the Communist leader, said today that the President would have to make changes in his Government. \"How could he possibly look at these results and do nothing about it?\" Mr. Zyuganov asked at a news conference. **********Mr. Yeltsin will certainly act, but the script will depend on his own murky intentions. Mr. Chernomyrdin laughed off calls today for wholesale changes in the Government. \"Changes, shifts, sackings -- nothing of the sort will happen,\"  he said. He said that changes would occur in Government, \"as in any living organism.\" **********\"Personnel changes have routinely taken place and will take place in the future,\" he said, sounding as if he was struggling to believe his own words. \"But they have nothing to do with this election.\" **********That of course depends on the ultimate results, which will not be known for at least two more days. With about 65 percent of the party list vote counted, the Communists have about 21.8 percent of the vote, Mr. Zhirinovsky's ultranationalist party has about 10.6 percent, Our House Is Russia has 9.6, and  Mr. Yavlinsky's Yabloko 7.6. No other party has received the 5 percent necessary to enter Parliament -- although three, the liberal party of Yegor T. Gaidar, the opposition group called Women of Russia, and the very hard-line Communist Labor  Party, are all hovering tantalizingly close to the barrier. **********Mr. Yeltsin has a tricky task ahead. He must sacrifice part of his Government to the results of this election. But if he moves too quickly he will be seen as  caving in. It also is not good politics. Most people expect Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev, perhaps the best-known liberal leftist in the Yeltsin Government, to be the first to go. But Mr. Yeltsin has said he will not decide until February whether he is going to run for president again. And until then, he can gain little by moving his chess pieces more often than necessary. **********Mr. Zyuganov started his chess game today, saying it was time to start planning for the presidential race. He took pains to stress that he would seek a broad coalition in Parliament, that he wanted allies with whom he could work, and that he was not afraid of compromise or disagreement. But he also said he expects the market reforms that have been the hallmark of the post-Communist era here to be eased. And on this, at least, he did not seem willing to compromise. **********\"The policy should be corrected,\" he said. \"No matter what they say now it is impossible to continue this policy.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/05/world/a-bitter-awakening-for-west-african-nation-s-cocoa-farmers.html": {"writer_name": "Howard French", "pub_date": "1995-10-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 570, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Bitter Awakening for West African Nation's Cocoa Farmers", "print_headline": "A Bitter Awakening for West African Nation's Cocoa Farmers", "body_text": " **********For three decades, while he pushed the development of agriculture throughout  this country's once thickly forested hinterlands, Ivory Coast's founding father, Felix Houphouet-Boigny, was fond of calling himself the nation's No. 1 peasant. **********The official press never tired of saying that no one could do more than Mr. Houphouet-Boigny to defend the interests of backwoods farmers.

Only since Mr. Houphouet-Boigny's death, he said, had peasants come to understand that for years, while cocoa and coffee prices were booming, the Government was salting away huge margins by paying them a fraction of the price it was earning from the export of these crops. And when world commodity prices plummeted in the 1980's the Government, rather than making up the difference to farmers, lowered the guaranteed prices. **********\"We grew up in a world where Houphouet decided everything,\" Mr. Yao said bitterly, taking a break from hacking at weeds with a machete. \"Now we have been awakened to discover that we have been deprived of our own fortune, and the Caistab, rather than facing its responsibilities toward farmers, is pulling out  of this business.\" **********Asked about the country's agricultural situation, a World Bank official here  expressed sympathy for farmers like Mr. Yao. But the official said that in the end, the increased competition in the commodity markets here caused by the Government's withdrawal from its heavy control of export crops would benefit peasants by \"creating a system where world prices correspond with the prices paid to local producers.\" **********But if World Bank officials, who pushed the changes in the export board, think that they will provide new encouragement to cocoa and coffee farmers, they may be disappointed. **********\"Among the youngsters who are just starting out in life, people are already looking into anything else they can: rubber, oil palm, pineapple, or just moving to the city,\" said Toure Vassiriki, an official in Tiassale's cocoa farmers cooperative. \"First of all, we have cut down so much forest that there is very little land left for the newcomer. Secondly, a lot of people have been left with a bitter taste in their mouths.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/14/world/balkan-accord-squabble-at-the-un.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "1995-12-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 352, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BALKAN ACCORD;Squabble at the U.N.", "print_headline": "BALKAN ACCORD;Squabble at the U.N.", "body_text": " **********Even before the Bosnia peace agreement is signed in Paris, the United States  and the United Nations have squared off for the next squabble: Who will police the volatile Croatian region of Eastern Slavonia? **********\"The problem is that no one seems eager to go there,\" Argentina's representative on the Security Council, Emilio J.

He said the United Nations would have a hard time assembling and sending the necessary force -- 9,300 troops plus 2,000 logistics personnel -- in the time demanded.

The 63-year-old securities company  employee was walking through Tokyo's financial district carrying a bag containing $400,000 to his company. Just as he reached his building, a man wearing a helmet approached him, sprayed a debilitating gas in his face, and ran off with the money. **********The robbery, which took place in September on a busy street in broad daylight, was one of several recent episodes that have shocked normally safe Japan. But why would someone walk unguarded through the streets with $400,000 anyway? **********The answer is that Japan runs on cash. Personal checks have never caught on  here. Credit cards have recently been spreading rapidly, but even their use is not that well ingrained. **********Instead, people often pay bills amounting to thousands of dollars in cash. Postal service employees visit customers' homes on red bicycles to collect cash  for life insurance premiums or savings account deposits. And on the 10th and 20th of each month, traffic is said to be particularly heavy as businessmen visit suppliers and clients to pay bills or receive payment in cash. **********In Mr. Saito's case, he was bringing the money from a nearby bank because his company, Kyoritsu Securities, needed it to pay customers, who like to receive their proceeds from stock sales in cash, even in amounts up to tens of thousands of dollars. **********A result is that Japanese often carry what, by American standards, are large  amounts of cash, even given the high prices here. This habit has made Japanese tourists tempting targets for pickpockets around the world. But in Japan, where  robberies are rare, it has hardly been a problem. **********Shigeru Nomura, an 80-year-old man who emerged from a securities company near where Mr. Saito was robbed, said he sometimes carried tens of thousands of dollars in a paper bag. \"I get a little nervous,\" he allowed -- but not nervous  enough to have someone accompany him. **********Recently, however, the number of robberies, while still very low by international standards, has been rising. The police have been issuing warnings  to those who transport large amounts of cash not to travel alone and to change routes frequently. **********But so far people \"don't feel the danger keenly,\" said Kiichi Shiraishi of the National Police Agency's community safety planning division. \"It is said that Japanese people believe you can get safety and water free of charge,\" he said. **********So the robberies keep occurring. In late October, Satoshi Murao, 33, an employee of Fuji Bank, visited three customers to pick up cash for deposit. When he emerged from the last customer, a hospital, he was stripped of $130,000 in a  robbery. **********When asked why people do not use checks, Japanese are likely to be puzzled by the question. \"In a way, I wonder how Americans can trust personal checks,\" said Seiichiro Saito, a professor of economics at Rikkyo University. Accepting a check requires verifying or trusting the check writer's identity and financial resources. **********In Japan, people can pay bills by having money automatically deducted from their bank accounts. Or they can deposit money in another party's account using  sophisticated automated teller machines that give exact change. **********Personal checks will also not do for bribery or tax evasion, two popular practices here. In a famous scandal a few years ago, a trucking company executive sent a bribe of about $4 million to a powerful politician. The politician's secretary had to wheel the bills in from the parking lot on a dolly. **********In 1989, passers-by found moldy packets of cash worth $1.7 million in a bamboo thicket in Kawasaki, a Tokyo suburb. A businessman later admitted he had  dumped the money rather than prompt a tax audit by putting it in the bank. **********How hard it will be to break the cash habit might best be seen in the case of Toshio Miyaji, the president of Jonan Denki, a chain of discount electronics stores. \"I feel very lonely if I have less than one million yen in my pocket,\" he said, referring to an amount equal to $10,000. **********Mr. Miyaji's office contains an automatic cash-counting machine, the type normally found in banks, which bundles 10,000-yen notes into packages worth one  million yen and spits them out onto the floor. Every day, Mr. Miyaji's aides insert one of those bundles into his wallet. **********But Mr. Miyaji is most famous for his Louis Vuitton attache case, which can hold up to one million dollars in fresh 10,000-yen bills. He is often seen on television being driven around in a red or sky-blue Rolls-Royce, dispensing bills from his attache case to buy products for his stores. Paying cash, he said, allows him to get bigger discounts. **********One would think this behavior would make Mr. Miyaji a conspicuous target. Sure enough, he has been robbed seven times, losing an amount equal to $390,000  at today's exchange rates. **********In one case, his own driver made off with an amount equal to $65,000 at those rates. \"After spending all the money he committed suicide 10 days later,\" Mr. Miyaji recalled. He added that he blamed himself for tempting the poor driver by leaving his attache case in the car. **********Despite the robberies, the feisty 67-year-old Mr. Miyaji still carries cash around without security. \"If I start worrying, it's just like closing down the store,\" he said. **********He has, however, made a few changes. After he was robbed in his own office last year, he installed some burglar alarms there. And, oh yes, he now takes his attache case with him when he leaves the car."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/11/world/world-news-briefs-us-spy-for-east-berlin-gets-suspended-sentence.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-11-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 47, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "World News Briefs;U.S. Spy for East Berlin Gets Suspended Sentence", "print_headline": "World News Briefs;U.S. Spy for East Berlin Gets Suspended Sentence", "body_text": " **********A German court gave an American researcher a suspended 18-month jail sentence today for spying for East Berlin. **********The 54-year-old spy, Jeffrey Schevitz, admitted passing secrets to East Germany between 1977 and 1990, helped by his wife, Beatrice Altmann, who was fined $7,000."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/28/business/executive-changes-041734.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-12-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 70, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Executive Changes", "print_headline": "Executive Changes", "body_text": " **********CELGENE CORP., Warren, Mich., named Richard Morgan acting chairman and chief executive, effective Jan. 1.

Roosevelt, the two leaders emphasized that they were committed to a  solution and had instructed their military strategists to keep searching for a command structure that both could live with. **********We agreed today that Russian armed forces will participate in these operations,\" Mr. Yeltsin said just a day after he had repeated in a speech to the United Nations that Russia would not send troops to Bosnia under the command of NATO. \"But how they go about doing it is the affair of the military.\" **********The United States and other members of the alliance have insisted NATO must command any troops sent to enforce peace in Bosnia. **********Mr. Clinton said simply that \"we made some progress\" in how to structure the  force and that they had instructed Defense Secretary William J. Perry and the Russian Defense Minister, Gen. Pavel S. Grachev, to keep exploring options. **********Still, the very fact that the session was so warm and the two leaders so committed to finding some way to integrate Russia into the Balkan force defied predictions that Moscow and Washington were sliding back toward a cold war-style standoff. **********Instead, the working session began with the Russian President wrapping Mr. Clinton in a bear hug moments after his helicopter touched down in the spectacular autumn foliage of the 33-acre Summer White House used by Roosevelt. **********More than four hours later, the two men emerged from the stone-and-stucco home for a joint appearance that officials had been saying would not take place. And with Mr. Clinton standing at his side in the afternoon sun, Mr. Yeltsin proclaimed that the post-cold-war \"partnership\" between their two nations \"is not calculated for one year or for five years, but for years and years to come,  tens of years, for a century.\" **********Then he thunderously accused journalists of both countries of promoting discord. \"One could see that what you are writing was that today's meeting with  President Bill Clinton was going to be a disaster,\" Mr. Yeltsin chastised reporters covering the summit meeting. \"Now for the first time, I can tell you that you're a disaster.\" **********\"Be sure you get the right attribution there,\" Mr. Clinton said, his face turning red as he doubled over with laughter and nearly fell into Mr. Yeltsin's  arms. **********On other issues, the leaders said they agreed to push for ratification of the nuclear-weapons nonproliferation treaty, to work toward a comprehensive nuclear  test ban next year and to strengthen close cooperation on safeguarding nuclear materials in Russia. **********Aides to Mr. Clinton said most of the sessions between the two Presidents focused on the Bosnia peace talks, which are to begin on Oct. 31 at a military base near Dayton, Ohio.  The officials said both leaders had given political momentum to the effort to find a way around the Bosnia peacekeeping problem. **********\"It's not a political impasse,\" a senior Administration official said. \"It is a military question of how you can resolve the difference here. And you can do that through military technical discussions.\" **********One American official suggested that the sides were searching for a face-saving way to integrate the Russians with NATO, while letting Moscow insist its troops were not reporting to NATO officers. Mr. Perry has suggested that the Russian troops could serve in a civilian capacity. **********In his quest for a military presence independent of NATO, Mr. Yeltsin has found an ally in France. In recent meetings, French and Russian officials have discussed having 5,000 to 8,000 Russian troops serve under Russian operational command but under the tactical control of the French. **********A senior French official today described the thinking of President Jacques Chirac this way: \"We have to take a part of Bosnia, to save its face for public  opinion, and give it to the Russians, under Russian command. The Russians are a  great army. They command their troops. Give them a sector.\" Washington, mindful  of the tensions when Berlin was divided into four sectors, has opposed such a suggestion. **********Mr. Chirac also said it was impossible to set limits on how long a peace force would be in Bosnia. \"We will be there for 20 years,\" he said. **********Mr. Chirac also reportedly said that unless the United States was willing to  pay one-third of the cost of reconstruction in Bosnia, which French officials say will run $5 billion to $10 billion, \"France would not pay at all.\" **********Administration officials said the related issue of NATO expansion in Europe,  which the Russians have objected to, came up only glancingly during the sessions. **********Both issues have enormous implications, ranging across such vital questions as the American role in Europe, the place of NATO and the Russian relationship with the organization. Complicating matters, both Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Clinton have domestic political considerations that tug them apart. **********Facing a Congress resistant to sending American ground troops to Bosnia, Mr.  Clinton said last week that he would seek Congressional support before he moved  ahead with plans to commit up to 20,000 troops to Bosnia. Congressional leaders  have said they would look skeptically at anything other than a NATO-led operation. **********\"It is only NATO in a practical sense which can efficiently and effectively implement a settlement,\" Anthony Lake, Mr. Clinton's national security adviser,  said on Sunday. **********Mr. Yeltsin, however, is looking toward parliamentary elections in December and has been under fire from nationalists and Communists, who accuse him of being too accommodating to the West. **********On the eve of his United States visit, Mr. Yeltsin made a bow to those critics by threatening to dismiss his longtime Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, the only liberal reformer left in his Cabinet. Mr. Kozyrev, however, did attend today's talks, although he flew to Hyde Park in a separate helicopter. **********As if to underscore the fact that both Presdients were mindful of domestic politics, Mr. Yeltsin presented Mr. Clinton with two ice-hockey shirts of the Moscow Penguins team, reading \"Bill Clinton 96\" on one side and \"Boris Yeltsin 96\" on the other. **********The site for today's sessions was chosen to evoke the World War II cooperation between the two countries. In fact, the site seemed to soften the mood of confrontation that had appeared to be almost inevitable on Sunday, when  Mr. Yeltsin used his speech at the 50th anniversary celebration of the United Nations to proclaim that Russia would join a Bosnian peacekeeping force \"only under a clear-cut mandate\" from the Security Council -- and outside NATO command. **********Today Mr. Clinton and Mr. Yeltsin walked, sometimes arm in arm, to the 190-year-old stone home where Roosevelt was born. Mr. Clinton showed the Russian war memorabilia, including the naval hat and cape that Roosevelt wore during meetings with Stalin and Churchill. **********The two men posed briefly for photographers on a veranda, sitting on rustic wooden chairs used during World War II by Roosevelt and Churchill, and gazed at  a resplendent view of the Hudson Valley. **********\"It was a very good idea to have our meeting here,\" Mr. Yeltsin said. \"I didn't want to have our meeting in New York in a big place, a formal place like  a hotel. I'm sure that in a place like this, that there are no problems we won't be able to resolve.\" **********Mr. Yeltsin also thanked the United States today for showing a willingness to compromise on a 1990 treaty calling for reductions in conventional arms within NATO and the former Warsaw Pact by mid-November. **********The idea is to ease limits on weapons on Russia's European borders so it can  deal more easily with secessionist movements.

They also complain that the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner, on whose approval the plan depends, is  a former Cigna employee who has not excused herself from the case and that she has provided the department's study of the company's proposals to Cigna and its  backers, but not to others. **********The Cigna plan calls for the creation of one group of weaker, inactive subsidiaries that would not sell new property and liability policies but would pay claims as they arose on old policies. The active, stronger company would issue new policies and would benefit, Cigna officials say, because it would have higher financial ratings once it was separated from the inactive unit. **********When Cigna announced its plan in October, its stock was trading at about $105 a share. Since then, it has dipped, before rising again to a high for the year of $112 on Wednesday. It closed yesterday at $110.75, down $1.25. **********Unlike other corporations, whose first loyalty is to their owners, or shareholders, insurance companies have long been regulated under the philosophy  that their primary obligation is to policyholders. **********Many analysts, including Robert Spass, managing partner of the investment group Insurance Partners, predict that Cigna's plan is a prelude to an effort by the company to find a buyer or partner for the property and liability business. **********While Cigna shareholders could benefit if the plan helped the property and liability business return to profitability, the plan's critics worry that policyholders would be left out in the cold if the inactive company ran out of money to pay claims years or even decades from now. **********Cigna officials contend that additional funds they will invest in the inactive company, with some reinsurance of claims against it, provide more protection to policyholders, not less. They also say that the active company will be able to provide additional funds to the inactive company if needed, though it would not be required to do so. **********Maurice R. Greenberg, chairman of the American International Group, a company whose businesses include reinsurance, said that if the inactive company would be that strong, Cigna should back it \"with a guarantee from the company\" or with full reinsurance. Cigna's unwillingness to do that is evidence, he said, that it wants to limit its liability for future claims. **********John N. Ellison, a partner at the law firm of Anderson Kill Olick & Oshinsky, which represents several Cigna policyholders, said that his clients had not been provided with enough information to evaluate the plan. \"If the protection for policyholders is just as strong now as it was before, then why do they want to do it?\" he asked. **********Although Pennsylvania's Insurance Commissioner, Linda S. Kaiser, was a Cigna  employee from 1986 to 1992 and is now covered by a Cigna pension plan, the insurance department's lawyers have decided that there is no conflict of interest that would require her to excuse herself.

Mr. Iguchi pleaded guilty in Federal District Court on Thursday to concealing trading losses over 11 years. **********With today's announcement, the Daiwa case appears to be unfolding in ways similar to other trading scandals of the 1990's: Blame is first cast on a rogue  trader, but it is later contended that some of those at the top may have played  a significant role, as well. In some cases, this may have been a lack of adequate controls or supervision by senior management; in others, as is contended in the Daiwa case, senior officials may have been more deeply involved. **********But in the Daiwa case, as in the billion-dollar trading loss that led to the  collapse of Barings P.L.C. of Britain, the spotlight has also fallen on government regulators who failed to discover a problem before it became a scandal. **********\"Organizations have become so large and complex, it's hardly surprising that  corporate governance is more difficult.\" said Haig J. Nargesian Jr., senior analyst of financial institutions at Moody's Investors Service in New York. Modern technology also allows individuals unprecedented freedom to move money around, making it easier for a trader to hide what he is doing. **********The court documents that contend there was a cover-up at Daiwa were released  on Thursday as Mr. Iguchi also acknowledged embezzling more than $500,000 from Daiwa. Mr. Iguchi said he had covered his losses by selling bonds held in customer accounts and then making it appear that the bonds were still there, and sold other securities to pay the interest due on the phantom bonds. **********In the statement today from its headquarters in Osaka, Daiwa said it \"directed the actions to be continued\" because it wanted \"to prevent Iguchi from fleeing\" and because it had to continue making interest payments on the bonds that Mr. Iguchi sold to conceal his losses. **********But the statement from the deputy general manager of the bank's international division, Kenshi Shiraiwa, contended that the actions did not constitute a cover-up. **********The two senior managers accused by Mr. Iguchi were not identified, but a spokesman for Daiwa denied that one of them was Hiroyuki Yamaji, a senior executive who had once been Mr. Iguchi's superior. Mr. Yamaji was sent to New York to talk to Mr. Iguchi after he told Daiwa of his unauthorized trading in a  July letter to Daiwa's president, Akira Fujita. Mr. Fujita and the bank's chairman, Sumio Abekawa, announced their resignations earlier this month, but it is not clear what, if any, roles they may have had in the debacle. Mr. Fujita was replaced immediately, but Mr. Abekawa will not step down until next March. **********When it first publicized the loss in late September, Daiwa Bank portrayed the scandal as the handiwork of a single trader who duped the bank. That was also the way the case was portrayed at Barings, where Nicholas W. Leeson, who was based in Singapore, bet heavily on the direction of the Japanese stock market and lost $1.4 billion, forcing the old merchant bank to lose its independence. While he was singled out for blame when the scandal erupted early this year, questions have now arisen about top management's possible role. **********This week, a report prepared for the Government of Singapore said two Barings executives tried to play down and conceal information about losses. It concluded that Barings' contention that it did not know what Mr. Leeson was doing \"gives rise to a strong inference that key individuals of the Barings Group's management were grossly negligent, or willfully blind and reckless to the truth.\" **********The Singapore International Monetary Exchange was also criticized in the report, which contended that it accepted explanations of what was occurring from Barings executives. Mr. Leeson is the only banker who has been charged in the case. **********Another case that no longer looks so straightforward is that of Joseph Jett,  who was accused by Kidder, Peabody & Company of singlehandedly creating $350 million in phantom profits while he was head of the government bond trading unit there. An internal investigation of the case found serious problems with Kidder's accounting system and the supervision of Mr. Jett, who has denied any wrongdoing. More than a year after the case broke, no criminal charges have been brought against Mr. Jett. **********In the Daiwa case, Federal prosecutors said Mr. Iguchi and Daiwa executives made \"incomplete and misleading disclosures to the Federal Reserve Board and its examiners.\" Mr. Iguchi himself bragged in a letter to Daiwa that it would be easy to conceal his losses from regulators. **********These comments and other criticism of the Fed's handling of the Daiwa affair  are expected to lead to a review of the regulation of foreign banks. **********Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican who is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said in a letter this week to Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, that he was \"dismayed by apparent gaps and problems in foreign bank supervision and its implementation.\" **********In 1991, in response to the scandal at the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, Congress passed the Foreign Bank Supervision Enhancement Act to more strictly control foreign bank branches, with a much bigger role for the Fed. In light of the Daiwa scandal, Mr. D'Amato said, \"it is time to re-examine  the structure of foreign-bank supervision.\" **********Adding to concern about the regulators is the fact that the Japanese Finance  Ministry has acknowledged that it was informed of Daiwa's losses six weeks before the bank notified American authorities on Sept. 18. American regulators have said they should have been notified earlier. **********The Finance Ministry said today that it was looking into allegations that Daiwa's top management might have taken part in a cover-up of the scandal, Kyodo news service reported. **********In a separate development, Moody's today downgraded its rating to Baa3 from Baa2 on long-term deposits of three Japanese financial institutions -- Hokkaido  Takushoku Bank, Nippon Credit Bank and the Chuo Trust and Banking Company. The ratings are the lowest investment-grade level and the lowest Moody's ratings of  Japanese bank deposits. **********In recent weeks, international banks have raised the premiums they charge Japanese banks who borrow funds from them, and Japan's stock market has had occasional jitters from speculation about more troubles among banks."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/02/business/company-news-accustaff-has-agreed-to-purchase-gw-consulting.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1995-12-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 92, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;ACCUSTAFF HAS AGREED TO PURCHASE GW CONSULTING", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;ACCUSTAFF HAS AGREED TO PURCHASE GW CONSULTING", "body_text": " **********Accustaff Inc. said yesterday that it had agreed to buy GW Consulting of San  Francisco.

He lived. **********Mr. Lee survived a massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators here in the provincial capital, Kwangju, in an incident in 1980 that has haunted South Korea ever since. As he plucked his false eye from its socket, holding it in one hand  and pointing with the other to the scars on his face, Mr. Lee reflected on the prospect of a trial soon of two of the country's former Presidents for ordering  the massacre. **********They should be executed,\" declared Mr. Lee. \"Unless we execute them, how can we put this all behind us?\" **********Few people expect the former Presidents, Chun Doo Hwan and Roh Tae Woo, to face the gallows. But both are now in prison, Mr. Chun having just been arrested on Sunday, and they are expected to go on trial next year for staging a coup in  1979 and for ordering the Kwangju massacre in May 1980. By the lowest estimate,  almost 200 people were killed, while other figures range into the thousands. **********For people in Kwangju who have fought for 15 years to investigate the massacre and punish those responsible, this is a moment to savor. Mr. Lee campaigned over the years to honor the victims of the massacre, and twice he was imprisoned -- once for two and a half years -- because of his efforts. Yet now South Korea has been turned upside down, and it is the former Presidents who are wearing prison uniforms and can expect to get used to them. **********The massacre was one of the pivotal moments in modern Korean history, nurturing radicalism and anti-Americanism among a generation of youth. **********An opinion poll at Seoul National University once asked students to identify  the greatest tragedy in Korean history since 1945. The professor who planned the poll assumed that the students would answer the Korean War, but they overwhelmingly cited the Kwangju massacre. **********At Mangwol Dong Cemetery, where 125 of the victims are buried, a light snow fell on the graves today. But an unusually large number of visitors walked among the tombstones, paying tribute to those who died in the massacre. **********\"The spirits will be relieved a bit,\" said Kim Jae Young, a 59-year-old man walking solemnly among the rows of graves. \"Their anguish has been soothed.\" **********Yu Tae Chung, a gravedigger at the cemetery for the last 19 years, knows the  victims he buried as if they were family members. He introduces Choi Mi Ae, who  was then a housewife, eight months pregnant, whose tombstone carries the inscription: \"Darling, you were an angel. I'll see you again in Heaven.\" **********Mr. Yu also showed the grave of a 10-year-old boy, Bang Kwang Bum, who was killed in the massacre. A photo on the tombstone shows a serious child staring solemnly at the camera. **********Like most people in Kwangju, Mr. Yu is angry at Mr. Chun and Mr. Roh and one  moment he says they should be punished to the full extent of the law. The next moment, reminded that they face the death penalty, he steps back. **********\"Execution?\" he reflected soberly. \"I'm not sure I'd go that far. Chun and Roh were fathers of this nation, after all. So I don't really know what punishment they should get. But I suppose if they're not executed, they should get life sentences.\" **********Mr. Chun set the stage for the Kwangju massacre on May 17, 1980, when he responded to pro-democracy protests by extending martial law across all of South Korea. The next day, demonstrations erupted in Kwangju, and an initial bloody crackdown led to a public uprising against the military Government. Protesters armed themselves with weapons taken from armories, and they briefly ruled the city. **********Ten days after the initial protests, the army invaded Kwangju with tanks and  machine guns. **********The Government has put the civilian death toll at 193, but that figure does not square with the list of 288 dead people whose family members the Government  eventually agreed to compensate as victims of the Kwangju massacre. Neither figure includes 23 soldiers who died, most killed by other troops but some by protesters. **********Dissidents have often argued that the death toll was higher, at least 500 and perhaps 2,000. **********\"We still get calls from people who want to report family members who went missing at that time,\" said Chung Soo Man, whose younger brother was shot dead in the crackdown and who now heads the Kwangju Massacre Bereaved Families Association. Mr. Chung said that the group is happy to see Mr. Chun in prison but that it wants a special prosecutor appointed to get to the bottom of what happened. **********One of the crucial issues that people want to resolve is what role if any the United States played in the massacre. It is an article of faith among many people in Kwangju that the United States military commanders in South Korea stood aside to allow the massacre to take place, and at the cemetery student groups have painted an oversized caricature of President Ronald Reagan, blood dripping from his fingers. **********American officials have denied complicity in the massacre, saying that they had no control over the Korean army units that were used in Kwangju. There is no sign, however, that the United States tried very hard to stop the killing, and the Reagan Administration feted Mr. Chun at the White House less than a year later. **********While delighted at Mr. Chun's arrest, many people in Kwangju seem perturbed that President Kim Young Sam appears to be using the prosecution of the former presidents as a way to bolster his own political standing, distracting attention from a slush fund scandal that had enmeshed him. **********\"I don't want to see this used for narrow political purposes,\" said Kang Yong Bok, a jeweler who was clubbed and bayoneted by soldiers during the massacre. \"But it's unbelievable what's happening now.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/22/business/fed-drops-rule-for-us-banks.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1995-12-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 149, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fed Drops Rule For U.S. Banks", "print_headline": "Fed Drops Rule For U.S. Banks", "body_text": " **********The Federal Reserve Board said today that it had eliminated the $25 million limit on the amount healthy United States banks could invest in a foreign company without Fed approval. **********Such investments now will be limited to 5 percent of a bank's Tier 1 capital  (equity and retained earnings), which in virtually all cases is more than the $25 million cap, the Fed said. **********Healthy banks' investments were previously limited to the lesser of $25 million, or 5 percent.

And its publication of the \"Pulp Fiction\" screenplay by Quentin Tarantino has sold more than 100,000 copies. **********Mr. Sheinberg is planning for his new entertainment company, the Bubble Factory, which is expected to include publishing. **********And Mr. Guber, who once ran the Columbia and Tri-Star studios for the Sony Corporation, threw himself into publishing at the end of the summer with the creation of Mandalay, a multimedia company. **********\"That means we can take a creative idea, whether it starts as a book, movie,  TV show, audio book, stage play or CD-ROM, and develop it in any -- and preferably all -- of these areas,\" said Nanscy Neiman, a former Warner publisher who is now executive vice president of Mandalay and publisher of its books. \"We're nothing if not ambitious.\" **********Arrival of producer-publishers has been germinating for some time. Since the  1970's, the growth of media conglomerates has meant that studios often find themselves in a corporate stable with book publishers. **********Universal Pictures and G. P. Putnam's Sons, for example, became divisions of  MCA Inc., now controlled by the Seagram Company. Paramount and Simon & Schuster  became siblings at Viacom Inc. And HarperCollins and Fox became divisions of the News Corporation. In each case, book and film divisions expected to have an early, if not first, run at each other's projects. **********Still, most remained at arm's length. Then in 1990, Disney took the step of establishing its own publishing division from scratch, setting up Hyperion Books as a general trade book publisher. **********The idea, executives say, was for Hyperion to feed ideas to Disney's film and television divisions, and vice versa, so all groups could benefit from shared publicity and marketing strategies. **********One particularly successful example has been Disney's marketing of the comedian Tim Allen. **********Last year, as a result of Disney's coordinated strategy, Mr. Allen became a leader in three categories. Ratings soared for his Disney-owned television show, \"Home Improvement,\" just as his new book, \"Don't Stand Too Close to a Naked Man,\" ran to the top of best-seller lists for Hyperion, and his first feature film, \"The Santa Clause\" for Disney, became a box office hit. **********For producers, setting up publishing shops gives them more access to an author's work. Where they once had to await a book's bound galleys before deciding if the story worked as a screenplay, producers can now read book proposals in their infancy. **********Fights over rights are minimized, and marketing opportunities are maximized:  publication and production schedules can be coordinated so that a book comes out just weeks before its film version. **********For authors, the advent of producers as publishers offers a kind of one-stop  shopping. Instead of having to wait for an agent to drum up interest on both East and West Coasts, authors are almost guaranteed a dual book-and-movie sale. **********But they may also forgo the kind of line-editing and guidance they could expect from the traditional, more experienced book publishers. **********Not that most producer-published books will need such tender literary care, said Robert Gottleib, an executive vice president of the William Morris Agency and head of its New York literary department. **********\"We are not dealing with Farrar, Straus here,\" he said. \"Remember, this is a  very commercial entertainment business.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/20/business/finance-briefs-074322.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-10-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 167, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "print_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Debt Federal Home Loan Bank is selling $100 million of bonds due in 1997 through First Tennessee Bank.

The upheaval has ravaged living standards, prompting an exodus that has reduced Armenia's population of 3.5 million by 20 to 30 percent. **********In turning to the 407-megawatt Metzamor reactor as a savior, Armenia will rely on a Soviet design that Washington considers among the world's most dangerous. There are six such plants in operation; the others are in Bulgaria, Russia and Slovakia. **********Washington has refused economic aid to upgrade Medtzamor, saying it wants to avoid a precedent that might force it to help the others. Rather, the Clinton Administration is pushing permanently to close all six. **********American officials cite the lack of a dome-shaped, concrete containment vessel that is standard on Western reactors. Without this feature, any radiation leak at Metzamor would simply escape into the region of Yerevan, the capital, where 2 million people make their homes. **********\"We have expressed our concern about this and other plants like it to various governments, including the Armenian Government,\" said John Quintus, an American Embassy official in Yerevan. \"But it is not within our purview to tell them they must not start it.

It was built on an ancient site that archaeologists have traced back to the Bronze Age, in a village that some local historians say was the birthplace of the Armenian people. **********The Soviet Union installed two reactors at Metzamor that together produced some 30 percent of Armenia's electricity. **********The plant was closed following a 1988 earthquake. There are two major geologic faults near Metzamor as well as many minor ones. **********The 1988 earthquake, measuring 6.7 on the Richter scale, did not seem to damage Metzamor. But the deaths of at least 25,000 people and the destruction of 55 villages spawned a movement that branded Metzamor a threat to the Armenian people. **********Today's reversal of thinking, seen in Armenia's emotional defense of Metzamor, reflects the survival question as much as its shutdown did six years ago. **********The issue is enveloped in Yerevan's support of ethnic Armenians who have captured the tiny Azerbaijan region of Nagorno-Karabakh. **********Azerbaijan has punished Armenia with an economic blockade, severing Yerevan's traditional route for imports of natural gas and fuel oil. Still Armenia, perceiving another crucial test of national will, seems ready to cope rather than compromise. **********In the Armenian view, its only option is to restart Metzamor. **********With Russian assistance, the Government has refitted the plant's valves and miles of water and steam pipes. The Government argues that these steps have upgraded the plant to world standards. **********Gagik Markossian, Metzamor's chief engineer, said one of the plant's new features is an automatic shutdown device that would be activated in case of a serious earthquake. **********\"We aren't the kind of people who can set our houses on fire and injure our neighbors,\" Mr. Markossian said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/20/business/company-news-praxair-raises-offer-for-cbi-and-sets-a-deadline.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-12-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 126, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;PRAXAIR RAISES OFFER FOR CBI AND SETS A DEADLINE", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;PRAXAIR RAISES OFFER FOR CBI AND SETS A DEADLINE", "body_text": " **********Praxair Inc. sweetened its hostile bid for CBI Industries yesterday and pressured CBI to accept it by imposing a deadline of tomorrow.

Kolodny positioned himself under a stand of eucalyptus trees here and settled down to wait. By the time the Sun was a red orb on the rim of the north Indian plain, a crowd of villagers had gathered around him, putting his counseling skills in heavy demand. **********Normally, Mr. Kolodny moves between courtrooms in Boston and Los Angeles, following a divorce practice from offices on both coasts. But the villagers who  pressed around the 55-year-old American lawyer in this corner of the semi-desert state of Rajasthan were after his knowledge as an amateur astronomer. **********At a few moments past 8:34 A.M., the Sun was due to disappear behind the Moon in a total eclipse, an event nobody at Khijuri had witnessed -- at least not in its fullest form, when the Earth plunges into eery night -- at any time since the Taj Mahal, 50 miles east of here at Agra, was completed in the 1600's. A total eclipse from any one spot on the Earth is visible only once in 360 years. **********From Iran to Borneo and into the Pacific, millions of people fell into the eclipse's shadow. At mosques south of Teheran, at the ancient Buddhist complex at Angkor in Cambodia, and all along the 10,000-mile path of the eclipse, life stopped briefly. **********Almost everywhere, the event stirred old superstitions, as well as outbursts  of astonishment and joy. **********Among India's 700 million Hindus, many still subscribe to an awful symbolism  in which an eclipse becomes a triumph of evil, represented by the blackness of the Moon's disc, over good, represented by the gold of the Sun. Since anybody exposed to an eclipse risks being tainted, the primeval superstitions lay down elaborate rituals for the event. **********In Khijuri, as in many of India's 500,000 villages, there were special washing rites. Many stayed indoors and lighted candles to the gods. **********Eating, for many, was forbidden for 12 hours before the eclipse and 12 hours  afterward. Pregnant women avoided holding knives or anything sharp for fear their children would be born scarred, or deformed. **********But some of the more intrepid ventured out, to the edge of the harvested wheat field chosen by a group of Americans, who like thousands of other visitors had made the eclipse a centerpiece of their Indian tours. **********There, they found Mr. Kolodny, along with his high-magnification cameras, charts and supply of special sunglasses that allowed direct viewing of the Sun without damage to the eyes. **********For Padam Singh, a grizzled 50-year-old muffled with a blanket against the chill, Mr. Kolodny's explanations of the planetary movements appeared, for a while, to be unconvincing. But after pushing back his turban to take several long looks through the sunglasses at the Moon eating a crescent into the Sun, Mr. Singh conceded. **********\"If you say so, it is only nature's way,\" he said, with a gruffness that conveyed lingering doubt. **********Deeper into the wheat field, other villagers provided a mute audience to a Cape Canaveral-style countdown, aided by an array of computers and satellite links brought in by American scientists. **********\"Two minutes to go, the light level is dropping, the shadows are moving in over the trees!\" shouted Glenn Schneider, 40, an astronomer from the University  of Arizona in Tucson. As the total eclipse neared, the silence was broken by agitated chattering among egrets and other birds. **********Mr. Schneider resumed: \"Thirty seconds! Fifteen seconds! Five seconds!\" **********At the instant when the Sun was fully covered, with a only a thin corona of light showing around the Moon's edges, the villagers, told beforehand that they  could look directly at the eclipse without protective glasses during the 52 seconds of total eclipse, erupted into gasps, followed by clapping. **********At that moment, the differences between the Indian villagers and the Americans seemed small. Behind the astronomers, 35 other Americans, mostly from  Chicago and Los Angeles, burst from their canvas seats. Cries of \"Oh my God!\" and \"Just beautiful!\" rang across the darkened field. One woman cried. Stockbrokers and physicians and lawyers shook hands. **********Several pledged to meet again at the next total eclipse, along a band of territory that sweeps through Siberia and into Mongolia, on March 9, 1997. In 1999, the hardened enthusiasts will be back in India. **********On the experience with the Khijuri villagers, some, like Mr. Kolodny, said they expected that the level of superstition will have declined, but one story told ahead of the eclipse suggested it might be wise not to overestimate the power of science. **********Usha Mehta, a 76-year-old veteran of India's struggle for independence, recalled being told more than 50 years ago of an incident involving Sir C. V. Raman, an Indian physicist who won a Nobel Prize in 1930 for breakthroughs in the study of light. **********Recounting the story in a weekend interview at her Bombay home, Ms. Mehta said the physicist had rushed home from his Calcutta laboratory to take a ritual bath ahead of a solar eclipse. \"The Nobel Prize? That was science,\" the physicist explained. \"A solar eclipse is personal.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/20/world/one-mr-pavon-here-and-another-there-who-s-who.html": {"writer_name": "Sam Dillon", "pub_date": "1995-10-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 447, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "One Mr. Pavon Here, and Another There.

Mr. Pavon then embraced the trafficker and allowed him to board a private jet and fly away. **********Mr. Pavon was later convicted of accepting a $200,000 bribe from the trafficker, and he served 40 months of a four-year prison sentence before his release in 1989. He has since lived with his family in Mexico City, working as a private investigator. **********This week, however, the Italian police arrested a man they identified as Armando Pavon Reyes, and said they were awaiting an extradition request from the United States. **********This international confusion has bordered on the absurd: Italian authorities  insist they have the right man and news agencies report -- incorrectly, according to American officials -- that the Federal Bureau of Investigation has  confirmed through fingerprints that the man is the former police commander. But  a man who appears to be the real Mr. Pavon has turned up in Mexico City, confidently asserting he is who he says he is. **********\"There is only one Jorge Armando Pavon Reyes, and I am that person,\" he said  on Wednesday, waving his arms indignantly during a news conference here. **********At a meeting with reporters on Wednesday evening at a downtown restaurant, he dragged from his wallet documents -- his Mexican driver's license and a tattered 1983 letter certifying him as a federal judicial police officer -- that identified him as Jorge Armando Pavon Reyes. He said he was visiting friends at  a Mexico City police station this week when someone told him his name was once again in the papers. **********The slapstick overtones notwithstanding, the incident has underlined the serious differences that chafe Mexico-United States relations over the extradition process. **********In the United States, Mr. Pavon is a wanted man. A Los Angeles grand jury indicted Mr. Pavon in 1988 in the murder of the drug agent, Enrique Camarena, and a warrant was issued for his arrest. Last year, American authorities put the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) on alert for Mr. Pavon, and a bulletin was transmitted to the 176 member nations, an Interpol spokesman  said. The Italian police responded this week with the arrest of the man they identified as Mr. Pavon. **********Mexico is a member of Interpol, but authorities here have made no move against Mr. Pavon, even though his whereabouts have been no secret. A spokesman  for the Attorney General said today that no charges are pending against Mr. Pavon in Mexico. \"This is not our affair,\" the spokesman said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/04/world/along-bosnia-dividing-line-federation-is-only-on-paper.html": {"writer_name": "Raymond Bonner", "pub_date": "1995-11-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1712, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Along Bosnia Dividing Line, Federation Is Only on Paper", "print_headline": "Along Bosnia Dividing Line, Federation Is Only on Paper", "body_text": " **********To speak with her daughter and granddaughters in Los Angeles, Adila Glavovic  must use the telephone of a friend who lives 10 minutes away, across a river in  her hometown of Mostar. **********On the other side is also the apartment she once lived in, groceries that are more affordable and the medical care her husband needs. But the west side of Mostar is largely forbidden to Mrs. Glavovic and people who, like her, are refugees in their own city. **********The Croats, who govern the west side of the city, make it almost impossible  for the Muslims, who live in the east, where the Bosnian Government has control, to cross the Neverta River. This divide exists in spite of the fact that Mostar, a 500-year-old city in a narrow mountainous valley, was supposed to be the showcase of the Bosnian-Croatian federation forged by Washington last year. **********But if anything these are two peoples moving apart, not together. Each side has different license plates, currency and passports, and diametrically different views of what Bosnia should be. **********Several days of travel through Croatian-held areas of central and western Bosnia show the federation to be little more than a piece of paper. That piece of paper, drafted to bring an end to fighting between Muslims and Croats, is also central to the American plan for peace in Bosnia, and its importance was underscored this week when negotiators in Ohio announced yet another agreement to strengthen the federation. **********\"It doesn't exist,\" a senior Western diplomat in Zagreb said. \"We invented the federation and forced the sides into it.\" **********Far from seeing the alliance between the Croats and the Bosnian Government as an enduring one, some diplomats and United Nations officials in the region fear  that the alliance of Muslims and Croats might end in conflict between them after a peace agreement is signed. **********Washington's peace proposal divides Bosnia between the Muslim-Croat federation (51 percent) and the Serbs (49 percent). In reality Bosnia's Croats control 20 percent of the territory of Bosnia, and the Muslim-dominated Government in Sarajevo, 30 percent. There are now an estimated 350,000 ethnic Croats in western Bosnia (about half the number before the war) most of them in  the Herzegovina region. **********\"If there were a referendum, the people would vote not 90 percent, but 99 percent, not to be part of the federation,\" said Krunoslav Kordic, a Croat who is mayor of Capljina, 25 miles southwest of Mostar. **********The Bosnian President, Alija Izetbegovic, said in a recent interview that the Croatian people in the region want to be part of Bosnia, but that paramilitary units with aid from Zagreb are stoking the flames of separatism. But Western officials in the Mostar area say that Mayor Kordic's view of public opinion appears to be closer to the truth. **********In front of Mr. Kordic's office, among the evergreens and leafy trees, flies  the red, white and blue flag of the Croatian Republic of Herzog-Bosna. Asked where the Bosnian flag was, he said simply, \"We don't recognize it.\" Bosnia's flag, with gold fleurs-de-lis on a blue background, is seldom seen in Herzegovina, nor are federation policemen. **********The self-declared republic, which has its capital in Mostar, has not been internationally recognized. But it is a reality. It delivers the mail, collects  taxes, generates electricity, educates children, and with its own 50,000-man army defends the territory of Herzegovina (with help from neighboring Croatia).  Police officers wear the same blue uniform as the Croatian police, with an almost imperceptible alteration in the red and white checkerboard shield on their shoulder patches. **********Don't try to buy beer or bananas, gasoline or shaving cream in Herzegovina with the Bosnian dinar. The legal currency in Herzegovina is the Croatian kuna,  or the German mark. **********The Bosnian Croats carry Croatian passports, not Bosnian ones. They vote in Croatia's elections, and in last week's parliamentary elections, they did so overwhelmingly for the Croatian Democratic Party of President Franjo Tudjman. **********Under pressure from Washington and the European Union, President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia has publicly vowed support for the federation. But Western officials say they do not believe that his public stance matches his real feelings. **********\"In Zagreb, they don't want it to exist,\" a Western diplomat there said about Croatia's attitude toward the federation. Mr. Tudjman is under strong American pressure to go along with the federation. **********One of the provisions of the 1994 federation agreement was that all people forced out of their villages during the Muslim-Croat war would be allowed to return home. **********That has not happened. \"The federation has brought about no integration of ethnic groups,\" said Kris Janowski, a spokesman here for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. **********This week's agreement in Ohio aims, in fact, to allow 300 Muslim families and 300 Croatian families to return to homes in areas occupied by the other group. Even if it works, these numbers are tiny in a country with nearly 700,000 internal refugees. **********Mohammed Elezovic was born in the historic Muslim town of Stolac, where his family's roots go back 400 years. He was expelled by Croats in July 1993. Mr. Elezovic, 55, a professor of Slavic languages, has still not been able to go back, not even to pick up his poetry or albums with pictures of his children. **********When Croatian troops recently recaptured the strategic town of Jajce from the Serbs, they moved Croatian civilians back in but did not allow displaced Muslim  residents to return to their homes. **********The grievances are not one-sided, however. **********In Zenica, an industrial city controlled by the Bosnian Government, more than 12,000 of the city's 20,000 Croats have been forced out since the federation agreement was signed, European officials said this week. **********\"The federation is rubbish,\" said a 21-year old Croatian man, who said that he is unable to return to his village near Konjic. **********There are only two ways to make the federation work, said a United Nations official. One is military force, the kind Washington does not want to use. The other is investing \"billions\" of dollars in Bosnia, so that there is an economy  strong enough to provide jobs for everyone. **********But the lesson of Mostar is that spending money is not enough. **********In the last 15 months, the European Union has spent more than $200 million to rebuild and reunify this city. The reconstruction has been a success -- children are in schools, the hospital has clean sheets and medicines for patients, traffic lights work, water flows. The work has been carried out on both sides of the city. **********What disturbs European Union officials in Mostar is that, because political unification has not been accomplished, the facilities are essentially segregated. **********For example, teenagers from the east cannot attend high school in the west as they did before the war, and special permission is needed for Mrs. Glavovic's husband, who had a heart attack five years ago, to go to the hospital, which is  in the west. **********The failure of political reunification is why Mrs. Glavovic cannot call her daughter without applying for a permit and waiting 10 days for permission to make the 10-minute walk, and why she and her husband cannot return to their three-bedroom west Mostar apartment with balcony views of the valley, even though they can see their former home from where they now live as refugees with  their relatives. **********It is why reconstruction of the 400-year-old mosque in east Mostar is hampered. The quarry with the right quality of stones is on the other side of a  river, explained Hussein Lulic, 71, a stonemason working at the mosque. **********Croatian officials do not deny that they are restricting movement. If they did, they would be \"demographically occupied\" by the Muslims, said Mile Puljic,  the deputy mayor of west Mostar, with the Muslims from the east coming west. **********With money from Croatian and German business executives, west Mostar is thriving and lively -- like West Berlin was -- with sidewalk cafes where Croatian soldiers in camouflage engage in conversation with chic young women. **********East Mostar, which was poorer before the war, and was more heavily damaged by Croatian shelling during the fighting, has suffered from a lack of significant private foreign investment since the end of the war. Muslims are still struggling to dig out from the rubble, and an old man was seen this week poking  through garbage in search of something of value to him. **********\"The people live in a ghetto,\" Hans Koschnick, a German who is the European Union's administrator for Mostar, said about the Muslims in east Mostar. \"I know something of ghettos. I don't like it.\" **********As for the federation, what the Bosnian Government wants is a country built on the principle of one person one vote, the basis of the American proposal. It  would like at least Herzegovina to be included, and the Serbian territories as well. **********The Bosnian Croats, if they cannot get unification with Croatia, want to be an essentially independent state in a confederation with Bosnia. But the Bosnian Government rejected this two years ago, and it is not part of the American peace plan. **********Mr. Puljic, the deputy mayor of west Mostar, calls the American idea \"totally unacceptable.\" **********\"To Mr. Holbrooke, I wish him all the best,\" he said, referring to Richard C. Holbrooke, the chief American negotiator. \"But it is not as simple as he supposes.\" **********SNAPSHOT Mostar: Two Peoples, Two Cities **********Although the European Community has spent $200 million in Mostar in an effort to rebuild and reunify the city, it remains politically and physically divided into eastern and western portions on either side of the Neretva River; the movement of people between the two is severely restricted. **********WESTERN MOSTAR **********CONTROLLED BY: Self-declared Croatian Republic or Herzog-Bosnia PASSPORTS: Croatian. **********CURRENCIES: Croatian kuna or German mark. **********EASTERN MOSTAR **********CONTROLLED BY: Bosnian Government. **********PASSPORTS: Bosnian Government **********CURRENCIES: Bosnian dinar. **********Photos: Reconstruction in Mostar has been hampered by the separation between the Muslim east and the Croatian west.

McCain, the Arizona Republican and former prisoner of war in Vietnam who has been one of his party's most bitter critics of any military intervention in  Bosnia. **********Mr. Dole said he was drafting a resolution supporting the President's decision -- with conditions intended to bring the troops home quickly -- and hoped it would pass late next week or early the following week. That would give  Mr. Clinton much needed bipartisan political backing before the scheduled signing of the Bosnian peace agreement in Paris on Dec. 14, which would be immediately followed by deployment of most of the American troops. **********After announcing his support, Mr. Dole, the frontrunner for the Republican Presidential nomination, acknowledged in an interview that American troops would be in Bosnia by the time the Senate voted. But he said that opposing the President after he had made his decision would undermine the soldiers' morale. **********The Administration was swift in praising Mr. Dole. \"I welcome Senator Dole's  expression of support,\" Secretary of State Warren Christopher said in a statement. \"His leadership can help build a bipartisanship consensus endorsing the President's decision to deploy troops as part of the NATO-led international force for peace in Bosnia.\" **********Mr. Dole said of his decision: \"It wasn't easy. I knew the easy way out was to go out and trash everything.\" He added, in an allusion to his Presidential rivals who have opposed the Bosnia mission: \"I know I'll get a few whacks out there, but I've been around here long enough to know that at this point we shouldn't be so partisan.\" **********Mr. Dole added that he was holding meetings with experts on Bosnia to persuade recalcitrant Senators to support him, and that he was also discussing a joint strategy with the House Speaker, Newt Gingrich. **********The Administration is likely to run into much more trouble in the House, whose members are younger and less swayed by Mr. Clinton's argument that failure to take part in the mission would destroy NATO. **********Several hours after Mr. Dole's announcement, White House officials traveling  with Mr. Clinton in Belfast, Northern Ireland, said the President had decided to allow a military spending bill that he needs to help pay for the Bosnian mission to become law without his signature. Although he had said he would veto the $243 billion bill because it contained more money than he had requested, it would also provide the $2 billion needed to pay for the Bosnia operation. **********Late tonight, Mr. Clinton qualified his approval of the bill in a statement issued by the White House that noted his strong concerns about \"excessive spending for projects that are not currently needed\" for defense. The statement  said Mr. Clinton would send Congress legislation that would eliminate money for  those projects. **********The announcement today by the two key Republicans does not signify a ringing  endorsement of Mr. Clinton, whose Bosnia policy has come under attack from Republicans and Democrats and which -- as both lawmakers pointedly observed today -- is opposed by the vast majority of their constituents. **********Rather, their decision stems more from resignation that Mr. Clinton is going  to send 20,000 troops no matter what, and that it would be unseemly not to line  up behind the Commander in Chief. **********\"The bottom line is that the President intends to send these troops to Bosnia one way or another,\" Mr. Dole said in the Senate. \"And so, it seems to me that we in the Congress have a responsibility to try to insure -- to our best ability -- that as this deployment goes forward, that we create the conditions to end it quickly and successfully so that U.S. forces can return to their families. **********\"So here we are, and I believe the Congress will do the right thing. We will  end up supporting U.S. forces.\" **********Mr. Dole has long held the view that a President should be supported once he  decides something as important as committing troops abroad. He argued passionately against the use of American troops to oppose President Saddam Hussein after Iraq invaded Kuwait, but once President Bush decided to do so, Mr. Dole worked hard to win support for him. **********Mr. Dole's decision this time carries with it the long-term political benefit of making him seem above partisanship at a time when most other Republicans seeking the nomination, particularly Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, have been strident opponents of the decision to send 20,000 American troops to Bosnia. **********Mr. Dole, who was severely wounded in World War II, commands respect on military issues. The fact that he spoke together with Mr. McCain, who carries a  lot of weight with younger lawmakers because of his imprisonment in Vietnam, is  expected to blunt Senate opposition to the deployment. **********But neither men made any secret of the fact that they have serious concerns about sending Americans to Bosnia. Mr. Dole listed two major concerns: the possibility of casualties and the potential that Americans will be drawn into a  \"quagmire with no way out.\" **********Throughout the Bosnian war, Mr. Dole was the leading Republican proponent of  arming and training the Bosnians. Today he said that he wished that sending troops could have been avoided and that Mr. Clinton had long ago embraced his policy as an alternative to intervention. **********\"If we'd lifted the arms embargo a year ago, we wouldn't be talking about sending American troops now, but that didn't happen,\" he said. **********In explaining his own support, Mr. McCain was more blunt. \"This is not something I want to do,\" he said in an interview. \"I've got calls in my office running 100-to-1 against. But the President has the constitutional authority to  do this and I want to do everything I can to minimize the loss of life and insure a peace agreement is lasting. I've got to do what I think is right. Otherwise, what the hell am I doing here?\" **********Senator Joseph Lieberman, the Connecticut Democrat who had cosponsored legislation with Mr. Dole on lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia, praised Mr. Dole for his action. **********\"The remarks of the majority leader were more than statesmanlike,\" Mr. Lieberman said in the Senate. \"They were in fact patriotic, in the sense that by taking the position he has, he's put the interests of his country ahead of politics.\" **********The unpopularity of sending Americans to serve abroad, even in a situation defined as enforcing peace, was underscored earlier in the day in testimony before the House International Affairs Committee by Secretary of State Christopher. **********Asked by Representative Christopher H. Smith, Republican of New Jersey, whether the timing of the American-led peace initiative was motivated by Presidential politics, Mr. Christopher said no. **********\"I'm not a political expert,\" he said. But, he added, \"It does not look to me, based upon what the polls are, that the President is taking a position that  is politically popular. Indeed, from what I gather it is a very politically risky position.\" **********The Senate resolution, which is in rough draft form, will condition support on a commitment by Mr. Clinton that the Bosnian Government will be able to defend itself after the NATO-led force leaves in about one year, Mr. McCain said. **********It also states that the American troops will engage only in military activities, not nation-building activities like the return of refugees or the policing of streets. **********The United States has committed itself to helping the Bosnian Government arm  and train its military, but not as part of the peace enforcement operation of NATO, which opposes the plan. The American military will also not carry out that task. Rather, it will be done with still-undefined American participation in conjunction with other countries."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/26/business/international-business-daiwa-to-sell-boston-hotel.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1995-12-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 47, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;Daiwa to Sell Boston Hotel", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;Daiwa to Sell Boston Hotel", "body_text": " **********Patriot American Hospitality Inc. has agreed to buy the historic Tremont House Hotel in Boston from Daiwa Bank of Japan for $16 million.

Under the program, which began on Nov. 1, a customer gets 500 American Airlines miles for each of his first five trades, then 100 miles for each subsequent trade. The deal applies to trades of all sizes. **********It takes 25,000 miles, or points, to earn a free domestic ticket on American Airlines, and 40,000 for an international flight. So, after buying or selling stocks 380 times, now you can get a free flight to Bolivia. **********A midsize firm based in New York, Bull and Bear is apparently the first discount broker to offer such a perk. The firm pays American for the miles, but  has not raised its own fees, said Mark C. Winmill, Bull and Bear's president. He added that response to the program has been strong. **********But is it worth it? That depends. **********Bull and Bear is neither the cheapest nor the most expensive of discounters,  according to the American Association of Individual Investors, which surveyed the industry earlier this year. To trade 100 shares of a stock with a price of $50, for example, Bull and Bear investors would pay $44 in commissions, a bit more than the industry average of $42.67. But they can sometimes do better: the  firm's minimum commission is $31, somewhat lower than the industry's average minimum of $36.29. **********With the deal, a Bull and Bear investor gets 500 frequent-flier miles for a first trade. On average, a frequent-flier mile is worth 1.5 cents, Randy Petersen, publisher of Inside Flyer magazine, said. That means the 500 miles are worth $7.50; enough, on a $31 trade, to drop the firm's minimum to $23.50. That  is lower than the minimums charged by all but a handful of the nearly 90 discounters tracked by the association. **********The 1.5-cent figure is an average, however. Depending on the actual ticket price of the trip for which the traveler uses the miles, the real value may be lower or higher. And Bull and Bear offers 500 miles just for the first five trades; after that, traders get only 100 miles a trade, worth about $1.50 by Mr. Petersen's reckoning. Add in the many other differences among discounters -- handling fees, interest paid on account balances -- and the importance to the individual investor of the Bull and Bear offer can vary greatly. **********Bull and Bear's promotion is part of an important trend in the discount industry.  \"There is really cutthroat competition right now,\" said Mark D. Coler, publisher of the Discount Brokerage Survey in New York. **********The struggle began last year, with some discounters slashing rates and installing flatter, less complicated commissions. **********But now fees are so low that \"prices are a nonfactor\" for further competition, said Ronald Kraska, vice president of R. J. Forbes Group, a discounter in Melville, L.I. **********So brokers have turned to nonprice lures instead. Mr. Kraska said his firm considered offering frequent-flier miles last year but decided against it because of accounting difficulties. It is focusing on technology to draw customers, perhaps with software that would let customers trade from home PC's. **********\"I'm willing to go to Taiwan and get posters and give them away with every trade,\" Mr. Kraska said. \"It's gotten to that point.\" **********The higher-priced discounters are offering nonprice lures, too. Hugo Quackenbush, senior vice president at Charles Schwab, criticized the frequent-flier deal. \"This is a serious business,\" Mr. Quackenbush said. He said Schwab offers a Visa card that lets customers collect points toward the purchase of investment-oriented magazines and other items. **********Mr. Winmill said he thought of the frequent-flier angle because he is a frequent flier with American Airlines. \"I've chosen my airline because of frequent-flier miles,\" he said. \"The Visa card I have is because of frequent-flier miles. The phone service I use is because of frequent-flier miles.\" **********Asked why he didn't just reduce Bull and Bear commissions by the value of the frequent-flier miles, Mr. Winmill said, \"This is different. It may appeal to people more.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/16/business/company-news-chrysler-to-add-incentives-to-some-ram-trucks.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-11-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 87, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;CHRYSLER TO ADD INCENTIVES TO SOME RAM TRUCKS", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;CHRYSLER TO ADD INCENTIVES TO SOME RAM TRUCKS", "body_text": " **********The Chrysler Corporation said yesterday that it would add sales incentives to some of its popular 1995 and 1996 model Dodge Ram pickup trucks.

My broker suggested that I sell call options against some blue chip stocks I  own. Isn't this a risky type of investment where only the broker ends up winning by making a commission?    T. ESTRA    New York City A. Not necessarily. Let's face it, all investments carry some degree of risk. Nicholas W. Leeson, the rogue trader who last February lost $1.8 billion in Singapore and promptly took down Britain's oldest bank, Barings P.L.C., was trading in that scariest of investments, derivatives. **********But Toshihide Iguchi, the Daiwa trader who allegedly lost $1.1 billion and was arrested last week, was playing with Treasuries, that supersafe bond backed  by Uncle Sam. **********In other words, how you use an investment sharply affects its risk. And what  your broker seems to have in mind -- selling options against shares you already  own -- is one of the few options strategies that make sense for individual investors. **********Known as writing covered calls, this tactic is a conservative way of insuring part of your portfolio against a decline, according to Stephanie L. Ackler, a vice president at Tucker Anthony, a financial services firm. **********Okay, here's how it works. Imagine you own 100 shares of XYZ Technology, and  you are worried its price will fall, either for company-specific reasons or due to a broad market downturn. To soften the impact of such a drop, you sell an option to another investor to buy your stock. **********This \"call\" option gives the other person the right to buy your shares at a predetermined price, known as the strike price, within a certain period of time. One call covers 100 shares of stock. If XYZ is trading at $44, for example, imagine that you sell one November call at a strike price of $45. You get $300 for selling this right. **********First, the $300 goes into your account and you keep that no matter what. Next, one of two things will take place. If the market falls and XYZ stock closes at, say, $39 at some point before expiration, which occurs the third Friday in November, the option holder will have no interest in buying your stock at $45. The option will expire worthless. And, with the $300 you have pocketed,  you have cut in half the losses on your 100 shares due to the stock's decline. If the stock stays at $44, you have made money on the deal, to the tune of $300. **********But suppose instead that the market rises and XYZ closes at $55 at the option's expiration. The defensive technique of writing covered calls doesn't work well in such a rise. The option holder will naturally elect to buy your 100 shares for $45 apiece.  You do get the $300 from sale of the option, but that isn't nearly enough to make up for the $1,000 you lose in selling stock for $45  a share in a market where it is getting $55. **********Knowing that this can occur, you may want to consider selling calls on only half the number of XYZ shares in your portfolio. This way you won't miss out completely should the stock go up. **********And you should select sleepy stocks -- those equities in your portfolio likely to remain at or around their current levels, said Ms. Ackler.  An example is Lilco,, the Long Island utility, which has been sluggish lately. A contrary example is a volatile stock like Cyrix, a technology company. While you will doubtless get more money for selling options on such a stock, you will also run  a greater risk of missing out on a significant upside move. **********But be aware that selling calls without owning the underlying stock is an entirely different strategy. This is an uncovered position -- and a very risky one, even for the pros. I know, having been a floor options trader on the American Stock Exchange for a few years. A number of my colleagues had to trade  in their yachts for rowboats. **********Still, even writing covered calls requires cautions. One big one: unless you  know exactly what you're doing don't fly solo. Options are complicated, but more than that, they can be very volatile. Should you ever drop into a busy options pit around lunch hour, you'll observe the traders chomping their sandwiches, eyes riveted on the computer screens above them and essentially afraid to leave. Don't go it alone. **********Second, read \"Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options,\" a booklet your broker should send you when you open an options account. You may also want  to read a book on the subject. Given that most tomes in the investment section of your local superstore are much too complicated -- as if the authors expect George Soros or Warren Buffett to buy one for a brush-up session -- look for something more easily understood. **********I suggest \"Getting Started in Options,\" by Michael Thomsett (John Wiley & Sons, $17.95). Just so you know where I'm coming from, my idea of a beginner's book is Elbert S. Mahoney's \"Chapman's Piloting, Seamanship & Small Boat Handling,\" which begins with the weighty question, \"What is a boat?\" **********However, if you don't get around to the book (there are only 84 days left for holiday shopping) here are a few guidelines. Always know your potential profit and loss before trading an option. **********Ms. Ackler warns against selling a call for under a half point ($50) since it won't be worth the commission cost. And don't get carried away; most professional portfolio managers only sell call options on 5 to 10 percent of their entire holdings. **********If you follow these rules and if you have the stomach for it, by all means listen to your broker and let him play the options game. After all, when Charles F. Kettering, a top executive at General Motors years ago, said we should all be concerned about the future because we will have to spend the rest of our lives there, he might just as well have been talking about options trading. **********But if you are the type to get upset if you make a bad options trade, heed the advice of Sam Goldwyn, the malapropist filmmaker of yore: never make any predictions, especially about the future. **********Questions about investing, careers and personal finance can be sent to Minding Your Business, in care of Money and Business, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York 10036.

From the age of 18, every Israeli must serve three years in the army. The peace that Mr. Rabin promised represented the offer of a new life without the danger and disruption of military service -- an offer that is perceived by many as now being cast into doubt. **********\"If there is going to be peace, the next generation is the one that is going  to make the changes,\" said Saev Sagir, an 18-year-old student who is to start military service in two weeks and does not relish the idea. \"People are really scared of going into the military,\" he said. \"You are going to fight for your life every day.\" **********Tom Segev, an author and columnist, wrote today in the newspaper Haaretz: \"The most surprising thing this week was the readiness of young people to adopt  Rabin as their hero.

I trusted the way he was leading us.\" **********Thousands of candles burned today at the site of Mr. Rabin's shooting -- the  former Kings of Israel Square that has been renamed Yitzhak Rabin Square -- until rain sweeping in from the Mediterranean quenched many of them. **********Then, as the rain gave way to winter sunshine, people came to light the candles anew. **********\"The young people wanted to believe that they wouldn't have to go to war,\" said Ronit Zohar, a 25-year-old who wept openly as she maneuvered the stroller carrying her 8-month-old daughter through the candles. \"They wanted to believe they won't fight, they won't die anymore. When I heard about the shooting, I looked at my daughter and thought: What kind of world will you inherit?\" **********Amos Ben Shalom, a 63-year-old laboratory technician said: \"The young people  are lonely. They are more afraid. They looked to Rabin as a father, as a big father.\" **********The impact of such emotions on Israeli politics is still far from clear.

Moreover, young people, like the rest of Israeli society, are deeply divided over the peace effort. **********In both Tel Aviv and at Mr. Rabin's grave in Jerusalem today, there was little indication that ultra-Orthodox Jews -- young or old -- were taking part in the mourning, any more than were Mr. Rabin's adversaries on the right. **********Some political analysts suggested that the young people who took part in public mourning were the same people who had attended peace rallies, meaning that their tears would not create a shift in the political center of gravity. **********\"Maybe they were the ones who were idealistic enough to hope that something was going to come of all this,\" said Gadi Wolfsfeld, of Hebrew University in Jerusalem. \"Maybe they really believed we were entering a new world, that their  lives would be different than ours had been.\" **********Noa Schein, a 13-year-old high school student, said: \"He wanted us to grow up in peace.

The world's prodigious appetite, for instance, has contributed to a shortage of durum wheat, said James Streeter, a trader for the big grain company Italgrani S.p.A. Prices  have climbed to about $7.50 a bushel in the United States, from $4.50 a few years ago. And increasingly competitive pasta makers have brought trade disputes to international forums. **********Still, for Giuseppe Menconi, the big decision at the start of the two-day conference was what sort of pasta to serve to Mr. Piyale and the 500 or so other delegates. Fusilli was no haphazard selection. **********\"When you're cooking for so many people, you have to choose a short format, with considerable thickness,\" said Mr. Menconi, president of the Union of Italian Industrial Pasta Manufacturers, indicating the ideal length with a thumb and forefinger. **********And how was it kept al dente? \"I always say, pasta must swim like a fish in water, so you need one liter for every hundred grams,\" he said. \"The pasta must  be alive, like serpents. Pasta is a living thing, it is not a shoe, or a button, and you must remove it from the water at the right moment, onto a hot serving dish.\" **********Across the dining room of Rome's elegant Excelsior Hotel, where the delegates clinked glasses and slurped their fusilli -- a short, wavy variety that goes well with heavier sauces -- Ding Xiaolin deftly twisted an unaccustomed fork. Professor Ding, a specialist in food science from Jiangsu, China, had led a team of Chinese experts to Rome. **********\"Most of the time, we have Chinese noodles, but I like pasta,\" said Professor Ding, who got to know the Western variety during the two years he spent at Kansas State University. \"Because our population is so big, if the Chinese eat pasta one night a week, that's a lot of pasta.\" **********Calculations like that warm the heart of Mr. Menconi, whose group organized the conference, the first of its kind, to gather delegates from over 40 countries, including manufacturers of pasta and pasta-making machinery, grain growers and traders, nutrition and food policy experts. **********After the fusilli, which was followed by veal, they broke up into working groups. In one, a Swiss engineer from Buhler A.G., the world's largest manufacturer of pasta-making machines, projected slides showing magnified cross-sections of penne to illustrate new techniques for producing extrusion dies. Elsewhere, Giorgio Duchi, an Italian pasta expert, discussed the \"granulometric characteristics of semolina,\" the durum wheat flour that is pasta's principal ingredient. **********\"In Italy, we say the spaghetti is eaten first with the eyes, then with the mouth,\" he said. \"So color is fundamental.\" **********\"The idea is to exchange ideas,\" said Leonard DeFrancisci, the president of Demaco Food Processing Systems, in Ridgewood, Queens, which makes pasta machines. **********\"We're discussing everything from the promotion of pasta, to awareness of pasta's value, to manufacturing methods,\" said Mr. DeFrancisci, whose huge computer-controlled machines, selling for $3 million to $4 million apiece, can turn out 100,000 pounds of pasta a day. **********The conference's diverse attendance bore witness to pasta's international appeal, he said. \"It has no fat,\" he said, \"it's got complex carbohydrates, and  it's an efficient way to produce nutrition. It takes 8 or 9 pounds of grain to make a pound of beef. Why not just eat pasta?\" **********With prices for things like raw materials rising, the struggle is fierce for  shares in leading markets. Indeed, the fly in the sauce at this week's meeting was the decision earlier this month by the United States Commerce Department to  tentatively impose tariffs on Italian and Turkish pasta, in response to a complaint by some of America's largest manufacturers. As imports have grown in recent years, the American industry argues that Italian and Turkish producers use government subsidies at home to sell pasta below cost in the United States.  The American companies asked for the tariffs to offset the European advantage. **********But Mr. Streeter said a pall of silence hung over the topic. \"No one has talked about it much,\" he said, adding, \"Everybody wants free trade, as long as  it's not my product.\" **********The consensus appeared to be that the world's hunger for pasta was large enough to satisfy everyone. \"These are episodes, this will not be the rule,\" said Mr. Menconi of the American action, waving his hand as if to whisk the problem from the table. \"The only ones who will earn money on this in the end will be the lawyers.\" **********\"Peace, harmony, harmony,\" urged C. Mickey Skinner, the president of the Hershey Pasta Group, which sells Ronzoni pasta and is one of the American companies that filed the suit. Hershey Pasta is a unit of the Hershey Foods Corporation. **********Though pasta may be a universal commodity, George P. Morris, the president of Borden Inc.'s North American Pasta Company, which sells Prince pasta, noted how  attitudes toward it vary in the United States. **********\"I think pasta has two basic personalities,\" he mused, turning the idea as if twisting vermicelli on a fork. \"In some markets, it can be a piece of Americana; in other markets it has to be Italian ethnic.\" **********\"New York, which I believe is the world's largest pasta market,\" he said, \"is one of those latter markets.\" **********Thus, some American brands, like Ronzoni, have Italian-sounding names, while  others, like Prince, do not. Borden's contender in the great New York pasta race, he noted glumly, is called Creamette, though its Classico brand has now entered the running against Italian imports like De Cecco and Barilla. **********If the Italian and American pasta makers made efforts to disguise mutual disdain, competitors from further afield showed greater equanimity. **********\"Pasta is part of Indian folklore,\" said Ramana Rao Arkal, whose company, Jaya Food Industries Ltd., in Bangalore, India, manufactures Bambino pasta. \"We  eat it as a breakfast food, or as a dessert called kheer, in sweetened milk.\" **********In recent years, said Mr. Arkal, whose company produces about 2,400 tons a month of various pasta types, including vermicelli, penne and spaghetti, Indians have developed a taste for foreign foods, most notably Chinese cuisine. **********\"We are thinking of starting an Italian food revolution,\" he said, by teaching Indians, who already enjoy Italian dishes like pizza, to consume pasta  with sauces the Italian way. **********Pasta, he said, could provide India with a nutritional alternative. \"We don't worry about obesity,\" he said, \"but it is splendid for diabetics, of which there are many in India, and for cardiovascular problems, for its protein content.\" **********\"One of our legends has it that the Hindu god Krishna, as a baby, was fond of sweets, curds and butter,\" he said. \"And one of his favorite sweets was kheer.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/13/business/the-media-business-turner-said-to-defend-milken-s-advisory-fee.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Truell", "pub_date": "1995-10-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 424, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS;Turner Said to Defend Milken's Advisory Fee", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS;Turner Said to Defend Milken's Advisory Fee", "body_text": " **********Ted Turner, the chairman of Turner Broadcasting System, acknowledged at an investment conference on Wednesday that huge sums would be at stake for himself  and others in the planned acquisition of his company by Time Warner Inc.

Echoing the kind of views favored by Communist leaders, he called Russia's current problems \"the son and grandson\" of corruption in the West. **********\"All this is connected with free-market economy, which creates the corruption, the mafia and so on,\" he said. \"It has become easy to trade, cheat and behave like hooligans.\" **********Toward the end of the interview, however, Mr. Yeltsin appeared to want to soften his words, and said free-market reforms were the greatest achievement of  his presidency. **********But he was adamant in his refusal to allow Russian peacekeeping troops to be  stationed in Bosnia under NATO command.

Zaveryukha  told the Interfax News Agency upon returning from Canada this afternoon. \"We will provide for our own citizens.\" **********That will be possible, specialists here say, mostly because the Russian people have begun to providing for themselves. More than a third of all meat and nearly half the vegetables in the country are now produced privately in back yards or in communal garden plots. For that reason, the predicted harvest of about 66 million tons of grain -- down from last year's anemic 80 million-ton figure -- will not lead to hunger, bread lines or the large-scale personal strife that often follows Russia's poorest harvests. **********But the economic effects, particularly on farmers, will be severe. And the political consequences -- a parliamentary election is scheduled for mid-December just when price increases on meat and milk should hit consumers -- are not expected to be comforting to President Boris N. Yeltsin's administration. **********\"I think the biggest effect of this really grim harvest will be known in December,\" said Viktor F. Lischchenko, director of agricultural studies at the Academy of the National Economy of Russia and a former Government adviser. \"Nobody can do anything about a drought. But the policies of this Government have for some time made a bad situation worse. Now they will be forced to let prices rise or to support them when they shouldn't for political reasons before  the election.\" **********Price increases are never good for the party in power. But price supports might be more harmful in the long run, because they could fuel inflation. **********Each problem in the farm system quickly touches upon others. Because the harvest was poor last year, few farmers could afford new machinery this year. That meant that the grain that was ready for market often failed to get there quickly enough. **********More than half of Russia's agricultural land suffered from drought this year. The poor crop will most seriously affect the quality and price of meat. Less grain means more expensive cattle feed. That will drive many farmers out of the  market, because they cannot afford the cost of keeping their animals alive. For  a while it will become a buyers' market, because farmers will be forced to sell  at low prices to get rid of their cattle. Then, once the animals are slaughtered, prices will rise sharply because supplies will drop. **********Mr. Zaveryukha, the country's most senior agricultural official, has said over the past several weeks that Russia is prepared to import grain if necessary. But nobody wants that. Grain imports are an important emotional issue here: They suggest that the country, which is still largely rural, cannot feed itself without outside help. **********Russia's problems are deepened by the fact that the other two major regional  grain suppliers -- Kazakhstan and Ukraine -- have also had problems this year. In Kazakhstan, the harvest is expected to fall to 12 million tons from 19 million last year. Ukraine is hoping to stay even with its harvest of 1994, but  last year's harvest of 35 million tons was far lower than the figure for 1993. It is unlikely that Ukraine will be able to help Russia with exports this year. **********There are many reasons for the poor harvest beyond the weather. Although the  collective farming system set up under Communism has officially been dismantled, nothing coherent has taken its place. Independent farms have no real distribution systems or bank credit and their equipment is inadequate and aging. When crops do well and are harvested rapidly they have to sit so long before they can be transported to market that as much as 40 percent of raw grain rots in the fields. **********Most important, perhaps, the property laws in Russia remain murky, discouraging people who do have money from buying a farm for fear they will not  really own it. Finally, because the Government is the biggest buyer of grain, it can keep prices low, meaning that many farmers cannot even recoup their investment. **********\"What has happened now will take years to set right,\" said Viktor I. Pashinin, vice chairman of the Association of Peasant Farms and Agricultural Cooperatives of Russia. \"We have combined stupidity with bad luck and now we are in a big hole.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/19/business/media-business-advertising-for-first-time-since-86-holidays-seem-free-print-ads.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1995-12-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 766, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;For the first time since '86, the holidays seem free of print ads that sing, pop up or mimic snow globes.", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;For the first time since '86, the holidays seem free of print ads that sing, pop up or mimic snow globes.", "body_text": " **********ELABORATE, expensive print advertisements with holiday themes, intended to help sales messages stand out when consumers are busiest and most besieged by marketing blitzes, might well be going the way of an appreciation for fruitcake. **********The trend had begun in 1987, when Absolut vodka ran an ad embedded with a microchip that played Christmas carols. Since then, consumers have been enjoying (or, depending on their tolerance for whimsical kitsch, wincing at) pitches that have sung, talked, moved, popped up and mimicked the snow globes and Advent calendars of childhood memory. Another popular gimmick has been to enclose gifts, ranging from gloves and stickers to hosiery and handkerchiefs. **********Most of these ads, known as spectaculars, have peddled premium-priced products, particularly liquor. Several of them have carried premium price tags,  too, costing advertisers as much as $1 million in production and media costs. **********Those factors, and the genesis of spectaculars in the status-conscious 1980's, have fed a perception that they have been fading in relevance and effectiveness. **********Indeed, it appears that this holiday season will be the first in eight years  without a single spectacular. Even Absolut, which had run one every year since 1987, chose a decidedly low-key alternative for 1995: a four-line ad in tiny type on the bottom of the front page of The New York Times. That ad, which ran yesterday, announced that Absolut would donate $250,000 to the anti-hunger organization Share Our Strength. **********\"I'm not saying that spectaculars are gone forever,\" said Arthur Shapiro, executive vice president for marketing at the House of Seagram in New York, a unit of the Seagram Company that is responsible for hawking brands like Absolut  and Chivas Regal Scotch whisky. **********\"But everyone expects us to do a Christmas blockbuster,\" he added, \"and that's a little more reason to zig while you're thinking we'll zag.\" **********It was that loss of the element of surprise and \"a need to do something different,\" Mr. Shapiro said, that rang down the curtain for now on holiday spectaculars, rather than any belief that, as he put it, \"they're so 80's.\" **********Richard Lewis, executive vice president of TBWA Chiat/Day in New York, the longtime Absolut agency that is owned by the Omnicom Group, agreed. **********\"We're certainly not walking away from spectaculars,\" he said. \"Just because  an idea was born in the 80's doesn't mean it had to die in the 80's.\" **********\"What we decided this year was to simply take a break, a sabbatical,\" he added. **********One theory about why spectaculars are diminishing in appeal is that they are  being supplanted by interactive media projects that offer more consumer involvement -- and cost far less to create and produce -- than ads inviting someone to listen to a tinny tune or open a die-cut door. **********For instance, Carillon Importers Ltd., a unit of Grand Metropolitan P.L.C. that markets Stolichnaya vodka, has redesigned its site on the World Wide Web for the holidays. The site (http://www.stoli.com) permits computer users to send electronic greeting cards called Stoli Notes; for each cybernaut who logs on and sends a greeting, Carillon will donate a dollar to the Literacy Volunteers of America. **********\"We didn't feel it necessary to do something spectacular,\" said Robert Manni, group account director at Margeotes/Fertitta & Partners in New York, the Stolichnaya agency. **********However, he added, the Internet project \"isn't being done in place of a spectacular; we're doing it in conjunction with what works on our Web site, which is interactivity, fun and entertainment.\" **********Margeotes/Fertitta is also running colorful, full-page magazine ads for Stolichnaya, featuring works by Yuri Gorbachev, a Russian artist. Those are meant to \"create a warm, folksy feel for the brand,\" Mr. Manni said, as a kind of holiday card in print; many of the graphic elements on the Web site are borrowed from the print ads, he added. **********Among those likely to be most despondent about the missing spectaculars are the advertising sales executives at the magazines where they have most frequently appeared. But at least one publisher maintained that she and her staff were \"definitely not throwing ourselves out the window.\" **********\"Spectaculars make a statement and make advertisers stand apart,\" said Amy R. Churgin, the publisher of New York magazine, which is owned by the K-III Communications Corporation. \"They're units that have what we call 'the wow factor.' **********\"But companies are probably rethinking them because they like to try something new,\" she added. **********Several marketers, in categories like distilled spirits, financial services and retailing, are working on \"smarter, more interactive\" types of spectaculars for 1996, Ms. Churgin said. And, in another change, she added, they probably will eschew the holiday season and choose times of the year when spectaculars were less expected."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/23/business/international-business-the-caspian-caviar-crisis-killing-too.html": {"writer_name": "Steve Levine", "pub_date": "1995-12-23", "snippet": "The 10 little jars of glistening black sturgeon eggs in Tofiq's refrigerator  reflect the bleak future of the world's caviar industry. \n\n     Twenty miles east of here is the Caspian Sea, where the sturgeon live and 95  percent of the black caviar...", "word_count": 1144, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: The Caspian Caviar Crisis: Killing Too ManyFish; Free Markets, Fewer Sturgeon", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: The Caspian Caviar Crisis: Killing Too ManyFish; Free Markets, Fewer Sturgeon", "body_text": " **********The 10 little jars of glistening black sturgeon eggs in Tofiq's refrigerator  reflect the bleak future of the world's caviar industry. **********Twenty miles east of here is the Caspian Sea, where the sturgeon live and 95  percent of the black caviar that adorns appetizer plates around the world is produced. Until the 1991 Soviet breakup, Bank was Azerbaijan's caviar center, where sturgeon fishing was carefully regulated, and eggs were canned under state inspection in the local factory. **********Today, however, with the collapse of state control, illegal fishing has ravaged the Caspian sturgeon population, and traders like Tofiq have come to dominate the caviar trade. **********Post-Soviet upheaval led to chaos in the Caspian region's caviar industry, the most important after oil. Despite the industry's dominance in the world market, experts say it is fading and are urging emergency measures to save it. **********In just the last five years, the sturgeon population has plunged from 200 million to fewer than 60 million, according to a Russian Government estimate. **********Before the collapse of the Soviet Union, it and Iran were the sole nations on the sea, and they obeyed strict quotas. Sturgeon fishing was banned on the sea itself; to catch the mighty schools of sturgeon, fishermen fixed nets across Russia's Volga, Azerbaijan's Kura and Kazakhstan's Ural rivers, and caught them as they swam to spawn. **********These days, the affable Tofiq, 26, buys caviar straight from the boat, adds salt, scoops it into red jars indistinguishable from official containers and resells it to black-market exporters. From there, the jars ultimately reach speciality shops in the United States, Europe and Russia. **********\"If someone wants 100 jars, I can make them; all I need is an order,\" Tofiq said, removing a 3.6-ounce sample from his home refrigerator. \"Pasteurization is not necessary. **********\"Sometimes, if I have a large order of 100 or 200 jars, I take my caviar to the factory. They process it in about five minutes,\" said Tofiq, who asked that  his last name not be used. \"But that is the only time the factory is working.\" **********Azerbaijan alone exported an average of 15 tons of caviar a year, mostly from Bank, which abuts the Kura; 1926 was the bumper year, with 550 tons exported, according to state figures. The Bank factory sent two-pound caviar salamis wrapped in white cloth to Stalin, state officials said, and exported 110-pound barrels of the black eggs to London retailers. **********The breakup four years ago, however, produced five Caspian states -- Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia and Turkmenistan -- which have failed to enforce the restrictions. **********Today, almost all fishing is done indiscriminately on the sea, before the sturgeon spawn. Specialists say this practice, along with pollution from petrochemical plants, oil and raw sewage, have been the key reasons for the sturgeon's decline. Another culprit has been a natural rise in the level of the  Caspian, where the sturgeon live 12 to 18 years before they spawn. **********The sea has risen 3 feet in the last decade, enough that the Kura River no longer descends rapidly into the Caspian. Some experts predict another 10-foot rise within a decade. **********Already, the water has submerged two sturgeon hatcheries near here that had released 10 million fish a year into the sea. Silt now almost blocks the Kura from meeting the sea, and sturgeon from reaching their traditional spawning grounds. **********Exacerbated by the construction of hydroelectric dams, some breeding grounds  have also been lost on the Russian Volga, Europe's longest river and the source of most Caspian caviar. **********\"Every day the supply of sturgeon declines, and declines fast,\" Tariel Mamedli, Azerbaijan's deputy fisheries minister, said in the Azerbaijan capital  of Baku. \"It can't go on long. We have to take fast measures or lose it. We'll lose everything in five years.\" **********Local fishermen and wholesalers themselves continue to inflict much damage. No one regulates how they produce or process caviar, and Western specialists say one result has been a decline in the freshness and general quality of some exports. **********By custom, fishermen here bonk their catch on the head, cut the fish open alive and scoop the caviar out. The fish is set aside for the market, and the caviar washed, weighed and sorted. **********In past years, the caviar was then sent to the local factory. There, it was put into jars, sealed with official steel caps and pasteurized by immersion in a 140-degree water bath for two and a half hours. Finally, it was refrigerated at  35 degrees, and sent to Russia for export. **********Rafael Jalelov, a manager at the old state caviar factory, said this process  yielded an eight-month shelf life. **********Today, Bank's busy, unregulated caviar market retains only the intrigue of the old Soviet Union, with sellers using a comical, surreptitious ritual, as though in the drug trade. **********Shifty-looking men sidle up behind buyers in muddy corner lots, where people  sell squirming fish and headless ducks. \"Do you want caviar?\" they whisper. **********In one such lot, a man pulled out from under his overcoat a pint-size jar wrapped in newspaper. It contained a slimy substance, caviar, but evidently not  extracted from a live sturgeon. He asked for the equivalent of $30. **********Such men make up the low end of Bank's caviar market. The high end -- those who control exports abroad -- is represented by a tough, officially tolerated mafia, local traders said. **********Traders like Tofiq represent the main, middle range, people who sell caviar from their backyards, often to mafia figures. **********At today's rates, Tofiq buys caviar from local fishermen for $20 a pound, and a local maker provides the jars and lids. Tofiq then charges $8 for a 3.6-ounce  jar -- a 78 percent markup. **********In Moscow, such jars go for $60; in New York, the retail price can be $75. **********Tofiq reckoned that he and his neighbors sell about a ton of caviar a month,  or enough for about 8,000 standard 4-ounce jars -- a credible figure, considering Soviet-era production. But the local take is relatively small, so traders like Tofiq do not think much about the impact of overfishing. **********\"All my neighbors do it,\" he said, tossing a two-by-four at two dogs sniffing around a gutted sturgeon that a fisherman has brought by motorcycle. \"You have to make a living.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/02/business/international-business-brazil-s-president-prevailing-despite-disruptive-oil.html": {"writer_name": "James Brooke", "pub_date": "1995-06-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 829, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;Brazil's President Prevailing Despite Disruptive Oil Strike", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;Brazil's President Prevailing Despite Disruptive Oil Strike", "body_text": " **********At dawn, drivers start lining up here for scarce gasoline.

The strike is not officially over, but it is crumbling. Oil workers straggled back to work today without a contract, and production at state oil refineries stood at 63 percent and rising. **********In a test of wills, the oil workers had threatened to derail the nation's anti-inflation program. Had they won pay increases above the inflation rate, other unions would have demanded equal treatment. **********Instead, the failed strike proved to be a fiasco for the left. In May, two calls for general strikes went unheeded. The left, in particular the Workers Party, which is aligned with a confederation of public-employee unions, gambled  that Mr. Cardoso, a sociologist and former exile, would buckle under pressure. Instead, he sent troops last week to occupy four refineries, helping restore production. **********Mr. Cardoso is also smiling because the strikers played neatly into his plans to push a package through Congress of market-oriented constitutional amendments. **********As the shadow lengthened from the monthlong strike by employees of Petrobras, the state oil company, the Chamber of Deputies, Brazil's lower house of Parliament, approved amendments that abolished the state telephone monopoly, erased discrimination against foreign companies, allowed private companies to sell piped natural gas, and opened the 5,000-mile Atlantic coastline to foreign  cruise ships and freighters. **********\"The strike increased political support for breaking the monopolies,\" said Walder de Goes, a political scientist in Brasilia and president of the Brazilian Institute of Political Studies. \"It showed the public how risky it is to have a  state monopoly in something so essential as oil.\" **********Mr. de Goes, who surveys Congressional attitudes, believes that when the lower house votes on Wednesday, it will approve the most controversial item of the free-market package -- allowing foreign companies to drill for oil in Brazil. The Senate, more tightly controlled by the governing coalition, is expected to ratify all measures the deputies approve by July. **********Breaking the phone monopoly is expected to pave the way for as much as $10 billion in foreign telecommunications investment by the end of the decade. Ending discrimination against foreign investors, such as the prohibition of majority ownership in mining operations, is expected to open the door to privatization next year of the huge state mining company, a sale expected to fetch about $15 billion. **********The rapid-fire series of congressional votes is making Brazil's left sound notes of desperation. Leonel Brizola, who spent 15 years in exile after a coup in 1964, said last week, \"If there is not a popular civilian reaction, there will inevitably be a military action, because the military are traditionally nationalists.\" **********Orestes Quercia, a former governor of Sao Paulo state, said here on Sunday, \"This Government is promoting the breaking of monopolies in an irresponsible way, with the goal of selling the nation's patrimony for small change.\" **********Sensing that a 50-year tradition of state companies is quickly slipping away, union leaders have assailed Mr. Cardoso, and there has been some violence. Last  week, in a northeastern city, protesters stoned the President's bus, smashing three windows and slightly injuring two aides. **********But, with public opinion polls backing the President, his free-market drive continues unabated. Inaugurating a public service concessions law, the Government in May privatized a highway, a major bridge and a hydroelectric dam project. In the second half of the year, 17 companies are to be sold, largely electricity and petrochemical concerns. **********Bolstering Mr. Cardoso's standing, Brazil's inflation for the first six months of the year is expected to be 10 percent -- the lowest rate for a six-month period in more than 20 years.

Procter & Gamble is to build a $100 million factory near here; Cargill is to invest $300 million, and Brazil's newly privatized steel industry plans $6 billion in investments through 1999. **********John Mein, vice president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Sao Paulo, said investors seemed to be waiting for the constitutional amendments to take effect. \"Then,\" he said, \"we will see a major increase in investments in Brazil, especially in areas previously not open to international investors.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/04/business/homegrown-capitalism-delivers-the-wide-world-of-sports-to.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Edelman", "pub_date": "1995-12-04", "snippet": "In 1990, Vladimir Titorenko was a leading writer for the national sports daily in Russia, Sovetskii Sport.

But as he began to write positive reports about the National Basketball Association, he faced increasing disapproval from  hard-line editors, who were more interested in pushing coverage of the Olympic sports favored by the state: track and field, weight lifting and archery. **********The deputy director of Sovetskii Sport, Vladimir Kuchmi, had been experiencing similar frustration. So that spring he raised the idea of starting  a politically independent sports daily and invited Mr. Titorenko to join him. **********In July 1991, a few weeks before the inept hard-line coup that marked the beginning of the end of the old Soviet Union, 12 of Sovetskii Sport's most popular writers left en masse to start the new paper. They were taking a huge personal and professional risk. Sovetskii Sport was not just the most popular sports daily, it was the country's only sports daily. **********To distinguish the new paper from Sovetskii Sport, its founders promised to emphasize sports with the largest audiences -- soccer, hockey and basketball --  and relegate the more obscure sports to occasional articles. The quest seemed hopeless. But today their paper, Sport Ekspress, is one of the most successful dailies in Russia, with a circulation well above 800,000. **********While the editors are reluctant to discuss financial details, they say that most issues sell out and that the daily rate for a full-page advertisement is $24,000 -- though, like their Western counterparts, they offer discounts to good customers. **********\"Our reasons for quitting were not simply political but professional,\" said Mr. Kuchmi, 46, who is editor in chief of Sport Ekspress. \"Sovetskii Sport was a small newspaper, only four pages. One page was official party news, another physical culture. A third was articles pirated from the foreign press. There was only one page of sports news for fans: one page for journalists to work in a normal professional manner.\" **********Sport Ekspress began publishing three days before the August coup. Mr. Kuchmi had used personal sources to get a low-interest six-month loan of three million  rubles ($160,000) from the Commercial-Industrial Bank of the Russian Republic. The founders bought computers, telephones and newsprint and started to work in one another's kitchens. **********Their goal was to deliver accurate and timely information about popular sports from a broadly international perspective, but the lack of wire services,  coupled with the Soviet Union's inadequate telephone system, made acquiring any  information, domestic or foreign, an arduous business. **********No one received wages for the first six months. \"We were fortunate each of us had friends who were able to help us,\" said the deputy editor, Vladimir Geskin,  42, who like Mr. Kuchmi spent more than 20 years at Sovetskii Sport. **********Yelena Vaitsekhovskaya, the assistant editor and a former Olympic diving champion, recalled the first days. \"We knew only how to write articles, but nothing about production, advertising or distribution,\" she said.Still, the founders were able to publish 20,000 copies of a four-page paper five times a week. It was delivered from the trunk of Mr. Kuchmi's car to whatever newsstands would take it. **********They immediately found an audience, and circulation increased rapidly. Mr. Kuchmi said he paid back the bank loan in three months. **********Advertising took longer to expand. As Soviet mores disappeared, ads for bookies and phone sex began to appear in Sport Ekspress. But eventually they gave way to lucrative displays for large Western and Russian companies selling everything from cigarettes and coffee to athletic shoes and computers. **********Still, Vsevolod Kukushkin, the paper's business director, had to reorient a certain Russian literalness concerning advertising. \"Not everyone understood what it meant to advertise in a paper like Sport Ekspress,\" he said. \"Someone would say, 'We sell computers, but you are not a computer newspaper.' Well, we are not a computer newspaper, but aren't people who buy computers also interested in soccer and hockey?\" **********It didn't hurt to be lucky. \"We'd published for three days when the coup began,\" Mr. Kuchmi said. \"All newspapers were closed down, but I was so obsessed I forgot the danger. Our printing plant was surrounded by troops, but I begged a soldier to let me pass with our layouts. He could have shot me, but he waved me  by.\" **********In the post-Soviet era, circulation and advertising expanded rapidly. The paper grew to eight pages, and the staff grew to more than 200. Permanent headquarters were secured in a small apartment in downtown Moscow. But by late 1994, Mr. Kuchmi said, \"We had exhausted the technical possibilities available to us.\" **********\"We were 8 pages, but we knew we could grow to 16,\" he continued. \"We needed  more phones, wire services, correspondents and computers.\" **********So they formed a privately held company and sold 51 percent of its newly created stock to the French sports daily L'Equipe for an undisclosed sum. The founding editors retained 49 percent of the shares. **********Sport Ekspress used the new capital to build a modern office in an otherwise  dingy building not far from Tverskaya Street, one of Moscow's main thoroughfares. **********Using a combination of sophisticated (computers for the production process) and primitive (typewriters and pencils for the writing and editing) technology,  the paper is published five days a week. Advertising occupies one-fourth to one-third of the available space. **********After four years, Sport Ekspress has begun to generate solid profits, its editors say. Journalistically, however, it has yet to find its own voice. Many of its practices are overreactions to the perversities of Soviet journalism, which featured a lack of up-to-date information and a preference for opinion over news.

Once a week after work I joined hundreds of New York bank employees at the American Institute of Banking, where we would slip into the humble furniture of  adult education to learn the rules of the financial system. This term we had firsthand experience of an institutional tolerance for cheating. **********Ten minutes into our midterm in international banking operations, a young woman sitting in the front row pulled out her textbook and began flipping through it. The teacher had not stayed to monitor us, and thus, he did not see the incident that would eventually riddle the class with anger, distrust, self-pity, xenophobia, complicity and cynicism. **********The moment the student began searching through her textbook, the 20 other scribblers looked up, eyebrows shot up -- and, most shockingly, the hands of two students shot down into bookbags to pull out their textbooks. Then the tense silence was broken by the click of the door. In walked the teacher. **********He strolled in front of the blackboard a while before his eyes fell on the open textbook. \"Close that book,\" he said quietly. He evinced no sign of the outrage I was feeling. The student closed it. He left the room. Not five minutes went by before she reopened the book. **********Because I once was a teacher, I allied myself with authority and spoke up: \"Is this an open-book exam?\" The students regarded me, then hid deeper into their work. \"Does anybody think this is an open-book exam?\" I asked more forcefully, staring hard at the young woman. She turned to me, and I said, \"Excuse me, but that offends me.\" **********\"Why?\" she shrugged. \"I forgot some answers.\" Her benign expression said I was the misguided one. **********\"It's called cheating!\" grumbled a gruff voice from the back. Then a another  woman spoke to her in their native tongue, clearly to reprimand her. She closed  the text. **********All this occurred in about 15 minutes, but the debate that followed still rumbles among the students and possibly in the administration of the American Institute of Banking, which is the educational arm of the American Bankers Association. I spoke to the teacher as I left the classroom the evening of the midterm, and he appeared concerned but noncommittal about any course of action.  I also called the school to ask about its policy on cheating, only to be told that it depended on the individual teacher. To which one can only respond: \"Does bank robbery depend upon the individual bank?\" **********When we reconvened the following week, a few students expressed frustration that their complaints to the teacher and the school were met with mild surprise and marked indifference. I was surprised by the apparent quandary of the teacher as he spoke to us at the beginning of that class. He addressed us as a group of malefactors; the woman who had cheated sat in the first row as unflappable as ever. **********He expressed three concerns: that we could not be trusted when he was out of  the room; that we ought to consider how we would feel if our own children cheated, and that the test was a standardized one, which the school had designed to be fair. **********Although he was addressing a classroom of working adults, ages roughly 30 to  50, he used a patronizing tone. His whole approach gave rise to a new outrage -- namely, that we were all lumped together with this witless cheater. **********There seemed to be no contemplation of punishment, just a lot of finger-wagging. I was not the only one annoyed, and a group of us gathered outside after class arguing about it. The initial fury at the cheater was soon directed at the teacher -- and at that large target, The System. **********Several students felt the exam had been unfair and that we had not been properly prepared. Though this view is arguable, there was a comprehensive textbook, so the teacher really couldn't be blamed. **********The text, maintained one student, was written in a dense style and was far too complex for the foreign students to whom English is a second language. But the school is called the \"American\" Institute of Banking, so it could reasonably be expected to teach and test in English. **********The teacher's English, his second language, was horrendous and could hardly be understood, said several students. True, but I never heard these students asking him if he really meant \"the Fed\" when he said \"the bed.\" And the test was not based on the lectures but on the book. I think ignorance of English is a shoddy excuse for cheating and reinforces dangerous prejudices. We don't really  think the ethics of the developing nations look like their balances of payments, do we? **********Another student whined about banks that reimburse tuition on the basis of grades: an A earned 100 percent reimbursement, a B only 80 percent, etc. Combined with the low pay at the foreign banks, the economic imperative for cheating gained a few fans. So is it O.K. to take money from the till at the end of the day because your pay is too low? **********What bothered me most, however, was my fellow students' gradual consensus that cheating is indeed part and parcel of banking, if not schooling. While several were initially outraged at the idea of cheating on a test, mention of Wall Street's more notorious cheats allowed us to settle into cynicism. Why should the institute be less tolerant of cheating than the institutions it's training us for? **********Thus the cheater was slowly exonerated by specious but steady rationalization. **********By the time we took our places for the final exam, I feared most students were prepared to cheat their way through it. Perhaps the teacher also thought so; he took his place in front of the class and bent an eagle eye upon us. But the young woman didn't show up for the final. Without her, we had no scapegoat for bad behavior. The exam stretched through two intense and muffled hours. I doubt that anybody had an opportunity to cheat, and since that was what had obsessed us, it was easy to feel cheated in the end."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/22/business/quaker-state-in-settlement.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1995-12-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 128, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Quaker State In Settlement", "print_headline": "Quaker State In Settlement", "body_text": " **********The Quaker State Corporation said today that it had agreed to pay $4.4 million to settle a lawsuit that it was part of an oil industry price-fixing conspiracy. **********Quaker State, a producer of motor oil and lubricants based in Irving, said it was one of three companies that were the targets of a 1994 class-action suit brought by producers of Penn Grade crude, an oil that yields products ranging from engine lubricants to food additives. **********The producers, most of whom operate in Pennsylvania and neighboring states,  contended that Quaker State, the Pennzoil Company and the Witco Corporation had  violated Federal antitrust laws by conspiring for 14 years to fix prices at several dollars less than what producers say they need to be profitable."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/14/world/balkan-accord-debatecapitol-sketchbook-clinton-gets-wary-backing-his-rival-dole.html": {"writer_name": "Francis Clines", "pub_date": "1995-12-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 843, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Clinton Gets Wary Backing From His Rival, Dole", "print_headline": "BALKAN ACCORD: THE DEBATECAPITOL SKETCHBOOK; Clinton Gets Wary Backing From His Rival, Dole", "body_text": " **********Only hours before President Clinton departed for the signing of the Bosnian peace agreement in Paris, Senator Bob Dole sought to ease his mission. He reached back 25 years in history and recalled the furious Senate debates over the Vietnam War and the issue of supporting American troops and their Commander  in Chief. **********The Kansas Republican and Senate majority leader presented one of the more arresting moments in the inevitable overlap of foreign policy and domestic politics: Mr. Dole, the scarred war hero, considered the front-runner to challenge Mr. Clinton in 1996, offering wary backing to a President regularly dogged for not serving in Vietnam. **********Long debates, rancorous debates, heated debates,\" Mr. Dole said today, recalling Vietnam on a spirited day of dispute over Bosnia. Crafting clauses, sizing up votes, the Senator was intent on delivering a qualified Senate blessing to the President's Bosnian initiative. At the same time, he was holding off a significant bloc of members who were as vocal as the critics in the old Vietnam days in wanting no part of putting 20,000 American troops at risk as peacekeepers in Bosnia. **********\"We had one debate that lasted seven weeks,\" he told a chamber that had little more than 12 hours to come to terms with the President's action on Bosnia. \"And I was the leader of the effort not to cut off funds because we had  people like John McCain in prison,\" Senator Dole said of the Vietnam war hero and Senator from Arizona. The nation's military, he cautioned in retrospect, should never bear the brunt of unpopular political decisions. **********\"It was wrong during Vietnam, and it's wrong now,\" Mr. Dole insisted, nudging the Senate toward approval of the Dole-McCain resolution, which would support the President's Bosnian effort but try to reshape it in the name of better protecting the troops and insuring peace by fully arming the Bosnian faction. **********The conflict of proposals for and against going to Bosnia presented as much a test of Mr. Dole's leadership as the President's. Only weeks from the formal start of campaigning for 1996, the rivals were, briefly at least, on oddly parallel tracks in a debate that reflected the full range of the public's doubt  about the mission. **********\"This is a goofy proposal to send American troops to stand in between warring factions that have been at war for 500 years and never honored a peace agreement,\" warned Senator Hank Brown, a Colorado Republican who cited American  troops' experiences in Vietnam, Lebanon and Somalia. \"C'mon now, does anybody believe the cause of interfering in civil war is important enough that they should lose their lives?\" **********Far to the contrary, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, New York Democrat, rose as a former representative to the United Nations to hail the Bosnian mission as  a \"rousing statement of the centrality of law\" and the upholding of treaty commitments by the Government. \"We are responding today to what we have learned  from the past,\" he said, reviewing history from the ideals of the founding fathers to the darkest lessons of two world wars. **********Standing somewhere between was William S. Cohen, Republican of Maine, who criticized Congress for yielding its constitutional responsibility for war powers to the White House across the years of ethnic atrocity in Bosnia. Looking ahead to the coming political year, he warned that the President's failure to seek stronger Congressional support sooner could prove crucial when casualties occur and the resolve to continue the mission flags. \"Unless you have Congress on record in support,\" he said, \"when the public turns, the Congress will be in  full pursuit.\" **********Many speakers sought to support American troops yet criticize the President.  But Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Connecticut Democrat, warned, \"We cannot support the troops and oppose the mission.\" **********Senator James M. Inhofe, Oklahoma Republican, said, \"I don't think we can tell the good guys from the bad guys,\" and argued that the troops would be wide  open to terrorist attacks. Mark O. Hatfield, Oregon Republican, scoffed at Administration assurances about avoiding battle. \"We are going into Bosnia with  an army,\" he said, \"And we are going to force the peace.\" **********If nothing else, the debate laid bare the multi-edged domestic politics of the Bosnian issue. Mr. Dole carefully drew distinctions with Mr. Clinton, saying his Senate resolution insures not just the arms for Bosnia that he had long sought over the President's opposition, but also a more \"timely and safe withdrawal\" of the troops than Mr. Clinton planned. **********\"Let's be clear: a date is not an exit strategy,\" Mr. Dole declared, even as  his primary Republican rival, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, was setting his sights on Mr. Dole. **********\"I am concerned about the Dole amendment,\" Mr. Gramm said, arguing that arming the Bosnians would shred American neutrality. **********Mr. Dole paid no heed. \"This is not about politics,\" he told the Senate, adding that \"this is about a lot of frightened young Americans\" arriving in Bosnia and asking one question of their homeland: \"Did we have the support of those who represent us?\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/06/business/futures-markets-soybeans-up-on-drought-fears.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-12-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 283, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FUTURES MARKETS;Soybeans Up on Drought Fears", "print_headline": "FUTURES MARKETS;Soybeans Up on Drought Fears", "body_text": " **********Soybean prices surged on the Chicago Board of Trade yesterday as concern grew that a lack of rain was harming Brazil's crop, the world's second largest. **********Wheat prices also rose strongly on concerns over low rainfall.

Can you suggest a simple business that my husband and I, both retired, and in our 60's, can start from home?    Gale Osgood    St. Louis **********A. A 1973 syndicated newspaper cartoon says it all: A husband, surrounded by suitcases on the doorstep, is about to put the key in the lock when he turns to  his wife and says, \"The most exciting part of our vacation is coming home and discovering which part of the house has been flooded, collapsed or burglarized.\" **********A desire to prevent that kind of \"excitement\" must have given rise to the house-sitting service, which has become a pay-as-you-go business ideally suited  for senior citizens interested in supplementing their retirement incomes. **********Jane Poston, who at 72 is a Mother Superior of the nascent senior home-sitting business, says, \"Today's new homeowner may have no family living nearby and often won't know the neighbors well enough to impose on them.\" **********Nor can one always depend on neighborhood teen-agers for hire. \"Reliability is critical,\" Ms. Poston explains, \"and retirees tend to be very reliable.\" **********For many who swear by it, house-sitting can represent a chance to live vicariously, occasionally on some wealthy person's estate or ranch. Some even look on these assignments as \"paid vacations.\" **********Senior citizens are ideal in that there is little \"heavy lifting.\" Previous experience in household management, though, is taken for granted. \"At the very least, home sitters should know how to reactivate a circuit breaker, replace a fuse, reset a thermostat and open the electric garage door,\" says Paul Sauer, 57, a former biochemist who 22 years ago founded Denver's Homewatch Corporation  (800 777-9770). Subsequently, he branched out into other areas (the company is now in 27 cities in 6 states), offered franchises ($18,500 a territory) and added ancillary services, like home pet care, handyman work and nonmedical companion care. **********Ms. Poston, a former high school English teacher and Peace Corps volunteer, ran the Tucson, Ariz.-based House Sitter Security Service for 20 years before retiring herself and selling her business. Her 41-page soup-to-nuts manual, \"How to Run a House-Sitting Business\" ($38 by mail from 1708 East 9th Street, Tucson, Ariz., 85719, or by calling 520 884-8530), is now in its third printing and has  been ordered in bulk from as far away as Saudi Arabia, \"where one homeowner required the sitter to take care of a hooded falcon and an Arabian steed.\" **********Most house-sitting is done by individuals, most of whom carry no liability insurance, are not bonded and rely on referrals rather than advertising, maybe to escape the attention of the tax collector. Tax officials are often aware of who is doing what in the nation's underground economy, but may choose to overlook a few senior citizens working part time to make ends meet. **********House-sitting is not necessarily a penny-ante profession. One Long Island house sitter describes her post-retirement work as \"extremely lucrative.\" Last year, she cleared an untaxed $48,000, most of it from jobs paying $25 an hour.\" **********Nor does \"house-sitting\" necessarily mean actually moving into someone else's home, though many homeowners do request 24-hour service. More often than not, users are satisfied with either a \"drive by\" (to make sure that no windows or locks are broken and that the mail hasn't piled up on the stoop) or \"drop in\" (to inspect the interiors and water the plants). A number of customers order overnight service, requiring sleep-ins. Most of the established outfits offer a  Chinese menu of basic house-sitting services, insist on contracts, ask for partial payment in advance (vacationers have been known to return broke) and charge per service for extras like pool cleaning, lawn mowing and pet care. **********Costs vary considerably, depending on what kind of service is requested, where one lives and what has to be watched. One of Mr. Sauer's Virginia franchises has gone from house-sitting to boat-sitting, and charges accordingly. Even among the entrepreneurs, there are daily and hourly rates, bulk discounts, and mileage allowances for car travel. **********Who makes the best house-sitters? \"What we're selling,\" Mr. Sauer of Homewatch says, \"are men and women with the experience, maturity, sense of responsibility, most of whom have gone through disasters and know instinctively  what to do in case of an emergency.\" Not surprisingly, Ms. Poston thinks women over 50 do. \"They know more about taking care of houses than anyone else. They are comfortable to stay at home, and they instinctively ask the right questions  before settling in.\" Like the name and number of the plumber, electrician and all the other service people. **********A busy house-sitter will often farm out jobs to others. Because each home is  unique, as are its owners, putting together the right sitter for the right clients can make house-sitting similar to running a dating service, Ms. Poston adds. \"You need to make sure that the petite, 100-pound sitter isn't suddenly confronted with having to walk a 200-pound St. Bernard,\" which is precisely what happened to her in the early days. A house sitter with as much experience as Ms. Poston will also deftly handle the occasional odd job, like spoonfeeding a high-strung Afghan hound chocolate chip ice cream -- the only thing that would calm him during a week of terrifying thunderstorms. **********Questions about investing, careers and personal finance can be sent to Minding Your Business, Money and Business, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York 10036.

The Croats control about 22 percent of Bosnia and their strong inclination is to govern this territory directly from Zagreb rather than work with the Sarajevo Government. **********The overall peace plan presented here today to the Presidents of Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia calls for the establishment of several centralized institutions, including a presidency and a parliament, and for what Secretary of State Warren Christopher on Wednesday called a Bosnian state \"with a single international personality.\" **********But at the same time it envisages splitting the country roughly in half between a Muslim-Croat federation and a republic of Serbs. **********The Serbs, who have fought since 1992 to establish their own state in Bosnia  and now control about 48 percent of the country, have told American officials that they want the central Bosnian institutions to amount to no more than \"a paper roof.\" **********It is this tension -- between the centralized unitary state sought by the Bosnian Government of President Izetbegovic and the very loose union that might  open the way to eventual secession sought by the Serbs -- that lies at the heart of the peace talks. It is by no means clear that the diplomatic acrobatics of the chief American mediator, Richard C. Holbrooke, can resolve it. **********Mr. Christopher made clear in a television interview broadcast today that the United States expects Radovan Karadzic and Gen. Ratko Mladic, the political and  military leaders of the Bosnian Serbs who have been indicted by an international tribual in The Hague as war criminals, to be ousted in the very near future. **********This statement amounted to by far the boldest demand yet made by the Clinton  Administration for the removal of two men who would certainly work determinedly  to insure that Bosnia is irrevocably split in two. **********\"We can't really expect that forces of NATO would be there at the same time as these individuals are in positions of power,\" Mr. Christopher said. **********Because a NATO force, including at least 20,000 American soldiers, is expected to go to Bosnia almost immediately after any peace agreement, this statement suggested that the Clinton Administration now wants the two men removed within weeks. This demand appeared to reflect the impact on the Administration of recent Serbian massacres of Muslims in Srebrenica and northwestern Bosnia. **********Up to now, however, President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia has only offered to work for the removal of Dr. Karadzic through elections that would take place within the next year, Western officials said. **********Thus considerable new pressure is being applied to Mr. Milosevic and it appears by no means clear that his response will be positive. The Serbian President heads a delegation that includes three senior Bosnian Serb officials. **********The aim of the American policy seems clear: open the way for Bosnia to be knitted together again by removing the men most identified with its division. But the risks are considerable, for the two men have solid bands of highly armed supporters with little to lose. **********Nicholas Burns, a State Department spokesman, said the three delegations were today handed four draft documents of an eventual peace. He said the papers included what he called \"the general peace agreement\" -- covering the overall terms of an accord -- and separate papers on the organization of elections, constitutional issues, and the separation of military and paramilitary forces. **********The documents were mainly drafted by the State Department and the team working with Mr. Holbrooke. But they were reviewed by delegations from Russia and the European Union. Other documents, on issues like economic reconstruction, are still under review. **********Apart from the highly contentious issue of territory, and particularly the status of Sarajevo, the question of elections is also a highly charged one, officials said. **********Apart from their objections to any role for Mr. Karadzic and General Mladic,  the Bosnian delegation wants the central parliament to be elected by direct, popular vote. The Serbs want its members to be appointed by the respective parliaments of the Muslim-Croat federation and the Serb republic in order to insure that ethnic balance of its members is roughly even. **********In an indication that the meeting will last at least another week, the United States Ambassador to Croatia, Peter Galbraith, and a European mediator, Thorvald Stoltenberg, were sent today to eastern Slavonia, the one remaining Serb-held area of Croatia. They are to return to Dayton in about a week. **********Mr. Tudjman and Mr. Milosevic agreed on Wednesday to work \"toward full normalization of relations\" between Croatia and Serbia, but no accord was reached on the fate of eastern Slavonia. Mr. Tudjman, who is to leave Dayton today and return next week, said recently that Croatia would take the area by force or negotiation by the end of the year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/04/world/for-american-press-in-canada-a-simpson-free-for-all-it-s-not.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Farnsworth", "pub_date": "1995-06-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 551, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "For American Press in Canada, a Simpson Free-For-All It's Not", "print_headline": "For American Press in Canada, a Simpson Free-For-All It's Not", "body_text": " **********The judge presiding over a sensational murder trial in Toronto recently warned American journalists here that they could not only be barred from his court but that they could be charged with an offense under Canada's Criminal Code if they reported prohibited testimony. **********In an American court, as millions know who watch the sparring in the murder trial of O.

The fund, which invests in Fidelity mutual funds, is an alternative to establishing a private foundation. Its investments in the equity-income and interest-income categories fell behind the mutual fund averages for their categories, while the portfolio's growth investments came out only slightly ahead. **********Robert A. Beckwitt, who runs Fidelity Asset Manager and is a member of the gift fund's investment review committee, suggested some changes when he described performance to the fund trustees last winter. **********On his suggestion, Fidelity Blue Chip Growth was replaced with Mid-Cap Stock, reducing the technology exposure and adding more midsize companies. Mr. Beckwitt also dumped Short-Term World Income in favor of Intermediate Bond to minimize interest-rate bets that had turned sour. And out went Global Balanced, hurt by emerging-markets plays; it was replaced by a combination of International Growth and Income and Dividend Growth. **********The result: a slightly better performance this year than would have been achieved with the old mix of funds. The Charitable Gift Fund has granted more than $75 million to more than 10,000 charitable organizations on behalf of its donors since its 1991 inception. A $10,000 minimum is needed to open an account. Waiving Fees On Money Funds **********Five money market funds waived all their fees in the second quarter of 1995, down from 11 in the first quarter, according to IBC/Donoghue's Quarterly Report on Money Fund Performance in Ashland, Mass. Three were funds open to individual investors: Benham Florida Municipal Money Market, Olde Premium Plus Money Market Series and Strong Money Market, which was the top-performing general-purpose fund for the quarter. **********By waiving or absorbing certain fees, funds can at least temporarily increase returns for investors and gain an edge over their competitors. The decline in waivers can probably be traced to the big rally in the bond market earlier in the year, a rally that made money fund yields more attractive without the waivers, said Walter Franke, chief economist of IBC/Donoghue Inc. **********Still, absorbing at least some expenses for a competitive edge is a thriving practice among money funds, where tiny increases in yields go a long way toward luring investors. Among taxable money funds, 57 percent waived at least part of their expenses in the second quarter, up from 55.3 percent in the corresponding period a year earlier. Among the 386 tax-free money funds, 61.7 percent waived part of their expenses, up from 60.1 percent a year earlier.

Only a few funds base directors' compensation on the amount of assets overseen. Templeton Global Opportunities Trust and the Navellier Series Fund are two that do so, according to Jeffrey C. Keil, an editor with Lipper Analytical Services, in Denver. **********The median total compensation for mutual fund directors was $41,000 in 1994, an 11 percent increase from 1993, according to the 1995 Survey of Mutual Fund Directors Compensation conducted by Fund Directions, a trade newsletter in New York, and Management Practice Inc., a management consulting firm, also in New York.

A recent Federal decision has given the independents a partial victory, granting them the right to those computer programs but setting no price for that access. **********Federal rules require that all 1996 models, some of which are now on sale, have computerized systems to detect failures in pollution control equipment. Indeed, some cars already have such systems, which include computer chips that would be used to repair any such failures at the push of a button, simply by making alterations to the computer program that controls the pollution equipment, or by reprogramming it. **********Car makers wanted to keep the software proprietary, giving dealerships a monopoly on repairs. But independent shops, which do 80 percent of all repairs, argued that the Federal Clean Air Act entitled them to the information, too. That, they argued, would create far more places for consumers to obtain the service, increasing competition and lowering the cost to consumers. **********In a recent ruling, the Environmental Protection Agency agreed that independents should have access to the information and that the car makers must provide it to them. **********The law required that consumers \"have a choice in where their vehicle is serviced,\" said Cheryl Adelman, a senior policy adviser at the E.P.A.'s motor vehicle emissions laboratory in Ann Arbor, Mich. Independent technicians, the agency said, should have access to emissions-related service and repair information because they do most car repairs. **********The agency's decision puts independent shops on \"even ground\" with dealers, said Aaron Lowe, director of legislative and regulatory affairs for the Automotive Parts and Accessories Association, a trade group in Bethesda, Md. Now \"we will be able to stay in this race,\" he said. A lot is at stake: Car repairs cost Americans $170 billion -- $75 billion for service, the rest for parts -- and that market is expected to grow even larger as systems become more sophisticated, detecting more emissions problems sooner. Further, it will be more difficult for the average do-it-yourselfer to repair these systems. **********Car makers and dealers -- who had opposed providing the information to independents, citing concerns that it would allow them to increase engine performance in a way that would violate clean-air rules -- played down the E.P.A. decision. **********\"We really don't believe they will need to do much reprogramming,\" John Trajnowski, an engineer with the Ford Motor Company, said of the independent shops, since much will be done by the dealers under warranty. **********Douglas Greenhaus, director of environment, health and safety for the National Automobile Dealers Association in McLean, Va., said, \"We're a bit concerned\" about making reprogramming equipment available to independent shops, but will \"do whatever we can\" to safeguard against tampering, he added. Still, Mr. Greenhaus said the E.P.A. had \"split the baby\" and sided with manufacturers and dealers in deciding not to set the price of the information, saying merely that they should charge a \"reasonable cost\" for providing it. **********Further, the E.P.A. did not feel it was necessary for independent parts makers to gain information from manufacturers on how to design parts compatible with the new computerized systems.

The oil rigs had belonged to a Canadian company owned by a Serbian immigrant. **********The documents were later altered to say the rigs were hydrological research equipment, destined for Macedonia, according to officials from several countries, who have seen the documents and are tracking the equipment. Western officials said similar shipments were planned if this one was successful. **********\"It is a particularly egregious example of a broader problem,\" said a Western diplomat who follows sanctions closely. **********The broader problem, officials said, is that the sanctions have developed a huge leak in the southern Balkans, and traders and the Serbs are using so many false fronts that governments are finding it hard to stem the flow. Not since engines for fighter planes were smuggled into Serbia a few years ago has a single shipment in violation of the United Nations embargo so alarmed Washington, officials say. And now the high-stakes espionage drama continues. **********Investigators are trying to keep track of the equipment, which is more than 100 trucks' worth and already in at least three countries -- and block it from reaching the Serbs, who have oilfields in the north and in a Serbian-controlled area of eastern Croatia. **********\"This is big stuff,\" a Western diplomat said. \"The most important thing you can deny to Yugoslavia is oil.\" **********With the United States having declined to send troops into the war zones of Bosnia and Croatia, sanctions against Yugoslavia are the centerpiece of Washington's Balkan policy. They are the means by which the United States hopes to persuade President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, the most powerful politician in Yugoslavia, to negotiate, end his support for the Bosnian Serbs and recognize the independence and boundaries of Croatia, Bosnia and Macedonia, all of which broke away from the old Yugoslavia. **********The case of the oil-drilling equipment is highly delicate, and officials who answered questions did so only on the condition that they, and in some cases even their countries, not be identified. **********The issue is delicate in part because about 700 tons of the equipment has already slipped through Greece and Bulgaria, and neither American nor European diplomats want to embarrass those countries' governments. In addition, Western intelligence agencies do not want the Iranians and the Serbs to learn how they found out about the shipment. **********Slobodan Popovich, who works in the foreign press section of the Yugoslav Information Ministry, said he knew nothing about the shipment. \"I doubt if anyone would,\" he said. He said that it would be a violation of the United Nations sanctions for anyone to sell such equipment to Yugoslavia, but that he did not think it would violate any law for Yugoslavia to try to buy it. **********The Iranian Embassy here declined to comment, saying it knew nothing about the matter, and the Foreign Ministry's press office in Teheran declined to answer questions. **********One of the most perplexing questions for investigators is why Iran would sell something of such military and strategic value as oil-drilling equipment to Yugoslavia, since Iran openly supports the Muslim-led Bosnian Government in its war with the Serbs. **********One Western official speculated that Iran did it simply for the money. But some Western officials have not ruled out the possibility that even Iran did not know the ultimate destination of the equipment and that it might have been diverted after leaving that country, though they said this seemed unlikely given the control the Iranian Government exercises. **********The shipping documents list the shipper of the equipment as Canadian Triton International, which is based in Calgary, Alberta. It is owned by Vladimir Katic, who Western officials said is a Serb who immigrated to Canada from Yugoslavia in 1966. **********Canadian Triton is a small oil-drilling company whose only operations are in Iran, George Duchesne, a company official, said in a telephone interview from Calgary. Mr. Duchesne, who declined to give his position in the company, confirmed that Mr. Katic was the owner and said he did not know about his background. **********Mr. Duchesne said he did not know why Canadian Triton's name was on the shipping documents. He said the company had leased the two rigs from a Yugoslav company in 1992 and had used them in Iran for one year. At the end of that time, Mr. Duchesne said, they belonged to Yugoslavia again. **********\"It's theirs,\" Mr. Duchesne said. \"Is there a problem with their bringing their own stuff home?\" **********Based on interviews with American, Western European and Balkan officials in seven countries, it is possible to piece together this outline of events: **********An Iranian ship, the Ershad, left Iran about Feb. 1, loaded with two rigs. It landed at the Greek port of Salonika about Feb. 20. The equipment, valued at $4.9 million, was consigned to a Bulgarian company. **********When the United States, through its intelligence sources, determined that the equipment was headed for Yugoslavia, it approached all governments in the region. **********One of the Security Council's sanctions resolutions -- No. 820, which was passed in April 1993 -- requires countries to detain all vessels and cargoes \"suspected\" of having been involved in violating sanctions. **********When the American intelligence was first relayed to the Greeks, they were slow to react, European and American officials said. **********A Greek Foreign ministry official who insisted on anonymity said Greece had not initially interfered with the shipment because under Greek law the Government has no right to stop a shipment in transit to a legitimate country, in this case Bulgaria, according to the shipping documents. **********Later, under constant pressure from the United States and the European Union's sanctions monitoring office in Brussels, Greece put a hold on the rest of the equipment. **********Before Greece acted, Western officials said, about 1,200 tons had already been hauled by trucks to Bulgaria. They crossed the border at Kulata, consigned to a company called Baypass, several officials said, including one who read from the shipping documents. Officials said they had not been able to locate the company. **********It was after the shipment reached Bulgaria that the documents were altered, declaring that the cargo was hydrological research equipment, Western officials said. **********American officials asked the Bulgarian Government not to allow the cargo to continue. But the Bulgarians said they could not interfere with the shipment since it was intended for Macedonia, a country against which there is no embargo. **********The Bulgarian Foreign Ministry said no one was available to answer questions about the case. The President's office said he was on a trip to North Korea and Mongolia with his spokesman and foreign affairs adviser. **********Bulgaria notified the United Nations sanctions committee this week that 60 truckloads of the equipment passed through Bulgaria into Macedonia. **********Some of it was loaded onto rail cars and was about to go to Serbia when American officials stepped in. The fully loaded rail cars sit on the tracks. **********If the United States succeeds in persuading Greece and Macedonia not to release the equipment now in their custody -- and Western officials say it is by no means certain Washington will -- the deal will have fallen through for the Serbs, because the parts that have been held up are needed for the rigs to work."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/21/business/second-breakup-t-computer-business-costly-marriage-ncr-becomes-vision-that.html": {"writer_name": "Laurence Zuckerman", "pub_date": "1995-09-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 692, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Costly Marriage to NCR Becomes a Vision That Failed", "print_headline": "THE SECOND BREAKUP OF AT&T: THE COMPUTER BUSINESS; The Costly Marriage to NCR Becomes a Vision That Failed", "body_text": " **********When AT&T finally overcame the resistance of the NCR Corporation in 1991 and paid $7.4 billion for what was the nation's fifth-largest computer company, AT&T's chairman, Robert E.

And to begin realigning the company, AT&T said 8,500 of its 304,500 workers would be terminated, including 1,000 at its Dayton, Ohio, headquarters. **********\"AT&T thought they could throw their muscle around to make NCR what it wasn't,\" said Jon Oltsik, an analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. \"They tried to diversify into everything, but they didn't have a plan.\" **********AT&T will take a $1.5 billion charge against earnings in the current quarter to account for the revamping. Not including NCR's $7.4 billion purchase price, the write-down makes a total of more than $2 billion in NCR-related charges since 1991. The division lost $332 million in the first half of this year. **********Lars Nyberg, the executive who arrived in June to turn around the troubled computer unit, said the cuts would allow the division to break even in 1996, just before it is expected to be spun off in early 1997. **********\"This company has not done what other companies have done in this industry,\" he said yesterday. \"It has not reduced expenses as gross margins have declined.\" **********Strong medicine is not new to NCR, which began life in 1882 as the National Cash Register Company in Dayton, Ohio, where it is still based. In the early 1970's, the company almost went under when its managers failed to recognize the growing importance of computers. After three-quarters of its workers were laid off, the company fought its way back to profitability and became a leader in automatic teller machines and high-end computers. **********After cutting expenses, Mr. Nyberg said, he plans to increase revenue by focusing on the unit's strengths, rather than making PC's, where the competition from lower-cost manufacturers was too formidable. **********He pointed to opportunities in the banking industry, where the pace of technical change is gathering momentum. He said that he also planned to exploit the company's lead in the area called data warehousing, in which retailers and other companies plumb huge data bases containing information about their customers to tailor marketing campaigns. **********Because of the expense of the powerful systems needed for such jobs, data warehousing has been available only to large players like Wal-Mart. But next week, Mr. Nyberg said, he would introduce a line of machines to make the practice affordable for medium-sized and even small companies. **********\"It was a niche business, but it won't be a niche business anymore,\" he said. **********The computer operation would enter the world as the smallest and weakest of the three new AT&T companies. It had $8.4 billion in revenue last year, and after the revamping it would be smaller, Mr. Nyberg acknowledged. **********Most analysts believe that it will face an uphill fight. \"Outside of their traditional banking and retail areas, they have lots of things going but none of them are leaders in their areas,\" said David Moschella, an analyst at International Data Group in Boston. \"They still can't make up their mind whether they are a product company or a service company.

Last May, his plane was allowed to stop in Hawaii to refuel, but the Administration barred him from staying overnight and meeting friends. **********Even though they excluded Mr. Lee in the past, State Department officials said they liked him, and they praised him for solidifying democracy in Taiwan. **********Republicans in Congress welcomed the decision. \"The White House had to address the realities in Congress,\" said Senator Frank Murkowski, the Alaska Republican who sponsored the resolution on Taiwan in the Senate. \"When we look at the significance of President Lee in the development of Taiwan -- they'll have free elections this year -- keeping him out was a situation that had to end, and I'm glad to see President Clinton move on it.\" **********One senior official acknowledged that the nonbinding resolution approved by Congress had forced the Administration's hand, since continuing to bar Mr. Lee would give the impression that Mr. Clinton was bowing to Chinese pressure. **********The President has sought to shake that image since last May, when he extended China's preferential trade status even though its human rights performance fell far short of what he had demanded. **********When Mr. Lake and Mr. Tarnoff met with Ambassador Li, they told the Chinese diplomat that if Mr. Clinton did not soon grant a visa to Taiwan's President, Congress might overwhelmingly adopt a binding resolution that would not only require him to do so, but would also upgrade the American relationship with Taiwan -- something that China bitterly opposes. **********\"The Taiwan issue is very important symbolically for China and we have to manage it very carefully,\" a senior State Department official said. \"There was a desire by this Administration to pre-empt new binding legislation that could hurt our relations with China.\" **********Administration officials said they had no idea whether or how China might retaliate. After President Bush announced plans in 1992 to sell F-16's to Taiwan, China protested and, many Asia experts say, retaliated by ignoring American pleas not to sell missile technology to Pakistan and nuclear technology to Iran. **********\"The Chinese aren't going to like this one bit,\" said Harry Harding, an expert on China who is dean of the Elliott School of International Affairs at George Washington University. \"It's possible, even likely, that they will take some retaliatory action. It's difficult to know what they will do, but I think when they find an issue that is more important to us than to them, they will decide not to be cooperative.\" **********Administration officials say Secretary of State Warren Christopher overruled some low-level officials when he recommended to the President last week that Mr. Lee be admitted. Several Asia experts in the State Department opposed granting Mr. Lee a visa, fearing that it would do too much damage to relations with China when Mr. Christopher's diplomatic vision is to try to maintain strong relations with the world's major powers. **********But some other advisers were recommending a visa for Mr. Lee to avoid a high-stakes showdown with Congress that the White House was likely to lose. Their fear was that Congress would adopt a binding resolution to admit Mr. Lee with enough of a majority to withstand a Presidential veto. **********\"We will be quite delighted if President Lee is able to attend the alumni reunion weekend,\" said Henrik Dullea, Cornell's vice president for university relations. \"It will be the capstone of the weekend.\" **********Cornell's President, Frank H. T. Rhodes, had urged the Administration to admit Mr. Lee, as had a petition from students, faculty and alumni. **********One factor that weighed in the decision, Administration officials said, was that China was slowly increasing economic ties and unofficial diplomatic exchanges with Taiwan even as it pressed the United States and dozens of other countries to keep contacts with Taiwan to a minimum."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/15/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-bmw-motorcycles-chooses-agencies.html": {"writer_name": "James Dunaway", "pub_date": "1995-08-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 100, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BMW Motorcycles Chooses Agencies", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; BMW Motorcycles Chooses Agencies", "body_text": " **********The BMW Motorcycles division of BMW of North America in Woodcliff Lake, N.J., has selected Fallon McElligott Berlin in New York to handle the creative portion of its account and DeWitt Media in New York to handle the media portion.

But it lies on a tense though unrecognized border between Government-controlled Croatia and the one-third of the country that has been occupied by rebel Serbs for more than three years. **********It is one of the most volatile borders in Europe, so the recent reopening of a major highway through this town is being watched with a mixture of hope and apprehension. **********Along the roadside, the ruins of villages from which the Serbs chased Croatian families three years ago are stark reminders of the brutality of the \"ethnic cleansing\" that was practiced here. A gas station near Nova Gradiska, at the other end of the Serbian-controlled portion of the road, is a twisted wreck of steel and concrete. Road signs are peppered with bullet holes. **********No one knows when the Croatian Government, which has grown increasingly frustrated by the long occupation, will launch an offensive to try to retake the Serbian-controlled region. **********Such an offensive, which could reignite the 1991 war of independence fought by Croatia against the Serbian-dominated Yugoslav Federation, seemed imminent as recently as November, when the Croatian Army canceled leaves and moved elite units toward the border. Diplomats in Zagreb, the Croatian capital, say that only intense behind-the-scenes pressure from Washington led Croatian leaders to abandon their plans for an offensive. **********Until recently, negotiations between the Croatian Government and the Serbs brought virtually no progress. The Serbs, backed by their brethren in Bosnia and in Serbia itself, have proclaimed the territory they hold to be an independent country, which they call the Republic of Serbian Krajina, and they vow never to submit to Croatian rule again. **********But after the Americans twisted Croatia's arm, and to the surprise of many people throughout the Balkans, leaders of the Croatian Government and the breakaway Krajina region reached an accord that could help normalize lives on both sides of their disputed border. **********Under the accord, water and electricity lines that have been cut since 1991 are to be restored and work is to begin on repairing an oil pipeline that runs from the Croatian port of Rijeka through the Krajina region and on toward Hungary, the Ukraine and Russia. In addition, the accord provided for reopening what was once Yugoslavia's most important road, the one connecting what were its two largest cities, Zagreb and Belgrade. **********The road used to be called the Brotherhood and Unity Highway, but in recent years it has come to represent the gulf of hatred that divides Serbs and Croats. There was heavy fighting along the road during the 1991 Serb revolt, and each day that it remained closed made the prospect of peace seem dimmer. **********When the road reopened on Dec. 23, only a few carloads of journalists and a handful of trucks carrying worried refugees ventured to test the good will of the Serbs who continue to guard it. But traffic has grown steadily, and now more than 2,000 vehicles are using it each day. **********A ride along the 16-mile stretch that runs through Krajina is still very unlike a ride on a normal road. Signs at Novska and Nova Gradiska, the towns on either end of the stretch, still proclaim \"Republic of Serbian Krajina,\" and Serbian flags adorn checkpoints along the way. White armored personnel carriers carrying United Nations peacekeepers look down from bridges and guard exits to make sure that travelers do not leave the road and venture into other parts of Krajina that are still strictly off limits to outsiders. **********Many of the Serbs who patrol the road are evidently unhappy to see it open. **********\"We have asked them repeatedly to take their flags down,\" said Capt. Kamal Pokhrel, a Nepalese officer who is among the United Nations soldiers assigned to watch the road. \"They say, 'Why should we? This is our land.' \" **********The question of whose land this really is remains to be settled. Croatians consider it theirs, and most of the outside world agrees. But Serbs vow never to return it. **********An agreement to resolve this conflict, if it can be reached at all, is months or years away. In the meantime, diplomats say the accord that reopened the road is the most important step taken so far to defuse the conflict. **********The significance of the agreement was underlined a few days ago when President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia drove through. \"The opening of this highway is just a first step toward the liberation of the entire region,\" Mr. Tudjman promised a throng of supporters in Slavonski Brod. **********When a representative of Croatian refugees who lost their homes in Krajina suggested that opening the highway seemed to imply recognition of Serbian authority in the region, Mr. Tudjman replied, \"A peaceful solution should give you more chance of returning to your homes than a new war.\" **********Many leading Croatian politicians and military officers, however, remain impatient with the Serbian presence, and warn that they will not wait indefinitely for a negotiated solution. **********\"If Serbian forces from the so-called Krajina shoot or kill any Croatian citizen on this highway, don't expect us to complain to Boutros-Ghali,\" the Croatian Chief of Staff, Gen. Janko Bobetko, asserted Friday, referring to the United Nations Secretary General. **********\"We will consider it an act of war and we will strike immediately, without warning.

The bond rally helped the dollar against the German mark and the Japanese yen in currency trading.  [ Page 34 ] . Stock traders, however, worried that such a slowdown could hurt corporate earnings, and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 16.26 points.  [ Page 39. ] **********Bond prices surged after the Labor Department reported that the nation's unemployment rate jumped three-tenths of a point, to 5.8 percent, in April and that the number of new jobs fell for the first time in more than two years. The data followed a string of reports, including the Commerce Department's index of leading indicators on Wednesday, all pointing to the slowdown sought by bond investors and generating the biggest weekly rally in the market since June 1989. **********\"Each new piece of data causes bond investors who have been holding out on the sidelines to one by one throw in the waiting towel and buy bonds for fear of missing an opportunity,\" said Kevin McClintock, manager of fixed-income portfolios at Aeltus Investment Management. **********The price of the 30-year bond jumped 126/32 , to a 10717/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 7.02 percent, from 7.16 percent on Thursday. The 7.02 percent was the lowest since March 28, 1994, when the yield was 6.97 percent. **********It was the sharpest drop in the long bond's yield since Feb. 3, when it fell to 7.61 percent from 7.76 percent two days after the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates for the seventh time in 12 months, according to CS First Boston. **********For the week, the yield fell 32 basis points, reflecting the biggest bond market rally since June 1989, when the yield dropped 33 basis points, to 8.15 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. **********While the employment report and other economic data have clearly pointed to a slowdown, there have been concerns that the economy may slip into a recession and the Federal Reserve will have to reverse its course on interest rates. But a continued drop in interest rates could help stabilize a slowing economy, providing easier credit for businesses and home buyers. **********Still, there are a number of traders and analysts who saw yesterday's gains as an overreaction. The market's bubble, they said, could easily burst next week when traders face a new supply of notes and data on consumer and producer prices. **********And the significance of the employment report may have been overstated, they said. **********\"The economy is not slowing as rapidly as this report implies,\" said Donald Fine, the chief market analyst for Chase Securities. \"When all is said and done, the economy is clearly slowing, but the degree of slowing is still uncertain, particularly when looking ahead to the second half of the year. **********\"You can't tell anything from this report; the only hard evidence that can be gathered from this report is that the manufacturing sector was weak in April. All other aspects of the report are open to interpretation.\" **********Christopher A. Low, senior economist for the HSBC Group, said a number of factors made the data uncertain -- in particular, a shorter duration between Labor Department surveys. **********\"But I think the report was so much weaker than expected, that it does look like a slowdown going into the second quarter,\" Mr. Low said, \"and that is what I believe the market is rallying to.\" **********Mr. McClintock of Aeltus Investment Management and other market participants said they thought the market was getting ahead of itself, particularly in short-term Treasury securities. With two-year Treasury notes yielding 6.12 percent, compared with a Federal funds rate of 6 percent, the market has priced in a cut in interest rates by the Fed, Mr. McClintock said. **********\"Quite frankly, I don't see that easing happening,\" he said. \"A more neutral spread between the two-year and funds rate would be about 80 to 120 basis points. If you polled the market today, most will tell you that they do not expect the Fed to raise interest rates at its next meeting on May 23.\" **********In the short term, he said, the market should continue to rally, provided that new economic data show weakness. **********Jay Goldinger of Capital Insight in Beverly Hills, Calif., said that despite the employment data, the economy was still growing. **********\"Everyone feared inflation, but none have seen it,\" Mr. Goldinger said. \"The so-called get-me-in people are buying bonds like it is some sort of commodity that is in short supply.

As foreign dignitaries arrived here today, city officials were at a groundbreaking ceremony for a new museum on the site of the former Gestapo headquarters. **********\"We cannot be permitted to suppress and forget the horrors of the Nazis, the nadir of German history,\" Mayor Eberhard Diepgen said at the ceremony. \"All Germans, even those born after the war, share responsibility.\" **********It is this burden, deeply felt by many Germans, that made today a somber occasion rather than a time to rejoice at what President Francois Mitterrand of France called \"the spirit of peace\" that Germany and its former enemies now share. **********The approach of today's anniversary has led many older Germans to recall their generation's suffering. In speeches and articles, they have been reminding the country that the end of the war led to the expulsion of more than 10 million ethnic Germans from their homes in Poland, Czechoslovakia and other parts of Central Europe. **********According to a poll published today in the magazine Der Spiegel, 40 percent of Germans over the age of 65 believe that the expulsions were as serious a crime against humanity as the Holocaust, in which six million Jews were killed. But when public figures compare the two events, they face sharp rebuke, as Chancellor Helmut Kohl did over the weekend. **********In a statement Saturday, Mr. Kohl expressed compassion for three groups of World War II victims: concentration camp survivors, combat veterans and Germans who were expelled from their homelands. His remarks sparked immediate protest in Germany and abroad. Sir Teddy Taylor, a member of the British Parliament, called them \"insensitive and likely to cause outrage.\" **********\"There is a world of difference,\" he said, \"between people suffering because they have initiated a war and people suffering because of a mad and evil philosophy of ethnic cleansing.\" **********Although such debates still strike delicate nerves among older Europeans, many of their children find them less meaningful. Younger Germans often say they have difficulty connecting their lives to the evil that was crushed 50 years ago today. **********\"I can understand the Middle Ages better than I can understand what led my parents' generation to welcome Hitler with those ridiculous salutes and then be so cowardly as to avert their eyes from Nazi crimes,\" said Antje Vollmer, a leader of the Green Party who was born in 1943. **********All the visiting foreign leaders made clear that they hold no grudge against the country whose dictatorship inflicted so much suffering on their peoples between 1933 and 1945. **********Mr. Mitterrand, in an unusually personal speech on the eve of his departure from office, called the 50 years of peace among Europe's powers \"the triumph of life\" and \"a victory of Europe over itself.\" **********Vice President Al Gore praised the \"profoundly new relationship between victor and vanquished\" that now binds Germany to its neighbors, and said the United States hopes to see \"an ever-expanding circle of democracy\" in Europe and beyond.  Mr. Gore represented the United States at ceremonies in London, Paris and Berlin; President Clinton is to assume that role in Moscow on Tuesday. **********Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the Russian Prime Minister, asserted that his country joins the other World War II combatants in accepting \"a special responsibility to prevent this horrible past from ever recurring.\" He also warned against the erection of \"new barriers\" in Europe and urged \"the construction of a genuine pan-European system of security and stability on a bloc-free basis,\" evidently a reference to Russian opposition to the planned eastward expansion of NATO. **********\"None of us have found it easy to shed the memory of the 'Iron Curtain' and the Berlin wall and to begin trusting each other,\" Mr. Chernomyrdin said. \"We are all taking our first steps in this new direction, and we need to be extremely circumspect and careful not to upset the structure upon which the current peace in Europe is based.\" **********President Roman Herzog of Germany, however, described Western Europe as \"an island of peace, freedom and prosperity,\" and said: \"The island must be made larger.  No one should feel threatened by such a policy.\" **********Mr. Herzog also expressed Germany's \"sense of collective shame\" for the crimes of the Nazis. \"The Germans today know full well, perhaps more clearly than 50 years ago, that it was their Government of that time and many of their fathers who were responsible for the Holocaust and who brought ruin down upon Europe,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/02/world/christopher-and-chinese-official-fail-to-settle-differences.html": {"writer_name": "David Sanger", "pub_date": "1995-08-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1091, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Christopher and Chinese Official Fail to Settle Differences", "print_headline": "Christopher and Chinese Official Fail to Settle Differences", "body_text": " **********Secretary of State Warren Christopher and his Chinese counterpart met here tonight in an effort to repair the biggest breach in relations since China's violent suppression of the democracy movement six years ago. **********Despite an exchange that both sides agreed to characterize as \"frank and useful,\" they made no progress on the two major issues dividing Washington and Beijing. **********After a 90-minute session, the Chinese Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen, emerged clearly dissatisfied that the United States refused to guarantee that it would never again issue a visa to a top official of the Taiwan Government, as it did in June for Lee Teng-hui, Taiwan's President. **********And Mr. Qian said the fate of Harry Wu, an American citizen being held on charges of stealing state secrets, was in the hands of the Chinese judicial authorities. He suggested that the Foreign Ministry could not intervene to release Mr. Wu, a step that Washington has made clear is a prerequisite to improving relations. **********Nonetheless, Mr. Christopher's aides insisted that the tone and body language of the meeting suggested that relations with China were finally emerging from what one senior Administration official termed \"the deep freeze.\" **********They noted that Mr. Christopher and Mr. Qian had agreed to instruct their deputies to continue talks in coming weeks, a step the Chinese had refused to take until today. And they said the two men had even talked, in vague terms, about the goal of arranging a summit meeting in October between President Clinton and President Jiang Zemin. **********Mr. Christopher was clearly eager tonight not to rile China further but fearful of fueling Congressional criticism that the Administration is coddling China's leadership at a time of continued human rights violations and suspected sales of missile technology to Iran and Pakistan. **********In a stark illustration of Mr. Christopher's balancing act, he stopped short of telling Mr. Qian directly what he said to reporters on Monday: that it would be \"difficult to imagine\" a summit meeting while Mr. Wu was still incarcerated. **********Administration officials who described the private exchange on the issue suggested that the Secretary was simply choosing his words diplomatically, and that that message was implicit in Mr. Christopher's statement to Mr. Qian that a \"more constructive environment\" was needed before any summit meeting could take place. **********\"The Chinese know where we are on this,\" one official said. \"They read the newspapers. We have to give it some time to sink in.\" **********Mr. Qian, while smiling and at one point joking with Mr. Christopher in front of the cameras, made clear in public and private that Beijing was intently focused on one issue: its fear that the Administration's decision to let Mr. Lee into the country indicated a change in policy toward Taiwan, despite Mr. Christopher's repeated statements to the contrary. **********Mr. Qian also made clear that he considered the issuing of the visa to be a violation of past assurances about Washington's adherence to the policy of recognizing \"one China,\" with Beijing as the sole legitimate Government. **********\"As an old Chinese saying goes,\" Mr. Qian told reporters in Mr. Christopher's presence, \"Words must count and deeds must yield results. Words have value only when they are honored in deeds.\" Mr. Qian, officials said, repeated that statement almost verbatim when the private meeting began. **********\"Some of the things he was saying were pretty tough,\" one official said. **********But Mr. Qian apparently spoke without any trace of the rancor that has characterized the public exchanges between Washington and Beijing for two months. That has led many American experts to speculate that both sides are fearful of overstepping the bounds. **********Mr. Qian repeatedly referred to a speech Mr. Christopher had given in Washington on Friday that offered detailed assurances that America's position toward China -- and its view of Taiwan -- had not changed, and describing China's economic and political importance to the United States. **********The question remaining after today's meeting is whether domestic politics in the two countries will stop driving them further apart. **********Congress seems eager to embrace Taiwan's emerging democracy and to embarrass the Administration, as it did last week when the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, invited Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek, the widow of the leader who established the Government on Taiwan after being driven from the Chinese mainland, to a Capitol Hill reception. **********At the same time, China's leadership rarely turns down a chance these days to voice suspicion that Washington is out to contain Chinese power. **********At one point in the talks tonight, held after an all-day session of foreign ministers from Southeast Asia and their major trading and security partners, Mr. Christopher seemed to acknowledge to Mr. Qian that the Administration was not fully in control of China policy -- and that Congress could not be ignored. Mr. Clinton was forced to issue the visa to Mr. Lee, a step the Administration opposed, after a nearly unanimous vote in Congress. **********The White House feared that failing to act might only tempt Congress to tinker with the Taiwan Relations Act, which limits Washington's interaction with Taiwan to \"unofficial\" contacts. **********Mr. Christopher also directly addressed China's fundamental fears about America's intentions. \"He said we want to engage you and not contain or isolate you,\" one Administration official said. **********But Mr. Christopher also made it clear to Mr. Qian that political conditions could force the issuing of further visas, and that some influential Americans outside the Administration clearly believed that containment would be a better policy. **********\"They were clearly not satisfied that the U.S. could not give a better answer,\" one Administration official said of the Chinese. **********Two planned trips to China by American Cabinet members, one by Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, the other by Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, were not discussed, though presumably those trade missions are possible tools to rebuild relations in coming months. **********Nor was there discussion, officials said, of whether Hillary Rodham Clinton would attend a conference in Beijing next month on the status of women.

But Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's finance minister, has had a hard time trying to convince investors and creditors that his nation is really different. **********Since Mexico surprised the financial markets in December by devaluing the peso, the ripple effect has been felt throughout Latin America -- and nowhere more so than in Argentina. The country's once-vibrant economy is threatened by recession as credit dries up, foreign investors take flight and Argentines pull their money out of banks. **********Until a rebound on Friday, fueled largely by the announcement of Mexico's austerity plan, Argentine stocks dropped roughly 38 percent since the Mexican devaluation on Dec. 20. Additionally, an estimated $3 billion of deposits has been withdrawn from Argentine banks. Recently, four banks were forced to close for lack of funds, and the Government has cobbled together emergency support for other endangered banks, hoping to prevent a collapse. **********Mr. Cavallo said last week that his Government would seek another $2 billion from the International Monetary Fund. The new request comes just a week after Argentina said it needed $420 million from the I.M.F. to supply funds to its strapped banks. After Mexico, it does seem as though the next currency ripe for devaluation is Argentina's peso. **********On numerous trips to the United States and Europe this year, Mr. Cavallo has tried to assure investors and bankers with two messages: Argentina is on more solid economic footing than Mexico, and there is more discipline in his country's exchange-rate system, which should blunt speculation. **********In the last four years, Argentina's growth rate -- roughly 7 percent annually -- has been far higher than Mexico's. Argentina's current-account deficit, though rising, is proportionately far less than that of Mexico, which reached 7.6 percent of gross domestic product last year. And inflation in Argentina, once a textbook case of hyperinflation, has dropped to less than 5 percent. **********Much of the improvement here dates from April 1991, when the Argentine Congress passed the \"Convertibility Act,\" which pegs the peso tightly to the dollar at a one-to-one ratio. Under the convertibility plan, every Argentine peso in circulation is backed by a dollar reserve in the central bank. Mexico had no such fixed system. **********In a recent interview with Telem, a local news agency, Mr. Cavallo blamed speculators for growing hysteria and pressure on Argentina to devalue. He insisted that no Argentine economy indicator justified the steady losses on the stock market. **********\"The economic signs are very positive, and I hope market operators in Argentina as well as abroad will see this and will reverse the climate of panic or terror that is being installed here,\" Mr. Cavallo said. **********The first signs of a squeeze on Argentina's economy appeared early last year when interest rates in the United States and Europe began rising. That made Western investors more likely to keep money in their home markets, slowing the inflow of foreign capital to Argentina and other developing nations. But Argentina was hit hard when the Mexican financial crisis prompted many foreign fund managers and investors to pull out of Latin America. The decline in foreign investment is expected to stunt economic growth in Argentina and reduce tax revenue, raising questions about whether the country can meet its debt payments. **********In an interview last week, Mr. Cavallo insisted that Argentina's debt payments of $5.2 billion would be made on time this year and that the funds had already been allocated. \"Any statements saying that we are not going to meet payments are false,\" Mr. Cavallo said. **********Asked if a recession might arise from the lack of liquidity, Mr. Cavallo said that there would be \"a decrease in production\" in 1995 but \"not a strong recession.\" **********Economists now predict that with the loss of foreign investment and the credit crunch, Argentina will post no growth this year and may even shrink slightly, compared with earlier forecasts of as much as 6 percent growth. **********The real threat in Argentina, economists say, is less of capital flight in the traditional sense than an old-fashioned run on the banks. Argentina's convertibility system is intended to make conventional currency speculation pointless. **********But bank withdrawals are running so high because depositors -- both Argentines and some foreigners -- are afraid that the banking system could collapse. Local bankers here report that many Argentines are withdrawing dollars from their savings accounts and placing them in safety deposit boxes or under mattresses at home. **********In the past, Argentina relied on foreign investments to balance its trade accounts, paying for its imports and other obligations from abroad. Yet with foreign investment declining, Argentina has been forced to adopt an austerity package to avoid what Mr. Cavallo has called \"the unthinkable -- devaluation.\" **********The Finance Minister announced the austerity program two weeks ago. The main elements are $1 billion in budget cuts and a drive to generate another $2.5 billion in revenue by eliminating tax deductions and cracking down on tax evaders. The measures are intended to help close a projected budget deficit of $4.5 billion this year. **********Most economists and financial analysts here believe that Mr. Cavallo will stand by his word and not devalue the peso, despite the growing pressure on the currency. Were Mr. Cavallo forced to reconsider, a devaluation would require approval of Argentina's Congress. Any devaluation, analysts say, would certainly not occur before the Presidential elections in May. **********Most economists and analysts believe that the inherent strength of Argentina's economy should make it possible for Mr. Cavallo to avoid a devaluation. But the skittishness of depositors and investors, both at home and abroad, after the Mexican collapse could make it all the harder to stay on course. And the jump of nearly 13 percent in the Argentine stock market on Friday shows, for better or worse, how much investors still link Argentina's fortunes to those of Mexico. **********\"It's been a long, difficult haul trying to persuade people that things are stable and Argentina is different from Mexico,\" said Christopher Eccelstone, an analyst for Interacciones, a brokerage firm here. \"What's happening is that everybody got it wrong on Mexico and they are trying to make sure that they don't get it wrong again on Argentina.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/18/world/us-utilities-helping-czechs-to-curb-greenhouse-gases-and-air-pollutants.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Kinzer", "pub_date": "1995-09-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 969, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Utilities Helping Czechs to Curb Greenhouse Gases and Air Pollutants", "print_headline": "U.S. Utilities Helping Czechs to Curb Greenhouse Gases and Air Pollutants", "body_text": " **********Here in the heart of one of Europe's most polluted regions, three American utility companies are embarking on a project that environmentalists hope will show the world a new way to reduce the greenhouses gases that are believed to be altering the world's climate. **********The utilities are to break ground on Monday for a gas-fired power plant to replace a coal-burning plant that has been spewing heat-trapping gases and poisons into the air since it was built in 1980. **********The plant, which will supply heat and hot water to apartments housing about 4,000 people and contribute a small amount of electricity to the local grid, is minuscule by world standards. But scattered across Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union are about 80,000 dirty power plants like the one here, and if this experiment is successful, it is likely to be copied. **********\"This is the first project of its kind in the world,\" the United States Energy Secretary, Hazel O'Leary, said at a news conference in Prague. \"It's the model. You need one or two successes, and then others will come.\" **********The project is one of the first concrete results of decisions made at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro and a follow-up meeting in Berlin this year. **********At the Berlin meeting, most of the world's countries accepted a new concept called \"joint implementation,\" under which governments and companies can receive credit toward their domestic pollution reduction targets by sponsoring projects abroad. **********\"Greenhouse gases don't respect political boundaries,\" said Roger Dower of the World Resources Institute, an environmental group that will serve as an independent monitor to try to insure that projected reductions in pollution here are achieved. \"We're moving into a new era where we not only understand the importance of this issue, but we're also coming up with some creative and promising solutions.\" **********The announcement of the project came after mounting evidence that global warming is continuing and that pollution is part of the reason. **********Under the accord signed in Rio, industrial nations are seeking to lower their levels of greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2000. **********American officials have concluded that the United States will fall short of that goal, but they have embraced the idea of \"joint implementation\" as a strategy that could have even greater effect. **********The United States has not yet enacted a law allowing utilities to count their pollution reductions abroad against reductions they would otherwise be expected to achieve at home. But many utility executives predict that such a law may be enacted in the years ahead, and are seeking experience in ways to cut emissions abroad. **********And American utilities are actively seeking markets in the developing world, from which almost all of the future increase in demand for electric power is likely to come. **********The utilities behind the Decin project -- Wisconsin Electric Power Company, a unit of the Wisconsin Energy Corporation; Nipsco Industries of Indiana, and Commonwealth Edison of Illinois, a unit of the Unicom Corporation -- are hoping that their work here will position them for future contracts in the Czech Republic and elsewhere if emissions of pollutants and of gases like carbon dioxide are restricted. **********Decin, a town of 55,000 in northern Bohemia, is in the heart of the \"black triangle,\" a highly polluted region that includes corners of Poland and the former East Germany as well as the Czech Republic. The incidence of respiratory ailments and malignant tumors in Decin is more than 50 percent higher than in the rest of the Czech Republic, and diseases during pregnancy are four times as frequent. **********\"These levels would have to qualify us as an environmental disaster area,\" said Milan Kunc, 29, the Mayor of Decin, who has been a driving force behind the project. \"We now see the possibility of confronting this problem, and at the same time contributing to the global environment.\" **********The new 10.6-megawatt plant in Decin is to cost $7 million to build. The Czech Government is paying most of the cost, with the American utilities putting up $600,000 and the Danish Government contributing a similar sum. **********Gas will come from Russia, through a 10-mile spur that will be built off a pipeline that runs nearby. When it comes on line next September, the new plant will emit 31 percent less greenhouse gas than the old one, Secretary O'Leary said. She said there would also be a 90 percent drop in sulfur dioxide emissions and complete elimination of particulate and coal ash emissions. **********At the old plant, which is still running, mountains of soft lignite coal are piled outside. The coal is carried by a conveyer belt into a blazing furnace. Outside, the air is pungent and faintly nauseating. **********This is one of four such plants in Decin, all of which are to be replaced by gas-fired plants by 2000. **********\"Conditions here have gotten a little better since 1990, but we still don't have any healthy children here,\" said Josef Charouzd, the plant manager. **********\"Before 1990, parents didn't allow their children to play outside at all between November and March, because the air was so bad,\" Mr. Charouzd said. \"Both of my own kids have serious asthma. They cough and have seizures. But with the new plant being built, I think we can hope that their children will live in a much cleaner environment. **********\"There's only one bad aspect of this project.

With more than 4,000 human genetic diseases and many more in which genetic predisposition plays a role, acquiring genetic information has enormous potential for developing new diagnostic tests and drugs. **********Under the agreement, Chiron has obtained an exclusive worldwide license to the technology, with the right to sublicense and commercialize resulting products, in exchange for an initial payment of $5 million and potential royalty and milestone payments to the university. **********Ciba is making an initial payment of an undisclosed size and has been granted a sublicense by Chiron to use the technology for research purposes. **********Coming a week after Ciba said it would invest up to $60 million in Myriad Genetics Inc. of Salt Lake City, this agreement is further indication that the Swiss company intends to take a leading role in genomics, the effort to find and spell out every human gene, with the purpose of identifying new targets for medical treatment. **********Optical mapping involves selective cutting of DNA and gene sequences into defined lengths to create a pattern that helps characterize genomes and identify individual genes. The technology, invented by David Schwartz, a professor of chemistry at New York University, makes it possible to construct gene maps quickly and to discover new genetic sequences for use as targets in developing novel drugs, vaccines and diagnostic products. **********Chiron shares closed yesterday at $52.25, up 50 cents, in Nasdaq trading. In November, Ciba acquired a 49.9 percent stake in Chiron, a leading biotechnology company based in Emeryville, Calif. Analysts said the agreement with New York University should be regarded as a long-term investment that could provide new leads for Chiron's diagnostics business within a few years. **********The N.Y.U. technology \"is really fabulous stuff,\" said Paul Boni, an analyst with Mehta & Isaly. The direct method of mapping genes is potentially much faster than the indirect methods now used, he said, and \"if the technology can be extended to sequencing, then you would have something really revolutionary. But there are several tough steps in between.\" **********Mickey Urdea, Chiron's vice president of research and development, said the technology would speed the company's discovery of new drugs and diagnostic targets. In addition, Chiron will sell the instruments and reagents needed for the process to others. \"We see this as a means to screen a series of interesting molecules simultaneously,\" he said. **********Genome mapping is currently done by pouring large quantities of DNA onto gels that are then exposed to an electromagnetic field. The process is slow, costly and hard to automate. Professor Schwartz's technique can be applied to single DNA molecules, without gels, using readily available enzymes and dies to delineate particular gene sequences. Because of its lower cost and higher speed, the process should facilitate mapping of whole individual genomes for large segments of the population. **********Professor Schwartz said he expected to begin mapping individual genomes within a year. \"Optical-mapping technology is a powerful platform for ultrarapid, high-resolution, whole-genome analysis that will find application in virtually every branch of biological science,\" he said. \"This is actually very complementary to any of the efforts to sequence human genes.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/21/business/international-business-yankees-phone-home-gte-role-venezuela-warning.html": {"writer_name": "James Brooke", "pub_date": "1995-06-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1397, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Yankees, Phone Home!; GTE Role in Venezuela Is Warning on Privatization", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Yankees, Phone Home!; GTE Role in Venezuela Is Warning on Privatization", "body_text": " **********In the three years since Venezuela's creaky state telephone company was privatized, the new American managers have increased the number of lines by 50 percent, doubled international circuits and quadrupled the number of working pay phones. **********So, Venezuelans have been heaping praise and honor on the country's largest single foreign investment, right? **********Not exactly. In the same three years, Bruce E. Haddad, president of a consortium led by the GTE Corporation of the United States that runs Venezuela's Cantv phone company, has been arrested once, called to testify before congressional committees 23 times and has faced marches by union workers chanting \"Gringos out of Cantv.\" Last year, Government bureaucrats suddenly refused to allow his company to buy dollars, forcing it to default on millions of dollars in overseas loans. **********Through it all, Mr. Haddad -- who is also president of Cantv -- has remained upbeat. \"You have to take a long-term view, you have to expect ups and downs,\" said the 41-year-old Florida native and longtime executive of GTE's telephone company in the Dominican Republic. **********Venezuela has one of Latin America's rockiest economic environments, but GTE's experience here serves as a warning to American business about the hazards of operating in a region that is starting to open politically sensitive public utilities to foreign investment. **********From Mexico to Brazil to Argentina, Latin American countries are seeking foreign investors to run former government monopolies like power generation and telecommunications. As American companies take up the task, they are sometimes encountering echoes of the nationalist passions that led to widespread seizures of foreign-owned utilities in the 1960's and 1970's. **********And with Venezuela's economy heading for the worst performance in Latin America for the second year running, Yankee capitalists have become a convenient scapegoat for a left-wing Government that is widely blamed for economic mismanagement. **********At the very least, as GTE has discovered, running a public utility with 2.3 million subscribers can be vastly more complicated, and certainly more politically sensitive, than building cars or selling soap. **********Venworld, the GTE-led consortium, paid $1.9 billion for a 35-year-controlling concession of Venezuela's telephone company in 1991. The president at the time, Carlos Andres Perez, was a free-market advocate who welcomed the foreign involvement. **********Since then, Venezuela has gone through two coup attempts, four changes of government and seven communications ministers. Rafael Caldera, Venezuela's current president, often follows policies at odds with those of Mr. Perez, his lifelong political rival. **********\"There are still people in Congress debating whether Cantv should have been privatized to begin with,\" said Joseph A. Mann, editor of Political Impact, a newsletter here. \"The Government should go out of its way to help Cantv. But I think that Caldera firmly believes that the company should be in the hands of the Government.\" **********Last year, without a political godfather, Cantv repeatedly became embroiled in conflicts with Mr. Caldera's new administration. After the Government imposed exchange controls one year ago, the company found itself far down a long list of businesses seeking to buy dollars. **********\"While 98 percent of our revenues were in local currency, 95 percent of our debt payments were dollar-denominated,\" Mr. Haddad recalled. **********With leftists initially controlling the Government currency board, which must approve foreign-exchange transactions, the American-controlled telephone company was promptly cut off from access to dollars. **********\"I granted two hours of my time to listen to the petition of the president and vice president of the company,\" Ivan Pulido Mora, then board coordinator, petulantly told reporters last August in response to questions about Cantv's foreign-exchange requests. **********Although telecommunications has been a rare growth sector of Venezuela's troubled economy, the foreign-exchange problem took almost a year to resolve. In May, the company renegotiated its debt to 40 foreign banks, winning a Government guarantee of near-automatic access to dollars to service the debt. **********The disruptions -- and Venezuela's general economic slump -- caused Cantv to slash its capital investment plan by 40 percent, to $408 million this year. Even with this reduction, Cantv investments will total $2.4 billion for the first four years of private operation, 10 times the $239 million invested during the last three years of public ownership. In addition to GTE, Cantv's controlling consortium of private investors includes AT&T, Telefonica de Espana, Banco Mercantil and Electricidad de Caracas. **********Relations with the Government took another nasty turn last August when Cantv briefly cut off 80 percent of Government ministry telephone lines for nonpayment of Government telephone bills totaling $100 million. Since then, the unpaid debt has stopped growing, partly because officials allowed Cantv to install pay phones in Government buildings for public employees to make personal calls, cutting down on the monthly bills. **********\"We now have people in Government that we can deal with,\" Mr. Haddad said, noting that the Government now routinely approves requests for dollars and for rate increases based on inflation. \"This is not some financial play -- this is a long-term commitment.\" **********In addition to sometimes hostile politicians, the American managers have had to cope with a xenophobic labor unions. From the outset, union leaders opposed privatization, to the extent of trying to disrupt the ceremony granting the foreign investors the telephone concession in 1991. Led by the Radical Cause Party, the unions have also tried to block GTE's merit-based management system, preferring the political criteria that prevailed in the old state-company days. **********\"The Cantv multinationals raise rates and oppress workers,\" read one union poster showing a malevolent Uncle Sam figure pointing a pistol at passersby. **********Despite the union problems, Cantv managed to negotiate a favorable deal. Two weeks ago, after seven months of negotiations, the company signed a new general contract giving it greater flexibility in setting hours and shifts and in defining the duties of the company's 12,000 unionized employees. **********Last week, Venworld announced that Gustavo Roosen, a Venezuelan businessman with close links to the Caldera administration, would become Cantv's chairman. At the end of June, Mr. Haddad is to move to Irving, Tex., to work as international vice president for GTE Telephone Operations, the GTE subsidiary that oversees the Venezuela operation. He will continue as president of Cantv. **********While Venezuela's Government and unions often have treated the American company managers roughly, Venezuela's public is increasingly pleased with the service they provide. With the average wait for a dial tone down to three seconds, customer satisfaction has hit about 80 percent, up from around 30 percent before privatization, Cantv surveys show. **********Beyond political issues, Cantv's management has had to cope with Venezuela's roller-coaster economy. **********After booming in the early 1990's, Venezuela recorded South America's worst economic performance in 1994.

Yeltsin, whose visibly declining health has long provoked speculation here, was rushed to the hospital today with what his press service described as \"acute\" heart pains. **********Within hours the Kremlin began issuing statements saying that the 64-year-old President was \"fully in control,\" that he would continue with his work while in the hospital, and that his pains had subsided. **********Doctors said Mr. Yeltsin had had an attack of ischemia, which means that the heart is not getting all the oxygenated blood it needs. Caused by an accumulation of plaque blocking a coronary artery, it can be a relatively minor affliction or it can be the first step in a severe heart attack. A large number of Americans suffer from coronary blockage but may not have symptoms, and a smaller number experience pain from ischemia resulting from the blockage. **********\"Judging by the first data from Boris Yeltsin's examination, nothing serious has happened to him,\" said the presidential spokesman, Sergei K. Medvedev, who did not make the data public. \"He continues to fulfill his constitutional duties.\" **********In a statement released in Moscow tonight, Mr. Medvedev said: \"The patient is active. He gets up from his bed. There have been no recurrences of pain in recent hours.\" **********The feverishness with which the Presidential Press Service put out the word that Mr. Yeltsin suffered no serious damage was highly unusual. Normally -- and this has been particularly true with Mr. Yeltsin's health problems over the years -- the public is told little about the illnesses of Russian leaders. **********Many politicians -- including Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, who would carry out Mr. Yeltsin's duties if the need arose, and Ivan P. Rybkin, the Speaker of Parliament -- emphasized the minor nature of Mr. Yeltsin's ailment today. And there was no reason to doubt them. The President signed official documents during the day, according to his press spokesman, and he has no plans to cancel a scheduled trip to the Russian Far North and to Norway next week. **********But at 64, there can be few more obvious candidates for a heart attack than Mr. Yeltsin. He has already lived five years longer than the average Russian man, he has high blood pressure and is overweight, and his job is among the most stressful in the world. Although he tries to play tennis as often as possible, he rarely plays for long, and his face shows the wear of the years during which he has led the country. **********Mr. Yeltsin has been seen stumbling frequently in the last year, and many published reports refer to his heavy drinking. Unlike many Russians, however, he does not smoke. **********\"He has all the classic signs that would point to heart disease,\" said Dr. George Goy, an American doctor based here at the clinic recently opened by Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. \"It's going to slow him down. And if he doesn't slow down, he could be in for trouble.\" **********Mr. Yeltsin's health problems are inevitably linked to his political leadership of the nation. He is by far the most important politician in Russia, but he has never been less popular. The bitter war for Chechnya has largely been attributed to him, a recent no-confidence vote in Parliament was essentially seen as a message to the President, and he now rarely appears in public or on television. **********When the war began in December, Mr. Yeltsin was hospitalized for an undisclosed problem with his nose. He appeared in public only once during the first few weeks after he sent 40,000 troops into the secessionist republic. Any serious physical setback for Mr. Yeltsin now would have a significant impact on Russian politics and the reform program.

Two weeks ago, the team bid for the Air Force contract to design launchers that would be the core of the nation's unmanned rocket fleet starting early in the next century. **********The Air Force program is the first big effort to develop a family of launching vehicles to replace the current fleet of Atlas, Titan and Delta rockets, whose design was largely based on 1950's technology. The program comes as once-nationalistic space programs, with jealously guarded technological secrets, give way to international consortiums engaged in global technology transfers. **********The bid is a big development in the highly competitive and strategically important rocket launching business, and it gives Arianespace a shot at a market that is currently dominated by its archrival, the Lockheed Martin Corporation. **********The United States has maintained a strict policy of launching military and other Government payloads on American rockets only, shutting out Arianespace as well as Russian and Chinese launchers. But with the new program, Washington has effectively opened the door to more extensive foreign participation, allowing a group like Arianespace to contribute a significant amount of the rocket's components. **********Before this development, Lockheed Martin, which makes the Atlas and Titan rockets, was given the bulk of United States Government business. That steady stream of work helped Lockheed Martin remain competitive as the European consortium grew to dominate the commercial-launching business, primarily handling telecommunications satellites. **********Evan McCollum, a spokesman for Lockheed Martin Astronautics, declined to comment beyond saying that the company was also bidding on the new project. **********But in a sign of the breakdown of the industry's once-inviolate national bent, Lockheed Martin is likely to have incorporated foreign technology into its proposals in the form of engines or other hardware from Russia, industry executives said. Lockheed sells Russia's powerful Proton rocket to commercial users in the West and has close ties to that nation's launching industry. **********Further underscoring the rapid changes in the industry, a top Russian aerospace executive said in Moscow on Friday that the United States was close to dropping the quota it had placed on Russian launchings of commercial satellites containing American technology. Anatoly Kiselyov, the general director of the Krunichev rocket factory, told reporters after a visit to the plant by Vice President Al Gore that the move would allow the venture between Lockheed and Proton's Russian manufacturers to book additional launchings beyond the eight up to 1999 that the United States had previously agreed to permit. **********The new American program, known as the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle, is intended to upgrade the current fleet of Atlas, Titan and McDonnell Douglas Delta rockets, all of which were originally built to carry nuclear warheads. **********A number of other aerospace companies are believed to have made proposals, although the Air Force declined to say how many it has received or to identify any bidders. Initial development contracts are scheduled to be awarded to as many as three or four bidders in August, with the final selection of a single winner still several years away. **********The Pentagon is not formally changing its buy-American policy, and in becoming a key subcontractor to Alliant, Arianespace is effectively giving up on cracking the United States Government market on its own. **********But Alliant and the European consortium are taking advantage of a greater willingness on the part of the Pentagon to allow its rocket makers to seek foreign technology and partners if doing so will result in lower costs and greater reliability. **********Richard Schwartz, Alliant's chief executive, said Arianespace would provide the program with its liquid-fueled, or cryogenic, stage -- the main booster, providing most of the power on rockets capable of carrying the largest spy satellites and other heavy payloads into orbit. **********The Arianespace cryogenic stage is now in the final stages of development and is the core of the new Ariane V launcher, scheduled to fly for the first time later this year. Under Alliant's proposal, the European Vulcain engine would be used in conjunction with upgraded solid-rocket boosters built for the Air Force's Titan program by Alliant's Aerospace Systems group, which encompasses the former Hercules Aerospace, an engine maker acquired by Alliant earlier this year. For small and medium-sized payloads, the Alliant proposal would use all solid boosters. **********\"The Europeans have already developed this vehicle and spent a lot of money on it,\" Mr. Schwartz said. Combined with Alliant's recently upgraded solid motors, \"you can form a system with low nonrecurring costs and significantly lower the cost per launch,\" he said. **********If its bid was eventually accepted, the Alliant team would most likely obtain a license for the European technology. The engine would then be built in the United States. The European engine and its associated hardware are built primarily by two French companies, Aerospatiale and Societe Europeene de Propulsion. **********Although the new program's primary aim is to upgrade the American military's launching capabilities, it also has the goal of promoting the development of a more competitive American commercial launching industry by improving reliability and driving down production and launching costs."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/13/business/the-media-business-fcc-backs-digital-satellite-radio.html": {"writer_name": "Edmund Andrews", "pub_date": "1995-01-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 492, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "F.C.C.

So it still is best to save as much as possible now. **********For those who feel they absolutely cannot spare much of their income for college savings, Mr. Loewe begins by taking out $25 a month, then keeps doubling up until the family can't bear any more. \"It's amazing what people can save if they don't see the money,\" he said. **********But saving is only the beginning. The next important decision is whose name to put the money in. Since the \"kiddie\" tax was put into place in 1987, there has been little reason to put large amounts of money into accounts in your child's name. For a child under 14, the first $650 of income is tax free. The next $650 is taxed at 15 percent, but anything above that amount is taxed at the parents' rate. Furthermore, money saved in the child's name can disqualify the child for financial aid. Schools consider about a third of the child's assets to be available each year for college, but only about six percent of parents' assets, excluding retirement accounts and home equity, are considered available. **********And financial aid is not only for the impoverished. A family with one child in an expensive private college could receive financial aid even if its income is $100,000. So unless you are wealthy, it is best not to assume there will be no aid, at least until your child is 14. At that point you can do a financial aid test and determine whether you are better off leaving investments in your name or gradually giving them to your child, who, after age 14, will be taxed at his own income rate. **********Carol C. Pankros of CCP Inc., a financial adviser in Palatine, Ill., suggested putting no more than $10,000 in a child's name, not just because of financial aid, but also in case the child does not go to college. **********Grandparents should also think twice about giving money to their grandchildren. Better to make the gifts in the parents' names. Otherwise, the parents may end up shelling out money that might have come from financial aid. **********The next step is to decide how to invest college savings. For a young child, most experts agree that a majority of savings should go into equities where growth potential far outstrips that of fixed-income instruments. Jennifer Saslaw, a financial planner in Chicago, suggested 80 percent in equities until the child is 8 years old. At that point, one should trim stocks to 70 percent. Once the child is 14, it is important to slowly move assets into less volatile, fixed-income instruments to assure your capital is there at college time. Move it in tranches, the experts advise. Your child will be spending the money over at least four years. If you are seeking financial aid, remember that selling stock the year before your child goes to college will show up on your income statement as a capital gain. Since up to 47 percent of a parent's adjusted income is considered available for college, that gain will decrease the amount of aid you receive. **********Next, parents need to determine how to invest the money. Most advisers suggest mutual funds. While many parents and grandparents choose zero coupon bonds for college, these investments don't have the same growth potential of stocks. \"The advantage is that you know how much you will have at the end of the time,\" Ms. Pankros said. But that security may cost you a lot in returns over 18 years of investing for college. The same goes for savings bonds. **********Another possibility is life insurance. Variable universal life insurance policies offer the ability to manage your savings in mutual funds. They also have the potential for huge tax savings, since the cash builds up in the policy while taxes are deferred. And you can borrow against the policy to pay for college without incurring taxes, as long as you never allow the policy to lapse. But you are borrowing against your future death benefit, so if you allow the policy to lapse before you die, you may be hit with an enormous tax bill when you least expect it."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/03/business/international-briefs-body-shop-reports-weak-sales-in-us.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-05-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 124, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Body Shop Reports Weak Sales in U.S.", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS; Body Shop Reports Weak Sales in U.S.", "body_text": " **********Body Shop International P.L.C. disclosed yesterday that its sales in the United States had been torpid, and it predicted little profit growth this year.

Lotus shares also rose, although by a smaller percentage, to close at $44.50, up $2.50. The movement in Lotus shares reflected the minimal impact that the ruling, by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Boston, is expected to have on the company's operations. Although Lotus had said it expected to receive more than $100 million in damages in the suit, Borland had less than half that amount in cash, and few analysts expected the outcome to be material to Lotus. **********The clear winner in yesterday's decision was Borland, a company that has had little good news for a long time. As long as the suit and the threat of huge damages hung over its head, the company's very survival was in question, and some customers might have deferred buying its products for that reason. Borland's newest product, Delphi, a software development tool used to create custom applications, was introduced to rave reviews last month. That product now has a better chance of success. **********The resolution of the suit, barring any appeal Lotus may file, also raises anew the possibility that Borland will be acquired. Although the company has been mired in losses for many quarters, there is still a strong franchise for its core products, like the dBase and Paradox data base management programs, and various software languages and development tools used by professional programmers. Borland recently completed a major revamping to focus on these products. **********Borland officials said the ruling cleared the way for them to pursue their new strategy. \"This decision removes a huge cloud of uncertainty from Borland and allows us to move forward with our business plans to develop and market world-class software development tools,\" said Gary Wetsel, who was named president of Borland in January after the company's founder, Phillipe Kahn, stepped down. Mr. Kahn remains chairman. **********Lotus executives, who said they were considering their options, would not say whether they planned to appeal the decision. **********But in many ways, the issue is moot in terms of the company's place in the market today. In August 1993, Borland removed a feature in its Quattro Pro spreadsheet that a lower court had found to infringe Lotus copyrights. Last March, the company sold the product altogether to Novell Inc. **********In the meantime, Lotus 1-2-3 has lost its place as the leading spreadsheet program to the Microsoft Corporation's Excel, and Lotus now says it expects its Notes program for workgroup computing to generate growth. **********\"Was it Borland that damaged 1-2-3?

The Eastman Kodak Company, long a disappointing performer, delivered earnings near the high end of expectations yesterday and said it would spend $1 billion to buy back 2.5 percent of its stock in the next six to nine months. **********Earnings for the quarter were $338 million, up 33 percent from operating earnings a year earlier. Investors responded positively to the report, sending the price of Kodak's shares on the New York Stock Exchange up $2.50, to $59.625, a gain of nearly 4.4 percent. **********The news was all the more welcome because it was somewhat surprising. With consumer-products companies like Polaroid and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing warning that third-quarter earnings would not meet expectations, there were fears that Kodak, too, would post numbers below the 94-cent-a-share consensus of analysts. **********But the company reported net earnings of 99 cents a share for the period, just two pennies less than the most optimistic forecast. \"The street was worried that it was going to be ugly,\" said B. Alex Henderson, an analyst with Prudential Securities Research. \"We had heard about losses in copiers and retail sales over all were down.\" **********Instead, Mr. Henderson said, Kodak's sales of consumer photographic products surged, fueling earnings. \"Film sales were well above the trend line, growing 7 percent compared to a trend of 3 to 4 percent,\" he said. \"That is good news, but it may not be sustainable.\" **********Harry L. Kavetas, Kodak's chief financial officer, disputed those doubts. He said the consumer imaging business -- film in yellow boxes, photofinishing, photographic paper and accessories -- could be counted on to expand. \"We are finding that the consumer imaging business is larger and growing more rapidly than the conventional wisdom would allow,\" he said. **********Mr. Kavetas is one of the outside executives brought to Kodak by George M. C. Fisher, who decided to drop drugs and other chemical products shortly after he became the company's chairman in December, instead preferring to concentrate only on the imaging business. **********Mr. Kavetas said Kodak's electronic imaging operations, Mr. Fisher's product line of the future, was still unprofitable, but on track to become profitable in 1997. \"It is our fastest-growing business,\" he said. **********Analysts said Kodak had promised to begin a program to return cash to shareholders by the end of this year, so yesterday's $1 billion stock repurchase announcement came three months before the self-imposed deadline. They said it was made possible by Mr. Fisher's asset- sales program, which allowed the company to pay off most of its debt. **********\"This is the first quarter in years where cash exceeded debt,\" said Jack L. Kelly, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs. \"They have $1.3 billion in cash and marketable securities and $1.06 billion in debt. The balance sheet is a success story.\" **********Analysts generally praised the buyback program, though some questioned its size and duration. \"This will all be over by the middle of next year,\" said Nicholas P. Heymann of NatWest Securities \"What happens next? **********\"They could have announced a three- or a five-year program,\" he added. \"By doing this, you have to suspect there is something else pending, like an acquisition.\" Mr. Heymann said Kodak's future cash-flow prospects could have supported a larger stock purchase plan. \"They are keeping an awful lot of powder dry there,\" he said. **********Kodak executives and analysts agreed that despite the strong earnings and the stock purchase plan, the company has more to do to convince investors that it can trim administrative costs that are widely seen as excessive. In his statement, Mr. Fisher pledged to \"continue to work very hard to reduce our cost base.\" **********Kodak executives, Mr. Kelly said, \"know they have to reduce costs in areas like distribution.

The number of car models sold by American auto makers in Japan with the steering wheel on the right side, which is the custom in Japan, is **********(a) 59 **********(b) 2. **********2. America's trade deficit with Japan in autos and auto parts is **********(a) getting bigger **********(b) getting smaller. **********3. Imported cars account for **********(a) only 4 percent of the Japanese market, far less than the imported share in other industrialized nations **********(b) 8-12 percent of the Japanese market, about the same as in other industrialized nations. **********The correct answers are a or b, depending on whether one believes the United States Government or the Japanese Government. In other words, the sides are worlds apart, giving new meaning to the old saw about \"lies, damn lies and statistics.\" **********In an effort to influence world opinion, both Governments have been issuing a blizzard of statistical fact sheets and counter-fact sheets in a duel that has no doubt kept lower-level bureaucrats on both sides of the Pacific toiling over spreadsheets until the wee hours of their respective mornings. **********Needless to say, each side presents the figures in a way that best suits its case. **********Take right-hand drive cars. Japan argues that one reason so few American cars are sold here is that Detroit simply does not make cars for the Japanese market. It argues that there are just two American cars sold in Japan with the steering wheel on the right side -- the Chrysler Jeep Cherokee and the Ford Probe. **********No way, cries Washington. The Government says there are 59 right-hand drive models offered in Japan by Detroit's Big Three, and it has published a list of them. (In fact, the list contains 60 models, but who's counting?) **********The discrepancy is that Japan counts only cars made by the Big Three in the United States. But Washington includes cars made by the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company in Europe as well as those made by Mazda Motors in Japan that are sold here by Ford. It does not matter where the cars are made, Washington says, as long as the models with right-side drive are for sale in Japan. **********But Washington's view of what constitutes a car \"model\" is considerably more liberal than Japan's. Consider the Telstar sold by Ford and made by Mazda. **********Washington lists 16 versions of the small car and counts each one as a right-hand drive model. There's the Ford Telstar II (18i-Ef) and the Telstar II (18i-E) and the Telstar II (18i-X), for example, not to mention the popular Telstar II (20i-X), which also comes in a four-wheel-drive version. There are also two models of the Telstar TX 5, two versions of the Telstar Sedan and seven varieties of the Telstar Wagon. **********What is the difference, say, between the Telstar II (18i-Ef) and the (18i-E)? According to a Ford dealer, the E has an audio system and electrically retractable side-view mirrors, while the Ef does not. In other words, not much of a difference if all one cares about is which side the steering wheel is on. **********Then there is the question of just how many new cars are sold by foreign auto makers in Japan. Washington argues that imported cars make up only 4 percent of the Japanese market; Japan says foreign auto makers captured more than 8 percent of the market last year. **********In calculating import market share, the United States calculates imports as a share of all vehicles sold in Japan. Japan, though, counts only passenger cars, excluding commercial vehicles and mini-cars, an extremely small vehicle for urban use, arguing that foreign auto makers do not really compete in those segments. **********Whatever the figure, how does this compare with other countries? Imports account for between 33 percent of the market in the United States and 55 percent in Italy. Given the paltry 4 percent share held by imports in Japan, that proves that Japan's market is effectively closed, Americans say. **********Japan begs to differ. The share held by imports in other big car markets around the world ranges from only 5 to 16 percent, Japan says, not 33 to 55 percent. **********As for the other nations, Japan excludes imports into the United States from Canada and Mexico and imports into one European country from another, arguing that these occur within free-trade areas. That knocks down the share of the market held by imported cars in France, say, from the 38 percent calculated by Washington to only 5 percent. **********What about the big picture? Can the two sides agree on that? **********The question of whether the United States deficit in auto-related trade with Japan is getting bigger or smaller simply depends on which currency is used to measure it. **********In dollar terms, the difference between imports and exports of automobiles and parts rose to $36.7 billion last year from $30.8 billion in 1990. But in Japanese yen, the deficit shrank 13.4 percent in that period, mainly because Japan has been exporting fewer cars to the United States. But because the yen has substantially risen in value against the dollar, the deficit measured in dollars has climbed substantially. **********As for the huge imbalance in auto parts pouring into the United States and the trickle of American parts flowing to Japan, Washington argues that something must be amiss in Japan because the United States has a surplus in auto-parts trade with the rest of the world. **********Well, not quite, says Japan. Tokyo contends that the United States imports more parts than it exports with most countries, including Mexico, Germany and France. The overall surplus the United States touts is mainly with Canada, Japan says, where the Big Three have several assembly plants that they supply with parts from the United States."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/20/business/eurocars-on-the-road-again.html": {"writer_name": "James Bennet", "pub_date": "1995-08-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2535, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Eurocars: On the Road Again", "print_headline": "Eurocars: On the Road Again", "body_text": " **********TO understand the fall and rise of the European car in America, consider the case of Volvo and the cup holder. **********The year was 1990. With its American sales plunging, Volvo, the Swedish auto maker, was developing a new, make-or-break model, the 850. It asked eight dealers in the United States to confect a \"no apologies car,\" with all the equipment their customers would want. The dealers demanded a sleeker look and splashier colors inside and out, and, they declared, they simply had to have cup holders. **********Old World habits, though, die hard. The Swedish engineers said no way; they would not contribute to reckless behavior like drinking hot coffee while driving. **********But the North American sales operations insisted on the inclusion of that uniquely North American auto fetish, and, ultimately, the engineers \"were beaten into submission,\" in the words of William J. Hoover, executive vice president of Volvo Cars of North America. The cup holders, optional when the 850 was introduced in the fall of 1992, have since been made standard, and the car has spearheaded Volvo's comeback in the United States. **********These days, in a stunning reversal of fortune, it seems that a European auto company can't miss in the United States. As the overall American market stalled out in the first seven months of this year, slipping 2.3 percent, Volvo sales were up 8.1 percent. And Volkswagen, BMW, Saab, Jaguar, Land Rover and Audi posted percentage gains in the double digits. Only one major European contender saw its sales decline, and that was Alfa Romeo, which is abandoning the United States. **********Chased from commuter parking lots in the late 80's by sturdier and less expensive high-line Japanese cars, the Europeans have dueled their way back in much the same way that the Japanese conquered the American market -- by cutting costs, restraining prices and finally pausing to ask customers why they started snubbing the cars in the first place. **********It turns out that drivers in the United States never lost their hankering for the snarl of a BMW engine, the craggy profile of a Volvo or the down-and-dirty ignition of a Saab. **********It's just that, strangely, they also prefer electrical systems that don't short out and sunroofs that don't leak. They like chipper colors and capacious glove boxes. They enjoy advertising that treats them like adults, or darn close to it. They don't like to pay too much for that muffler, or for anything else. **********\"It's not so much magic,\" said Dr. Jens Neumann, the member of Volkswagen A.G.'s board of management who overseas operations in North America. \"You just have to go out from the ivory tower to where the real life is taking place.\" **********Dr. Neumann, who graduated from high school in Baltimore, could not resist serving up a little crow. \"I told you we'd double the sales,\" he said, recalling a promise made in 1994. \"No one really believed it.\" (In point of fact, V.W.'s sales in the United States last year rose only 95.9 percent.) **********In part, the European companies are benefiting from their recent obscurity in this country. **********Erin Spencer, a 38-year-old management consultant in Atlanta, said her old Nissan Altima \"was a great car.\" But when it came time to trade up, she said, \"I wanted one that everybody and his brother didn't have, versus the Lexus and Infiniti, which everybody has. Saab was just a little bit different.\" **********At the same time, the Europeans are aggressively promoting their cars by jabbing at perceived weaknesses of the Japanese wares: unexciting handling and vanilla styling. **********\"That's a big downfall of the Japanese -- they're not stylish cars,\" said R. Michael Smith, an executive search consultant in Roswell, Ga., who recently replaced his 1992 Infiniti Q45 with a glacier-white Jaguar XJ6 sedan. \"The Jaguar's a very stylish car. People look when I drive by, and I like it.\" **********Mr. Smith knew all the old jokes about the quality of Jaguars (\"You have to buy two, since one will always be in the shop\"), but he had heard that the cars had improved since the Ford Motor Company bought Jaguar Cars Ltd. in 1989. \"The bottom line was, I wanted a Jag since I was a kid, and now the quality was in it,\" he said. **********Despite their recent gains, most European car makers remain below their record levels of the 1970's and 80's, and they represent tiny fractions of the American market. For example, in the most marked resurgence, Land Rover more than doubled its sales last year after introducing a new sport utility model, the Discovery. It cost just less than $30,000 -- compared with more than $50,000 for Rover's other four-door model, the Range Rover -- and had some features oddly novel in Rover's lineup, like a glove box. **********While its sales jumped more than doubled, Land Rover nonetheless sold only 12,045 vehicles in the United States all last year. By contrast, Ford sells about 30,000 of its Explorer sport utility alone -- each month. Even the biggest of the European brands in this country, Volkswagen, sold only 97,043 vehicles in 1994. **********Over all, however, the Europeans are steadily gaining share, to 3.1 percent of the total car and light truck market at the end of July, compared with 2.7 percent a year ago; the Big Three auto companies in the same period slipped from 73.7 percent of the market to 73.6, while Japanese companies declined from 22.7 percent to 22.3. **********The European companies generally sell at the upper, and smaller, end of the market, where customers are more demanding but profit margins are fatter. And within that segment, their gains are bigger. **********Through July, they controlled 27.5 percent of the luxury market, up from 23.8 percent for all of 1994, according to an analysis by Susan Jacobs, the president of Jacobs & Associates, an automotive consulting firm based in New Jersey. **********To cement and extend their gains, the Europeans are preparing to deliver a slew of new models, from convertible roadsters to sport utilities. They are also moving down-market with less expensive but jazzier vehicles, in a bid to win younger buyers by broadening the appeal of staid brands like Mercedes. And, as the Japanese did years ago, they are building plants in this country to dig themselves securely into the American market. **********At a new plant in South Carolina, BMW A.G. has already started making sedans and roadsters. In Georgia, Mercedes plans to start producing a new, so-called all-activity vehicle by 1997. Peugeot is weighing building a plant and selling again in the United States; Volvo says it will almost surely build a new plant in North America by the end of the decade. **********THE Euro rash has spread even to Detroit. The General Motors Corporation, desperate for a luxury car to excite youngish buyers, is turning to its German subsidiary, Opel, for an import it will sell as the Catera in the fall of 1996. **********It is also crossing the Atlantic for the basis of its next mini-van and a new model of its Saturn cars. And Ford's so-called world cars, the Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique, started their life as the European Mondeo. **********As recently as a decade ago, the Europeans could sell anything they offered in the United States because they had a part of the market mostly to themselves: luxury performance vehicles with a whiff of romance. Although competitive threats were stirring, the auto makers were complacent. **********\"I don't think any of the manufacturers thought the consumer would accept the Japanese as premium cars,\" said Jim Crumlish, president and chief executive officer of of Saab Cars U.S.A. Inc. **********But the Japanese offered better quality at a lower price, and quickly lured customers away. At the same time, Detroit's auto makers began improving their own quality and styling, presenting another threat. **********With sales tumbling, the Europeans finally woke up in the early 1990's. As the Big Three had, they began studying Japanese manufacturing and marketing methods, rethinking their organizations, their brands and their products. **********The results were some shocking changes -- shocking mostly because they had not been made years before. Mercedes-Benz, for example, began disciplining its product developers for the first time to hit price targets for new cars, to insure that the new models could go head to head with Japanese cars and attract suddenly price-conscious luxury buyers. **********Such a change might seem elementary, but Mercedes-Benz \"did business a hundred years with great success, and there's a certain inertia to walking away from what you've been doing successfully,\" said Mike J. Jackson, executive vice president for marketing, service and sales at Mercedes-Benz of North America. \"While everyone knew change had to come, no one understood how dramatic or fast or urgent the change needed to be.\" **********TO cut costs, Mercedes turned to outside suppliers to make more parts for its cars, since they could do so more efficiently. It also began shrinking its work force in Germany through early-retirement programs. **********The aggressive efforts by Mercedes to control prices came just as Japanese cars, because of the rising yen, were losing their bargain status. When Lexus introduced its ES300 in the fall of 1991, it cost $26,620, well below the bottom-line Mercedes, which then cost $30,200. **********But two years later, when Mercedes brought out its new entry level model, it priced the car only $125 above the model it replaced. Meanwhile, the price of the Lexus had shot past the Mercedes, rising 17 percent, to $31,080. Since then, reflecting the tougher competition, the prices of both models have risen only 4 percent, leaving Mercedes with the advantage. **********Sales have surged for Mercedes since the debut of that new entry-level model, the C-class, and it is now poised to bring out several new cars to reposition the company here. A new E-class sedan is due this fall, to be followed by a convertible roadster, the all-activity vehicle and an all-new entry-level vehicle, which will cost less than the C-class. Mr. Jackson is hoping the cars will update the Mercedes image to draw in more, and younger, buyers. **********\"An icon up on a pedestal is not where we want to be in the 90's,\" he said. Mercedes, he said, needs to become \"more approachable, relevant, friendlier.\" **********Mercedes had deep-enough pockets to weather the market shakeout. Not so some of the other European auto companies, which lost their independence to big auto makers demanding immediate changes. While Ford bought Jaguar, BMW bought Rover. **********For its part, G.M. bought a 50 percent stake in Saab for $600 million in 1990, and installed new executives to salvage the collapsing company. Over the next four years, Saab chopped its work force in half, in the process lowering its break-even point -- the number of sales at which it becomes profitable -- from 130,000 to 80,000. **********Saab also went to work on a replacement for its 900 model, with new attention to Japanese manufacturing techniques and American tastes. **********The North American sales operation asked for a six-cylinder engine. Saab almost surely could not have afforded to develop one on its own, but G.M. simply sent one it already made in England. **********Saab's product planners also demanded a convertible, brighter colors, unusual wheel designs and a better sound system. Oh, and they asked for one more thing. \"It was a tough thing to convince the Swedes of, why you need a cup holder,\" Mr. Crumlish recalled. **********Closer attention to quality in the new cars is also paying off. At Volvo, for example, to produce the side of the 850, workers now stamp only one piece of metal, rather than welding together several small pieces, as they had on previous models. **********The result is a stiffer side less prone to rattles, as well as greater efficiency in the factory. Volvo's scores in J. D. Power & Associates' Initial Quality Survey, an industry yardstick, climbed from worse than average in 1992 to 10th best of 33 ranked brands this year. **********MERCEDES and BMW have also moved into the top 10. Indeed, while they still lag behind the Japanese, the European auto companies as a group have improved their J. D. Power scores by 39 percent since 1992, compared with an 18 percent improvement for the industry as a whole, said Jacques DaCosta, a project director at Power. **********Dealers and auto analysts say that, in good measure, the European recovery is a result of basic price competition. With aggressive pricing, particularly through lease deals, the Europeans have been able to equal or undercut the Japanese companies. **********\"I don't think the average buyer is tired of buying Japanese,\" said Kyle Brooks, Volkswagen sales manager at Bay Ridge Car World Ltd. in Brooklyn. \"What's happening is because of the competitive pricing the American buyer is looking into the European car. Once they get here, they're finding this is a nice car for the money.\" **********Some buyers say that, beyond price, European cars have an advantage in personality and performance. **********\"The European cars are different,\" said Mark Gordanier, an accountant in Green Oak Township, Mich., who recently replaced a Toyota 4-Runner sport utility vehicle with a Volvo 850 sedan. \"They're tight. The steering's tight. The ride's tight.\" **********That is certainly the image most European companies are promoting. Toyota's marketing program for its Avalon sedan, which pictures a car floating among clouds, is the antithesis of the Europeans' message. **********\"I am scrubbed of pollen, free of dust, void of pollution,\" a young woman cheerfully announces in a new V.W. ad. \"So,\" she asks, her voice climbing to an echoing yell, \"Why can't I breathe!\" To a burst of vigorous music, the advertisement cuts to a shot of a V.W. convertible Cabrio, amid dazzling reds, golds and blues, twisting, top down, through country roads at high speeds. **********\"It invigorates, never isolates,\" declares the ad, and a female narrator avers, \"On the road of life, there are passengers, and there are drivers.\" **********DR. NEUMANN explained that V.W. was looking to attract \"active drivers.\" **********\"It's the young people -- up to 40 or 45 -- and those who stayed young that have the feel for it, and that we need to focus on,\" he said. To that end, V.W. is planning to introduce a futuristic version of its beloved Beetle, designed in Simi Valley, Calif., for sale in the United States. The company is coy about the introduction date, the price and other details. **********While Dr. Neumann said Asia presented the auto makers with the most room to grow, he called the United States a \"relative growth market\" for a company like V.W. that is positioned to gain market share. **********Selling in the United States, he argued, can contribute more than profits. The market here strengthens auto companies because it is so \"transparent,\" he said, thanks to strict emissions and safety standards and independent watchdog groups like Power. **********\"This competition,\" he said, \"teaches you something.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/03/world/in-cairo-israel-and-arabs-back-peace-talks.html": {"writer_name": "Chris Hedges", "pub_date": "1995-02-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1206, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "In Cairo, Israel and Arabs Back Peace Talks", "print_headline": "In Cairo, Israel and Arabs Back Peace Talks", "body_text": " **********The leaders of Egypt, Jordan, the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel, in their first regional summit meeting, agreed tonight to conduct talks in the coming days aimed at overcoming the obstacles to peace in the region. **********In the past, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin has met individually with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, King Hussein of Jordan and Yasir Arafat, chairman of the P.L.O., but until Mr. Mubarak invited the group to Egypt, Mr. Rabin had never sat down with all three of the Arab leaders who have formally made peace with Israel. **********The leaders, who met for five and a half hours, did not adhere to their schedule and speak with reporters after the talks, which underscored the lack of progress. **********But Egypt's Foreign Minister, Amr Moussa, read a joint communique condemning political violence, calling for the preservation of the P.L.O.-Israeli agreements, appealing for more international financial support for the Palestinian Authority and seeking the establishment of a regional development bank. **********\"The four parties condemned all the outbreaks of bloodshed, terror and violence in the region and reaffirmed their intention to stand staunchly against, and put an end to, all such acts,\" the statement read. **********Mr. Moussa said the meeting had helped save the Middle East peace effort and brought it \"back on track.\" It also brought Mr. Mubarak back to the center of Middle East issues.

Over the long term, the authorities should spend $50 million to build water treatment plants for the city of Leon, which lies upstream, the scientists said. **********The panel was formed under the environmental tenets of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and its investigation -- the first of its kind -- was an important test of the three nations' ability to cooperate on environmental matters. **********The Mexican authorities concluded last summer that industrial pollutants had killed the birds. But the Nafta panel's report said that although exposure to heavy metals, discharged without treatment by 1,000 leather tanneries upstream from the Silva reservoir, may have been a factor, botulism was the main killer. **********\"The overriding cause of mortality in waterbirds at the Presa de Silva was botulism; however, a small percentage of birds may have died of other causes,\" the report said. **********The panel's identification of untreated sewage as an environmental killer underlines what health experts have long called one of Mexico's most sweeping health problems: the lack of water treatment facilities. Julia Carabias Lillo, Mexico's environment minister, said this month that there are only 660 water treatment plants for all of the country's 92 million people, and many of them are not functioning. **********From November through January, when most of the birds died, the waters of the Silva reservoir were likely 100 percent raw sewage, the Nafta panel's report said. **********Noting that thousands of birds began perishing six weeks before Mexican authorities reacted, the Nafta scientists urged Mexico to form an agency to monitor the health of its beleaguered wildlife and respond to outbreaks of wildlife diseases. **********Mary A. Minette, a staff lawyer for the National Audobon Society, which along with two Mexican environmental groups requested the investigation, warned that although the reservoir has been drained, local farmers depend on it for irrigation. **********\"Unless they provide a clean place for birds to land nearby, this is just going to happen all over again,\" Ms. Minette said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/12/business/company-news-uunet-offers-to-buy-internet-access-provider.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-10-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 95, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "UUNET OFFERS TO BUY INTERNET ACCESS PROVIDER", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; UUNET OFFERS TO BUY INTERNET ACCESS PROVIDER", "body_text": " **********The shares of Uunet Technologies Inc. rose yesterday after it offered Monday night to buy Unipalm Group P.L.C., Europe's largest Internet access provider, in a $154 million stock swap.

But the fact that the measure is creating fertile ground for lawyers only tells part of the story. It is also having a profound impact because of its hallmark requirement to provide \"reasonable accommodation\" for disabled people. **********Although the term is not defined by the law, \"reasonable accommodation,\" in practice, requires that employers affirmatively help a wide range of employees in a variety of ways and with a flexibility that is counterintuitive to the way most businesses operate. **********The requirements are far different than the precept of equal treatment mandated under other equal employment laws. The reasonable-accommodation requirement is imposed on employers so that disabled employees have a means of overcoming barriers that prevent or restrict employment opportunities.  Since every job, employer and disability is unique, providing reasonable accommodation can entail diverse actions like restructuring a job, buying special devices for a worker, providing an interpreter or granting leave or flexible hours. **********The frightening aspect of this process for employers is that the final arbiter of what is reasonable may be a jury that has the authority to hand out a staggering award, including back pay, legal fees and punitive damages. **********The concept of reasonable accommodation challenges many of the fundamental assumptions employers have held with respect to job qualifications. For example, if physical or mental standards screen out individuals with disabilities, an employer must demonstrate that the standard is job-related and consistent with business necessity. In one recent case, a Federal court in Kansas City, Mo., held that a blanket prohibition on licensing one-armed security guards constituted discrimination under the A.D.A.. The court reasoned that it was improper to assume that an individual with one hand could not perform the same physical tasks as someone with two hands. Courts that have addressed these issues have not concerned themselves with employer discretion as to how the job is done but only with insuring that the job is done. **********The law's employment provisions are only a few pages long, but their brevity belies a panoply of complicated legal issues. It has taken the E.E.O.C. 47 pages of regulations to explain what constitutes lawful disability-related inquiries under the law, and those regulations raise just as many issues as they resolve. **********The E.E.O.C. says you can ask a job applicant how many days leave she took last year but not how many days she was ill. Because alcoholism is considered a disability under the A.D.A., you can't ask someone if he is an alcoholic, but you can ask if he drinks alcohol. These subtleties are beyond the grasp of most lawyers, let alone the small-business owner who meets the law's threshold coverage of 15 employees. **********Even defining the term \"disability\" has proved mercurial, requiring 60 more pages of explanatory regulations. Individuals are protected under the law if they possess a \"physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more major life activities.\" That latitude often makes determining coverage under the law ambiguous. **********Let's say, for example, an employee is impatient with her co-workers and her boss, often loses her temper and publicly questions her superior's directions. If this conduct is a result of manic depression -- rather than merely a personality trait of impatience or arrogance -- this person receives all of the law's protections. **********Employers can hardly be sanguine about the law's seemingly endless scope. Falling within its broad protective sweep are recovered drug addicts; people suffering from panic attacks, depression or other mental illness; the learning disabled; the mentally retarded; alcoholics; the obese; individuals with facial disfigurements, and persons who are impaired in their ability to procreate.  In addition, the law protects those employees who are not actually disabled but are perceived to be so. For the employee who wants to sue, the A.D.A. has, as my wife likes to say, a lid for every pot. **********The law's outer boundaries are not yet known, but we are living, after all, in a renaissance age when it comes to legal ingenuity. The computer programmer fired for tardiness who claimed that he suffered from a neurotic compulsion for lateness did not succeed in his lawsuit.  Nor did the bus driver who suffered from uncontrolled diabetes, which could make him lose consciousness.  And the waitress with panic attack disorder, who had a \"meltdown\" in a packed restaurant on New Year's Eve, was denied her demand that she have an assistant when the restaurant was crowded. **********Nonetheless, companies are fairly concerned that the law has become a weapon for any disgruntled employee who wants to bring a discrimination claim. **********Advocates for the disabled seem reluctant to acknowledge that the law imposes requirements on business that give disabled employees special treatment. They equate the measure with other equal employment laws, but employers will be wise to recognize that the mantra of equal treatment just doesn't cut it under the A.D.A. With input of the disabled employee, employers must provide assistance on an individual basis. After that, employers can only hope that a jury playing Monday morning quarterback will be convinced that the company acted in a \"reasonable\" manner. **********Readers may submit articles to Viewpoint or From the Desk Of, Money and Business, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York 10036, or send E-mail in care of viewpts@nytimes.com or fromdesk@nytimes.com.

In the upper castes dwelt the Estee Lauders and Chanels at Saks Fifth Avenue and Bergdorf Goodman, while in the lower castes the faux-designer perfumes and other pretenders sat in the murk of suburban strip malls. **********The marketing, for the most part, was as caste-ridden as the products. The Brahmins lavished millions on artfully sculptured bottles and skin-care jars, and even more artful magazine advertising. The outcastes skimped on packaging and advertised scarcely at all, and then only to rail at the $30 to $100 price tags of the prestige brands. **********Somewhere in between was Pond's, which has nonetheless managed to leap from No. 5 in its market to No. 2 in the last three years with a canny and largely successful attempt to erase those caste lines. Its latest attempt to further erase those barriers, backed by $45 million in advertising and marketing spending, begins this week. **********Pond's, a 149-year-old brand name, has until recently languished as a product line redolent of grandmother's cold cream. Pond's products are aimed at women aged 25 to 55 and its famous cream, derived from witch hazel, was invented in Utica, N.Y., by Theron T. Pond with the help of an Oneida Indian medicine man. **********Not surprisingly, modern women seemed wary of such a vintage legacy. \"Women always said Pond's was for someone else, someone older, even if they were 55,\" said David Cohen, category director for Chesebrough-Pond's U.S.A. in Greenwich, Conn., a unit of London-based Unilever. **********By giving its mass-market product as many earmarks as possible of a prestige brand, however, Chesebrough-Pond's U.S.A. has sharply increased its market share. It has done so with new products, like Age Defying Complex, as well as with the Pond's Institute advertising campaign designed by Pond's ad agency since 1992, Ogilvy & Mather, which is owned by WPP Group. **********But the clincher may have been acid-etched glass. In a canny bit of legerdemain, Chesebrough-Pond's redesigned its bottles and other packaging to mimic the sculptured romanticism of the prestige brands. It now uses much the same heavy glass as in the $100 perfume bottles. **********But Pond's has retained mass-market prices. Pond's cold cream, the original product, sells for as little as $3.99 a jar and the product line tops out at $14.99 for Prevent & Correct, a new anti-aging product, which uses the popular alpha-hydroxy acid to help remove old skin. **********This week, in the print stage of its new campaign, Pond's is introducing an approach that mimics the glamour of fashion magazines while attempting to hold on to current customers who harbor a mild suspicion of glamour. The ads are beginning this week in People, McCall's and Ladies' Home Journal. **********For its new campaign, Pond's hired Herb Ritts, the fashion photographer known for his photos of models like Cindy Crawford and Naomi Campbell. **********\"What we didn't need to do was warm up the Pond's brand; it was very respected,\" said Victoria V. Corcoran, a senior partner at Ogilvy & Mather. \"But we did need to connect somehow with what women were feeling today.\" **********The Ritts photographs are framed like magazine covers. But the photos are not typical glamour shots -- a younger woman holds her face in her hands in a faintly comic gesture of stress, and in another a gray-haired woman in her 50's seems to be auditioning for the chief executive position at a company. **********\"What Herb is terrific at is capturing moments instead of poses,\" said Glen Jacobs, an Ogilvy & Mather partner who oversaw the campaign. What the agency was seeking were portraits of practical women who seek dependability, value for money, but also effective skin care. **********\"The campaign says, 'Look, we know you don't want to look 12 years old,' \" Mr. Cohen of Chesebrough-Pond's said. \"What you want is to look great for your age.\" **********The previous campaign centered on the Pond's Institute, a consumer-research center in Trumbull, Conn., that in television commercials somehow came to resemble the Mayo Clinic, with white-jacketed researchers tipping their horn-rimmed glasses as they peered at clipboards. The campaign effectively gave Pond's a scientific image that helped erase the grandmother image of old. **********The earlier campaign led to a lift in market share. In 1992, Pond's was an also-ran with a 7.8 percent share of a $655 million market in face-care products for the mass market, according to data from the A. C. Nielsen Company. Pond's trailed Neutrogena, now owned by Johnson & Johnson; L'Oreal's Plenitude; Procter & Gamble's Noxzema, and the market leader, P.& G.'s Oil of Olay. **********As of July 8, Pond's had a 13.5 percent share of an $810 million market and was No. 2, after Oil of Olay, which has a 20 percent share. **********\"We knew that what women wanted was a little luxury for less,\" Mr. Cohen said. \"This advertising will try to address that, too, but remain practical.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/11/business/jefferson-pilot-agrees-to-buy-household-s-life-insurance-unit.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-08-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 393, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Jefferson-Pilot Agrees to Buy Household's Life Insurance Unit", "print_headline": "Jefferson-Pilot Agrees to Buy Household's Life Insurance Unit", "body_text": " **********The Jefferson-Pilot Corporation said today that it had reached an agreement to buy Household International Inc.'s insurance unit for $575 million. **********The purchase of the unit, the Alexander Hamilton Life Insurance Company, based in Farmington Hills, Mich., would nearly double Jefferson-Pilot's assets, to about $14 billion.

Since then, there has been practically no violence, but the threat that the two sides might again clash has hung heavily over the state, damaging investor confidence in Mexico and raising political tensions that affected last year's presidential election. **********The situation has changed drastically since February, when the Government arrested several people it accused of being rebel leaders, identified the masked spokesman who had been known only as Subcommander Marcos as a radical college professor, and sent a huge force of federal troops into the rebels' highland forest stronghold. The rebels, who are mostly Mayan Indians, have been surrounded since then, while attempts were made to reopen formal peace talks. **********Masked representatives of the Zapatista National Liberation Army arrived here to cheers Wednesday night with what their leaders said was a specific proposal for a permanent truce. Government negotiators also said they had come with a plan for lowering tensions and eliminating the lingering military threat. **********But Government officials said they were seeking more than a resolution of the military aspect of the rebellion. **********\"In terms of military force, the Zapatistas no longer have any,\" said a Government official close to the negotiations. \"What we need to do here is resolve the deeper issues in a way that does not leave behind any resentment that can become another problem in the future.\" **********Although they are surrounded by Mexican troops, the Zapatistas still represent a formidable public relations threat with support throughout Mexico. The Government, beset by economic and political problems, feels it must take the rebels seriously, and many Government officials fear that an outburst of violence or a terrorist attack would severely set back Mexico's attempts at recovering from the economic crisis caused by the devaluation of the peso in December. **********The current Government plan is for the negotiating sessions with the rebels to continue for several months, perhaps till the end of this year. Each round of talks will deal with specific themes. In later sessions, the Government will take up rebel demands concerning land rights and the brutal poverty in which the Indians of Chiapas live. **********This threadbare community, about 15 miles northwest of San Cristobal de las Casas, is a Zapatista stronghold that mirrors the conditions the rebels have said forced them to take up arms. Nearly all the 15,000 residents of the area speak a variety of Indian languages; more than half have never attended school; less than 15 percent of the houses have plumbing, and only 25 percent have electricity. **********Government officials have made it clear that they will not expand the talks to include national issues, like democratic reform, that the rebels have tried to place on the agenda. Nor, officials said, will the Government succumb to pressures from conservative parts of society that want to see a quick end to the rebel movement. **********\"The policy of the Government is not based on pressures but on meeting the goals and objectives of the people of Chiapas,\" said another Government official close to the talks. **********Today's planned talks follow a preliminary session on April 9 between rebels and the Government that was meant to beat a deadline imposed by the Mexican Congress. Arrest orders against rebel leaders had been suspended for a month by a special amnesty law but would have become effective again on April 10 if the rebels had not taken steps to begin the long-stalled process of negotiation. As long as the talks continue, the Government has pledged to keep the arrest orders suspended. **********Both the Government and rebel leaders are declaring their openness to discuss all issues and to work for a solution to the conflict that has dragged on for 16 months at great cost to Chiapas and to Mexico. **********It is clear that part of the Government's strategy is to differentiate these talks from those that failed in February 1994. Then, the Government was represented by an independent peace commissioner, Manuel Camacho Solis, who personally attracted nearly as much attention as the rebel leader Subcommander Marcos, who has become a national hero. **********Those talks were held under wide publicity in the cathedral of San Cristobal de las Casas. After several days, delegates emerged with a 32-point preliminary settlement, which eventually was rejected by the rebels. **********This time, the Government is represented by officials of the Interior Ministry and a bipartisan Congressional commission.

In the case of the \"Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995,\" conumers will find a world-class misnomer. Now before the Senate, the bill is more accurately described as securities litigation repeal. For millions of middle-class American investors, the fate of this bill -- and the even more radical version passed by the House of Representatives in March -- could spell the difference between recovering or losing billions of dollars from securities fraud. **********Securities litigation reform began with the intent of putting some weights around the ankles of a few fleet-footed lawyers; but the measure now dangerously close to Senate passage would wind up being a noose around the neck of defrauded investors. While everyone agrees on the need for reasonable reform, numerous public-minded groups are strongly opposed to radical steps in the Senate bill, S.240, that would snuff out key investor rights. **********If securities litigation reform was the real goal here, the widespread support that exists for reasonable steps to curb lawsuit abuses would have insured easy passage. But the bill now before the Senate would rein in frivolous lawsuits only by making it virtually impossible for consumers to pursue rightful claims. Here we see the financial world's equivalent of the notorious Vietnam \"hamlet strategy\": we must destroy this village in order to save it. **********The reality is that the main intent of this legislation, despite what its proponents say, is to provide a shield for all but the most extreme cases of fraud. Have the members of the Senate already forgotten the financial scandals of the 1980's that cost investors and taxpayers billions of dollars? Is it really good public policy to erect protective barriers around future wrongdoers who will be emboldened to emulate Lincoln Savings and Loan and Prudential Securities? **********At the heart of consumer concerns over this legislation are two key problems. **********Under current rules, public companies are prevented from deceiving investors by reasonable restrictions on statements concerning future corporate performance, known as \"forward-looking statements.\" The original S.240 created a limited \"safe harbor\" for such statements, but the harbor was changed to an ocean. So now the Senate is considering a measure that protects any reckless or irresponsible statement by a company about its future as long as the statement is represented as forward-looking and notes that actual results may differ. **********The Senate bill narrowly defines as fraudulent only those statements \"knowingly made with the expectation, purpose and actual intent of misleading investors.\" As if this was not a loose enough standard, the bill requires that each of the three conditions be proven separately in court. **********Consequently, S.240 is a dagger aimed at the heart of what makes possible strong public confidence in the markets: full, fair disclosure mandated under Federal securities law. Arthur Levitt Jr., the Securities and Exchange Commission chairman, has noted: \"I cannot embrace proposals which allow willful fraud to receive the benefit of safe harbor protection.\" **********Perhaps the clearest sign, however, that the bill's proponents have sold middle-class investors down the river is their refusal to lengthen the time in which consumers can bring cases to court. The current rule derives from a 1991 Supreme Court decision that created a statute of limitations for Federal securities law cases of one year from discovery of a misdeed or three years from the commission of the act in question. This represented a serious reduction in the time available for such lawsuits, since Federal courts previously had relied on state standards for statutes of limitation. **********Currently, 31 states permit longer than the \"1 and 3\" standard for the filing of state securities cases. What possible case can the backers of this bill make for keeping the time limit as short as possible so that future swindlers who cover their tracks carefuly will get off the hook for good? **********Fortunately, efforts are under way to pull the measure back toward the interests of small investors. Among the amendments expected to be deliberated on the Senate floor this week are measures that would: replace the expansive safe harbor for forward-looking statements with a directive to the S.E.C. to continue its rulemaking efforts in this area; lengthen the statute of limitations for private securities fraud actions; fully restore aiding and abetting liability under the securities laws, an established concept that, before it was recently removed by a Supreme Court decision, made it possible to sue even indirect participants in a fraud, and lift the severe limitations the bill imposes on joint and several liability, allowing investors to continue recovering from all participants in the fraud. **********The difference between reform and repeal of securities litigation is an enormous one for middle-class investors in America. Based on current payments to securities class-action claimants, it should be expected that shutting the doors of America's courthouses over the next five years to securities fraud victims will result in 1.79 million investors losing the right to recover approximately $2.87 billion.

Since a quake struck Tangshan nearly 19 years ago, they have shown through enterprise and determination that life goes on even in the face of devastation and death 50 times greater than the disaster that hit the industrial city in western Japan last week. **********\"We know what it's like,\" Mr. He said, standing in the preserved ruins of a library on the campus of the Tangshan Institute of Technology. The building is one of seven memorials to the destructive power of the vast quake, which killed 242,000 people and injured 160,000 when it struck at 3:42 A.M. on July 28, 1976. **********China has borne the brunt of some of the worst earthquakes on record, at a cost of 550,000 lives in this century alone. The Tangshan quake is believed to be the world's third-most destructive in 2,000 years. Nearly a generation later, many older city residents still cannot bear to talk about it. **********The quake measured 7.8 on the Richter scale. For 20 seconds the landscape heaved repeatedly, pummeling the city of just over a million residents with earth-splitting jolts and causing all but a handful of buildings to collapse on sleeping residents. **********All communications were cut off. People crawled from the rubble dazed and in darkness. A light drizzle was falling. Nearly one-fourth of Tangshan's residents were dead. **********\"Seven thousand families were completely exterminated,\" said Lu Shushan, a city official who in 1976 was a Chinese teacher at the No. 13 Middle School. He was buried when his house collapsed but managed to struggle out of the rubble by himself. **********\"It was very silent for a few seconds, and then you began to hear the shouts and cries,\" said Liu Chuanzhen, a member of the city planning commission who also pulled herself out of her collapsed house that day. **********It took 12 hours for the central authorities in Beijing to discover that Tangshan, at the quake's epicenter, had been completely leveled. **********Mao lay dying, and his potential successors were engaged in a fierce power struggle. They learned of the scale of the disaster only because a Tangshan coal miner, Li Yulin, drove a red ambulance for six hours along dirt roads to reach Beijing. His face muddied and clothes tattered, he rolled right up to the imposing gates of Zhongnanhai, the high-walled compound where China's leaders live, to give his report. **********It took days to mobilize the army and start relief operations. The Tangshan residents dug with their hands, stacking tens of thousands of bodies along the alleyways and roads so choked by debris that the trucks could not always get through to remove the dead. **********Airplanes flew over the city spewing disinfectant to stop the spread of disease. **********China's leaders forbade foreigners from traveling to the area and rejected offers of aid from international relief agencies. Instead, they organized a lean recovery operation whose name reflected the politics of the time: \"Resist the Earthquake and Rescue Ourselves.\" **********It was a time of eating bitterness, as the Chinese like to say. With no water and only bags of biscuits dropped from airplanes in the first days, the people of this city had little time to mourn the dead, whose bodies were dumped in mass graves. **********\"No one cried,\" recalled Mr. Lu. \"It was so big and so many people died that the streets and alleys were all piled up with corpses. People didn't even think to cry.\" **********It took China more than a decade to rebuild the city. Some residents did not get new housing until 1988. The central Government called on China's provinces to send planners and engineers to Tangshan. The city of Shanghai took responsibility for one neighborhood, and Sichuan, Hubei and Shanxi provinces took responsibility for others. **********\"Basically, a whole new city was planned on top of the ruins,\" said Zhao Shuzhen, the municipal secretary. The Chinese Communist Party apparatus mobilized volunteer construction brigades, and factories contributed construction materials. Tangshan residents did the rest. **********Tangshan's rebirth has coincided with China's opening to the outside world, after the death of Mao only weeks after the earthquake and the rise of Deng Xiaoping a year later as China's paramount leader. **********In Chinese history, disasters are said to foretell the end of dynasties or the deaths of great leaders. Many Chinese saw the Tangshan earthquake as an omen of Mao's passing, just as some Chinese today say the Kobe quake may presage the death of Mr. Deng, who is 90 and in declining health. **********Today, Tangshan is again a prosperous industrial city. The population has grown to 1.55 million, and economic output has increased sixfold since 1976. The city now ranks 23d among China's 460 urban centers in the total value of its industrial and agricultural production. **********Foreign companies have signed contracts to invest more than $1 billion in the city's 550 joint ventures. Though Tangshan preserves its earthquake memorials, municipal leaders now prefer, as they do throughout China, to steer any conversation to foreign investment and how to attract more of it. **********Yet the scars remain, some less visible than others. A mental hospital still shelters those who broke under the strain. A hospital for paraplegics cares for people who were maimed or crushed. **********On a recent sunny afternoon at the Institute of Technology, an elderly man with a snowy white beard shuffled along the walkway. He was asked if he remembered the events of that day. **********\"Oh, I remember,\" he said.

In a second spot, for a line of popcorn cakes in test markets, he makes only a cameo appearance at the end. **********The case of the missing popcorn pitcher isn't difficult to solve. The reason is age: not Mr. Redenbacher's -- he turned 88 yesterday -- but rather consumer demographics. The face of the brand, No. 1 by a wide margin in the microwave popcorn market, is being reshaped by Ketchum Advertising San Francisco, its agency since 1975, to appeal to snackers aged 25 to 34. They prefer potato chips or pretzels to popcorn because the gratification found inside a microwave oven isn't instant enough. **********\"He's 88, but he's a very vibrant man still out there spreading the word,\" said David Rohdy, marketing director for the Orville Redenbacher's brand at the Hunt-Wesson division of Conagra Inc. in Fullerton, Calif. **********\"Microwaving, in general, tends to skew to consumers over age 35,\" he added. \"We see an opportunity to bring in a younger group.\" So in the Redenbudders commercial, a couple of 20-somethings are the sole stars, unchaperoned by Mr. Redenbacher. And in the spot for Orville Redenbacher's 100 Percent Popcorn Cakes, the plot centers on office workers who hide the snack from their officious boss. **********The remaking of the Orville Redenbacher's image speaks to a larger point about the care and feeding of powerful brand icons: the only constant is change. **********For instance, General Mills has had to update the look of the make-believe Betty Crocker six times after the first portrait of the character was commissioned in 1936, most recently in 1986. But perhaps because a single painting cannot convey the diversity of contemporary cooks -- including many Benny Crockers -- a red spoon with the Betty Crocker signature always appears now in place of the portrait. **********As the irascible Frank Perdue began turning over the operations of Perdue Farms to his son, Jim, advertising by Lowe & Partners/SMS in New York, a unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, featured both men for several months last year before switching to solo son spots. **********And the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings has shifted to multiple camels in campaigns for Camel cigarettes: Old Joe, the venerable original mascot; Joe Camel, the cartoon version peddling Camel Filters and Camel Lights, and updated versions of Old Joe for store signs and promotional programs like a series of \"Classic Camel Collector's Packs,\" featuring vintage advertisements, going on sale next month. **********The issue is \"holding onto the characteristics of the brand,\" said Tom Freyer, a senior vice president and creative director at Ketchum San Francisco, owned by Ketchum Communications. **********\"Orville will always be a strong presence,\" Mr. Freyer added, \"because he built the company, he built the brand. We've done a lot of research and to consumers he is popcorn. **********\"At the same time, you want the brand to have its own identity to some degree.\" **********Mr. Rohdy concurred. \"Consumers want to know it's from Orville and has his quality standards,\" he said. But particularly with newer products like Redenbudders and the popcorn cakes, \"we found the name is definitely enough to communicate that,\" he added. **********The Redenbudders commercial will appear through the fall on local and national broadcast and cable stations and networks. Though Mr. Rodhy declined to discuss the budget, he said the brand typically spends $5 million to $7 million on introductions. **********The popcorn cakes spot has been running since February in two test-market regions; one is Albany, Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse, and the other is Denver, Phoenix and Salt Lake City. A third region -- Cleveland, Detroit, Pittsburgh and Grand Rapids, Mich. -- is being added this month.

But no one can know yet from the scant emerging evidence whether the slowdown will turn out to be only a lull -- followed by another stretch of strong growth -- or the beginning of a slide toward much slower economic growth, if not recession. **********Auto sales and home construction, the two pillars of growth, remain mostly intact. But once built, the new homes now sell less quickly. Many retailers find they must offer bigger discounts to keep people buying. Manufacturers say that while they are still very busy, new orders are not as numerous. And last month, for the first time since 1992, the unemployment rate rose. **********\"I am hearing in the past two months comments that I had not heard before, comments that new orders are flat or slowing,\" said Ralph Kaufman of the National Association of Purchasing Managers, which conducts a monthly survey of its members, who are all in manufacturing. \"Some of the managers feel that the higher interest rates are starting to take hold.\" **********Yet the hard data is far from conclusive. \"It is mostly straws in the wind, a sense things are not going as well as they had been,\" said Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office. **********No straw seems more noticeable than the stockpiles of merchandise and materials piling up at stores and warehouses. Virtually every forecaster expects stockpiling to be less robust this year than last, helping to slow the economy. The slowdown could turn into a recession in the unlikely event merchants decided, more or less simultaneously, that they had stockpiled much more than they could sell. After all, their inventories in the last quarter reached three times standard levels -- and a reluctance to order more goods would have a ripple effect. **********Factories would be forced to cut back, layoffs would rise, consumer confidence would falter and the economy would slow sharply. That sequence has been a major cause of recessions in the past. **********\"The most important ingredient for a slowdown is in place,\" said Robert Gordon, a Northwestern University economist. **********But right now, the nation's merchants are not talking cutback. \"Our inventories are right where we expect them to be,\" said Harold Ruttenberg, chairman of Just for Feet, a chain of 15 sporting goods stores based in Birmingham, Ala. **********Still, some store owners are clearly concerned. \"We had a very strong Christmas season, but my inventory is higher than I want,\" said Craig Cooper, owner of Bikes to You, a bicycle shop in Grinnell, Iowa. \"My suppliers are eager to extend credit to me to get their goods into the store. Ultimately, as the retailer, I have the final say, but they are offering discounts and deals on credit that I just cannot refuse.\" **********Economic recoveries in the United States typically alternate between strong growth and lulls. That was the pattern during the recovery that lasted through most of the 1980's. A lull now would be the second in the current recovery, which began in March 1991, with the end of the last recession. The first came in the winter and spring of 1993. **********The Federal Reserve, of course, has been encouraging the onset of a lull by raising interest rates steadily since last February, and most recently last week, when it raised the lending rates it controls by half of a percentage point -- hoping to slow the economy by damping demand for housing, cars and other goods and services purchased on credit. Less growth, in turn, would keep inflation from rising. **********So far 15 months of strong economic growth have produced neither rising inflation nor rising wage levels, the principal source of inflation. But Fed officials and many economists say that absent a lull, in which economic growth would decline to an annual rate of 2.5 percent from the current 4 percent, both phenomena are just around the corner. **********In their view, the economy is too much like it was in 1988 and 1989. In those years, labor costs and the inflation rate rose after a period of low unemployment and weak inflation very much like today. Although the unemployment rate rose by three-tenths of 1 percent in January, to 5.7 percent, many economists consider that rate still low enough to produce labor shortages and wage pressures. **********\"Economists are no better than the readers of history,\" Professor Gordon said, \"and the big historical caution is that in 1988 and 1989, inflation did accelerate.\" **********The antidote, rising interest rates, is beginning to have an effect and, if precedent holds, the effect will be even greater in 1995. Home sales, for example, have fallen since October, partly in response to a 30-year mortgage rate that averages 9.1 percent today, more than two percentage points higher than late 1993. And rising rates might help to account for a phenomenon that manufacturers are just beginning to report. **********Manufacturing has played an important role in the robust growth. Factories have operated at full capacity, and while wage levels have not risen, overtime pay and bonuses have put spending money in the pockets of tens of thousands of people. But now orders for production several months ahead are no longer growing at their old rate, according to the National Association of Purchasing Managers. **********The Mexican crisis might also be a factor. Exports have been an important source of new orders and sales, but that market might shrink this year, partly as a result of the Mexican crisis, with its ripple effect. Latin America accounts for more than 20 percent of this nation's overseas sales. **********Still, American consumers have been at the heart of the strong economic growth, and the rising interest rates have cut only slightly into their buying habits, says Richard T. Curtin, director of the University of Michigan's Survey Research Center. **********Mr. Curtin cites several reasons. What with overtime and more people holding jobs today than a year ago, the total income available for spending has risen, even though individual wages have not. Then, too, Mr. Curtin's surveys show that most consumers do not expect a recession, despite the rising interest rates, and for this reason, their fear of layoffs has diminished. **********\"There is some point when consumers will judge that current Fed policies have crossed some threshold and the rising rates will cause a recession,\" Mr. Curtin said. \"That threshold has not been crossed yet.\" **********Most important, consumers have adjusted. While in the past, they would have cut spending abruptly if their wages failed to rise faster than the inflation rate, today they keep spending as long as their wages manage to keep up with inflation. **********\"There was a sense in the 1970's that if you were not gaining ground on inflation, you must be losing ground; you could not stand still,\" Mr. Curtin said. \"That attitude is no longer true. There is greater acceptance now of slowly improving living standards.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/20/business/company-news-gillette-agrees-to-buy-a-maker-of-ear-thermometers.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1995-10-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 73, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GILLETTE AGREES TO BUY A MAKER OF EAR THERMOMETERS", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; GILLETTE AGREES TO BUY A MAKER OF EAR THERMOMETERS", "body_text": " **********The Gillette Company agreed to buy Thermoscan Inc., a maker of infrared ear thermometers, for $105 million in cash, Thermoscan said yesterday.

Moscow has often said that NATO should be subordinated to the Vienna-based Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a 54-member group that grew out of the cold war and that includes the United States, Russia and nearly all European states. **********\"Ultimately, allies will decide by consensus whether to invite each new member to join, according to their judgment of whether doing so will contribute to security and stability in the North Atlantic area at the time such a decision is to be made,\" the study said. **********New members would face \"substantial financial obligations,\" the study said, since they would be expected to make their equipment, headquarters and operating procedures compatible with NATO's and help pay for joint military programs and peacekeeping operations. **********\"There is no a priori requirement for the stationing of nuclear weapons on the territory of new members,\" it said in an attempt to reassure Russia that expanding the alliance would not mean advancing NATO's nuclear arsenal to Moscow's western doorstep. **********\"In light of both the current international environment and the potential threats facing the alliance, NATO's current nuclear posture will, for the foreseeable future, continue to meet the requirements of an enlarged alliance,\" the study continued, though it added that this could change. **********\"For new members, the peacetime stationing of other allies' forces on their territory should neither be a condition of membership nor foreclosed as an option,\" it continued, adding that NATO currently had no intention of moving troops eastward. **********\"All allies must of course be prepared in times of crisis or war to allow other allies' forces to enter and operate on their territory,\" it said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/19/business/bellsouth-seeking-savings-is-planning-more-job-cuts.html": {"writer_name": "Mark Landler", "pub_date": "1995-05-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 703, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BellSouth, Seeking Savings, Is Planning More Job Cuts", "print_headline": "BellSouth, Seeking Savings, Is Planning More Job Cuts", "body_text": " **********Conceding that an earlier program of job cuts had not reduced costs enough, the BellSouth Corporation said yesterday that it would reduce its work force by another 9,000 to 11,000 employees by the middle of 1997. **********BellSouth announced its first big cutback, of 10,200 employees, in late 1993. The company, based in Atlanta, said yesterday that only 5,200 workers, or about half the projected number, had retired or been laid off so far. That means BellSouth must remove 14,000 to 16,000 more workers from its payroll in the next two years. **********\"We still are not at the cost levels we need to be competitive in this marketplace,\" said Jere A. Drummond, president and chief executive of BellSouth Telecommunications, the company's core subsidiary, which offers local phone service to more than 14 million customers in nine states throughout the South. **********Mr. Drummond added that 70 percent of the reductions would affect blue-collar workers and 30 percent would affect white-collar employees. **********The job cuts will not end with this reduction, either. Mr. Drummond informed employees of BellSouth yesterday that the company would initiate another round of cuts in the fall, though that reduction would be far smaller. Mr. Drummond said that by 1997, BellSouth will have slashed its labor force by 30 percent, to roughly 58,000. The company began trimming in 1991. **********Shares of BellSouth fell $1.375, to $60.625, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. **********All seven regional Bell companies have struggled to rein in costs as their once-protected markets have opened to new competition from long-distance carriers and cable television companies. For many of them, that has meant huge job cuts. **********Mr. Drummond said BellSouth had worked assiduously to reduce its costs by replacing aging equipment and shutting or consolidating service centers. But the company still ranks as the second-costliest operator among the Bells. According to Furman Selz, an investment firm, only the Nynex Corporation has higher costs. **********Elaine Altman, a telecommunications analyst at Furman Selz, said BellSouth had an added incentive to streamline, because the company recently won regulatory relief in two states, Georgia and North Carolina. The BellSouth rates in those states had previously been set to generate a predetermined rate of return. **********Now, however, BellSouth will be able to retain the extra cash it generates through cost savings. \"There's some head room and incentive to cut costs under these new regulations,\" Mrs. Altman said. **********Mr. Drummond said the new reductions could result in a charge against the company's earnings. But he said BellSouth had not made a final judgment because new, generally accepted accounting principles required companies to describe very specifically the financial impact of a work-force reduction. BellSouth would not be able to establish the cost of its cuts until sometime this summer, he said. **********BellSouth took a charge of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion to cover its last cutback. That charge, though, included a write-down of aging equipment and plant consolidations. If BellSouth takes a charge this time, Mr. Drummond said, it will be in the range of $300 million to $400 million. **********Until now, analysts considered BellSouth something of a laggard among the Bells in preparing for new competition. To a certain extent, the company has not had to worry that much: Its mostly rural markets have attracted fewer new rivals than the more urban markets served by Nynex or the Pacific Telesis Group. **********Pacific Telesis said on Monday that it was reducing its projected earnings for 1995 by 10 percent, in part because of fierce competition from the AT&T Corporation and the MCI Communications Corporation in the short-haul long-distance market. Long-distance carriers are not allowed into that market in most states in the BellSouth region. **********But Mr. Drummond said BellSouth was starting to feel the pressure from its new rivals, particularly in the lucrative access market, in which calls are handed off from long-distance to the local phone network. **********Mr. Drummond said BellSouth had reduced the access fee it charged to long-distance carriers by 18 percent since 1989, in response to the inroads made by so-called competitive access providers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/22/business/dismissal-of-security-expert-adds-fuel-to-internet-debate.html": {"writer_name": "John Markoff", "pub_date": "1995-03-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 793, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dismissal of Security Expert Adds Fuel to Internet Debate", "print_headline": "Dismissal of Security Expert Adds Fuel to Internet Debate", "body_text": " **********Depending on your attitude toward Satan, a skilled computer security expert named Dan Farmer is either a genius or a menace. **********Satan is a sophisticated software program, intended to find the security flaws in any computer system linked to the global Internet.

So, on Monday, Silicon Graphics dismissed him. **********The sacking of Mr. Farmer, who helped develop Satan on his own time, adds fuel to a controversy that has swirled around him in recent weeks as he has ignored the threat of lawsuits and various other forms of pressure to keep Satan on a short leash. **********In the Internet community, Mr. Farmer's case is seen as symbolizing the conflict between a time-honored ideal -- the free flow of information in cyberspace -- and the harsh new reality that corporations and government agencies must protect their computer systems against intruders and vandals armed with increasingly sophisticated break-in software. **********\"This is the classic double-edged sword,\" said Peter Neumann, a computer scientist at SRI International, a research and consulting organization in Menlo Park, Calif. **********\"You have to get the information about how bad things are to people in order to fix the problems,\" Mr. Neumann said. \"On the other hand, you run the risk of this information falling into the hands of sinister elements.

But Sun's lawyers see Mr. Farmer as a walking liability suit and are urging management to steer clear for the time being. They fear reprisals from government agencies, universities or corporations that may end up having their networks burglarized by Satan-wielding break-in artists. **********\"This lawyer's liability consciousness is exactly what the problem is,\" said John Gage, the director of the science office at Sun Microsystems. \"The spirit of Dan Farmer's software is what we need to make complex computer systems secure.\" **********Silicon Graphics, which has offered Mr. Farmer a severance package, said it had tried to be even-handed with him. **********\"We've been discussing this issue with Dan and we've agreed mutually that parting company at this time is appropriate,\" said William Kelly, the vice president of business development at Silicon Graphics. \"It's fair to say that we at SGI did not agree with the distribution plan he has for that product.\" **********Mr. Farmer said he understood, but disagreed with, Silicon Graphics. **********\"They're a corporation and they have to do what they have to do,\" he said. **********But Mr. Farmer says he, too, must do what he has to do. \"In a way, it's a freedom of speech issue,\" he said. \"I want to teach people and have them learn about computer security.\" **********Mr. Farmer said he had been developing Satan with a Dutch friend and colleague, Wietse Venema, and had intended all along to distribute it far, wide and free. It is scheduled to be released on April 5, Mr. Farmer's birthday. **********The issue of whether little-known computer security flaws should be widely publicized has long been discussed among the computer experts who care for and maintain the computer hardware and software that make up the Internet. **********One camp argues that the community of systems administrators who maintain computers is inherently lazy and will not make needed security changes unless forced to do so. **********But other, more conservative, computer security workers are aghast at the prospect of an automated software tool like Satan being made available to anyone who wants to look for holes in computer network defenses.

The decision by several large countries to sell off Government-controlled industries is one big engine of growth. Yet deficits, inflation and joblessness keep hampering the pace of recovery in many countries. **********For many nations, 1994 was a turnaround year as they began pulling out of recession. Some of the hottest economies, and targets of foreign investment, emerged in once-overlooked markets of Southeast Asia and Latin America. **********China, a favored destination for foreign investment, slowed down its unrelenting growth last year to 11 percent, a still-formidable rate that strained the capacity of aging industries and power grids. Japan, no longer the growth model for Asia, tried to climb out of its prolonged slump, with growth of barely 1 percent in 1994. **********Political developments rattled countries like Mexico, where the peso plummeted after being freed to float against the dollar. Eastern Europe continued to slough off old Communist habits. But in Russia, the best economic news may have been that growth dropped off only 8 percent in 1994, compared with double-digit declines in the previous two years. **********Trade liberalization became an international byword, notably with the North American Free Trade Association, now a year old. But frontier barriers were also lowered within Europe and Latin America, even as Washington's trade frictions with Japan and China festered. The European Union expanded to 15 countries. And the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade transformed itself into a sleeker new World Trade Organization. **********For Mexico, 1994 should have been a year to remember. Instead, almost everyone would just as soon forget it. Expectations were dashed from the very first when, instead of entering triumphantly into the North American Free Trade Agreement and the club of developed nations that membership had come to represent, Mexico looked down the barrel of a rebel's gun in the southern state of Chiapas. **********The disappointments continued throughout the year and hit bottom the week before Christmas with a clumsy forced devaluation of the peso that cost investors in the United States and Mexico billions of dollars overnight. **********The expected economic lift that was to have come from the trade pact never really materialized, and the Mexican stock exchange ended the year well below the 3,000 level that optimistic financial analysts had predicted. Mexican exports to the United States increased over the year, but so did imports from north of the border. Mergers and acquisitions of Mexican businesses by bigger companies in the United States and elsewhere meant that many Mexicans, from executives to line workers, lost their jobs. **********The new President, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, is a Yale-trained economist whose beliefs in the open market will be tested as he tries to rebuild Mexico's collapsed economic strategy. He closed the year by bringing another economist educated at Stanford, Guillermo Ortiz Martinez, as his new Finance Minister after the old one, Jaime Serra Puche, resigned following his erratic performance during the peso's slide. **********The official Government targets for 1995 are a tidy 4 percent growth and 4 percent inflation, with a balanced budget and increased social spending. But after the devaluation, the Government had to go back to the drawing board and start over. Even officials ended the year without any clear idea of what would happen in 1995. **********The nightmare of 1994 has not ended, especially after the devaluation. The Zapatista uprising in Chiapas is still unresolved, unemployment is still high and uncertainty remains a constant. The hopes for Mexico's getting an investment-grade rating any time soon have all but disappeared. The Standard & Poor's rating service, which some analysts had thought would promote Mexico to investment grade in 1994, ended the year by putting Mexican foreign debt on a credit watch. **********The other political shocks last year -- two assassinations, post-election unrest, kidnappings and infighting within the ruling Party of Revolutionary Institutions -- also took their toll as did interest rate increases in the United States that drained investor money from Mexico. **********But many investors stuck with Mexico anyway, realizing that the ability of the country to continue even after such shocks was a sign that its financial institutions functioned well, even if its political institutions did not. **********The first order of business in 1995 will be to regain their confidence.

Microsoft, the world's largest software publisher, dominates the market for Macintosh software, including a 65 percent share of Macintosh word processing programs. **********But the Word controversy is threatening Microsoft's control of that niche, as a growing number of Macintosh customers have begun switching to word processing programs from several smaller companies. Macintosh users complain that the new version of the Microsoft program, Word 6.0, is too slow and unwieldy and has too many bugs. **********They also contend that the program, released last fall, has not been adequately fine-tuned to the requirements of the Apple Macintosh, and that it is merely a rough translation of the version of Word 6.0 that Microsoft sells for the world's far larger number of I.B.M.-compatible personal computers. **********Like many other software companies, Microsoft has at times rankled users by introducing a version of a product that failed to meet their expectations or contained a seemingly unreasonable number of bugs. Microsoft officials say that there is nothing unusual or alarming about the Word 6.0 uproar, and that the company is rushing to address the concerns. **********But many Macintosh users see the problem as an early sign that Microsoft may be growing so big and diverse that it cannot focus on important details of a specific product -- or so powerful that it doesn't care to sweat the small stuff. **********\"Pass the Cranberry Sauce, This One's a Turkey,\" read the headline of a review of Word 6.0 in the current issue of the quarterly journal of the Berkeley Macintosh Users Group. **********\"Word is Microsoft's flagship product,\" said Bob Thyken, executive director of the Berkeley group, one of the country's largest organizations of corporate and individual Macintosh users. \"It makes people think twice about the company.\" **********Another review, in Macweek magazine, said that the task of counting words took almost 11 times longer with Word 6.0, compared with the previous version of the software. **********Seeking to quell the complaints, Microsoft has announced a free maintenance version of the program, due by the end of March, to fix bugs. And the company, based in Redmond, Wash., has scheduled a meeting to discuss the problem with analysts and reporters on Jan. 30 in Cupertino, Calif., the city where Apple is based. **********\"We think we understand the issues and are addressing them,\" said Pete Higgins, Microsoft's senior vice president of desktop applications. **********To be sure, Microsoft still rules the software world and remains enormously profitable. Two days ago, the company reported an earnings increase of 29 percent for its second quarter -- to $373 million -- on the strength of better-than-expected sales of its products, which cover a range of business, home-office and consumer software. Such profits can help finance the company's ambitious expansion plans into fields like home banking and on-line services, and providing access to the Internet global computer network. **********But some analysts see signs that Microsoft may be spreading itself too thin. They see symptoms of a company where the nimbleness necessary for top-flight computer programming is in danger of being overwhelmed by a bureaucratic software development organization. **********The uproar over the new Macintosh Word program, which was six months late when it reached the market, comes as the company is encountering continued delays in introducing the next version of its Windows operating system. And a new program called Bob, scheduled to be released in March and intended to be consumer friendly, has been criticized as condescending and inefficient by some industry reviewers. **********In recent years, Microsoft has assumed the industry role formerly occupied by the International Business Machines Corporation, influencing the direction of the computer business by defining standards and controlling markets for software. But in the late 1980's, I.B.M. lost contact with new technology trends and with customers, and saw its influence wane. Now a favorite topic of industry conversation is whether Microsoft will be able to avoid that fate. **********\"They feel they're in control of the marketplace,\" said Stewart Alsop, editor of Infoworld, a weekly computer industry newspaper, \"But things may be getting out of control.\" **********Apple Computer Inc. produces the operating system software that controls the basic workings of a Macintosh computer. But Microsoft is the leading provider of application software for the Macintosh, with programs like Word and the Excel spreadsheet. **********Over all, Macintosh programs are a $400 million business for Microsoft, but that constitutes less than 8 percent of the company's revenue. And many Macintosh users contend that Word 6.0 is evidence that Microsoft is paying too little attention to their needs. **********\"It's simple,\" said Steven Levy, a columnist for Macworld magazine. \"Microsoft's message to Macintosh users is, 'Drop dead!' \" **********Reviewers in Macworld and other trade magazines have found that the program takes about three times as long to start up, and runs at about half the speed, as Microsoft's previous version, Word 5.1. **********The Macworld review, for example, reported that on a Macintosh Centris 610 model, the Word program took more than 7 minutes to start. And counting the words in a long document took 5 minutes and 48 seconds, compared with 33 seconds in Word 5.1, according to a review in Macweek. **********The performance decline, computer experts said, is a result of Microsoft's using common underlying software for both the Intel-compatible PC and Macintosh versions of Word 6.0, but refining it first and more successfully for the PC program. The PC version, released in the second half of 1993, has generated no performance-related complaints. **********Some critics say Word 6.0 also suffers from \"feature creep\" -- the tendency to add dozens of new features to each new version of a program, creating a slower program that requires many times as much memory and disk storage space. Fully installed, Word 6.0 requires 25 million bytes of disk space. Word 5.1 needed only 6 million. **********Such weaknesses have opened a large hole for smaller competitors like Novell Inc.'s Wordperfect unit and tiny Nisus Software Inc.'s Nisus Writer. Both have recently enjoyed significant increases in word processing sales for the Macintosh market. **********Because Microsoft's Windows operating system competes directly with Apple's Macintosh software, some Macintosh users are always looking for signs of sabotage by Microsoft. But even some of the company's harshest critics see maladroitness, rather than malevolence, in Microsoft's handling of Word 6.0. **********\"The conspiracy theories are saying that this is Microsoft's attempt to undermine the Mac,\" said Jim Heid, an author who wrote the negative review in Macworld. \"But I'm in the camp that believes that even big companies can blow it.\" **********Microsoft executives said the disappointing performance of Word 6.0 for the Macintosh was a one-time foul-up. Using common underlying software code for its Macintosh and Windows-based applications is a new approach for Microsoft, the executives said, and the Word 6.0 problems are a result of a rough transition that is now behind the company. **********That explanation has done little to mollify some of Microsoft's largest corporate Macintosh users, who have told the software publisher that they are not willing to install Word 6.0 because they find it unusable. **********One California-based company whose work force uses more than 2,000 Macintoshes agreed in late 1993 to buy rights to use Word 6.0, based on demonstrations of a prototype version. The attractive new features included an electronic-bookmark feature that lets users quickly navigate through a long document. **********But 15 months later, the company has still not begun to use the program. \"As soon as we got it, we installed it on our server, but two weeks later the president of our company ordered us to take it off,\" said one of the company's computer managers, who spoke on the condition that neither he nor his company be identified. The software was simply too slow, he said. **********Customer dissatisfaction is evident at the retail level, as well. Computerware, the largest Macintosh dealer in Northern California, said it sold an equal number of copies of Wordperfect 3.0 and Macintosh Word 6.0 in December. With the earlier version, Word 5.1, Microsoft typically had a substantially larger share of the chain's sales. **********\"The problem you have when you get really big and really dominant is you lose touch a little bit,\" said Ken Krich, president of Computerware. \"It's a challenge to keep listening to your customers.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/02/world/a-deficit-reins-in-sweden-s-welfare-state.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Stevenson", "pub_date": "1995-02-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1390, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Deficit Reins In Sweden's Welfare State", "print_headline": "A Deficit Reins In Sweden's Welfare State", "body_text": " **********In the last six decades, Sweden has built one of the world's most generous and successful social welfare systems, providing its citizens with a lifelong array of benefits that help them maintain a high standard of living through good times and bad. **********But now, unable to afford the bill, the country is being forced to pare social welfare spending. Although the cuts have so far hardly been Draconian, there is widespread anxiety that the system, long seen as the model for combining socialist welfare policies with vibrant capitalism, could collapse under its own economic weight. **********The strains are already beginning to show. Despite Sweden's commitment to universally available child care, local authorities in some areas have had to reduce spending on subsidized day-care centers. **********In the last few years, reductions have been made in unemployment insurance and in payments to workers injured on the job. Among a number of proposals likely to be enacted in coming months is a $17 reduction in the $100 monthly payment provided to every family for each child regardless of need. **********Nearly every industrialized country is seeking to overhaul its social welfare system. As in the United States, the issue is moving to the political forefront across Western Europe, where the high costs of maintaining generous benefits are increasingly seen as a drag on the economy. **********But no major Western nation faces financial pressure as intense as that of Sweden, where citizens remain downright coddled by American standards. Still, it is particularly unsettling to many Swedes that the most recently proposed cuts, the deepest so far, are being carried out under the party that built the system, the leftist Social Democrats. **********The party, the dominant political force since the 1930's, regained power in elections last fall after three years in opposition, in part because voters felt that the conservative Government had gone too far in dismantling Sweden's liberal system. **********\"We are just nine million people, and we should be able to take care of each other,\" said Annelie Drevstam, an assistant at a Stockholm photo agency. \"It's a new problem for Sweden that we have people living on the streets, and if I have to pay more in taxes or get less child allowance to help, I'm willing to do it.\" **********Yet Sweden already imposes one of the world's heaviest tax burdens to pay for its social largess, with total Government receipts in 1993 amounting to 58.3 percent of gross domestic product, compared with 31.1 percent in the United States. **********As a result some Swedes, including Ms. Drevstam's husband, Mika Laitanen, say their commitment to social welfare has its limits. **********Since the family is hoping to buy a house, Mr. Laitanen would like to see the Government do more to bring interest rates down, maybe even at the expense of cutting welfare, and he supports the tax-cutting philosophy of the conservatives. **********\"I would rather decide what I do with my money,\" said Mr. Laitanen, an electrician for the Swedish military. **********The Swedish system provides, among other benefits, a guarantee of close to a full income indefinitely in cases of sickness and unemployment. It covers medical care and subsidizes educational costs, sets minimum retirement income and provides paid leaves of absence for new parents. **********But faced with one of the developed world's worst budget deficits and plagued by a stubbornly high unemployment rate of 13 percent, Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson has had little choice but to push for spending cuts. **********In January the Government proposed a four-year, $15 billion program of spending cuts and tax increases, by far the biggest austerity package in the country's history, in an effort to stop the growth in the deficit and to bring down punishingly high interest rates. **********The deficit surged from 7.4 percent of gross domestic product in 1992 to 13.5 percent in 1993. Although it dropped slightly by some measures last year, it remains more than three times as high as the average ratio of 3.8 percent for the world's largest industrial countries. **********Mr. Carlsson said he was confident of getting his package through Parliament, despite complaints from the left that the cuts were too deep and from the right that he was relying too much on tax increases. By 1997, he said, the deficit should be down to around 7 percent of gross domestic product. **********Mr. Carlsson said his plan would bring financial stability to Sweden without forcing any wholesale changes in a system that extends far beyond providing a safety net for people who need help to recover from misfortune. **********Under Mr. Carlsson's plan, for example, Swedish women would continue to be encouraged to take a year off from work after the birth of a child, but they would be paid 75 percent of their former salary for the year, down from 80 percent. **********\"We're trimming the system, not dismantling it,\" Mr. Carlsson said in an interview. \"It's very clear to me as a Social Democrat that if we want a social welfare system, we have to have the income to pay for it. The condition for this is to strengthen the Swedish economy, and that's exactly what we are doing now.\" **********The slimming of the welfare state began under the previous, conservative Government, led by Carl Bildt. In three stormy years as Prime Minister, he sought to impose a Thatcherite revolution on Sweden by cutting taxes, introducing free-market economic policies and asserting the need for more individual responsibility. **********But Mr. Bildt's tenure coincided with the worst recession in Sweden since the 1930's. The jobless rate went from almost nothing in 1991 to 13 percent last year. **********With the economy foundering and unemployment benefits and other welfare payments surging, Mr. Bildt's tax cuts led to a rising deficit. The problem was compounded when he was unable to find consensus in his coalition Government for large-scale spending cuts. **********Mr. Carlsson's budget strategy has set off protests from some of those affected, including several thousand students who marched in Stockholm in January to protest cuts in their grants. **********Many business executives and economists contend that the Government has been too timid in its cuts, though. **********\"In our view the proposed measures will not be sufficient, either in scope or direction, to achieve the necessary correction in state finances or the growth for which the Government is striving,\" the chairmen of eight of Sweden's largest companies -- including Volvo, Electrolux and the technology giant Ericsson -- said in a letter to Mr. Carlsson. **********Some analysts say that rather than snip around the edges of the benefit programs, the Government needs to engage in a wholesale reassessment of Sweden's priorities. **********\"Inevitably, the debt burden will force Swedes to make large-scale modifications to their public benefit programs and accept slower growth in their standard of living,\" said a report from Moody's Investors Service, which analyzes the financial condition of countries and companies. **********The need for a shift in public policy, Moody's said, \"has not yet been accepted widely by the full population.\" **********Sitting around their kitchen table in Skarpnack, a Stockholm suburb, Barry Andersson and his wife, Majvor Hansson, said the change that would be most widely felt -- the $17-a-month reduction in child benefit payments -- would not dent their comfortable middle-class life, even though they had two children. **********\"It's only because we've had such good times in Sweden that these small problems sometimes seem very big,\" Ms. Hansson said. **********Mr. Andersson, a chimney sweep, and Ms. Hansson, who works in a psychiatric clinic, said they were confident that the Social Democrats would try to keep the social welfare system intact. They expressed a vague unease that Sweden might be lurching toward much bigger changes, but they made clear that they still expected a lot from their Government. **********Mr. Andersson said he wished the Government would do more to reduce unemployment. Ms. Hansson said she wished the Government would come up with a program so that someone who was unemployed could take her job and she could take a year or two off -- with pay."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/27/business/company-news-semi-tech-to-buy-stake-in-japanese-electronics-maker.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-01-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 107, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SEMI-TECH TO BUY STAKE IN JAPANESE ELECTRONICS MAKER", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; SEMI-TECH TO BUY STAKE IN JAPANESE ELECTRONICS MAKER", "body_text": " **********The Semi-Tech (Global) Company said yesterday that it would buy 55 percent of a financially troubled Japanese electronics manufacturer in an effort to expand its worldwide business.

Then there was the case in January of baby Elisabetta, who was supposedly conceived from an egg taken from a woman who had died two years before and carried to term by her father's sister. **********With these and other tales of artificial fertilization making headlines, the next announcement was not as amazing as it might seem. **********\"A pregnant man? It could be,\" a newspaper said, citing a professor who had discussed the theoretical possibility of male pregnancy at a seminar here in Rome. **********It took a day or so for the story to be knocked down by other experts, who pointed out that science -- like the male body -- does have its limits. But the larger point struck home: Italy is virtually the only country in Europe that still has no law, no controls, not even any minimum regulations governing more than 100 private clinics that perform various fertilization procedures. **********This legal vacuum has led to charges that Italy has become the Wild West in a rapidly shifting field of biomedicine that carries profound ethical as well as social and health implications. Politicians say Italy has become a mecca for foreign women who come here for \"procreative tourism.\" **********\"We have no law, which means everything imaginable is legal,\" said Francesco D'Agostino, president of the Committee on Bioethics, whose proposal for a set of regulations on fertility centers is still sitting in Parliament. \"There is widespread acceptance of fertility assistance. The case of Elisabetta, for instance, was viewed by the public as a great curiosity, not as a scandal. Public opinion did not say, 'No.' Most people said, 'Why not?' \" **********It is no small paradox that all this goes on next door to the Vatican, which has taken a harsh stand against any fertilization procedure that substitutes for the sexual act. Since it regards embryos as human beings, the Roman Catholic Church is particularly opposed to 'in vitro' fertilization, in which embryos are often destroyed -- a point reiterated in Pope John Paul II's encyclical last week. **********\"The Catholic Church is against any progress in this field,\" said Dr. Emanuele Lauricella, president of Cecos, a French organization operating 20 private fertility centers in Italy. \"Since the church holds to the principle that the sexual act must serve procreation, they say 'no' to birth control, 'no' to artificial procreation.\" **********In the years when Italy's old Christian Democratic Party was in power, no laws on artificial fertilization were passed. In 1985, the Health Minister -- a Christian Democrat -- issued an administrative circular to all public hospitals advising them not to undertake fertilization procedures unless they involved the sperm and the egg of married couples. **********The result has been a sprouting of private clinics. In late 1992, the Italian Register for Medically Assisted Procreation listed 57 clinics; today, the number is 120. **********But the registry has no control over the clinics, none of which are licensed, and registration is voluntary. **********By Dr. Lauricella's estimate, 2,000 artificial fertilization procedures are done each year in Italy, 500 of them at Cecos clinics. Without a monitoring system, it is difficult to know the true number, but the fact is that in this predominantly Catholic country, the church's strictures are clearly ignored by many couples. **********Fertility doctors say many of their patients are devout Catholics who in a number of cases are referred by priests looking to help childless couples. **********But the legal loophole is upsetting to many doctors, who want to see some controls. Cecos, for instance, refuses women over 45 and single mothers, with some rare exceptions. **********Dr. Severino Antinori, a pioneer in fertility treatments for post-menopausal women, rejects the idea of such categorical refusals. \"The limit is not age; the limit is physical,\" he said. \"What I want to see is a law that controls the centers, and not the wishes of the people.\" **********Of the 300 post-menopausal women who have come to him for treatment to get pregnant, he said, he agreed to treat only 70, all successfully. **********Most countries in Europe long ago adopted licensing procedures, which control the quality of centers, monitor donated sperm and eggs and limit the time embryos can be kept frozen. In the United States, a Federal law has been passed to require fertility clinics to register, report success rates and certify laboratories. **********The push for legislation in Italy has gathered steam in recent months. The Italian Medical Association last weekend leapt into the fray with its own rules, barring doctors from using artificial fertilization treatment on women over 50, single women and lesbians. **********The association's rules are being contested by some doctors, including Dr. Antinori, who has called them \"dangerous and illegitimate.\" **********But Mr. D'Agostino says the quandary of Italian politicians is that they are not quite sure which way to go. \"Politicians are not sure what the public opinion is, and they have a fear of losing consensus,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/14/business/media-business-advertising-companies-pursue-electronic-ways-insure-that-sports.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Sandomir", "pub_date": "1995-09-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 975, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Companies pursue electronic ways to insure that sports advertisers get the best sites in the house.", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Companies pursue electronic ways to insure that sports advertisers get the best sites in the house.", "body_text": " **********TELEVISION sports viewers who have just gotten used to rotating billboards behind home plate and at basketball scorers' tables might soon have to make another visual adjustment: ads inserted electronically during the action that appear to be part of the actual background. **********Before the year is out, a television network that has not been identified plans to offer its advertisers the option of having their ads appear in places where no ads have gone before or to have them superimposed over existing ones. The network will be able to do that through a digitalized system that maps landmarks, or optimal spots for ads, on the playing field. The system is being developed by Princeton Electronic Billboard, which is based in Princeton, N.J. **********With electronic signs, the same ad space could be sold again and again. For example, the prime space on the fence behind the tennis star Pete Sampras that bears the name of an American company could be bought by any number of companies in other countries whose television stations were simultaneously running the telecast and had the capability to accept electronic advertising. **********In test footage of a tennis match currently shown by Scidel Technologies Ltd., an Israeli company that is Princeton Electronic's main competitor, stationary ads depicting corporate logos are inserted during action in the service courts, doubles alleys and backcourts. **********\"This has all sorts of possibilities,\" said Mark Bingham, vice president of marketing for the New York Mets baseball team. \"Signs can be changed thousands of times. You can probably put ads on someone's helmet.\" **********But Steve Schanwald, vice president of marketing for the Chicago Bulls basketball team, said he was unimpressed with electronic signs. \"There's a prohibition against it in the N.B.A.,\" he said. \"It holds no interest for me. Even if it were allowed, I wouldn't want my ads covered over, and I wouldn't want to do it to anybody else's signs.\" **********As long as sports events have been televised, there have been signs on fences and in arenas. In recent years, teams have used rotating billboards that show a new message every few minutes and can be sold to as many as 30 advertisers per game. The billboards are there for TV viewers -- the backdrop to 7-foot-tall men running back and forth on a basketball court or behind the baseball batter. **********Dorna U.S.A., the American subsidiary of Dorna Promocion del Deporte S.A., a sports marketing company based in Madrid, dominates the market for rotating signs. Its Adtime systems are in 15 major league baseball stadiums, 16 National Basketball Association arenas and 5 National Hockey League arenas. Full-season contracts can cost $200,000. **********But companies like Princeton Electronic and Scidel are counting on electronic advertising to generate far more revenue than its mechanical counterpart. In recent months Princeton Electronic has tested its system during baseball games of the major-league Florida Marlins and the minor-league Trenton Thunder, and at an international broadcast of the Parmalat Cup, a soccer tournament, at Giant Stadium in New Jersey. **********With the Princeton Electronic system, ads can be inserted into live action -- that is, foul balls pass over the ads, as do swinging bats. Princeton Electronic focuses on up to 16 landmarks. \"You need that many, because some get covered up during a game,\" said Sam McCleery, the company's vice president of marketing. \"You always need four or five visible.\" A digital map of the landmarks is saved, and during a game ads are inserted into them. **********Scidel, whose main investor is Scitex, the Israeli maker of imaging equipment that is a subsidiary of the IDB Holding Corporation, has been showing tapes of its system to networks and advertisers but acknowledges that it is behind Princeton Electronic in development. Right now, Scidel cannot insert ads into live action. **********Princeton Electronic and Scidel are carving different niches in the emerging market. Princeton Electronic wants to be in the existing billboard segment. Scidel wants to insert signs and logos onto the floors of stadiums and arenas, where corporate logos often appear during college bowl games. **********\"I know we won't be doing the Super Bowl,\" said Kobi Bendel, executive director of Scidel, \"but there are many other small events in thousands of cities that need this extra money.\" **********For the moment, these are among the commercial possibilities of electronic advertising: ***********If, for example, the Yankees were playing the Tigers in Detroit in a game shown in New York on the MSG Network, signs at home plate that now show Motown-based advertisers could be electronically covered with those of local advertisers. ***********During a nationally broadcast game, General Motors might want to regionalize its messages by putting a Pontiac sign in the Northeast market, a Cadillac sign in the West and an Oldsmobile sign in the Midwest. ***********On a soccer telecast beamed to 50 countries, a global company might want to pitch itself in dozens of languages or to plug the divisions it owned in those nations. **********Because electronic signs have yet to be introduced, it is unclear whether the sports leagues will allow them or whether advertisers will go for them. **********Mr. Bingham of the Mets envisions problems ahead. \"While Toyota and Sharp love being seen around the country,\" he said, \"I can see them saying, 'You've taken away half our value' if they were covered up electronically.\" **********He said electronic billboard signs could work only if agreements were reached between teams that would allow them without a legal war. But he is not ready for such signs on the actual playing fields. \"I wouldn't want to see a running back, on third down and one, to have to cross a Modell sign for a touchdown,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/21/world/fortunes-of-bosnian-war-ease-us-military-tasks.html": {"writer_name": "Eric Schmitt", "pub_date": "1995-08-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 894, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fortunes of Bosnian War Ease U.S. Military Tasks", "print_headline": "Fortunes of Bosnian War Ease U.S. Military Tasks", "body_text": " **********Despite Western setbacks and miscalculations, the United States suddenly finds its risks in Bosnia greatly reduced. **********The dangers of the Balkans remain high, as the deaths on Saturday of three American diplomats on a rain-soaked mountain road near Sarajevo remind. But Pentagon planners say that the extrication of 24,000 United Nations forces from Bosnia would require far fewer troops for only a portion of the time previously estimated. Similarly, the size and risks of any peacekeeping operation could be smaller than had been thought. **********This all could have significant political consequences for 1996, since Administration officials say they will probably send American troops to Bosnia in the next year either to help withdraw the United Nations troops or to enforce a peace plan. **********A smaller operation with more manageable risks would probably pose less of a political liability for President Clinton during his re-election campaign, when his handling of the lingering crisis in Bosnia is likely to be an issue. **********Events of the last month, including the West's concession of two Muslim enclaves in Bosnia to Bosnian Serb rebels and a successful Croatian offensive that defied Pentagon predictions, have unexpectedly opened new diplomatic opportunities and foreclosed some difficult military missions. **********\"While losing the enclaves has been unfortunate for Bosnia, it's been great for us,\" said a senior Administration official. **********At the same time, any lessening of the military risks could undermine one of the Administration's central arguments for not flouting the arms embargo against the Bosnian Government. Defense Secretary William J. Perry has said that breaking the embargo would set off the withdrawal of United Nations peacekeepers, commit thousands of American troops to help them leave, and be \"risky, costly and shameful.\" **********With a resurgent Bosnian Army joined by its Croatian ally now standing up to rebel Serbian forces and pushing them back in some areas, and fewer United States troops needed to withdraw less vulnerable peacekeepers, Mr. Perry's warning may not be so dire. **********Administration officials say there are now three likely scenarios the Balkans crisis could follow: ***********The latest American peace plan fails, but the United Nations peacekeeping force, dominated by Britain and France, stays for another winter. ***********The negotiations fail and the United Nations pulls out. Without a firm peace plan, there is concern in Washington that Britain and France will decide by mid-September to leave. ***********The warring parties accept an American-brokered peace plan, and a NATO force roughly the size of the withdrawal force moves in to police the plan. **********President Clinton has promised to send as many as 25,000 American soldiers for a 70,000-member NATO force to extricate the United Nations peacekeepers spread out over Bosnia. The Pentagon said the operation could take 22 months to complete. As many as 10,000 of those United States troops could actually go into Bosnia itself, with the rest handling logistics in Croatia or remaining in reserve. **********But events of the last month have radically altered the Balkans map, and with it the risks and responsibilities for United States forces. **********Two precarious Muslim enclaves in eastern Bosnian -- Srebrenica and Zepa -- have been overrun by Bosnian Serb troops. The Croatian Army's offensive earlier this month relieved the siege of another enclave, Bihac. **********On Friday, the United Nations said it would withdraw its last remaining ground troops in Gorazde, a fourth enclave, and rely on air power alone to protect the civilians there. **********\"It's fair to say that the number of troops that might need to be evacuated from potentially hostile areas has been reduced by at least two-thirds,\" said a senior Administration official. **********The current evacuation plan assumes the worst: cramped sea ports, snow, fighting and poor roads. But with the changes on the ground, a spirited debate has broken out in the Administration over how large a withdrawal force would be needed. **********Defense Secretary William J. Perry and Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, are arguing to keep as robust a force as possible to deal with all possible contingencies with the lowest casualties. But other State Department and White House officials are trying to pare the force down to make it more palatable to a Congress wary of sending ground troops to Bosnia, even to help extract America's allies. **********But most peacekeepers could probably now drive themselves out of well-defended central Bosnia through Croatia. At worst, peacekeepers could be helicoptered out after they disabled their equipment. Military officials say this could require a much smaller NATO force, and perhaps only a few thousand American troops, and take weeks, not months. **********Adm. Leighton W. Smith, the commander of NATO forces in southern Europe, has told his senior planners to submit revised draft withdrawal plan by this week. Admiral Smith is also expected to meet this week with senior American commanders from the various branches of the armed services who would take part in a withdrawal or peacekeeping plan. **********Since the negotiations over the American-brokered peace plan are still in a relatively early stage, it is hard to tell how many and what kind of military forces would be required. To be sure, any peacekeeping or peace enforcement mission would be risky, with possible American casualties. **********\"The hooker on this is we don't know what we're going to face,\" said a senior Pentagon official. \"Just three weeks ago, people talked about the Serbs winning it all.

Blinder, the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, which indicated that the Fed was unlikely to cut interest rates anytime soon without evidence that the economy is slowing. **********But as the price of the 30-year bond fell and its yield approached 7 percent, buyers began to emerge, traders said. **********The rebound was helped by a report on industrial production and capacity utilization, which was weaker than expected. **********The price of the 30-year bond settled up 24/32 of a percentage point, to 99 26/32 ; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, slipped to 6.89 percent, from 6.95 percent on Monday. **********The Federal Reserve said yesterday that industrial production rose one-tenth of 1 percent in July after a revised one-tenth of 1 percent drop in June. Industrial production was unchanged in May. Capacity utilization fell to 83.4 percent, the sixth consecutive monthly decline. While capacity use was a little higher than the 83.1 percent forecast, that was largely a result of increased use of electric power during the heat wave in July. **********\"Indeed, were it not for the heat wave, industrial production would have dropped in July,\" noted Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities. Manufacturing output dipped two-tenths of 1 percent, with motor vehicles the weakest sector and computer and office equipment the strongest. **********Bond prices opened lower after Mr. Blinder, in an interview Monday night, indicated that economy would have to weaken from current levels before the Fed would again push interest rates lower. **********Eric Hamilton, senior fixed-income analyst with Technical Data in Boston, said Mr. Blinder's comments \"spooked traders who were still factoring in the chance for another easing at next week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting.\" The committee sets Fed interest rate policy. **********But bonds soon recovered, rising in the late afternoon after the release of a Johnson Redbook report showing lackluster store sales in the first two weeks of August. **********Bonds were also bolstered by a surge in the dollar. The currency rose to its highest level in six months after the Fed and the Japanese and German central banks bought dollars on foreign exchange markets. **********Mr. Hamilton of Technical Data said the stronger dollar prompted those who were selling short, or betting that bond prices would fall, to cover their positions, pushing the market higher. **********\"Looking ahead, the stronger dollar intervention seen today should continue to have a positive impact on the market,\" he said. \"Those central banks now holding a fresh supply of dollars typically look to put these funds back into the Treasury market.\" This, he added, should be enough to keep the downside of the market protected over the next couple of trading sessions. **********Mr. Fine of Chase Securities, however, noted that the market could soon have other concerns. \"Lurking in the minds of bonds market participants is tomorrow's announcement of two-year and five-year Treasury notes,\" he said. \"Both issues are expected to be increased in size, and will temporarily add to the market's supply distribution woes.\" . **********In the municipal bond market, where states, cities and their agencies sold $1.089 billion in new securities through negotiated and competitive sale, Los Angeles priced one of the larger issues. **********The city sold $229 million in general obligation bonds through competitive bidding won by BA Securities.

He said Motorola did not expect the inventory bulge to put more pressure on cellular phone prices, which have been falling. **********The company said the oversupply was a contrast to the situation in the final quarters of 1992 and 1993 when Motorola and other manufacturers had not shipped enough phones to meet demand. It said the rate of growth in demand was less predictable as the phones became more popular with general consumers. **********Shares of L. M. Ericsson of Sweden, Motorola's main cellular equipment rival, also fell today on general nervousness about cellular industry growth rates. The company's American depository receipts dropped $1.50, to $56.875, in Nasdaq trading. **********Sales of cellular phones accounted for more than $8 billion of Motorola's $22.2 billion in revenues last year, with more than half of the sales coming from outside the United States. The cellular business has been one of Motorola's most rapidly growing operations for several years and the company today reiterated previous projections that worldwide sales would continue to grow at a rate of 50 percent or more for the next couple of years at least. **********Analysts said today's sharp selloff in Motorola's stock reflected profit taking (the shares had been trading at their 52-week high), the tendency of some investors to bolt at the first whiff of weakness in rapidly growing businesses and perhaps surprise at a stumble by a company that so frequently had delivered news that was better than expected. **********Most analysts shaved their first-quarter earnings estimates -- some as much as 10 percent -- but the prevailing view was that the news was not nearly bad enough to justify today's drop in the stock price. \"I had it as a buy -- it's more so now,\" said John M. Geraghty, who follows the company for CS First Boston. **********Motorola may have contributed to investor nervousness by repeating warnings made last month about other problem areas, notably the slow rate of orders for its radio communications systems from start-up companies like Nextel Communications that have had trouble arranging financing to build the networks that they expect will compete with cellular phones. **********Motorola also reminded Wall Street to anticipate start-up inefficiencies with the company's new semiconductor plants expected to come on line this year. **********Mr. Gams said today that the company did not anticipate any write-offs against its earnings from any of the problems."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/30/world/argentine-president-discourages-new-revelations-on-dirty-war.html": {"writer_name": "Calvin Sims", "pub_date": "1995-03-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 318, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Argentine President Discourages New Revelations on 'Dirty War'", "print_headline": "Argentine President Discourages New Revelations on 'Dirty War'", "body_text": " **********In a radio interview President, Carlos Saul Menem has called on former military torturers and murderers to confess to priests and not to \"rub salt in old wounds\" by publicly recounting their deeds. \"Publicly coming forward to give testimony is a way of returning to a horrible past that we are trying to forget,\" he said. **********Mr. Menem, who is running for re-election in May, accused \"some of the media\" of playing up recent revelations by a former navy captain, Adolfo Scilingo, who said the military disposed of hundreds of political prisoners by throwing them, alive but unconscious, into the ocean from aircraft. **********In an interview on Tuesday with Radio 9.90, which broadcasts to the capital, Mr. Menem said the Argentine people are tired of hearing about the military's \"dirty war\" of repression during the 1970's, and he blamed the news media and former military officers for keeping \"this horrible memory\" alive. **********Mr. Scilingo's disclosure has prompted other military men to come forward in recent weeks.

On Monday, the company's shares split on a two-for-one basis and began trading at slightly more than $46. By the following day, the share price had jumped as much as $16.25, to $62.50 a share. It closed out the week down from its highs, at $56.875 in over-the-counter trading. **********What accounts for all the excitement? Certainly not the company's disclosed financial performance. In the first quarter, Presstek announced earnings of 2 cents a share -- or $160,000 -- down 50 percent from the 4 cents it earned in the first quarter of 1994. Presstek shares are now trading at some 500 times earnings, the kind of lofty heights that should give most any investor a nosebleed. **********In public statements, Presstek has said that it has no idea why the stock price is moving in such a galloping way. But some short sellers -- that Wall Street breed that sells borrowed shares in a bet that the stock price will collapse -- have their own opinion: somebody out there is manipulating the price of Presstek shares. **********There are already some signs that there might be something to that.  Since November, the Securities and Exchange Commission has been conducting an investigation into the possible manipulation of Presstek stock. No charges have been filed, nor has any evidence from the inquiry been made public. **********In fact, the last time there was this much controversy about a rapid rise in a stock price was 1993. Then, the stock that was defying the laws of gravity was Future Communications, a Dallas-based cable television company with only three dozen employees. In little more than two months, shares in Future Communications surged from $6.50 to almost $30. Sound familiar? **********Short sellers argued it was a manipulation and sued. Future Communications later settled civil charges with the S.E.C. and went bankrupt. The lofty share price collapsed, and now the stock trades sporadically at around 25 cents a share. The investors in Future Communications seemed to scatter in the wind. **********What's odd is that a number of those same investors -- both institutions and individuals -- have been ponying up cash for Presstek shares. So, what does this mean for the potential of Presstek? Maybe nothing. Maybe it's all just one big, eerie coincidence. But one bit of advice: given the lack of public announcements from Presstek to account for its astronomical price rise, investors should probably pay close attention to future communications."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/29/business/currency-markets-dollar-is-pushed-down-sharply-as-fed-declines-to-raise-rates.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-03-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 366, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dollar Is Pushed Down Sharply As Fed Declines to Raise Rates", "print_headline": "CURRENCY MARKETS; Dollar Is Pushed Down Sharply As Fed Declines to Raise Rates", "body_text": " **********The dollar fell sharply against the German mark and the Japanese yen yesterday as the Federal Reserve left interest rate unchanged. **********The dollar fell throughout the day amid expectations that the Fed would not raise short-term interest rates.

He complained not only that the provision involved matters that were the jurisdiction of his committee, but also that its call for withdrawing most-favored-nation trade status would violate treaties. **********In an interview today, Mr. McConnell said he inserted the amendment without a vote to apply some quick pressure on the Burmese military dictatorship.

And without citing China by name, Mr. Clinton made it clear that many nations still have a long way to go in assuring basic rights for women. **********Many Republicans in Congress have opposed American participation in the conference and Mrs. Clinton's attendance in particular, because of China's violations of human rights and because of the conference's expected stand on such issues as abortion. But Mr. Clinton dismissed such arguments as demagogic and beside the point. **********\"One of the most troubling things to me about our politics today in America is that everything gets turned into just another version of the same old political fight,\" Mr. Clinton told a rally organized by the Wyoming League of Women Voters and other groups to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment, which gave all American women the right to vote 51 years after Wyoming had already done so as a territory. **********\"All these issues seem to be torn like Silly Putty into extremes, so now there is this huge effort in America to try to convince the American people that this conference is somehow anti-family, and that we're sending some sort of radical delegation there,\" he said. **********\"Why? Not because it's true, but because it furthers the almost addictive, almost narcotic drive among some elements in our society to take every single issue and use it as a cause for division among our people when we need to be united.\" **********Instead, Mr. and Mrs. Clinton said, the conference is about the most basic issues of concern to women and families everywhere: adequate health care, economic opportunity and political rights. Mrs. Clinton listed much of the delegation, which includes former Gov. Thomas Kean, the New Jersey Republican, and Susan Weld, the wife of Gov. William Weld, Republican of Massachusetts, in an effort to show it was not some liberal cabal. **********\"And however anyone might try to paint this conference,\" Mr. Clinton said, \"the truth is it is true blue to families -- to supporting them, to conserving them, to valuing them.\" **********He said that the United States could learn lessons from other countries, and that he would establish an interagency task force to carry out any \"good ideas\" that might come out the conference. **********The White House announced on Friday that Mrs. Clinton would serve as honorary chairwoman of the American delegation, one day after China expelled the American human rights advocate Harry Wu on espionage charges. Today's event had been long planned, and officials said Mrs. Clinton was glad to have the announcement of her role in the conference out of the way so she could elaborate on her reasons for going. **********The trip will be one of the First Lady's most high-profile appearances in months, but she left the political infighting to the President today and was much more circumspect in her comments, repeatedly emphasizing the nonthreatening motherhood themes of the meeting. **********The conference, she said, will raise awareness about the challenges and burdens women face and advance their interests. **********Women voters are an important constituency for Mr. Clinton, and one whose support his fledgling campaign is working hard to retain next year. Since 1964, women have outnumbered men among the American electorate, and they constituted 54 percent of the vote in 1992. **********But, Mrs. Clinton noted, only 45 percent of eligible women voted in the 1994 election, and the Administration is hoping to boost that turnout next year. Today's appearance, featuring a rousing performance by the Cow Patsys, a singing, fiddling trio of women, had all the feel of a campaign rally, with the Teton mountain range a perfect backdrop against a cloudless sky. **********Mr. Clinton recited his history as the son and grandson of working women in the 1940's, and both Clintons recited Wyoming's pioneering history. While some other American states and cities allowed women to vote in school board and some other local elections earlier, Wyoming is regarded as the first jurisdiction in the world to grant women a general right to vote, in 1869, and Jackson became the first municipality in the world with an all-female government, in 1920. **********The state's legacy is commemorated in its motto, \"The Equality State\" and in its official seal, which features the image of a woman with broken chains on her wrists, holding a banner. **********But the territorial legislators' decision to grant women the vote was born partly of old-fashioned expediency. At the time, men outnumbered women here by about 7 to 1, and the legislators saw women's suffrage as a way to attract more women and families as settlers. **********In his weekly radio address today, Mr. Clinton made another pitch for protecting the nation's natural wonders from Congressional budget cuts or unwise private development. He once again criticized the 1873 Mining Law that he said allows claims to be staked and mined on Federal land \"while giving virtually nothing back to the American people who make it possible.\" **********The President acknowledged that some Federal environmental regulations needed streamlining or simplifying. \"Do we need reforms? Yes,\" he said. \"Should we reverse course?

In short, the Gospel is integrated into the cultural patrimony of each African country.\" **********But if opening up the church to some of Africa's colorful pageantry and other tastes has proved relatively easy, in many other ways the challenge before this Pope of making the Vatican's teachings more relevant to the world's poorest continent has become more difficult than ever. **********When John Paul II last visited Africa, in 1993, the breakup of the Soviet Union was still an event whose consequences were fresh on people's minds everywhere, and one of his central messages as he traveled the continent was for people to be wary of ideology and to place their faith in the teachings of the church. **********Still, if Africa, with its more than 90 million Catholics, is one of the most fertile recruiting grounds for new believers, it is also a place where many of the Vatican's teachings collide with deeply ingrained cultural obstacles or face harsh economic, demographic or health realities that to many seem to argue against them. **********During a stopover in Benin on his last African tour, for instance, the Pope suggested that abstinence was the only acceptable means for combating the spread of AIDS, which has hit this continent harder than any other. **********John Paul's comments flew in the face of campaigns under way in Benin and many other African countries to encourage the use of condoms as the most cost-effective way of containing the disease and at the same time helping control the continent's galloping population growth. **********Perhaps nowhere can the challenge facing the church's teachings in Africa be more readily seen than in the question of polygamy, a practice that is considered sinful by the Vatican, but which forms a central part of the traditional social structure of millions of Africans in every region of this continent. **********African Catholics often reconcile their faith with this ancestral practice with discretion or outright denial, performing an urban church ceremony in one marriage, and an often quieter, rural and traditional ceremony -- often nothing more than the pouring of libations or the exchange of vows before witnesses -- in subsequent weddings with second and third wives. **********As in many African countries, in the Ivory Coast the most powerful example of this pattern was given from above by President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, a practicing Catholic who nonetheless took more than one spouse, a fact which although never officially announced, was widely known. **********Mr. Houphouet-Boigny built the world's second largest basilica, after St. Peter's in the Vatican, and this Pope came to bless it. **********For many on this continent, extramarital liaisons are as much a reflection of hard economic facts of life as they are of adherence to custom. **********\"It is one thing to be a Christian, and it is another thing to survive,\" said Martine Abetoh, a single, 29-year-old Catholic woman here who says she has a longstanding relationship with a married Catholic man. \"The economic environment in our countries does not always permit us to live the word of God. He takes care of me and of my child, and I don't have a job or any other means. Should I live in misery?\" **********For Cardinal Poupard, there is no question of the church's endorsing practices like these, but at the same time, there is a growing sense of patience before a task that, admittedly, will not be accomplished overnight. **********\"A polygamist is not a Christian, because a Christian follows the word of God, and the Bible does not permit a man to have two wives,\" he said. \"In this case, a person should not take communion, because he is not worthy of the kingdom. But can the church prevent man from doing what he wants to do?\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/05/business/a-new-tune-freedom-not-to-pay-taxes.html": {"writer_name": "Bruce Weber", "pub_date": "1995-07-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 483, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A New Tune: Freedom Not to Pay Taxes", "print_headline": "A New Tune: Freedom Not to Pay Taxes", "body_text": " **********Twenty-six years ago, Richie Havens opened the Woodstock music festival with his signature anthem, \"Freedom,\" a hoarsely passionate cry of the heart that expressed the rage and defiance of a youthful America against a seemingly monolithic, authoritarian Federal Government. **********Some things change; it is now the right that is generally associated with decrying the centralized power in Washington.

Apparently, the answer is yes. The stock of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has leaped 20 percent so far in 1995, rising despite reports of some insider selling late last year and in the face of mediocre performance from many of the stocks that Berkshire Hathaway owns. **********Berkshire Hathaway, as every owner of the stock knows, is run by Warren E. Buffett, who does not believe in stock splits. That fact, plus the excellent record Mr. Buffett has compiled, explains why Berkshire Hathaway trades at levels never seen before in this country. The stock closed at $24,550 a share, down $275, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. When Mr. Buffett took over the company 30 years ago, the price was less than $20. **********Mr. Buffett is the subject of a current best seller, \"The Warren Buffett Way,\" by Robert C. Hagstrom Jr. In its subtitle, the book calls Mr. Buffett \"the world's greatest investor.\" If anything, the book is more laudatory than that would indicate. **********Peter A. Russ, an analyst with Shelby Cullom Davis and a longtime fan of Berkshire Hathaway, said he assumed that the readers of the book had felt they had to own a share or two of Berkshire Hathaway. **********\"I think this is the first time the stock does not have a dollar-for-dollar intrinsic value underlying it,\" Mr. Russ said. But he quickly added that he thought the stock was likely not to fall sharply but to mark time for a period, as values caught up with the stock price. **********One holder who evidently was taken by surprise by the latest run-up was Charles T. Munger, vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway. He took in about $8 million in November and December, selling 400 shares at prices ranging from $19,600 to $20,700, far below the current level. He did not return a telephone call seeking comment yesterday. Mr. Buffett also did not return calls. **********As the shares have advanced this year, trading as high as $25,200 last week, there has been more turnover than normal, with the volume in January at 6,130 shares traded, the highest monthly volume in more than three years and more than double the usual level. So far this month, the volume has come to 2,120 shares. The assumption is that the activity was caused by the book publicity; certainly no one is thinking about a takeover. **********Berkshire Hathaway's annual report should be out in early March, and only then will investors learn how the company's various businesses performed. They range from the World Book encyclopedia and The Buffalo News to See's Candies, Dexter Shoes and the Nebraska Furniture Mart. The operating results of Berkshire Hathaway's insurance companies are also important. **********But if there are a lot of unknowns in those businesses, it is clear how some of Berkshire Hathaway's largest stock investments are performing. Their performance cannot explain Berkshire Hathaway's surge. The company's portfolio of big holdings, now valued at almost $14 billion, includes holdings of $1 billion or more in Coca-Cola, Capital Cities/ABC, Geico, Gillette and Wells Fargo. Other sizable holdings are in the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, known as Freddie Mac, General Dynamics, the Washington Post Company and Guinness. **********Since the beginning of the year, those common stock holdings have risen 3 percent, while Berkshire Hathaway's stock has gained 20 percent. From July 1 of last year the comparisons are just as striking, with the stock portfolio up about 12 percent and Berkshire Hathaway's stock up 49 percent. **********Berkshire Hathaway also has large convertible preferred holdings in Salomon Inc. and USAir. Because the preferreds do not trade, neither is included in the calculations. If estimates of them were included, the performance for the portfolio would be a bit worse. **********Mr. Hagstrom's book does a fine job of describing Mr. Buffett's investment style, which often features the purchase of stocks that are out of favor with investors. At $24.95, the book now is probably a better buy than the stock."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/10/business/the-media-business-added-worry-facing-cbs-gaping-holes-in-fall-lineup.html": {"writer_name": "Bill Carter", "pub_date": "1995-04-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1055, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Added Worry Facing CBS: Gaping Holes In Fall Lineup", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Added Worry Facing CBS: Gaping Holes In Fall Lineup", "body_text": " **********After a collapse in prime-time ratings that has seen the network lose ground every night of the week, CBS is likely to find itself with an extraordinary number of holes to fill in its program schedule next fall -- more new programming, a senior CBS executive conceded, than any network can realistically introduce at once. **********The network's fortunes, in sharp decline since September, have fallen further and faster in recent weeks as a batch of new programs introduced last month have fared even worse than the programs they replaced. **********The overall prime-time rating for CBS this season is a still respectable 11.2, compared with a 12.1 rating for the leader, ABC, which is owned by Capital Cities/ ABC/ Inc. (Each rating point represents 954,000 homes.) **********But in the last three weeks, CBS has been in a midweek ratings desert: From Tuesday through Friday, not a single CBS program has reached a double-digit rating in prime time. **********\"CBS's position is kind of scary,\" Steve Sternberg, a senior partner with BJK & E Media, said. Compared with last season, he added, \"the network is down 10 to 20 percent across the board.\" **********CBS executives freely acknowledge that they find themselves in the position of a sports team that is so far behind in a game it adopts a strategy of \"clearing the bench.\" **********\"We're just kind of sending in the scrubs to see what they can do,\" David F. Poltrack, senior vice president of research for CBS, said. \"We knew we wouldn't be competitive.\" **********CBS has already confronted the difficult problem of falling so far short of the guarantees it made to advertisers that it was forced to give away large numbers of commercials to advertisers -- what are known as make-good ads. With the network's recent performance declining even more, the make-good problems have worsened, Mr. Poltrack said. **********Some CBS executives have started to resort to gallows humor. \"We joke that it's deliberate,\" a senior CBS executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said. \"We're doing this bad now so no matter what we put on next season, it'll look like we've improved enormously.\" **********Mr. Poltrack replied: \"That's how a cynic sees it. That may be how you set a low benchmark for next season. If you survive until next year it's a good strategy. The problem is how to survive until next year.\" **********One way CBS is surviving is by holding back on costs as much as possible. The network has not filled some positions that have become vacant, including the head of its program practices division (better known as the chief censor), who left last month. \"We probably won't be filling that job,\" the senior CBS executive said. **********But Mr. Poltrack emphasized that the network's focus had shifted. He said CBS wrote off this season after the end of the last ratings sweep period in February. \"Since then we've been in development for next season,\" he said. **********CBS has tried to load the next sweep month, in May, with as many specials -- mini-series and the like -- as it can. Otherwise the network has concentrated on finding new shows for next season, which begins in September. **********But given the midweek collapse it has been suffering, CBS may be required to add more new fall programs than ever, the senior executive said. **********Last month, Peter Tortorici, president of CBS Entertainment, presented a preview for advertisers of the programs CBS had in development. Most in the audience were impressed. At the time, Mr. Tortorici said he expected to replace \"about five and a half hours of shows on the low end\" and \"seven hours on the high end\" in the fall. **********As the season draws to a close in the next two weeks, though, CBS has 8 to 10 hours on the weekly schedule that are regularly below the network's ratings average. **********\"At the research department we would advise against going up toward 10 hours of new programs,\" Mr. Poltrack said. \"Beyond six hours, it's almost inevitable that the replacement show won't equal the show it's replacing.\" **********The reason, he said, is that in program planning, the best new show is considered to have replaced the worst old show. As the network moves down its list of new shows it begins to move up the list of shows it intends to replace, and the line that defines which show is truly better begins to get blurred. **********\"We have a lot of tough decisions to make,\" Mr. Poltrack said. He cited a group of shows the network introduced this year that, while not hits, have not really been rejected by viewers, including \"Due South,\" \"Under Suspicion\" and \"Touched by an Angel.\" Depending on how many new shows with potential that CBS thinks it has, some in that group may return next season, despite tepid ratings. **********Most prominent in that category, Mr. Poltrack said, is \"Under Suspicion,\" a show about a female detective. He said CBS believed the lead actress, Karen Sillas, has an opportunity to become a star; several viewers' groups have organized campaigns to save the series. **********\"For reasons we can't really explain, that show has been the lowest-sampled show on television,\" Mr. Poltrack said. \"The viewers who have seen it tell us they like it.\" **********Another risk CBS faces in ordering wholesale cancellations is that the network will have nothing but repeats of lame-duck shows to offer during the summer. **********CBS also does not want to further damage its most valuable property, \"The Late Show With David Letterman.\" That show still dominates the late-night competition but has seen its audiences erode along with CBS's midweek evening ratings. **********\"The prime-time lead-in for Letterman is about 40 percent less than it is for Jay Leno on the 'Tonight' show,\" Mr. Poltrack said. Mr. Leno, on NBC, which is owned by the General Electric Company, is Mr. Letterman's main entertainment competition. But, Mr. Poltrack added, \"I think the summer won't be as bad for Letterman because college kids are home and he's especially popular with them, and Leno won't get the huge lead-in he's getting now.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/17/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-interactive-focus-for-two-alliances.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1995-05-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 241, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Interactive Focus For Two Alliances", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Interactive Focus For Two Alliances", "body_text": " **********Two developments in interactive marketing were announced yesterday. **********Three market research companies -- Nielsen Media Research, a unit of the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation; Yankelovich Partners, and ASI Market Research -- have formed a strategic partnership to develop research services for measuring the use of on-line computer services and the Internet.

And there has been no major fallout in markets abroad. This absence of a crisis atmosphere relieves some of the pressure on the Administration to act quickly. **********The main tool for a quick fix is higher interest rates, a tool the Federal Reserve controls. At a time when people are hurrying to exchange hundreds of billions of dollars for yen and marks, higher interest rates in the United States might halt the dollar selloff. The higher rates would make American bonds and other interest-earning securities more profitable to own, encouraging people to buy them with their dollars rather than exchanging the dollars for yen or marks.

That might happen if the economy begins to revive again. The weakened dollar may itself be a source of stimulus, by making American exports less expensive and thus more sought after in Europe and Japan. **********Imports, however, would become more expensive, raising the danger of a higher inflation rate, after several years of mild inflation in the United States. \"At some point, rising import prices bring a rise in the nation's general inflation rate,\" said Peter L. Bernstein, an economic consultant. \"I don't know when that point comes, but it will.\" **********Rising inflation would undoubtedly prompt the Federal Reserve to raise rates, helping the dollar in the process. **********The dollar's value has been declining gradually against the mark and the yen since the early 1970's, when the Nixon Administration decided that the dollar would no longer have a fixed value and would float against other currencies. Even in the early 1980's, when the dollar was becoming stronger, making American exports less competitive, it never returned to its levels in the mid-70's. **********Various administrations have welcomed the decline as inevitable and healthy, since it reflected the rising output and growing economic strength of other nations and America's declining share of the world market. Only twice has an Administration struggled against a sharply falling dollar. The first time was in the late 70's when Jimmy Carter was President and the dollar lost 40 percent of its value against the yen in only two years. The second time is now. **********The late 1970's, however, offered a set of circumstances that made reversing the dollar's slide easier than it might be today. Inflation had become a severe problem and that gave the Federal Reserve an opportunity to push up rates far more than might be possible today. In the process, the interest rates on American bonds became much higher than the returns from owning German and Japanese securities. **********What's more, foreigners, particularly the Japanese, were far more willing to hold dollars and invest them in the United States than they are today. **********Because the dollar has become less attractive to foreigners, an increase in interest rates now, even a substantial one, seems less likely than in the 1970's to reverse the slide in the dollar. Largely for this reason, Administration officials are pushing longer-term policies for strengthening the dollar. They speak, for example, as they have for months, of Commerce Department promotions for American exports, to lower the trade deficit and thus reduce the flow of dollars abroad. **********And they talk particularly of the Administration's latest effort -- an effort that has been made for years -- to get the Japanese to spend more of their hoard of accumulated dollars on the purchase of American cars and auto parts, the biggest item in the huge United States trade deficit with Japan. **********\"Prying open the auto market might not result in an immediate change in the deficit, but it would have a great psychological effect that would help the dollar,\" an Administration official said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/13/business/amoco-and-mcdonald-s-to-develop-sites.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-10-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 233, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Amoco and McDonald's to Develop Sites", "print_headline": "Amoco and McDonald's to Develop Sites", "body_text": " **********After more than a year of experimenting, the McDonald's Corporation and the Amoco Corporation have concluded that consumers like one-stop fill-ups for their gas tanks and stomachs. **********The two companies today announced plans to develop retail sites that combine Amoco gas stations and convenience stores with McDonald's restaurants throughout most of the central, Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern United States. **********The alliance, which is similar to one McDonald's announced in August with the Chevron Corporation for the Pacific and Southwest states, leaves the Northeast as the only big region in which the fast-food giant has not chosen an oil company partner. **********Amoco, of Chicago, and McDonald's, of Oak Brook, Ill., plan to open up to 75 dual-service sites in the next year, in addition to the 12 now operating, and to add hundreds more in the years to come, according to Kathleen Latham, the Amoco executive managing the oil company's relations with McDonald's. **********Some sites will have the full McDonald's menu and others will have more limited offerings, but all are expected to have inside seating and drive-through service, the companies said. **********Opening outlets in service stations is part of the fast-food industry's race into nontraditional sites including schools, hospitals, stores like Wal-Mart and even airplanes.

But some of them who have created computer games, personal software and CD-ROM's for markets that did not exist 10 years ago are also encountering pitfalls in dealing with electronic rights for books, photos, music and titles. And at least one independent CD-ROM developer is learning the hard way that having an original idea and sewing up the content rights is not enough; you still have to be careful what you call it. **********Irving Green runs Scanrom Publications from his house in Cedarhurst, L.I. The company is tiny, consisting of Mr. Green, his wife and his son, who wrote the programming for their CD-ROM of Judaica reference materials. But it has managed to attract the attention of a much larger software company: Microsoft. **********The Greens spent two years and $150,000 compiling Jewish history, religion and folklore texts, biographies and a cookbook. They hoped their disk would supplement rows of Judaica books in homes and libraries, so they called it \"The First Electronic Jewish Bookshelf.\" **********The Greens were thrilled when they were invited to join a Microsoft-produced marketing brochure. But the second message from the huge software developer was troubling. **********\"We have come across the enclosed catalogue listing for 'The First Electronic Jewish Bookshelf,' \" said a letter from a Microsoft lawyer, William O. Ferron Jr. \"We believe this use is likely to cause confusion with Microsoft's \"Bookshelf\" and \"Bookshelf Series\" trademarks, and so is an infringement of Microsoft's rights.\" **********Thus the Greens discovered that in the context of CD-ROM products, Microsoft has owned \"bookshelf\" since 1991, when it trademarked the term to cover its CD-ROM collection of reference books, Microsoft Bookshelf. Mr. Green says he did not bother to do a trademark search because it never occurred to him that anyone could own such a generic term. \"There are certain words that belong to the people,\" he argued. **********But as tax authorities are fond of saying, ignorance of the law is no excuse. Thousands of generic words are trademarked. The Patent and Trademark Office grants marks for specific goods or services -- Microsoft, for example, owns the term \"bookshelf\" as applied to CD-ROM products. But a scuba diving company that wanted to call snorkel and fins \"bookshelf\" would probably not infringe the Microsoft mark. **********Unfortunately for Mr. Green, he is not in the diving business. And he says he does not have the money to change his disk's programming, packaging, inserts and advertising. **********Both Mr. Green and a Microsoft spokesman, Erin Carney, said last week that they hoped to settle the dispute amicably.  Extending The Trombone **********At some point in the 15th century, musicians discovered that a trumpet could be modified with sliding tubing to produce deeper musical tones, and the trombone was born. All brass instruments produce music by manipulating the air blown through their tubes, mostly with valves. The trombone was different, however, because it controlled air flow with a slide that elongated its tubing. **********About 400 years later, Brian Phillip Leonard took up the instrument in high school. Playing jazz with friends in Melbourne, Australia, he quickly discovered the trombone missed certain low notes. It needed longer tubing to hit those lower notes, and the slide was already as long as a musician's reach. **********\"To create lower notes, you'd have to push the slide out so far it would just fall off the end,\" said Mr. Leonard, now a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Akron. Using his knowledge of air flow dynamics and acoustics, he designed a trombone with tubing and valves added near the instrument's bell and won three patents for his inventions. **********\"The trombone was a hobby, and I tried to combine it with my knowledge of fluid mechanics,\" Professor Leonard said. \"The whole thing has to be worked out mathematically in terms of the length of the windpipe. That may have inhibited others, because most musicians don't have a knowledge of the theory of acoustics.\" **********When a trombone is in its closed position -- with the slide completely compacted -- it produces high notes. As the tube is lengthened by extending the slide, the air has to travel farther and so the notes become progressively lower. That is, until they run into the limits of a musician's reach. **********To fill a musical gap between the tenor range and pedal tones -- those low notes reminiscent of an organ -- without requiring difficult slide movements, the inventor added brass tubing to the trombone's bell section. The tubing is controlled by thumb- and finger-activated valves. **********In a standard B-flat tenor trombone, the tubing is 108 inches long, with a slide that extends about 22 inches. Professor Leonard's attachments add 138 1/2 inches, without lengthening the slide. Instead, when a musician wants to blow air through the attachments, he opens a valve with his thumb or middle finger. **********Professor Leonard's most recent invention, an attachment 20.4 inches long, puts notes the trombone already achieves in more convenient places along the slide. His first invention, a 63.7-inch attachment with two valves, lets the trombone hit a low B. A second invention, a 54.3-inch tube, fills the \"tenor gap\" by allowing a B-flat trombone to hit E flat, D, D flat, C and B. **********The rights to the patents belong to the University of Akron. Professor Leonard received patents 5,365,823 and 5,375,499. His third patent is to be issued this summer."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/10/business/mazda-car-production-cut.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-08-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 37, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mazda Car Production Cut", "print_headline": "Mazda Car Production Cut", "body_text": " **********The Mazda Motor Corporation said today that it would shut down four car-assembly lines next month and lay off 5,500 workers for as many as five days because of poor sales in Japan."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/31/business/stocks-post-modest-increases-but-dow-still-declines-by-3.87.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-08-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 699, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Stocks Post Modest Increases, but Dow Still Declines by 3.87", "print_headline": "Stocks Post Modest Increases, but Dow Still Declines by 3.87", "body_text": " **********Stocks posted modest gains yesterday after Time Warner Inc. offered to buy Turner Broadcasting System for $8.5 billion, touching off a rally in media shares. **********\"It bodes well for stocks that even though the market is up 20 percent, companies are still willing to buy companies for stock,\" said Alan Bond, chief investment officer at Bond Procope Capital Management. \"It says maybe media shares are still undervalued by the market.\" **********Still, losses in the shares of Alcoa, the Aluminum Company of America; the International Business Machines Corporation, and the International Paper Commpany caused the Dow Jones industrial average to slip 3.87, to 4,604.57. **********The broader Standard & Poor's 500 Index, meanwhile, climbed 0.92, to 560.92, as technology shares rebounded, and long-distance and drug stocks advanced, tempering losses in retail, oil and gold issues. **********Gains by many technology issues helped the Nasdaq Composite Index end a four-day losing streak, rising 8.97, to 1,012.61. **********The Russell 2000 Index of small companies recouped almost all yesterday's losses, gaining 1.76 to reach 303.26.

Willes, Times Mirror's new chief executive, will eventually decide to sell them as a group or individually. **********Times Mirror Magazines, with 10 publications, is one of the largest publishers of outdoor leisure magazines. They range from the 100-year-old Field & Stream, which has a circulation of 2 million, and Outdoor Life, with 1.5 million, to smaller niche magazines like Yachting, with 133,000, and the newest acquisition, Transworld Snowboarding, with 92,000. A new magazine, Snowboard Life, is planned for October. **********Francis P. Pandolfi, president and chief executive of the magazine group, said the division was profitable, but declined to give figures. **********Last week Times Mirror Magazines introduced a strict profit improvement program. An ambitious but costly multimedia group was eliminated and its projects taken over by individual publications. Popular Science, for instance, is planning a series of CD-ROM's called Popular Science for Kids and Skiing magazine hopes to go on line by Labor Day. **********\"We've got to do better\" in terms of profitability, Mr. Pandolfi said. \"We do have a goal, but I just can't discuss numbers with you.\" **********Many of the publications are referred to as mature, in the sense that they may have reached their circulation peaks. They are known in the industry as \"hook and bullet\" magazines for serious sportsmen, as opposed to the more \"life style\" sporting magazines that appeal to younger readers. Still, circulations are generally stable and revenues are up. **********And the outdoor category is expected to grow. \"I would think the market for buyers is pretty good\" if the magazines go on sale, said Leo E. Scullin, a media consultant. \"Mature doesn't mean over the hill. And frankly some of these magazines can be considered annuities -- just cashing in your chips year after year.\" **********Mr. Pandolfi said subscriptions and newsstand prices would probably be raised next year. And some publications may move from Lower Park Avenue in Manhattan to less expensive locations in other states. **********The magazines belong to the company's consumer media group, which also includes Harry N. Abrams, the book publisher, and the just-closed multimedia division. In 1994 the consumer media group reported a 6.9 percent increase in revenue, to $289.9 million, but its operating loss deepened to $4.9 million from $3.8 million in 1993. This year, revenue through June was $142 million, compared with $132 million last year, and the group's operating loss has reached $12 million, up from $4.6 million in the comparable period last year. **********Mr. Pandolfi said he was not about to change his overall vision of the company as a force for environmental change. Since 1991, when he started the Partnership for Environmental Education, 175 advertisers have included an environmental message of 15 words or more in their ads and Times Mirror has donated 2.5 percent of the revenue from these ads to environmental causes. Mr. Pandolfi said the total contribution was almost $400,000. **********The company also sponsored the Smithsonian's Ocean Planet exhibit, which will go on tour next year. And last October volunteers were invited to sites in Nevada, Kentucky and California where, under the direction of the Bureau of Land Management, they made trails, constructed wildlife viewing areas for handicapped people and built information kiosks. **********\"I was at the site at Cache Creek in Northern California, where it was 104 degrees, and at the end of the day the manager told me that she had had 10 years of work done in that one day,\" Mr. Pandolfi said. **********This connection to the environment attracts many readers. But the magazines still suffer from the perception that they are staid publications for older readers. **********\"Part of their problem is that they are not perceived as hot and it would take good P.R. to overcome it,\" Martin S.

That transaction was announced last night.  [ Page D3. ] **********Whether Seagram can get better results than Matsushita from MCA remains an open question, because the acquisition will mark such a radical departure from Seagram's core spirit and beverage business. **********The president of Seagram, Edgar Bronfman Jr., declined to comment last night, apparently because the deal had not been signed. But top executives of MCA, who are widely expected to leave the company, had already been told that the company was changing hands. **********\"I feel sad because I have been around here for 59 years,\" said Lew Wasserman, the 82-year-old chairman of MCA, who has run the company for decades. \"But life goes on.\" **********The change of owners and managers for MCA could have broad ramifications in Hollywood. The company is best known for blockbuster movies by Steven Spielberg like \"E.T.,\" \"Jurassic Park\" and \"Schindler's List\" and music produced on the Geffen Records label. **********But lately MCA has lost momentum and now has only tenuous ties to Mr. Spielberg and the record executive David Geffen, which are based primarily on their personal relationships with Mr. Wasserman and the president of MCA, Sidney J. Sheinberg. **********For Matsushita, which paid $6.6 billion for MCA, scaling back to only a minority stake in MCA could suggest a model for retrenchment to another Japanese giant, the Sony Corporation. Sony has lost billions of dollars on Columbia Pictures Industries, the Hollywood studio it acquired in 1989, and has been considering ways to reduce that investment. **********But if Sony stays the course, Matsushita could be embarrassed, some financial analysts in Japan said. \"It's an admission of defeat,\" said Joseph A. Osha, technology analyst at Smith New Court (Japan) Ltd. \"But I think it's smart to admit defeat because there's no way they are ever going to be able to integrate this business.\" **********Though Seagram has no experience in running an entertainment company, doing so has been a dream long nurtured by the Bronfmans, the Canadian family that founded Seagram more than 70 years ago and still controls it. **********The chairman of Seagram, Edgar M. Bronfman, who is 65, was a big shareholder and chairman of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in the late 1960's, before selling his stake to the investor Kirk Kerkorian. **********And the current thrust into entertainment has been championed by the younger Mr. Bronfman, the president of Seagram, who is 39. He spent several years as a screenplay reader and in 1993 was responsible for the acquisition by Seagram of 15 percent of Time Warner Inc. **********Some analysts said yesterday that Seagram was paying too high a price for its stake in MCA, given the recent performance of MCA. But they said the bigger issue was who would run the entertainment company, which includes the Universal Pictures studio, the Universal Television programming unit, record labels, theme parks and a book company. **********Asked yesterday if there was a chance that he would stay at MCA, Mr. Wasserman, the chairman, said: \"I have no idea. It's free enterprise. If they buy it and pay for it, they can do what they want to.\" **********Mr. Wasserman said the elder Mr. Bronfman telephoned him late Wednesday night to tell him about the deal. Mr. Bronfman, he said, explained that he had not called sooner because he was not free to do so, apparently alluding to the secret nature of the talks with Matsushita, which were conducted over several weeks and appeared to be winding down yesterday in Manhattan. **********Mr. Sheinberg, who is 60, indicated that he, too, was uncertain about his future. The news of the MCA sale is \"one of those things that is anti-climactic,\" he said yesterday, referring to the reports of the negotiations that began appearing last week. **********The talks between Matsushita and Seagram intensified last weekend, and since then involved round-the-clock discussions -- including telephone conversations between the younger Mr. Bronfman and the president of Matsushita, Yoichi Morishita, in Osaka, Japan, according to people familiar with the talks. **********It is unclear what type of role Mr. Bronfman sees for himself at MCA. Other men who have bought control of studios -- including Sumner M. Redstone of Viacom, who acquired Paramount, and Rupert Murdoch of the News Corporation, who bought 20th Century Fox -- have taken active roles in the companies. **********Those who know Mr. Bronfman say he may bring in the powerful Hollywood agent Michael Ovitz to run the studio. Mr. Ovitz, who was the broker in the acquisition of MCA by Matsushita in 1990, is thought to have had no formal role in the Seagram-MCA deal. But he is a close friend of Mr. Bronfman's and, informally, his business adviser. **********If Mr. Ovitz joins MCA, the move is likely to raise questions about whether the company will have a relationship with Dreamworks SKG, the new entertainment company formed by Mr. Spielberg, Mr. Geffen and the former Disney executive, Jeffrey Katzenberg. Though Dreamworks had been expected to distribute its movies through MCA under Mr. Wasserman and Mr. Sheinberg, such an arrangement with Mr. Ovitz could be another matter. **********Even though Mr. Ovitz has long been Mr. Spielberg's agent, industry executives said yesterday that it might be difficult for any of the Dreamworks team to suddenly begin reporting to Mr. Ovitz, a man who they have long considered to be their professional equal. And Mr. Geffen and Mr. Ovitz reportedly have a chilly professional relationship. **********No matter who manages MCA, Seagram will be in control of one of Hollywood's legendary film companies. Founded in 1923 as the Music Corporation of America by the band leader Jules Stein, the company's initial business was booking engagements for bands.

But the change did little to alter opinions among private analysts about the economy's prospects for the balance of the year. **********\"The entire revision was in two categories, consumption and farm inventories, which alone was responsible for about 40 percent of the overall increase in gross domestic product,\" said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities Inc. \"But being on a trading floor in New York, I can't get excited about farm inventories.\" **********After slowing sharply during the first six months from an unsustainably rapid pace in the second half of 1994, most analysts still expect the economy to rebound to the rate of growth of 2 to 2.5 percent that is favored by the Federal Reserve.

P. Morgan Inc. **********The revised report contained \"more good news than bad news,\" said Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting project at Georgia State University. \"Capital spending is still strong, exports are still good and there are no inflationary concerns.\" **********Worries about inflation were the primary force behind the seven increases in short-term interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve over a 12-month period beginning Feb. 4, 1994. **********The absence of inflationary pressures was prominently mentioned when the Fed reversed its previous course in early July, pushing short-term rates down by a quarter of a percentage point. **********Yesterday's report provides further evidence that inflation remains in check. **********\"The economy looks like it is headed to a 2 percent to 3 percent growth path,\" said Allen Sinai, chief global economist at Lehman Brothers, \"and that is exactly where the Fed wants it.\" **********As measured by the gross domestic product deflator, the prices of goods and services rose 1.6 percent during the second quarter, slightly higher than the 1.3 percent rate reported in July, but less than the 2.2 percent rate recorded in the first quarter. **********The fixed-weight price index for domestic purchases, which in contrast to the deflator does not reflect the changing composition of output, rose at a 2.8 percent rate, up slightly from the 2.7 percent rate of increase that was originally reported. **********The Commerce Department will make its final revision to its second-quarter G.D.P. report at the end of September. **********The department also said that using a new method of calculating growth that it is phasing in this year, G.D.P. expanded five-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter, and did not decline by two-tenths of 1 percent, as first reported. The new method will formally replace the older system at the end of 1995 and is designed to measure price changes more accurately. **********Analysts cited improving home sale numbers, which should lead to increased sales of consumer durable items, strong capital spending and a likely improvement in the nation's trade accounts as reasons they expect growth to pick up. **********Mr. Ratajczak, who projected that the economy was growing at a 2 percent annual rate in the third quarter, said that despite sluggish auto and back-to-school sales, consumers almost certainly are spending more money this quarter than they did in the previous three months. **********\"We know they are spending more, if not on autos, then on utilities, because of the heat, which affects anyone from the Mississippi Valley to the East,\" he said. **********Increased spending on utilities could well cut further into the personal savings rate, which fell significantly in the second quarter from the first. **********Yesterday, the Commerce Department said the personal savings rate in the second quarter was 4 percent, not 4.1 percent, as originally reported. In the first quarter, the savings rate was 5.1 percent. **********\"The heat will boost service consumption in July and August,\" Mr. Fine said, \"but I don't know if consumer spending will remain strong. We do know the third and fourth quarters will be better than the second. Growth in the second half should be characterized as moderate, not strong.

And, despite differences in the fine print, both would make it significantly harder for investors to sue. **********Not surprisingly, the bills are supported by business leaders, accountants and underwriters. And they are opposed equally vehemently by consumer groups and Federal and state securities regulators. **********So far, the debate on the issue has been dominated by caricature. Congressional critics have vilified lawyers who file securities class-action cases as fee-hungry extortionists who do nothing to help investors. Corporate executives dismiss the plaintiffs in those suits as cynical opportunists who buy stock only to gain suing rights. Class-action lawyers condemn their corporate critics as greedy hucksters seeking a license to steal. **********But beyond these strident stereotypes are executives, plaintiffs and lawyers who agreed to discuss their experiences in the trenches of securities-fraud law. **********There are executives like John G. Adler of Milpitas, Calif., whose consistently profitable company was sued when one quarter's revenues fell just 15 percent below Wall Street forecasts. There are plaintiffs like Kenwood and Helena Perkins of San Marcos, Calif., securities-fraud victims who recovered some desperately needed money through a class-action suit. And there are class-action lawyers like Howard B. Sirota of Manhattan, who condemns those who file frivolous suits but fears that pending proposals will prevent him from fighting even worthy battles. **********Together, they provide a far richer and less distorted picture of the securities-fraud terrain and of the potential consequences of the efforts to reform it. And they suggest that while change is needed to rein in unfair and costly abuses, the bills may unintentionally leave many wronged investors without hope of justice. **********\"I've been frivolously sued, too,\" said Anthony C. Lami, a pizza parlor owner in Sandy, Utah, who joined a class-action suit after he lost more than $400,000 of his investment in Media Vision, whose stock collapsed after the company retracted past financial statements. \"I can see that for a company like Apple, say, whose stock has gone from $70 a share to $20 a share several times in its life, it may be cheaper to pay a settlement than to fight a lawsuit -- and that's wrong to me. But if the new legislation prevents lawyers from taking on a case like mine, that's wrong the other way.\" **********Though the Senate proposal is considered somewhat more moderate, both would raise the burden of proof for plaintiffs, protect companies from lawsuits based on \"forward looking\" earnings statements and encourage judges to force the losing party to pay the winner's legal bills if the judge believes the loser's case was not justified. **********Both would also limit a guilty defendant's financial liability to some \"proportionate share\" of the blame, repealing the current \"joint and several liability\" doctrine under which any guilty defendant may be assessed for the full damage award if other guilty parties cannot pay. **********And to the dismay of consumer advocates, neither bill addresses Federal regulators' request that Congress remedy gaps in current securities laws caused by Supreme Court decisions curtailing the statute of limitations on fraud claims and restricting claims made against \"aiders and abettors\" of fraud. **********Before any bill can be sent to the White House, a congressional conference committee must resolve differences between the two bills in ways that have sufficient support in both chambers to overcome a possible Presidential veto. Though President Clinton has not publicly stated his position on the bills, officials in the Administration have indicated that, unless the loser-pays provisions are removed by the conference committee, he could well decide to veto the final bill.  The Perkinses A Nest Egg Recovered **********Before becoming the victims of a securities fraud in the mid-1980's, Kenwood and Helena Perkins were living in the upscale San Diego community of Rancho Bernardo and looking forward to a comfortably secure retirement. **********But like hundreds of other Californians -- doctors, dentists, professional athletes -- Mr. Perkins had entrusted his finances to a persuasive entrepreneur named Harry Stern, the founder of a public conglomerate called Technical Equities Corporation. Mr. Perkins had worked briefly as a senior executive of Mr. Stern's company in the late 1960's, and years later turned to him for guidance. **********\"I was traveling a lot overseas for my job and I really didn't have the time to look after my finances,\" Mr. Perkins recalled. \"So I made the serious mistake of letting an individual manage my money.\" **********At the time, Technical Equities was a favored client of Security Pacific Bank, whose advertisements once boasted of its role in financing the company's robust growth. **********The corporate audits were done by a major accounting firm and its investment bankers were well-known brokerage firms. **********But in February 1986, Technical Equities collapsed in what some commentators called the largest financial scandal in California's history. In July 1988, Mr. Stern agreed to plead guilty to criminal fraud charges stemming from the maze of Ponzi-like transactions he conducted through the company. **********The Perkinses were devastated. \"We seriously considered personal bankruptcy,\" Mrs. Perkins said. \"I had fears of going on welfare.\" **********Instead, Mr. Perkins -- despite health problems he blames on the stress of their situation -- went back to work at age 65. The couple sold their home and moved to a trailer park in San Marcos, Calif. **********And they joined a class-action lawsuit being directed by Alan R. Plutzik, now with the firm of Farrow, Bramson, Baskin & Plutzik, in Walnut Creek, Calif. **********\"I'm not about to defend the entire legal fraternity,\" Mr. Perkins said softly. \"But in this case, they were a real bright light in a very dark situation.\" **********The lawsuit by Mr. Plutzik's team, one of dozens filed in the scandal, claimed damages of $12.5 million plus interest and ultimately was able to recover $13 million, the lawyer said. After legal fees, Mr. Perkins recovered about 60 percent of his losses. **********That recovery would have been unlikely if lawyers had not been able to seek full damages from the company's bankers, auditors and investment bankers, Mr. Plutzik said. **********\"Joint and several liability was critical here,\" he explained. \"If that had not in place, the potential recovery in the case would have been drastically reduced.\" **********And if the current \"loser pays\" proposals had been in effect, he added, \"I would have had to caution the Perkinses that they might have ended up having to pay a share of the defendants' legal fees, which were utterly huge.\" Mr. Perkins, now 76, said he certainly would not have taken on that risk. **********As it turned out, the money from the lawsuit is what has enabled the couple to live in reasonable comfort. \"We're still living in the mobile home park,\" Mr. Perkins said, \"but our future is reasonably secure, and it would not have been without that extra money.\" Anthony C. Lami  Anxious, Then Angry **********Tony Lami, who is 39, calls himself a careful investor. Before he bought stock in Media Vision, which made multimedia computer products, he made sure to study the growing multimedia market and monitored Media Vision's sales by reading annual reports and Wall Street research. **********Impressed by the company's red-hot sales, he accumulated 12,000 shares by early spring 1994, at prices ranging from $31 to $46 a share. His outlay was approximately $450,000 -- a substantial sum for a man who, after managing restaurants for others, was setting up his own pizza parlor. **********\"Not for one minute did it occur to me that those sales numbers were not real,\" he said. **********But in late March 1994, Media Vision announced it expected a large loss in the first quarter of the year; then, in April, it said it had actually incurred a large loss in 1993, not a profit. As the company's stock sank, Mr. Lami was sick with worry. **********\"It takes a lot to admit that this is really happening to you -- that it is not a dream,\" he said. \"This is not an easy business we're in. My wife and I work seven days a week, evenings, weekends. And this was all our money, everything we had worked for through seven restaurants.\" **********New fears surfaced as the stock fell below $20 a share. The couple was adopting a baby daughter, but the adoption was not yet final, and he was afraid his deteriorating finances would derail the process. **********By the time the stock had reached $11 a share, he said, his anxiety was so severe that he found himself \"running around the block in my suit. It seemed that if I was running, it would be O.K., but if I stopped, I felt I would explode.\" **********Finally, with the stock at $9.75, he sold his entire stake in April to raise money to pay his taxes. \"It was a godsend, in a way,\" he recalled. \"The stock ultimately went to zero.\" **********In July 1994, Media Vision filed for bankruptcy. To settle its debts and emerge from court protection, it awarded new stock to its creditors, thus rendering its prior shares worthless. **********\"I felt I'd been lied to,\" Mr. Lami said. On his own, he found a class-action lawyer, George S. Trevor at the firm of Gold Bennett & Cera in San Francisco, and joined one of the dozens of lawsuits filed against Media Vision, its accountants and its underwriters. **********Mr. Lami understands that the accountants and underwriters resent being seen as \"the deep pockets\" in the case. **********\"But I counted on them to go in and check on this company, and if they didn't do their job properly, that is their responsibility,\" he explained. \"After all, if somebody slips and falls in my restaurant because I haven't cleaned my floor carefully, that is my responsibility, isn't it?\" **********As the legal fight creeps forward, a Federal judge has dismissed as too vague the allegations against one accounting firm and the company's underwriters, giving the plaintiffs 90 days to file more specific charges. The case still stands against the company's founder, several senior officers, and another accounting firm. All defendants deny they played any role in Media Vision's collapse. **********\"It is not unusual for plaintiffs' counsel to cast around for deep pockets in a case like this,\" said Jared Kopel, a partner in the firm of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati in Palo Alto, Calif. **********He is the lawyer for the underwriters Montgomery Securities and Cowan & Company. \"But there is no evidence that the underwriters knew of, or should have known of, of any evidence that the company was in trouble.\" **********Mr. Trevor said the plaintiffs' cases would not be worth pursuing if proposed limits on \"joint and several liability\" were enacted. \"You could go through three or four years of litigation, prove all your points, get a successful verdict against people who were found to be liable for damages -- and still not get any of your damages back,\" he said. John Adler  Insult Added To Injury **********John G. Adler came to the United States from his native Hungary in 1956, a nearly penniless 19-year-old \"running from the Russians.\" With a scholarship, he earned an engineering degree in 1960. After 20 years with I.B.M. in upstate New York, he gravitated to Silicon Valley. In 1985, he became president of Adaptec, a young computer parts manufacturer in Milpitas, Calif. **********By late 1990, Mr. Adler had added the titles of chairman and chief executive and Adaptec's revenues exceeded $100 million. After lean earnings in 1989, both Mr. Adler and Wall Street analysts expected a strong rebound. **********Then, in mid-November of that year, Mr. Adler learned that various sales glitches would cause fourth-quarter revenues to be about 15 percent lower than Wall Street expected. It seemed minor -- the quarter and the year would still be solidly profitable -- but Mr. Adler decided to hold a conference call to alert the handful of analysts who followed his company. **********After the stock market closed on Monday, Dec. 10, 1990, Mr. Adler and two senior executives made the conference call. When the stock market opened on Tuesday morning, Dec. 11, Adaptec's stock fell more than 30 percent in response to the revised forecasts. By Friday, the first of seven lawsuits against Adaptec had been filed in Federal court in San Jose. **********\"Up to this point, I'd paid zero attention to these frivolous suits,\" Mr. Adler said. **********Company lawyers tried but failed to get the case dismissed. For six months, photocopiers were wheeled from department to department as employees gathered documents sought by plaintiffs' lawyers. Legal expenses grew. **********Added to the injury of lost time and money was the insult. \"The suit alleged we were a badly managed company on the verge of collapse,\" Mr. Adler fumed. \"Yet we had a balance sheet with almost no debt and lots of cash, and we were profitable.\" **********The maneuvers cost the company $2 million in fees and ultimately led to settlement talks. \"I was not at all inclined to settle,\" Mr. Adler said. \"I was still on my soapbox.\" But he was advised that a trial could cost the company's shareholders far more than the $4.3 million settlement the lawyers had negotiated. **********So he settled -- protesting that \"this was legalized extortion\" and refusing to shake the opposing lawyer's hand when the talks ended. He also refused to sign any settlement agreement that declared the suit had been justified or that barred him from discussing the settlement, he said. **********William S. Lerach, whose San Diego law firm, Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, led the the plaintiffs' case against Adaptec, remains critical of Mr. Adler for only notifying a few analysts of the revenue shortfall instead of making a public announcement to all investors. \"The case was absolutely justified,\" Mr. Lerach said. \"I don't have any question about it.\" **********Mr. Adler, no longer Adaptec's chief executive but still its chairman, is a vocal supporter of the Senate bill, which he sees as \"much more moderate\" than the House bill. But he said he has no interest in shifting legal fees onto the losers, and he suspects that provisions putting the biggest investors in charge of lawsuits would mean that some valid cases would not be pursued. **********\"No bill is perfect,\" he said. \"The system is out of control, and whenever you think you're going to fix it, you may have broken something in the process. But that doesn't argue for preserving the status quo.\" **********Besides, he added, if these proposals push the pendulum too far, \"there will be a backlash and another tweak will come to bring us back to the middle.\" **********But if Mr. Adler is uncertain of what will happen if some version of the two pending bills becomes law, he is certain of what will happen if nothing changes. \"I just know that somewhere along the way, we're going to miss the numbers again. It's inevitable,\" he said. \"And I'm going to get sued and go through the same thing again.\" Corporate Defendants  Fighting Can Pay Off **********Securities class-action lawyers joke that every company they sue condemns the action as frivolous -- even when Federal prosecutors are at the door. And the corporate habit of settling cases instead of fighting them before a judge or jury can make even specious fraud claims look valid. **********But there are cases in which courts have found class-action cases to be wanting. **********For example, in June 1994, after four years of preparation and 21 days of trial, Information Resources of Chicago was cleared of class-action fraud charges filed after the company fell far short of its 1989 profit forecasts. **********A month ago, on Aug. 16, an appellate court upheld the jury's findings that the company's forecasts were based on reasonable assumptions, and that no fraud was involved in its accounting practices. **********When the verdict was reached, James G. Andress, the company's chief executive, said he hoped it would \"encourage others to fight these actions.\" **********But his company was sued again just months before the courtroom victory -- and later quietly settled out of court for $12.5 million. The company would not comment on either case. **********T. J. Rodgers, the chief executive of Cypress Semiconductor Corporation in San Jose, Calif., fought for more than three years against a class-action case accusing his company of making deliberately misleading earnings projections in late 1991 and early 1992. **********In June, a Federal judge granted the company's motion for summary judgment, ruling that \"no reasonable jury could find that any of Cypress's statements were false or misleading.\" Howard Sirota  Is It Time To Change Sides? **********Since 1987, Howard Sirota, has specialized in filing securities class-action lawsuits. But do not ask him to defend those who file quick-draw cases whenever corporate earnings miss their mark. He is furious at the impact that such suits have had on his business. **********\"My so-called colleagues have accused thousands of innocent executives of securities fraud and it's created this terrible backlash,\" he complained. \"We are having a harder and harder time convincing judges that a case is an actual fraud because too many people have cried 'fraud' for every earnings disappointment.\" **********Unlike the image of class-action lawyers drawn in Congressional debate, Mr. Sirota, who is 46, does not commute between a palatial estate and an office where paralegals churn out boilerplate fraud claims at the push of a computer button. **********He and his wife, Rachell, work together in a four-person firm -- Sirota & Sirota -- in a modest office in midtown Manhattan. The couple, their daughters, his in-laws, and several pets all live in the same house in a beachfront community in Queens. **********Mr. Sirota's class-action credentials include successful cases against the Crazy Eddie retail chain and the Sahlen & Associates security-guard empire, both subsequently the targets of Federal criminal fraud convictions. He boasts of recovering more than $100 million for plaintiffs over the years. **********But now, Mr. Sirota is turning down cases he might once have accepted, he said, because the public vilification of class-action lawyers has made judges more hostile toward such cases. **********\"I'm raising my standards,\" he explained. \"In the two recent cases I turned down, I was convinced there was securities fraud, but I'm going to leave them to lawyers more aggressive than I am.\" **********\"I'm filing cases where I'm convinced there is actual fraud and then I'm trying to figure out how to collect,\" he said. \"But the trend is definitely negative. The proposals being considered now are designed to get at these frivolous suits, but they have the effect of making it riskier and possibly disastrous for me to try to bring my fraud cases.\" **********The limited liability of accountants and underwriters under the current bills is worrisome, he said, because truly fraudulent companies are the most likely to have collapsed before any damages can be collected. But he is most concerned about proposals encouraging judges to charge the losers for the winner's legal costs. **********\"If they adopt 'loser pays,' I quit,\" he said. \"I'll go back to representing the corporate defendants.\" **********And if other class-action lawyers follow suit and refuse to handle valid investor complaints? \"Look, this is not 'Wall Street Legal Services' I'm running here,\" Mr. Sirota said. **********\"Society used to encourage these lawsuits as a way of policing the system. Now society is saying that filing a securities class action is akin to molesting a child. Fine -- if the Congress is saying 'the public be damned,' I'll represent the crooks.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/13/business/international-briefs.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-09-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 108, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "International Briefs;", "print_headline": "International Briefs;", "body_text": " **********The United Microelectronics Corporation, Taiwan's second-largest maker of semiconductors, said yesterday that it would team up with a group of North American companies to invest in a $1 billion chip plant in Taiwan. **********The group, which also includes Trident Microsystems Inc., ATI Technologies Inc., Integrated Silicon Solution Inc. and Opti Inc., will form a joint venture with initial capital of $600 million to operate the plant, United Microelectronics said in a statement.

Marcuss, L'Oreal's outside lawyer, said the company denied any wrongdoing but was settling the case anyway. \"L'Oreal does not want to obscure the fundamental fact that it is opposed to the boycott and is a major participant in the Israel economy,\" he said. **********It is against the law for companies in the United States to supply information that will help Arab countries enforce the boycott. **********Paris-based L'Oreal, best known for its Lancome creams and perfumes, asked a newly acquired American subsidiary, Helena Rubenstein Inc., to supply information in 1989 about its contracts and royalties from a licensee selling its cosmetics in Israel, Mr. Marcuss said. Helena Rubenstein had been on an Arab blacklist of companies that did business with Israel, and L'Oreal was blacklisted when it acquired Helena Rubenstein. **********L'Oreal sent information to Arab officials in Damascus, Syria, the same year about Helena Rubenstein's operations in Israel, and L'Oreal was removed from the Arab blacklist in July 1989. But Mr. Marcuss said it was not clear whether the information provided by Helena Rubenstein in the United States was the same as that passed on to Arab officials, and he argued that the Commerce Department was wrong to interpret the information being sent to Paris as a violation of the boycott law. **********\"This was simply a communication between a subsidiary and a parent company,\" the lawyer said, adding that L'Oreal has bigger cosmetics operations in Israel than any other company. **********Mr. Despres noted that L'Oreal's activities in Paris were outside the jurisdiction of American officials and the American boycott law. **********But Lindsay Owen-Jones, the chairman of L'Oreal, nonetheless sent a letter today to the Anti-Defamation League apologizing for the company's correspondence with the Arab officials. **********\"As chairman of L'Oreal, I personally would like to say that I am sorry such correspondence was ever sent,\" he wrote. \"I also want to inform you that I have taken measures to assure that such action will not happen again.\" **********Abraham H. Foxman, the league's national director, said he strongly believed that L'Oreal had cooperated with the Arab boycott, although he said there was some room for discussion whether American laws had been broken. But he accepted Mr. Owens-Jones's apology and praised L'Oreal for having expanded its operations in Israel in recent years. \"The question is not punishment or vengeance; the question is what happens from now,\" he said. **********L'Oreal has been a target of criticism since 1991, when it was reported that the chairman of its American marketing arm, Jacques Correze, served in 1940-41 as Paris region director of the pro-Nazi Revolutionary Social Movement. The movement worked with the Gestapo in raiding homes and businesses of Jews, although Mr. Correze denied before his death that he took part in anti-Semitic attacks or persecution. **********In the summer of 1991, the Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations began an investigation whether to bar Mr. Correze from the United States. A week after the investigation was announced, Mr. Correze, who served five years in a French prison after World War II, stepped down as head of the marketing arm, Cosmair Inc., and died a few hours later of pancreatic cancer. **********Helena Rubenstein has been merged since 1989 with another American subsidiary of L'Oreal, Parbel of Florida Inc., which agreed today to pay $1,387,000. Cosmair agreed to pay $9,000. Parbel and Cosmair are both wholly owned subsidiaries of L'Oreal. **********Bruce L. Mishkin, who was the vice president, general counsel and corporate secretary of Helena Rubenstein in 1989, and is now associate general counsel of Cosmair, agreed today to pay $50,400. **********The largest penalty for violations of the anti-boycott law was imposed two years ago on Baxter International, which agreed to pay $6 million for violating provisions of the law prohibiting it from giving Arab nations details of its business and charitable contributions in Israel. **********Today's announcement came after the close of trading in Paris, where L'Oreal's shares rose 15 francs to close at 1,275 francs. **********Mr. Despres said that while he planned to continue enforcing the boycott law, Arab countries appeared to be showing less interest in enforcing the boycott. The number of complaints received by the Commerce Department's anti-boycott office dropped 27 percent in the first half of this year from the preceding six months, while the number of complaints from Persian Gulf countries, which had rigorously enforced the boycott, dropped 61 percent in the same period, he said. **********Arab hostility toward Israel has been diminishing in recent years, as Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organization reached agreements with the Israelis, and Syria has held negotiations."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/22/business/company-news-levi-strauss-to-spend-850-million-in-revamping.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-03-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 80, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LEVI STRAUSS TO SPEND $850 MILLION IN REVAMPING", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; LEVI STRAUSS TO SPEND $850 MILLION IN REVAMPING", "body_text": " **********Levi Strauss Associates Inc. said yesterday that it planned to spend $850 million in the next few years to improve its United States operations.

Until the mid-1980's, visitors who crossed the Taiwan Strait from either direction were regarded as spies to be interrogated and jailed. The only exception was defectors. Taiwan, for example, rewarded each defecting Chinese Air Force pilot with instant celebrity and $1 million. **********But now that the business of China, more and more, is business, Taiwan's combination of identical language, cultural backround and fast-growing economy offers a special role as teacher to the mainland. **********\"This has nothing to do with ideology,\" said Mr. Shao. \"This is about making money.\" **********Although Taiwan investment in mainland China is difficult to measure accurately -- direct investment is still officially banned -- David O'Rear of the Economist Intelligence Unit in Hong Kong estimates that it reached about $6 billion in 1994, compared with $2.5 billion from the United States. **********Taiwan business people started coming to China in the mid-1980's as economic and political policy relaxed on each side, and Taiwan estimates that its residents conducted seven million visits to the mainland last year. Taiwan business people can now be found in every major mainland city, both as private investors and as resident representatives for multinational companies. **********\"It makes a lot of sense if you think about it,\" said a Taiwan businessman who is general manager for an American company in Shanghai. His insistence on not being identified reflects a lingering sensitivity to the issue. \"We have a much greater intuitive ability to work with people here than other outsiders do.\" **********Growing ties are not limited to individuals. Last fall, even the People's Construction Bank of Shanghai formalized ties to a venture capital company owned partly by Taiwan and partly by the United States. The company, the China Development Corporation, formed a $250 million fund aimed at a variety of Asian investment projects. **********There is another side to Taiwan business activity in the mainland, too. Chinese officials complain that a large percentage of sour deals and business fraud is conducted by Taiwan business people, and point to the pirating of American and Chinese music copyrights as an area dominated by business people from Taiwan. For years, Taiwan has been a leading violator of publishing and recording copyrights. **********On the other hand, Taiwan business people have cooled their enthusiasm for direct investment in the mainland during the last year because of frustration caused by China's lack of adequate legal protection when a dispute arises with a Chinese partner. **********Ever sensitive to the issue of sovereignty, China's concern centers on the question of whether the United States views the mainland and the island off its southeastern coast as \"one China\" or as \"one China and one Taiwan.\" **********The current troubles were touched off by something as seemingly innocuous as the United States decision to allow President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan to attend a reunion at Cornell University last month. **********American officials have been at pains to point out that Mr. Lee's visit to Cornell did not alter their position recognizing only one China.

McGregor, executive general manager of Broken Hill, which is based  in Melbourne, said in an interview last night that the deal had several advantages for his company. **********Most importantly, it would give Broken Hill a fully integrated copper operation, because Magma has a state-of-the-art smelter that the BHP Copper Group, the subsidiary to be created to meld Broken Hill's and Magma's copper operations, can use to transform mined copper into metal. Broken Hill, which does not have a smelter, now hands over the copper it mines to outsiders to process into metal. **********It would also give Broken Hill immediate access to the American copper market, essentially giving it a global reach. Most of its copper products are now sold in Asian and European countries. **********\"The key focus of this acquisition is growth,\" Mr. McGregor said. \"The asset  base complements our existing asset base in a way that will create great synergies.\" **********Broken Hill said that in addition to the $28-a-share offer for Magma's common shares, it would also tender for outstanding shares of Magma's Series D and E convertible preferred stock at a price that equals its offer for the common stock. **********Broken Hill plans to finance the acquisition with internal cash resources and existing lines of credit. Mr. McGregor said that the company's debt would rise somewhat initially. **********He said the acquisition was expected to save the combined company $30 million to $40 million a year over time as redundancies in operations like exploration and administration are thinned. **********Magma's stock has risen sharply in the last two weeks, after Dan Dorfman, the CNBC television financial correspondent, quoted analysts as saying the stock could hit $29 in 18 months. He did not, however, predict an acquisition. **********Mr. McGregor hinted that Broken Hill might have had some competition for Magma, saying, \"The deal has the support of both boards, but that, of course, doesn't mean others may not have an interest. But it would be hard for anyone else to extract the value we get from this, because our operations are so complementary.\" **********CS First Boston, the investment banking unit of CS Holding, advised Broken Hill on the acquisition, and Goldman, Sachs & Company advised Magma. **********The BHP Copper Group will be based in San Francisco, along with Utah Mining,  which Broken Hill acquired from the General Electric Company last year. BHP Copper is expected to produce about 900,000 tons of copper in 1996. **********Magma earned $51.9 million, or $1.02 a share, on sales of $392.6 million in the third quarter of this year.

Volume amounted to 335.5 million shares, well off from Friday's 429.4 million shares; Friday's activity was stimulated by options-related buying. **********\"It was just a so-so day in a typical holiday week,\" Robert Freedman, chief investment officer of the John Hancock Funds in Boston, said of yesterday's trading. \"And we've been seeing a change of leadership in the market.\" **********Yesterday's early rally was sparked by the temporary resolution over the weekend of the Federal budget crisis. Since a compromise between the Clinton Administration and Congress had been previously factored into the market, though, stock prices fell back toward the end of the day. **********\"Don't get too aggressive in buying, since a positive budget outcome is already built into the market,\" said Larry J. Wipf of the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis. \"Federal Reserve and private-sector reports reveal a sputtering manufacturing sector, easing home sales and rising credit-quality concerns.\" **********High-technology stocks slumped for the second consecutive session in reaction to the Hewlett-Packard Company's announcement on Friday that a greater percentage of its fourth-quarter profit came from products with lower profit margins. Hewlett-Packard tumbled 4 1/2, to 84; Micron Technology dropped 5 1/4,  to 49 7/8; Texas Instruments declined 3 1/4, to 56 1/2, and Sun Microsystems fell 5 7/8, to 81 5/8. Shares in so-called Internet stocks were an exception to  the technology selloff and finished significantly higher. **********However, money managers rotated into big-name consumer-oriented companies with consistent earnings. Among those showing gains were Eastman Kodak, up 1 3/8, to 70 1/4; Walt Disney, up 1, to 60 1/4, and Texaco, up 1 to 72. Caterpillar rose 1/8, to 55 5/8, amid signs that a 17-month strike by its unionized workers might soon end. **********A number of retail issues were higher. Gucci gained 3 1/8, to 33 7/8; Sears,  Roebuck advanced 3/8, to 39 3/4, and Federated Department Stores increased 1/4,  to 29 1/8, **********Automobile stocks, which had been underperforming the overall market, showed  some strength yesterday. General Motors closed at 47 5/8, up 3/4, and Ford Motor ended at 29, up 3/8. Chrysler was unchanged at 50. **********American Home Products, which received approval from the Food and Drug Administration to sell a new drug, gained 1, to 90 1/8. Iomega, which won awards from two computer magazines at a trade show last week, soared 61/64 , to 409/64  . C-Cube, which announced a 2-for-1 stock split, jumped 3, to 83. **********In contrast, Eckerd, the drugstore chain, declined 2 1/2, to 41 1/8, after saying that it plans to sell 2.5 million shares to the public. Exide Electronics dropped 3, to 16 1/2, after Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette downgraded the stock. And Haemonetics slipped 1 7/8, to 17 1/2, after being downgraded by Alex.

First Procter & Gamble sued Bankers Trust, saying it had been led down a too-risky investment path. A mass of papers quickly piled up -- lawyers tend to be good at that -- and a judge decided some of them weren't quite ready  for public consumption. Then Business Week got hold of the sealed papers and smelled a scoop, a judge said no, and all sorts of First Amendment hell broke loose. Last week some smoke cleared, as the judge unsealed the documents, which  seemed to bolster P.&G.'s case by disclosing losses at other companies from derivatives sold by Bankers Trust. But the free-speech issue was left smoldering, for the judge also insisted he had the right to stop publication. Now it's in the lap of the appeals courts. **********CHARITY Throwing Big Money at Cancer It's all too familiar these days: a takeover, a merger, a little board-room back-scratching, and some executive walks away with a sum that would boggle the  mind even if it lost a couple of zeroes. But last week came a stunning variation: the mind-numbing sum was going not to an executive but to science. Jon Huntsman, who made about $1 billion in chemicals, lost both parents to cancer and battled it twice himself. That was enough to prod him to say he'd give $100 million to a cancer research center at the University of Utah. That may be walking-around money to Ted Turner, but it's the largest individual gift  ever to medical research. \"It's been 26 years since a man walked on the moon,\" Mr. Huntsman said, and we're still battling cancer. He wants to win this one. **********AUTOS Speaking Out at Chrysler The seat belts are off at Chrysler. Last week the chairman, Robert Eaton, lashed out at those he said wanted to \"trash\" the company -- mainly Kirk Kerkorian and  Jerome York. He said Mr. Kerkorian, who now owns nearly 15 percent of Chrysler,  \"has no real knowledge\" about what's happening and is merely out for \"personal gain.\" He said Mr. Kerkorian and Mr. York -- the former Chrysler executive who's now in Mr. Kerkorian's camp -- are merely harming other shareholders by trying to gain control. **********REAL ESTATE Japanese for 'Low Rent' Japanese real estate prices are so high they're almost an international joke (so long as someone else is paying them). So when you hear that they've plummeted -- by two-thirds or more -- in recent years, does that mean they're out of the stratosphere? Not exactly. You'll still spend $6,000 or so (every month!) to rent a modest suburban house, perhaps $4,000 for a one-bedroom Tokyo apartment;  this is Japanese for \"plummet.\" And it may not even last. Last week the I.M.F. forecast a recovery for the battered Japanese economy in 1996, though it did lower its estimate for the nation's growth this year. Rent 'em while you can. **********CAREERS The Mailroom Gambit It is, so it's said, the American way: if you're near the top of your field, you make a good living. So you'd think that Jay Bonin, who's in the top 200 or so Americans in his chosen field, would be riding high. If he'd been a lawyer, he might have been one of the hundreds of that profession at the Simpson defense table; if he played baseball, he'd be out there spitting with the richest of them. But Mr. Bonin's great talent is chess. Yes, there's $1 million in prize money in the world championship match that was speeding toward a conclusion last week atop the World Trade Center, but in chess, if you're not at that pinnacle,  you'd better have a day job. Mr. Bonin, brilliant at chess, makes a few thousand a year at it; by day, he's a mailroom clerk. **********INNOVATIONS Making Cats Easier to Love There are, those tireless statisticians tell us, 63 million cats in this country. There'd be a lot fewer if it weren't for one Edward Lowe. Cats, you see, smell. Built for the desert, they use water with enviable efficiency, but the downside is that their urine . . . well, you know. To fight the odor, people tried sawdust, sand, wood shavings, but they weren't much help. Then one day in  1947 -- a watershed day in feline history -- Mr. Lowe had a neighbor try a dried, granulated clay used to sop up grease spills in factories. And, yes, Kitty Litter was born -- along with what is now a $600 million annual industry.  And Mr. Lowe? In 1990 he sold his business for $200 million. And last week he died at age 75. **********OPPORTUNITIES Gulps of Premium Juice Who has the most impact on this marvelous capitalist machine we inhabit? Well, one week it might be Bill Gates, the next week Newt Gingrich, and the next, Steven Spielberg. Last week, of course, it was 12 faceless jurors in a Los Angeles courtroom. They spoke, and this mighty economy -- which prides itself on packing every second chock full -- ground to a halt for long, long minutes. You  could have heard a stock drop, if any had been trading; you could have heard the phone ring, if anyone had called. The jurors spoke, and whole conglomerates were born -- reported $1 million sales of photos of the reunion of the defendant (what was his name?) and his children, tales of $50 million pay-per-view blowout interviews, other interview deals, book deals, and then probably books about the book deals. And, yes, talk of a television drama series based on the lives of two DNA experts. And it's only just begun. **********HEALTH CARE Medicare Plan Under Fire Medicare may well need patching up, but the Republicans' notions about how to do it took a lot of flak last week. First came the American Medical Association, which has kept silent for much of the recent debate but now voiced concern that  limits on payments would scare too many doctors away. \"It would be a major blow,\" said an A.M.A. spokesman. Then the A.A.R.P. joined the fray, saying Congress was cutting \"too much, too fast\" from projected spending. Newt Gingrich has been trying to get the elderly on his side, but he doesn't seem to have succeeded. And in a final attack, the head of the American College of Physicians said bluntly, \"We are not on board.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/29/world/world-news-briefs-turkish-jet-crashes-in-aegean-encounter.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-12-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 219, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "World News Briefs;Turkish Jet Crashes In Aegean Encounter", "print_headline": "World News Briefs;Turkish Jet Crashes In Aegean Encounter", "body_text": " **********A Turkish F-4 jet fighter crashed in the Aegean Sea today after Greek warplanes intercepted it near the island of Mitilini. **********The Turkish plane's systems operator was rescued, but the pilot was missing.

The dancing of these computer-generated mannequins was manipulated by a few television viewers punching buttons on their touch-tone telephones after dialing in to the university's late-night interactive TV program. One minute, viewers could see the real dancers; the next, the robotic mannequins -- all keeping time to the same music. **********Experimental shows like this are irreverent, funky, hip -- a digital mix of music, video and bright graphics. Graduate students in the Interactive Telecommunications Program call the shows the future of television. **********The technical elite who style themselves the digerati might find that, energy aside, the scenes were generations behind the computer images in the Disney film \"Toy Story.\" But the students, who made the movie a topic on their show, are indifferent to such comparisons. They say they want to extend multimedia to the  technological have-nots of the information age, the people with television sets  but no computers, phones but no modems. **********In a world that celebrates the ever more complex, New York University has created a graduate program built around the notion that technology is truly useful only if it enhances creativity for all. In the Interactive Telecommunications Program, technology is a liberal art. **********In practice, this means that the 200 students take one course in programming, but none in electrical engineering or physics, in contrast with the requirements of computer-science programs at schools like M.I.T. While most students here know such technical arcana as which digital-compression standard works with what kind of computer file, their curriculum has the same free-form, random-access feel as the digital world they work in. **********\"We're more interested in content than in hardware,\" said Red Burns, a New York University professor and head of the Interactive Telecommunications Program since 1983. \"To me, the computer is just another tool. It's like a pen. You have to have a pen, and to know penmanship, but neither will write the book for you.\" **********Thus, in contrast with many technically oriented graduate programs, her students get formal training in multimedia with an emphasis on what they can do  for technology, not the other way around. **********\"I think new technology represents a cataclysmic change -- in the way we look at the world, in the way we communicate,\" Professor Burns said. \"But since we're in the middle of it, we don't know what it is.\" **********The program has no required texts or theories. \"What they know of the field they came from is what they will use in technology,\" she said. \"They bring ideas, play with ideas, examine ideas and look for the appropriate technology. We try to train people to learn how to learn, to go out and work in a technology world that is changing all the time.\" **********The N.Y.U. program predates the current hyperbole about the convergence of computers with entertainment and information. It has existed since 1979, its founders believing that a multimedia revolution was already under way. **********\"At that time, it was cable and video,\" Professor Burns said. Originally a documentary film maker, in the mid-1970's she helped create two-way television programs to inform the elderly about community social services. She and her colleagues put video cameras in retirement homes, hospitals and housing agencies, and linked them through a cable system. They used technology in untried ways to answer questions and spread information about facilities for the elderly. **********As Professor Burns said recently, \"We didn't go in and say 'here's the technology, let's find a way to use it.' We said 'here's a need.' \" **********With N.Y.U. colleagues two decades ago, she cobbled together the space at the university, found money for the program, and took on about 20 graduate students, dubbing the effort the Interactive Telecommunications Program. \"I had a very hard time trying to explain to people what it was,\" Professor Burns recalled. \"Nobody understood. It wasn't mass media? Then what was it?\" **********Today, about 200 students are enrolled for two years to study multimedia forms, ethics of the digital domain, and, as Professor Burns puts it, \"enough about technology to be able to use it.\" **********Many work in familiar areas like interactive video, computer graphics and electronic publishing. But some classes range further afield, adopting the attitudes, and prose style, of modern social science theorists. In a course titled E/Merging Media, students are taught \"how to control the dynamics of merging and interactivity so as not to abandon the content.\" **********\"How does the formal tension among the media create new possibilities for meta-media?\" the course description asked. \"Are we, in effect, moving toward the widespread adoption of what has been called hypermedia? What are the ethical dilemmas?\" **********\"The courses are there for people to get a handle on what the questions are,\" Professor Burns said. \"But the problems are solved in the halls, at the computers. There's a lot of collaboration that goes on here in the middle of the night.\" **********Her department fills the fourth floor of N.Y.U.'s Tisch School of the Arts. A hall with wide pine floorboards ends in her office, where a long farm table serves as a desk and a computer is tucked unobtrusively into a corner, leaving the impression that it is not the center of attention. The decor in other rooms  is techno-modern, with doors of glass and tables full of computers, video monitors and editing machines. **********On a recent day, students in a class on Design for the Screen gathered for a  lecture on how information can best be presented on computers so that people feel comfortable. \"It's important to understand, appreciate and respect the technology side,\" said Miles Kronby, a second-year student. \"But my interest is  in the content side of it. Basically, what kind of stories might best be told in these media and how to tell them? What kinds of stories and information are more engaging because of interactivity?\" **********Professor Burns said that her students, with their diverse backgrounds and their degrees from the program, go to work \"everywhere, because these technologies have permeated everywhere.\" In the last five years, graduates have  taken jobs at Apple Computer, Nynex, Viacom, MTV, HBO and the Macmillan publishing house. Many others have begun their own businesses. **********One destination is the Starwave Corporation outside Seattle, a multimedia producer of CD-ROM's and World Wide Web sites. \"So far, I.T.P. is the only place to go to find people who cross disciplines,\" said Erling Aspelund, a Starwave producer and a graduate of the Interactive Telecommunications Program. Until he  arrived, the company, started by Microsoft's co-founder, Paul Allen, had never heard of the program. **********\"We are a publishing company first and foremost,\" Mr. Aspelund said. \"This is the only school you can go to find associate producers, graphic artists, designers -- the kinds of people coming up with concepts, with new ideas for on-line services.\" **********At Microsoft, Pierre de Vries, lead program manager of its Consumer Systems Prototyping Group, worked last summer with interns from N.Y.U. and recently hired a program graduate. **********\"Microsoft has no shortage of the best technical thinkers,\" Mr. de Vries said, \"and we need to find and attract people who are the best at traditional creative thinking. The insights that people who are artists have are crucial if  we're going to make a breakthrough in the way we think about the uses of technology and if we are going to make things that are compelling.\" **********Which is not to say that he or other employers could do without the electrical-engineering or computer-science majors who are expert in intricate programming. But the I.T.P. students' ability to resort to low-tech legerdemain  when there are no easy high-tech solutions fits the needs of both new multimedia companies and older software businesses. **********In the hopes of fitting into such a business, Sigi Moeslinger, an industrial  designer from San Francisco, enrolled in I.T.P., rather than a more technical program. For a department exhibition, she created a \"virtual flower.\" A flower pot sat on a shelf below a monitor embedded in a wall. A synthetic stem from the pot reached toward the monitor, disappeared and then re-emerged on the screen, with an animated flower blooming at its head. When lamps in the room were moved, the on-screen flower pivoted toward the light. When water was poured into the pot, the flower on the monitor perked up. **********\"There's this thing that's half real and half virtual,\" she said. \"You can interact with it in the real world, and use some of your natural experiences. People feel more engaged when there's a physical relationship.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/24/business/international-business-leeson-is-formally-charged-in-singapore.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-11-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 429, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;Leeson Is Formally Charged in Singapore", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;Leeson Is Formally Charged in Singapore", "body_text": " **********Singapore formally charged the extradited former Barings P.L.C. trader Nicholas W.

But many officials warned that creating an elite first group among the former Soviet-bloc countries could leave the region divided and possibly unstable. **********While fixing a time for negotiations was only a step toward expanding the European Union, it capped one of the most decisive summit meetings by the group's leaders in years. **********On Friday, the union made a symbolic decision to give the name euro to the common, unifying currency it hopes to create in Europe by 2002. It also signed an agreement with leaders of four South American countries -- Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay -- to work toward a free trade pact early in the next century. **********But any decision on enlargement will be fraught with problems, if only because of money. The union now spends almost $47 billion to subsidize its farmers and calculates that similar subsidies for Eastern Europe would cost another $13 billion. And other economic assistance for residents in poorer regions of the European Union, now almost $40 billion, would have to rise to more than $90 billion."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/04/world/world-news-briefs-powerful-quakes-rock-islands-north-of-japan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-12-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 92, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WORLD NEWS BRIEFS;Powerful Quakes Rock Islands North of Japan", "print_headline": "WORLD NEWS BRIEFS;Powerful Quakes Rock Islands North of Japan", "body_text": " **********A strong earthquake hit the Kurile Islands in the Russian Far East early today, but no injuries or damage were immediately reported. **********The quake measured 7.2 on the Richter scale and was centered about 31 miles  undersea off the island of Iturup, Japan's Central Meteorological Agency said.

Ms. Pillay is one of six members of the panel on Rwanda, part of the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague. **********As Ms. Pillay spoke in interviews on Thursday and today, there were reports  from Zaire of the arrests of 8 to 10 Rwandans near the Goma refugee camps on charges of intimidating Rwandan refugees who want to return home. Among those detained was Francois Karera, a former mayor of Kigali, the Rwandan capital, whom human rights groups consider a central figure in genocidal attacks on Tutsi and moderate Hutu in the spring of 1994. After the slaughter erupted, Tutsi rebels drove out the Hutu-dominated Government. **********Mr. Karera is not among the eight Rwandans indicted this fall by the war crimes tribunal, which focused its first cases on killings around the western town of Kibuye. But as a refugee living in luxury apart from fellow Rwandans in  Zaire, Mr. Karera, a Hutu, had made no attempt to hide his contempt for Tutsi people. Although he was vague about what he was doing when massacres took place  in Kigali, he is considered a candidate for an indictment on genocide charges. **********In August 1994, Mr. Karera told a reporter: \"The Tutsi are originally bad. If the reasons are just, the massacres are justified.\" **********Mr. Karera, formally accused of genocide by the new Tutsi-led Rwanda Government, appears to have irritated the Zairians not for activities in Rwanda  but for efforts as a member of a Hutu party, the Rally for a Return to Democracy in Rwanda, to organize resistance to the return of Rwandan refugees from Zaire.  The others arrested by Zaire were apparently also party members. **********Zaire would like to empty the camps of about a million remaining refugees, many of them Hutu fearful of Tutsi reprisals, a terror played on by leaders like Mr. Karera. Last fall, the Zairian Army made attempts to evict them by force before being assured by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees that an orderly return would be organized as soon as possible. **********Justice Pillay welcomed the reports of arrests in Zaire today, but said that  the Zairians have not been willing to discuss the tribunal's cases with international prosecutors or with Justice Richard Goldstone, the South African who heads the Rwanda panel and a similar one on former Yugoslavia from his base  in The Hague. Resistance has also been demonstrated by other African countries,  including Kenya, where President Daniel Arap Moi threatened to arrest prosecutors. Other Kenyan officials have since intervened to temper those comments. **********Ms. Pillay, 54, a lawyer from Natal province, said that her experience in supporting the creation of a commission in South Africa to investigate political crimes during apartheid convinced her that Rwanda must have the same opportunity. Without the healing that comes from seeing justice done, she said,  Rwandans cannot build a new society or resist demands for revenge. **********\"Judges must raise their voices,\" she said, dropping the cloak of anonymity usually worn by panel members. Ms. Pillay said she appealed to African governments and the Security Council, which created the tribunal, for help in moving faster on genocide charges in Rwanda. The Rwanda panel, based in Tanzania, will be ready to try cases in February. The five other judges on the Rwanda tribunal -- which will sit as two three-member panels -- are from Bangladesh, Russia, Senegal, Sweden and Tanzania. **********But the exact whereabouts of the Rwandans identified in the first eight indictments are unknown and without the help of officials in countries where they may be living, they cannot be brought to trial. While the tribunal is seeking help from governments to find them, the names of the accused have not been made public to make it harder for them to evade arrest. **********Even so, at least one of those thought by human rights groups to be among the indicted was recently reported to have drowned in a boating accident along the Zaire-Rwanda border. Alison DesForges of Human Rights Watch/Africa, said in an interview today that there seems to be a rash of \"disappearances\" and \"deaths\" in the region that she said may be efforts to cover suspects' tracks. **********\"Show me the bodies,\" Ms. DesForges said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/12/business/manzi-departure-unlikely-to-derail-ibm-s-plans.html": {"writer_name": "Steve Lohr", "pub_date": "1995-10-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 628, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Manzi Departure Unlikely To Derail I.B.M.'s Plans", "print_headline": "Manzi Departure Unlikely To Derail I.B.M.'s Plans", "body_text": " **********For I.B.M., the abrupt departure of Jim P. Manzi is less a strategic blow than a sobering reminder of how quickly the human assets of a software company can take flight. **********It was less than four months ago that Mr. Manzi, the 43-year-old chief executive of the Lotus Development Corporation, agreed to sell Lotus to I.B.M. for $3.5 billion and join the executive ranks of I.B.M. **********Most analysts expect other Lotus executives to leave the International Business Machines Corporation in the wake of Mr. Manzi's move. But they say a trickle of departures should have scant effect on I.B.M.'s strategy for making Lotus software -- especially its Notes program -- a vehicle for growth during the next several years. **********The real danger, analysts say, would be if there were a wholesale exodus of key Lotus people from I.B.M., like the team of developers behind Notes, which enables computer-linked employees to work in far-flung teams. The head of the Notes team is Ray Ozzie, whom William H. Gates of Microsoft once called \"one of  the top five programmers in the universe.\" **********\"Manzi's departure is not any kind of derailing of I.B.M.'s strategy for Lotus,\" said Stuart Woodring, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc. in Cambridge, Mass. \"But if Ozzie and a few others left, that would be a real problem.\" **********I.B.M. paid cash for Lotus, which means that people like Mr. Ozzie instantly  became multimillionaires thanks to their Lotus shares. And despite reports that  Mr. Ozzie has a contract to complete two more upgrades of Notes, which could keep him at I.B.M. for another 18 months or so, one executive close to Lotus said there was no contract holding Mr. Ozzie. Mr. Ozzie could not be reached for comment yesterday. **********Keeping the key Lotus developers and managers within the I.B.M. fold, and keeping them motivated and productive, is vital if I.B.M. is going to make a success of its software business in the future. **********Today, I.B.M.'s sizable software business is largely dependent on the company's mainframe and mini-computer lines, and is growing very little, according to Stephen K. Smith, an analyst for Paine Webber Inc. **********Since 1988, I.B.M.'s software revenues have increased by just $1 billion, to  $11 billion last year, Mr. Smith estimated. During the same period, he said, the total computer software market has grown to $75 billion from $30 billion. **********\"I.B.M. desperately needs to get growth from the software business, and that's what the Lotus acquisition was about,\" Mr. Smith said. **********Armed with Lotus Notes, I.B.M. hopes to retain its corporate customers and to finally beat the Microsoft Corporation in an important product category. Despite spending heavily, I.B.M. has been unable to make its OS/2 desktop operating program any kind of a rival to Microsoft's Windows. **********Major corporations increasingly want their employees to share documents, reports and financial information across time zones and borders. Lotus Notes is  the leading program that enables this kind of teamwork -- a software category called groupware. **********Recently, Notes has become a hot product among large industrial companies, banks and high-tech concerns. Installations are expected to double this year to  roughly 2.6 million. And significantly for I.B.M., Microsoft has been an uncharacteristic laggard in groupware. **********Yet so far, most analysts said, the early signs from the I.B.M.-Lotus merger  look encouraging, despite Mr. Manzi's surprise departure. Last July, for example, I.B.M. executives announced that Lotus products like cc:mail, Lotus Organizer and Lotus Approach would be the standard desktop offerings from I.B.M. **********\"To date, the integration of the two companies is ahead of schedule,\" said John B. Jones Jr., an analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc. **********Investors apparently agreed, shrugging off news of Mr. Manzi's resignation.

Zhirinovsky as the leading anti-reform element in the lower house of Parliament. But Administration officials said they did not see any need to adjust Washington's policy toward Russia and the Government of Boris N. Yeltsin. **********Even the apparent plurality achieved by the Communists leaves them well short of a working majority, said Administration officials, who concluded that more than three in four Russian voters did not support a return to the past. They noted that the Communist surge was offset by a decline in support for Mr. Zhirinovsky's nationalists, which meant that the coalition of forces opposing President Yeltsin's liberalization policies had not really increased. **********\"At this point, I think it seems likely that the new Duma that was elected yesterday will not be strikingly different than the Duma that has been in session for the last few years,\" Mr. Burns said today, referring to the lower house of the Parliament. In essence, he said, the results mean that one-third of the legislators would oppose economic reform, another third would support it and the rest would be in the middle. **********The votes reported so far apply to seats allocated to political parties, which account for only half of the 450 seats in the lower house. The results for remaining seats will not be known for some days. Those seats are elected from among individual candidates who represent themselves and are expected to hew more closely to the center because they will be elected foremost on the basis of local issues. **********Because the lower house of Parliament is constitutionally much weaker than the presidency, Administration officials are also treating yesterday's elections as a kind of rehearsal for the presidential elections next June that will determine Mr. Yeltsin's political survival. **********It also seems likely that the Administration has been looking beyond President Yeltsin, who is not only politically unpopular at home but also suffered a heart attack recently, to identify younger, more vigorous Russian politicians who support economic reform. **********Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman, said, \"What remains clear after the election is that the political culture of Russia is still multi-faceted and quite dynamic, with a lot of different participants, a lot of  different factions, a lot of different points of view of what Russia's political future should hold.\" **********While conceding that the Communists had made a strong showing, Mr. McCurry said, \"We also believe that there is a strong presence in the newly elected Duma of reformers and those committed to democracy and market economics.\" **********Even so, Administration officials acknowledge some discomfort with the new prominence of the Communists, whose leader, Gennadi Zyuganov, has spoken of reconstituting the Soviet Union. **********\"It certainly doesn't hearten those of us who believe in democracy and reform,\" Mr. Burns said at today's State Department briefing. **********But another senior Administration official observed that it would be hard to  put the Soviet Union back together because Russia, like the West, recognizes the sovereignty of the other former Soviet republics. **********\"Russians are looking to the future, not looking to turn back the clock, but  they have very different ideas of what the future should be,\" he said. **********The official observed that foreign policy issues had not figured in the recent political campaign, which focused far more on the debate over Russia's troubled transition to a market economy. **********The final composition of the lower house, and its variance with President Yeltsin, will not become clear until it is known how many political parties garner 5 percent or more of the total vote, which is the threshhold for inclusion in the legislature. **********Dr. Harvey D. Balzer, director of the Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies at Georgetown University, agreed that the outcome so far did not pose a threat to the Administration's relationship with Moscow. \"Overall, it probably deserves a sigh of relief,\" he said. **********Mr. Burns, who previously served as a Russian affairs specialist in the National Security Council, offered another reason for the relative calm with which the Administration accepted the election news. When the nationalists under Mr. Zhirinovsky made gains in the first parliamentary elections in 1993, Mr. Burns recalled, \"there was pretty much shock\" inside the White House.

To some, it looks like the greatest bull stampede ever. To others, it appears that short-sellers are being squeezed like never before. **********\"The Internet stocks remind me of the riverboat gambling stocks of a few years ago,\" said Emanuel Geduld, the president of Herzog Heine Geduld, a major market maker in the Nasdaq market. \"The public loves these stocks.\" **********But there may be more to it than that. Recent trading patterns -- many Internet stocks have doubled over the last month -- make it look like short-sellers have been forced to buy to stem losses. A short-seller, who bets that stocks are overvalued and will decline, sells borrowed shares and, eventually, must buy shares to repay the loan. **********Wall Street rumors say that some market makers -- brokers who stand ready to  buy and sell stocks to meet public demand -- found sellers scarce and ended up going short whether or not they intended to do so. Whether that is true cannot be confirmed, but even the speculation can help to bring out buyers hoping to drive up the price and force short-sellers to buy shares in an effort to avoid even bigger losses. **********Mr. Geduld said his firm had resisted the temptation to short any of the stocks. \"Intellectually, they all appear like great shorts,\" he said. \"But when  they are on a feeding frenzy like this, it is best to step aside.\" **********Yesterday's spurt came despite the fact most stock averages dipped, including the Dow Jones industrial average, which fell 6.86 points, to 4,983.09, after briefly trading over 5,000. [Page D8.] **********And the Internet boom is coming at a time when many technology stocks have weakened. For example, the Philadelphia semiconductor index, which fell 11.41 points yesterday, to 217.78, is now down 28 percent from the peak it reached in  September. Microsoft, the pre-eminent computer software company, fell $1.375 yesterday, to $86, and was off 22 percent from its peak. **********It may be, however, that the Internet frenzy peaked, at least for now, during yesterday's trading. After 2 P.M., many of the stocks gave up a good part of the gains they had recorded earlier in the day, although they all ended with substantial gains. Spyglass, for example, traded as high as $112 before ending the day at $104.75, a gain of $4.25 during the day. Netscape closed at $116.25,  up $5.75 from Friday, but down $8.50 from the peak. **********The market argument for the Internet stocks is that they are going to benefit from the next great change in the computer marketplace, in which communications  are so cheap that it makes sense to do everything effectively on the Internet rather than have a lot of computing power at your home or office. Instead, you can use so-called dumb terminals that cost much less, hooked into both memory and software away from your site. **********That may work out. But it is likely to be awhile, and it is clear that the high value now being put on Internet stocks by the market is wildly out of line  with insider expectations only a few months ago. **********Netscape, for example, the premier company making software to let computer owners get onto the Internet, went public in August at $28 a share. That in itself was a dramatic increase from the $12 price the company was willing to take, with insiders selling some of their own shares. At yesterday's peak, the price was 10 times that. **********Or consider Spyglass, which also provides Internet access and has software to let companies offer products and services on the Worldwide Web. It went public in June at $17, although it and its insiders had been willing to sell for as little as $11. It too hit 10 times that figure in yesterday's trading. **********Uunet -- pronounced \"you-you-net\" is another provider of Internet access. It  went public at $14 a share, although its insiders were willing to take as little as $10. At its peak yesterday of $98.75, it was worth just less than 10 times that price, making it the laggard in the group. It closed yesterday at $93.25. **********Another way of looking at those hot three is that at their public offering prices, the companies were worth a total of $1.5 billion. A month ago, they were worth $6.1 billion. Now they are valued at $7.5 billion. **********There are many other stocks -- some of them with only marginal connection to  the Internet -- that have profited in the boom. But the latest initial public offering to do so was that of Secure Computing, which went public last week at $16 a share, although insiders had been willing to take as little as $13. It offers an \"Internet firewall\" product that is supposed to protect computers hooked up to the net from unauthorized entry by hackers. **********On its first day of trading Friday, the share price leaped to $48.25. Yesterday, it traded as high as $59.50 before ending the day at $55.50. **********Secure, unlike some other hot initial public offerings, has an operating history and has shown a profit. But that profit and history were based on its old business of government contracting. Its new business, of selling computer safety systems to commercial customers, is barely a year old, with the product announced last November and first shipped in March. Through Sept. 30, it had sold 42 units and had orders for 13 more. **********Including management options -- managers get to buy shares for as little as 59 cents each -- the market is now valuing Secure Computing at $373 million. With total revenues for the last 12 months of nearly $19 million, that works into a price-to-revenues ratio of 20. Clearly, great things are expected. **********When an initial public offering is hot, it is all but impossible for most investors to get an allocation, and many of the buyers who get in on the offering are professionals who want to make money rapidly and get out. Each of the stocks mentioned above saw first-day Nasdaq volume of more than the number of shares that had been sold in the offering, indicating a lot of flipping. **********Those who got in the first day of public trading paid up for their shares, but all have since had a chance to sell at good profits. Just how long those profits will last depends in part on how great the public enthusiasm gets to be, and in part on how many short-sellers there still are with big losses and hopes  that the prices will come down."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/25/world/bosnian-serb-leader-signals-acceptance-of-peace-plan.html": {"writer_name": "Raymond Bonner", "pub_date": "1995-11-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 871, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bosnian Serb Leader Signals Acceptance of Peace Plan", "print_headline": "Bosnian Serb Leader Signals Acceptance of Peace Plan", "body_text": " **********In his first public statement since a peace agreement was reached, Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, said this evening that his government had accepted the agreement and the fact that the military struggle that began nearly four years ago is over. **********\"We accept the peace,\" Dr. Karadzic said in a televised interview this evening. Although the Bosnian Serbs are not happy with many of the provisions of the Washington-brokered agreement, Dr. Karadzic said, \"the time has come to switch to political ways to achieve our goals.\" **********Dr. Karadzic, who appeared subdued if not defeated in the one-hour interview from his headquarters in Pale, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, sought to put the current reality in the best light for the Bosnian Serbs. **********A few months ago, he noted, the Bosnian Serbs controlled 64 percent of the territory of Bosnia, and under the accords negotiated in Dayton, Ohio, they will get only 49 percent. Still, he said, \"We have achieved our objectives. We have half of Bosnia; we have more than 40 cities; we also got some good land.\" **********And even though the self-declared Bosnian Serb republic, of which he is considered president, has not been recognized as an independent state, it has been recognized as an entity within Bosnia, he noted. The other entity is the Croat-Muslim federation. **********Dr. Karadzic said nothing about his own political future, which has been a matter of great speculation. Under the terms of the Dayton agreement, Dr. Karadzic will be barred from politics because he has been indicted by the international war crimes tribunal. **********The Bosnian peace agreement was initialed on Tuesday in Dayton by the Presidents of Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia, but the Bosnian Serb representatives refused to initial it and did not acquiesce until Thursday, after intense pressure from the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic. **********Dr. Karadzic's public acknowledgment that he accepted the peace agreement would seem to move the Clinton Administration a step closer to deploying the 20,000 troops it has promised as part of a 60,000-member NATO force to enforce the peace. Without sounding bellicose, Dr. Karadzic made it clear that the peacekeepers will not be out of harm's way and may face a greater task than expected. **********Likening Sarajevo to Jerusalem, he said the peacekeepers would have to protect the Serbs in the city. **********\"The Muslims will regret that they opted for this solution,\" Dr. Karadzic said about the unification of Sarajevo. The Bosnian Serbs had wanted the city divided between Serbs and Muslims. Dr. Karadzic said the Serbs would resist Muslim-Croat control and will want to have their own police and their own schools. **********According to the Bosnian Serbs, there are 120,000 Serbs in the Sarajevo suburbs that will now come under Bosnian control. The United Nations puts the number at closer to 50,000. **********\"The international community will have to protect the Serbs in Sarajevo,\" he  said. \"We will demand protection for five years, at least.\" **********Not all Bosnian Serb leaders were as conciliatory as Dr. Karadzic. Ratko Adzic, mayor of the Serbian-controlled Sarajevo suburb of Ilijas, said, \"We will use all forces to fight for our city and our property,\" according to a Belgrade  television report. Mr. Adzic and other leaders from the Serbian suburbs had been summoned to Pale to meet with Dr. Karadzic. **********And though Dr. Karadzic did not criticize Mr. Milosevic, his political rival, other Bosnian Serb leaders have accused the Serbian President of having betrayed the Bosnian Serbs in Dayton. **********On a television program in Belgrade this evening, Biljana Plavsic, a vice president of the unofficial Bosnian Serb republic, accused Mr. Milosevic of having given away more territory than he had been authorized to. **********The Bosnian Serbs are angry that Mr. Milosevic gave up land in a corridor in  the northeast of the country and in a corridor that links Sarajevo with the Muslim enclave at Gorazde. **********During the television interview, Dr. Karadzic used maps to show the territorial divisions the Serbs had wanted. **********Mr. Milosevic also overruled the Bosnian Serbs on the deployment of NATO troops, said Momcilo Krajisnik, speaker of the Bosnian Serbs' self-declared parliament. **********\"We did not want NATO troops on Serbian-held territory,\" said Mr. Krajisnik,  who appeared on Bosnian Serb television with Mr. Milosevic. \"Milosevic outvoted  us.\" **********And the Americans virtually ignored the Bosnian Serbs, he said. Dr. Karadzic  criticized Washington for siding with the Muslims. \"Since the beginning of the war, they have kept them from total defeat,\" he said, and in Dayton the American negotiators drew a map that favored the Muslims, he said. **********Other developments in Bosnia today underscored the politically complex and militarily precarious terrain the new peace force will enter. **********In the early morning hours, some 200 troops of the Muslim-dominated Bosnian Government raided a United Nations camp, firing machine guns over the heads of Bangladeshi peacekeepers and stealing nine armored vehicles, United Nations officials in Sarajevo said. There were no reported casualties. **********And the United Nations in Sarajevo also reported that soldiers of the Bosnian Croat army were burning and looting homes in an area of northwestern Bosnia that is to be returned to Serbian control. The Bosnian Croat army, though nominally part of the federation, has operated largely independently of the Bosnian Government, though the troops are supposed to be unified under the Dayton agreement."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/22/world/japanese-premier-vows-to-renew-leases-on-us-bases-in-okinawa.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-11-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 468, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Japanese Premier Vows to Renew Leases on U.S. Bases in Okinawa", "print_headline": "Japanese Premier Vows to Renew Leases on U.S. Bases in Okinawa", "body_text": " **********Easing a sore point with the United States, Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama  declared today that he would force Japanese landowners to renew leases for property that is used for American bases. **********The first of the leases expires next March. If Mr. Murayama does not intervene then part of the land on an American base will revert to its Japanese  owner. **********While Mr. Murayama's decision clears the way for continued operation of American bases, it also underscores the growing sensitivity of the American military presence, particularly on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa. The  leases involved are on Okinawa, where the American bases are concentrated. **********The decision was particularly painful for Mr. Murayama, the head of the Socialist Party and a lifelong opponent of American bases in Japan. But he has had to abandon most of his Socialist positions since being installed as Prime Minister by a conservative-dominated coalition. **********\"Time is running out,\" Mr. Murayama told reporters later, and indeed time may already have run out. The legal procedure for Mr. Murayama to force an extension of the leases is so cumbersome that it is not clear that it can be completed by  March. **********Normally, it is the Governor of Okinawa who would sign the documents to force owners to lease their land for bases or other public uses. But the Governor, an American-trained scholar named Masahide Ota, has refused to sign and has demanded that American troops be gradually withdrawn from Okinawa. **********Mr. Ota's stance against the American bases is enormously popular. A recent poll found that 89 percent of Okinawans supported his stand, along with 78 percent of Japanese nationwide. **********Antagonism toward the American military presence, always evident in Okinawa,  has grown sharply since the rape in September of a 12-year-old girl, in which three American servicemen have been charged. The men have pleaded guilty and are now on trial. **********The next step is for Prime Minister Murayama to advise Mr. Ota to sign the documents forcing the extension of the leases. Then, when Mr. Ota rejects the advice, Mr. Murayama can order Mr. Ota to sign. **********When Mr. Ota refuses to obey the order, as he is expected to, Mr. Murayama can go to court to compel him to do so. Finally, if Mr. Ota still refuses, Mr. Murayama can sign the necessary documents himself. **********The dispute over the land-use rights has cast a shadow over attempts by American and Japanese officials to reaffirm the importance of the American military presence in Japan.

Their only direct information from the servicemen comes from letters and telephone calls to relatives in which one complained about \"coaching\" by Japanese investigators. **********The servicemen pleaded guilty earlier this month to conspiracy to abduct and rape a Okinawa schoolgirl in September, an incident that has prompted demonstrations and criticism of the United States military presence in Okinawa.  Their trial will continue on Dec. 4, and at least one of the American lawyers plans to attend the next session to monitor the proceedings. **********The American lawyers say the servicemen were pressured into admitting their guilt when they entered a plea at the beginning of the trial earlier this month. \"An independent investigation needs to be done into the veracity of their statements,\" Mr. Ross said. **********The lawyers cite letters home from Seaman Marcus D. Gill that were written in September when United States military officials were transporting the men daily  to the Japanese police office in Okinawa for hours of questioning. **********In a letter to his wife, Mr. Gill described sitting in a room with a Japanese investigator for eight hours a day. In another note to his father, he said the Japanese would not allow a lawyer present while they were being questioned. **********\"I've been 'coached' (forced by Japanese police) into making statements the way the victims describe,\" Seaman Gill wrote. \"At the time the victim was raped, I was in my quarters, but they do not want to hear that.\" **********Japanese officials maintain that the lawyers are raising irrelevant issues because all three servicemen openly pleaded guilty in court to a rape conspiracy charge. **********\"They admitted their guilt, although the two servicemen denied actual sexual  intercourse,\" said Tatsuya Sakuma, first secretary at the Japanese Embassy in Washington. \"Still, they admitted their guilt to abducting the child.

But his cousin's 5-year-old son, Nicola, growing up in Caserta today,  \"turns the family computer on and off, perfectly at ease,\" Mr. Tronco said. **********The bets of Europe's computer industry are riding on the likes of Nicola. With improvement in European economies in the last year or two, sales of personal computers have boomed, growing at rates of 25 percent to 30 percent in  each of the first three quarters of this year, after years of erratic growth. **********Feeding the boom is a fierce price war, as personal computer makers from Europe, Japan and the United States flood the market with fancier and cheaper machines intended to woo computer-shy Europeans. **********The European divisions of American companies are getting their share of the action. Compaq and the International Business Machines Corporation are the No. 1 and No. 2 suppliers, respectively, and Apple Computer, Hewlett-Packard and Dell  rank in the top 10. **********Europe's manufacturers are struggling hard against the American assault. Siemens Nixdorf and Escom A.G., in which the German industrial giant Siemens A.G. holds a 10 percent stake, have had to cut prices steeply to increase their  share of the market. Olivetti of Italy lost $162 million on personal computers last year, and though it is fighting back with a new home computer system called Envision, some industry experts fear it may be the European computer war's first fatality. **********What fuels the hopes of PC companies is that far fewer Europeans than Americans own home computers. Nearly 4 in 10 American households have a computer, but Europe is another story. In technology-minded Germany, slightly less than 20 percent of households have a computer, about the same percentage as in Britain. In France, postal authorities gave out small home terminals, called  Minitels, virtually free of charge in the 1980's to turn Frenchmen into computer enthusiasts. Yet today, only 15 percent of French households have upgraded to a  personal computer. **********As the rate of increase in the sale of home computers begins to slow in the United States, the companies that make them are spending millions to convince Europeans that their future, and their children's, should have a computer in it. **********They have learned that with computers, as with most other consumer products,  the cost of having one is greater in Europe than in the United States. Fewer Europeans than Americans are exposed to computers in schools, and fewer use them at work. More Americans work at home or bring work home from the office than do  Europeans, who more passionately defend the line between home and the workplace, according to a recent survey by Inteco, a market-research firm near London. **********Europeans, the computer makers have learned, have less access than Americans  to the global Internet, and when they do, government telephone monopolies make them pay more for them. And while the market for CD-ROM's is growing apace, Europe's fragmentation into relatively small language groups makes the cost of producing them greater than in the United States. **********Over the last two years, I.B.M. has spent millions of dollars overhauling its personal computer division, the C.P. Company, and used television and print ads  to get Europeans to try computers. The ads typically show fathers, mothers and children working or entertaining themselves at a home computer screen. **********And big manufacturers like I.B.M. and Compaq are banking on brand recognition, hoping that parents who use their products at work will buy the same brand for their children to do their homework. The companies, accustomed to providing big corporations with computer systems, are tailoring new models to home use. **********\"We used to sell only Ferraris,\" said Aldo Meneghelli, chief of Compaq's Italian unit in Milan, which is pushing Compaq's Impresario multimedia system. \"But you don't sell a Ferrari to someone who's satisfied with a Fiat.\" **********The manufacturers are getting a run for their money. Recently, aggressive competitors like Escom, Hewlett-Packard and Dell have cut prices as much as 20 percent to gain market share. In the third quarter Escom catapulted into third place, from seventh, by acquiring a chain of 200 retail stores in Britain, outside its home German market, then undercutting competitors' prices by about one-third. So many producers are rushing in that some analysts fear a glut in the market. **********\"These are still quite high-ticket items for every household to have one,\" said Charles Smulders, who follows the personal computer market for Dataquest in London. \"Yes, penetration of the market is higher in the United States, so the opportunity is here in Europe.\" But, he added, there may always be a gap between the American enthusiasm for computers and that of Europeans. **********Apartments in Europe are generally smaller than American homes, with less space available for computers and peripheral equipment. And with computers somewhat more expensive here, their purchase is more heavily tilted toward the wealthy than in the United States. American consumers now spend $1,500 to $3,000 for a typical personal computer system, while prices in Europe generally begin around $2,000 -- a bigger chunk of usually lower salaries than in America. **********Moreover, with fewer high-volume discount outlets, Europeans often buy their  computer equipment in small retail stores, where operating costs and rent are higher per unit than at the big American discounters. The value-added tax, a kind of sales tax at each stage of production and distribution, adds as much as  20 percent to the cost of a computer. **********\"It's not just computers, but hi-fi's and television sets, too,\" said Miles Thistlethwaite, a computer analyst at Inteco. \"You simply pay more in Europe.\" **********Cost plays a role in other ways, too. Many CD-ROM's for education or entertainment -- films, encyclopedias or children's educational aids -- are American items produced in English, and the cost of having them translated and sold in relatively small European markets is high. These costs, passed along to  the consumer, discourage Europeans from buying them in sufficient quantities to make their production profitable. **********Beyond all that, the high cost of telephone calls and on-line services often  stifles purchases of computers and modems. The European Commission has proposed  directives that demand full market deregulation by Jan. 1, 1998, but with many telephone systems still run by state monopolies for now, service in Europe is costlier than in the United States. **********Heiko Schmidt, a 20-year-old economics major at the University of Bonn, logs  onto the Internet free of charge through the university's access system. Were he to use the German post office's BTX access ports, he would pay a $15 monthly fee, plus the cost of the call. \"Their system is very slow, so you wait hours,\"  he said. **********In most countries, on-line access is only available in big cities, requiring  those elsewhere to make expensive long-distance calls for access. Mr. Schmitt, for instance, is discouraged from joining Compuserve because the nearest access  ports are in Frankfurt and Dusseldorf, 50 to 100 miles away. **********Despite the improvement in computer sales, the tempo of market growth slowed  in the second and third quarters of this year. But manufacturers hope that the Christmas season will revive home PC sales. **********Elio Franci, who operates 15 Arcipelago Sparta computer stores throughout northern Italy, part of Sparta S.p.A., said that the two months of November and  December generally accounted for 40 percent of sales. But echoing store owners elsewhere in Europe, he noted signs of a new European economic slowdown -- something that would not bode well for products like home computers. **********Others, paradoxically, believe that even a slowdown might provide a sales stimulus, as parents seek to equip their children for an increasingly tight job  market. **********\"Parents think kids need one,\" Mr. Thistlethwaite of Inteco said. \"It makes them more attractive for getting a job. They need skills.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/07/business/options-exercised-by-at-t-officials.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-12-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 197, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Options Exercised By AT&T Officials", "print_headline": "Options Exercised By AT&T Officials", "body_text": " **********Seven executives of the AT&T Corporation, including its chairman, Robert E.

Unless RJR Nabisco agrees to an immediate spinoff, the slate will be offered before Nov. 20, the deadline for proposing new board members. **********\"You are, of course, free to solicit proxies to elect a new board of directors at the annual meeting,\" Mr. Harper wrote. \"We do not believe the shareholders will support you and turn over to you control of their $9 billion investment.\"    RJR Nabisco released its response to Mr. LeBow after the stock market closed.

Markets have sprung from places of carnage, and civilian convoys have crossed Bosnian Serb territory to Government-controlled areas. **********For workers at the Lion Cemetery, they have not only experienced a respite from being targets of snipers and artillery and but also from the many burial plots they had to dig. **********\"There were many days of 40 or 50 holes,\" said Husein Salispahic, 47, a gravedigger. \"And there have been many more deaths at the graveside. When the Serbs saw a lot of people here, they liked to shoot. I hope now I will only have to bury the old, not the young people I have grown used to burying. And I am fairly confident about this happening.\" **********Yet for others, memories of many broken cease-fires and failed talks have tempered any optimism they hold for the negotiations in Ohio. **********Referring to the Bosnian Serbs, Amir Began, a 38-year-old soldier said: \"They understand Tomahawk missiles and NATO planes. And if they don't settle, they will understand our tanks on the Drina River.

Kendrick Ledet, 20, of Waycross, Ga. The judge rejected the motion from the mother of Pfc. Rodrico Harp, 21, of Griffin, Ga., because her son did not support the request. **********Privates Harp and Ledet have denied raping the girl, but have both admitted to kidnapping her. In testimony earlier this week, the two marines said they had cooperated only because they were intimidated by the third defendant, Marcus Gill, a 22-year-old Navy seaman. Seaman Gill, of Woodville, Tex., has admitted to kidnapping the girl and raping her. **********But Seaman Gill, who testified on Wednesday, emphasized that all three men had staged the abduction and planned the rape together. He said that Private Harp spotted the girl as she was walking into a stationery story and that Private Ledet had suggested ambushing her. **********The schoolgirl, whose name has not been made public, was bound with tape and  raped in a rented car on a remote road near a farm, according to the prosecutors. She is not expected to appear in court, although her family did submit a statement by her in which she mentions the rape. **********Masanori Higa, the lawyer for Seaman Gill, said that the girl seemed not to remember clearly but that she believed she was raped twice. **********The two mothers, Daisey Harp and Barbara Cannon, were allowed to make the request as legal assistants to their sons. The two women argued that the emotionally charged atmosphere in Okinawa made it virtually impossible for their sons to receive a fair trial. **********Many Okinawans complain about crimes, accidents and noise that they say are the result of the American military presence. Soon after the rape, at least 50,000 Okinawans staged a protest against the bases. **********Underscoring the political repercussions of the rape case -- and the wide presumption among Okinawans that the three servicemen are guilty -- opponents of the American military bases purchased an advertisement in The New York Times on  Nov. 15 calling for their reduction and stating that three Americans had raped a schoolgirl. The advertisement invited readers to make contact or inquiries with the Okinawa Governor's office. **********\"If three Okinawans committed rape in New York and Governor Pataki put an ad  in the paper, do you know how fast the trial would be moved?\" said Michael J. Griffith, a partner at the International Legal Defense Counsel, who is informally advising the defendants. \"These guys have been made a spectacle. Rape is a horrible thing, but these guys deserve the semblance of a fair trial.\" **********A change of venue is provided for in Japanese law but is very unusual, in part because cases are decided not by juries but by judges who are presumed to be less emotional than members of the public. In Japan, judges determine guilt or innocence as well as the sentence, and in this case a three-judge panel of Okinawa judges is hearing the case. The Japanese lawyers for the three servicemen say it is unlikely that the request will be granted. **********\"We know from past rulings that the possibility of this claim is very low and that it is just a waste of time,\" said Yutaka Arakawa, the Japanese lawyer who is representing Private Ledet. Mr. Arakawa added that the delay in the trial could prolong the detention of Private Ledet, and he made it clear that he did not agree with the tactic. **********Japanese prosecutors have an overwhelmingly high conviction rate, partly because they prosecute only cases that have very strong evidence, including confessions. Thus, Japanese defense lawyers often focus not on winning acquittal but on trying to get leniency for clients by apologizing and demonstrating contrition. **********All three American servicemen, including some family members, have made apologies, and each serviceman has also offered to pay $5,000 to the girl as compensation. **********If convicted, the three men could be sentenced to prison terms ranging from three years to life. Sentencing had been expected on Jan. 19, but the request for change of venue may delay that."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/06/business/company-news-jeans-maker-increases-cost-cutting-plan.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1995-12-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 99, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;JEANS MAKER INCREASES COST-CUTTING PLAN", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;JEANS MAKER INCREASES COST-CUTTING PLAN", "body_text": " **********The VF Corporation, which makes Lee Jeans, said yesterday that it would expand its corporate reorganization to cut costs further.

But from his childhood Soap Box Derby days, his passion was always racing cars, not ravioli. **********So, though his grandfather founded Barilla S.p.A. in 1877 and Paolo's brothers were lured into the $2 billion company by their father, Paolo built a career driving at tracks like Le Mans in France and Monza in Italy, and for the  Toyota Motor Corporation in Japan. **********Then, one day in 1990, he decided it was time to go home. \"I felt an attraction for the family business,\" said Paolo, who is now 34. \"I was curious about it. My father always believed that whatever comes naturally and is not forced puts down the deepest roots.\" Three years later, his father died, and he  and his brothers Guido and Luca took over. **********Paolo's return to the family fold is part of a much larger generational changing of the guard in Italian business, which, more than industry in almost any other European country, is dominated by families. Except for the huge but inefficient state sector, virtually all Italian companies, even giants like the  Fiat auto group, the Pirelli rubber company and the Olivetti computer maker, are controlled and run by families. **********Fiat, Pirelli and Olivetti were all founded during Italy's 19th-century industrialization. And some economic historians trace the strong family tradition in Italian business to the great banking and commercial families of the Renaissance, like the Chigis of Genoa and the Medicis of Florence. But most  of the 3,500 private-sector companies active today were created during the rebuilding of Italy's economy after World War II. With the founders now aging, analysts estimate that one-third of them will have to find successors within the next five years. **********The search for new leadership comes at a crucial time for Italian businesses. Like companies elsewhere, they are having to come to grips with the globalization of markets and increased competition from abroad. **********It isn't that leaders in the older generation were global slouches. They hawked shoes and clothing, machine tools and packaging equipment in foreign markets from Stuttgart to Singapore. But they did so in broken English or sign language and rarely dreamed of building factories outside Italy. The sons and daughters have been trained abroad, speak fluent English and maybe one or two other foreign languages, and think readily about manufacturing in other countries. **********So pronounced is the generational shift that Bocconi University, Italy's leading business school, started a special program in 1991 to train the sons and daughters of graying business owners. **********The courses, which enroll about 30 students, focus on practical problems, like defusing family tensions. The students are required to write an essay on their family's business after interviewing their parents and other company officers. **********\"If a father is successful, that usually means he's a strong personality with a very elevated ego,\" said Guido Corbetta, who teaches corporate strategy and helped design the three-week program. \"That causes psychological problems.\" **********Members of the younger generation at big Italian companies often go outside Italy for their business degrees and then get hands-on training at high-profile  positions within the business before taking over. Consider the worldly experience of one rising star of the Italian business world, Alessandro Benetton, next in line to run the Benetton S.p.A. clothing empire. After getting a management degree from Boston University, he spent two years in London as a financial analyst for the American investment firm Goldman, Sachs & Company. Though he spent much of the time \"doing photocopies and making coffee,\" he said, the experience gave him the breadth he needed to finish a degree at the Harvard  Business School, where he wrote his thesis on -- what else? -- Benetton. **********In his final training stint before moving to Benetton, the 31-year-old Alessandro has been put in charge of a family investment and consulting company  that caters to small businesses in the Veneto region of northeastern Italy. **********The young Mr. Benetton recounts how his father, Luciano, 60, two uncles and an aunt pioneered the use of computer-assisted design and distribution to build  their knit-goods company in Veneto into a worldwide clothing and sports-equipment giant. In addition to selling apparel, Benetton partly or wholly owns companies that make sports brands like Rollerblades, Nordica ski boots, Kastle skis and Prince tennis racquets. **********But while Alessandro was steeped from childhood in the family business, he said, \"I always felt free to do whatever I chose.\" **********To be sure, there are big and small problems that result from corporate inbreeding and in some cases from a dearth of international-minded professional  management. GFT S.p.A. of Turin, for instance, the apparel maker that brought the craze for Italian designer fashions to the United States in the 1980's, had  to be bailed out in the 1990's by banks after the Rivetti family proved incapable of managing the complex multinational operations. Non-family members in upper management sometimes clash with the owner clan. Before Carlo de Benedetti took over Olivetti, he worked briefly for Fiat, but quit after locking horns with the Agnelli family, which controls the auto maker. **********Dissension within the family ranks can also make a company vulnerable to corporate raiders. Children sometimes refuse to join the business, or fight over the inheritance. Some of the major foreign acquisitions in Italy -- including the 1993 takeover of the Gucci fashion-goods company by Investcorp of Bahrain -- resulted from such quarrels. **********And there is always the danger that a family will anoint a weak successor. In the early 1990's, when Fiat was struggling through the recession, its banks and  other investors begged Gianni Agnelli, the chairman and family patriarch, not to cede his position to his younger brother, Umberto, who was considered less capable. Gianni Agnelli agreed to delay the passing of the torch, and this year  the family bypassed Umberto and designated his 31-year old son, Giovanni Alberto Agnelli, to inherit his uncle's mantle. **********As such internecine scheming suggests, family-controlled companies in Italy can sometimes be tripped up by their secretiveness. Umberto Bertele, a management professor at Milan Polytechnic University, said Italian business was  rife with \"Chinese boxes, cross shareholdings and other financial constructs that in America would be prohibited.\" **********The habits of doing business around the dining room table and withholding information from the public have spawned a recent wave of scandals and criminal  prosecutions. Numerous companies have been charged with paying off tax officials in exchange for favorable audits. The number of arrests among government inspectors suggests that the practice was widespread. **********One of the defendants is Silvio Berlusconi, the chairman of the Fininvest media company. He has responded by accusing prosecutors of manufacturing the case against him last year when he was Prime Minister of Italy. And Piersilvio,  his son, rejects the charges against his father as \"absolutely ridiculous.\" **********Piersilvio, 26, cut short his university studies to join Fininvest in 1993. After a stint in advertising, he switched to a job creating new programs for a channel aimed at teen-agers. **********Piersilvio said he had been learning the family business since, as a child, he listened in on discussions over heaping plates of pasta around the dining room table at the family home at Arcore, outside Milan. \"I attended all the meetings about television when I was 16, 17, 18,\" he said. **********For all his familiarity with the business, though, he said he had asked himself many times whether he really wanted to work for his father. When faced with tough decisions, he said, he likes to go scuba diving, because the sport helps him relax. \"I must say I did a lot of diving,\" he said. **********Far from crimping Italian companies, analysts said, the family connection generally works to their advantage. \"They often specialize in custom-made products,\" said Enrico Valdani, chairman of the marketing department at Bocconi  University, which is in Milan, Italy's financial capital. And, because control is concentrated, he added, \"they have the ability to adapt quickly.\" **********The internationalization of markets poses a new challenge to Italy's family-run companies. To compete, they have to grow, and to grow they will have  to raise fresh capital. That will mean bringing in more outside investors, diluting the family's stake. **********With the revolution in the media industry, for example, the senior Mr. Berlusconi sold stakes in Fininvest's television unit to the Saudi investor Prince Walid bin Talal and the German media magnate Leo Kirch, while retaining management control. **********Beyond capital, the other big requirement of family companies is management expertise. \"They always produced in Italy and exported, and so we have to ask whether they will be capable of defending international markets,\" said Bocconi's Professor Valdani. \"They will have to be pocket multinationals, perform and behave like the big guys, developing strategies of penetration, joint ventures,  overseas investments.\" **********The Barilla clan never hesitated to seek outside help. In the 1970's, when terrorism and economic uncertainty clouded Italy's business climate, it sold the company to the American businessman J. Peter Grace, then the chairman of W. R. Grace & Company, only to buy it back several years later with the help of Swiss  investors. **********Now, Paolo Barilla and his brothers are again seeking outside expertise, and  this year they hired the former chief of Procter & Gamble, Edwin L. Artzt, to join their board. **********Paolo Barilla paints a glowing future for the pasta company. It will be \"much faster, closer to the consumer, a flexible company,\" he said. And, he added, \"It will be much more international.\" **********Clearly, his father's attentions paid off. Paolo Barilla said his father was  a patient teacher who never forced anything on his three sons. \"He wanted us to  develop a kind of affection for it,\" he said. \"His fear was that if he pushed us and pushed us, in the end we'd reject it.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/08/business/market-watch-a-rough-week-for-a-top-rookie.html": {"writer_name": "Floyd Norris", "pub_date": "1995-10-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 621, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MARKET WATCH;A Rough Week for A Top Rookie", "print_headline": "MARKET WATCH;A Rough Week for A Top Rookie", "body_text": " **********Has any Wall Street rookie ever had a season like Marc A. Kaufman is having? **********Mr. Kaufman was 25 when he took over Fidelity's Select Electronics Fund at the end of March. It was his first stab at managing money, and he hasn't done badly. His fund gained 61.5 percent in his first six months, more than any other fund. **********Mr. Kaufman did that by leaping into semiconductor stocks with both feet. In a technology-crazed market, that was the right thing to do, and he did it with more gusto than anyone else. **********Mr. Kaufman, now 26, joined Fidelity as an analyst in 1992 after getting a master's degree. He dropped out of the Ph.D. program in electrical engineering at M.I.T. \"It was very intellectually challenging,\" he said of academia, \"but on a day-to-day basis, it is not as exciting as what we do in this business. Engineering is a science. There is an art to investing.\" **********This has been an exciting year to be investing in technology stocks, especially for Mr. Kaufman. The cash has poured into his fund, pushing assets from $152 million at the end of 1994 to $1.25 billion now. **********Such heavy cash flows can create a wonderful merry-go-round. As the money comes in, a fund buys more of the stocks it likes, which drives up the price of  those stocks and improves the fund's performance. That brings in more money, and away we go. **********There is a theory on Wall Street that it is young money managers who are best positioned to take advantage of wild bull markets, such as the current tech boom. No matter how much history they have read, they are untroubled by recollections of being caught owning collapsing stocks. When things are good, that gives them the courage to throw caution to the winds. **********Mr. Kaufman knows there are people who see the current boom in technology stocks as a classic bubble, but he doesn't sound worried. He isn't buying a market, he said. He's buying stocks. \"There have always been plenty of good ideas to buy, and that is still true today.\" **********Enthusiastic investors sometimes have a way of engaging in what might be called \"ruler forecasting,\" placing a ruler on a trend line and assuming it will continue indefinitely. Mr. Kaufman may in fact be guilty of that now. He said demand for semiconductors has been rising at a year-over-year rate of 30 percent for several years and he sees no reason for that to change. **********In that way, he said, \"this period is very different from 1983,\" when semiconductor stocks soared, only to tumble. \"That was much more of an inventory build for demand that was never there in semiconductors,\" he said. \"The demand here is much more sustainable.\" He talked with scorn of the \"panic\" that has driven down the price of one semiconductor maker, Integrated Silicon Solutions,  from a July high of $73 to about $30 now, largely out of fears that prices of its chips will fall, and says the stock is a good buy. **********Integrated Silicon Solutions is, in fact, a fine example of how amazing this  year has been. The company went public in February with insiders selling stock at $13. It is a rare year when someone can look at a stock eight months after it had gone public, see it selling at more than twice the original price, and pronounce that a sign of panic. **********Last week was bad for tech stocks and for investors in Mr. Kaufman's fund, which fell 5.5 percent. Have such stocks peaked? We don't know. But some day, perhaps soon, we will see if Mr. Kaufman and other technology bulls are as nimble in a falling market as they have been in a soaring one."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/06/world/intruder-startles-wife-of-canada-s-premier.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-11-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 171, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Intruder Startles Wife of Canada's Premier", "print_headline": "Intruder Startles Wife of Canada's Premier", "body_text": " **********Prime Minister Jean Chretien's wife, Aline, came face-to-face with an intruder who was standing at their bedroom door with an open jackknife early today. **********Mr. Chretien said he and his wife locked themselves in their room until the Royal Canadian Mounted Police arrived minutes later and arrested the man. **********Neither was injured. **********Mr. Chretien told reporters that his wife woke up at about 2:45 A.M. when she heard a noise.

The 1977 Community Reinvestment Act allows the Government to block mergers by banks  that do not have good records of lending money where they do business. Thus, a protest filing is perhaps the best way an activist on a street corner can get attention of the bankers high in the executive suite. **********In many larger mergers, groups have filed protests complaining about the banks' records only to withdraw the challenges when the bank agreed to increase  its loans and grants to the community. But in other cases, protesters have delayed approval. The proposed merger between the Fleet Financial Group and the  Shawmut National Corporation announced in February has still not been approved by the Federal Reserve, largely because a storm of protest about Fleet's past lending record. **********The process has been described as blackmail by bankers and as the only way to get a bank's attention by community activists. **********Chemical and Chase accept the fact that to get their deal done they will have to substantially increase the $1 billion a year that the two banks already invest in low-income programs. While most of the money is in new home mortgage loans, there are important grants to local groups that in some cases help them survive. **********But in their own twist on the process, the banks are not waiting for the protests. Instead the banks took the unusual step of sending questionnaires to 375 community groups asking what they needed in preparation for today's announcement. **********\"We don't want to submit to what has been seen in the past as C.R.A. blackmail.\" Carol Parry, Chemical's top community reinvestment officer said. \"There will be some unhappy people who don't get what they want. But we don't want to be in a position where we have one group that holds us hostage while 350 groups sign on.\" **********Matthew Lee, the director of Inner City Press/Community on the Move, a Bronx  organization that has challenged several bank mergers, criticized Chemical for what he called a move to buy silence from community groups. **********\"Groups are not supposed to take $5,000 grants and then not protest,\" he said. **********But many other community activists known that this is the time to put pressure on and they see nothing wrong with what they get. \"I find it disingenuous when people in the banking industry put out terms like blackmail or extortion,\" said Brad Lander, executive director of the Fifth Avenue Committee, a Brooklyn housing group. \"Since the merger will affect the city in negative ways --job losses and branch closings -- it seems appropriate that at this moment they are especially accountable.\" **********Of the Fifth Avenue Committee's $550,000 budget, 20 percent comes from banks, the largest source after government subsidies and property management fees. Chemical and Chase have given the group $9,000 so far this year. **********Francine Justa, director of Neighborhood Housing Services of New York, which  develops low-income housing, said: \"So what if a few groups try to get some computers from a $400 billion corporation. People are trying to survive.\" **********One irony of this process is that Chemical is largely regarded as having one  of the best community lending records in New York, with a top grade from Federal regulators. When it merged with Manufacturers Hanover in 1992, Chemical committed $750 million to community development programs over five years. After  four years, the total loans and grants is actually $1.9 billion. **********Last year's share of this investment totaled $502 million in community investment loans and 2,021 nonprofit and community groups got $6.1 million in grants. More than half of the lending total is $282 million for home mortgages.  Another $174 million was lent to small businesses in low-income areas, to nonprofit organizations and through the Small Business Administration loan program. **********But Chemical's record has not been enough to keep the protesters at bay. **********\"We want to make sure that their commitment level after the merger goes up not down,\" said said John Taylor, the executive director of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, a Washington clearinghouse for local groups. **********Moreover, some groups say Chase's record is worse than Chemical's, largely because it has appeared to be shunning lower-income customers. **********Banking lawyers said that Chemical's approach seemed to be designed to shift  the spotlight to housing development programs, an area in which the bank would like to make large investments. That will distract attention for Mr. Lee's demand that Chemical increase its routine deposit and lending services through branches in low-income areas. **********\"Chemical is very smart to attempt a pre-emptive strike,\" said Warren Traiger, a New York banking lawyer who specializes in the Community Reinvestment Act. \"They can divide and conquer. The groups that benefit under the proposal will take Chemical's side.\" **********Despite the large amounts, these commitments are hardly a huge sacrifice for  the new bank, which will be run largely by Chemical management under the tonier  Chase name. Chemical's community development area makes a small profit, in fact, because the high returns from lending to big housing projects subsidizes the operating costs of making small business loans and mortgages to first time home  buyers. Bad debts are no more common in these loans than those to more affluent  customers. **********\"What the C.R.A. has done is bring people to the table,\" Mr. Taylor said. \"In the past, mergers were largely adversarial. Banks did not sit down and talk abut community needs. Now we and the banks realize we're all in this together.\" **********Banking lawyers say it is highly unlikely that regulators will block Chemical's merger or any of the other large deals. But the regulators do try to  orchestrate these battles between the banks and the community groups as a way to keep the pressure on the banks. **********\"There is a lot of shaping that goes on in a subtle way as a result of the fact that banks have to file applications, with public scrutiny, pressure from community groups and sometimes questions asked by regulators,\" said one senior Federal official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. **********Indeed, the Federal Reserve and the New York State Banking Department have just called for a rare public hearing on Nov. 16 to look at the Chemical-Chase merger, which will largely focus on community concerns. **********Chemical, of course, has been preparing to defend its record. It devoted 192  of the 270 pages in its Government merger application to its community-lending record.

Such a drug could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars annually and might be prescribed  to treat other autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis. **********The aim is to suppress the activities of a protein known as tumor necrosis factor, or T.N.F., which normally helps jump-start the immune system but sometimes goes haywire. In the case of rheumatoid arthritis, T.N.F. starts a series of events that can result in irreversible damage to the body's joints. **********In 1985 Dr. Bruce A. Beutler, now an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and an associate professor of internal medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, was one of the first  scientists to isolate and clone T.N.F. Dr. Beutler has now received a patent covering what he contends is the most effective way to thwart the wayward protein. **********There are several possible ways to block T.N.F. One is to administer monoclonal antibodies, large Y-shaped proteins that originate from the immune cells of mice. These antibodies bind to the T.N.F. and neutralize it. Centocor Inc. is taking this approach, as are other companies. **********The problem with this method, Dr. Beutler contends, is that even when these antibodies have been \"humanized,\" the body will recognize them as being foreign  in origin and eventually will produce its own antibodies that will nullify any therapeutic effect. \"Rheumatoid arthritis is a lifelong illness, so you need a drug that will work for years and years,\" Dr. Beutler said. **********Dr. Beutler's approach is to splice two genes together to produce a new gene  that codes for a Y-shaped molecule that is essentially an artificial monoclonal  antibody. The two arms of the Y are T.N.F. receptors; the stem of the Y is a fragment of a normal human antibody. **********\"It's a thousand times more potent in neutralizing T.N.F. than a typical monoclonal antibody would be,\" Dr. Beutler said. \"Another important advantage is that it is made of pieces of two molecules that already exist in the human body, so it is invisible to the immune system. It's very probable that this could be given indefinitely, just as human insulin is given to diabetics.\" **********Hoffmann-LaRoche, a unit of Roche Holding Ltd., and the Immunex Corporation are testing a similar concept clinically; patent attorneys at both companies said they were not aware of Dr. Beutler's patent. **********\"We actually own the molecule -- or at least we think we do,\" Dr. Beutler said. **********Ray Wheatley, director of technology transfer at the Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, said the university had not spoken yet with any companies about the patent. \"We haven't tried to market it yet, but our patent could be seen as being very powerful,\" he said. **********Dr. Beutler, Karsten Peppel and David F. Crawford received patent 5,447,851,  which was assigned to the University of Texas. **********An Alternative To Swaddling **********Though seemingly immobile, small babies can wiggle out of their clothing with disconcerting ease. Khoi Nguyen-Senderowicz, a mother of four with a fifth on the way, recently patented two ways to keep infants covered up. **********Her first patent is for a \"zipperless, snapless, laceless infant sac with car safety seating capability.\" The sac, which has sleeves that end in mitts, is elegantly simple. The front features two overlapping panels. The inside panel wraps across the front of the baby and attaches to a Velcro tab inside the sac at one edge. The outside panel wraps across to the opposite edge, where it also  attaches to a Velcro tab. **********Ms. Nguyen-Senderowicz said her invention was a snug alternative to swaddling. \"When you think you've got the swaddling all neat and nice, everything falls apart and baby's legs start sticking out,\" she said. \"With this, you just plop baby in and she stays there.\" **********The second patent covers an elastic brace designed to keep socks or booties in place. The brace resembles a figure-eight, with the top loop wrapping around  the ankle and the bottom one around the arch of the foot. **********Ms. Nguyen-Senderowicz recently formed a company, Appealing Apparel in Berkeley, Calif., to manufacture and market the two inventions. She received patent 5,418,979 for the sac and patent 5,445,598 for the brace. **********A Disposable Liner For the Shower **********James Williams, an inventor in Burlington, Mass., has patented a disposable plastic liner for showers that he said will simplify bathroom cleaning. **********The liner is about 3 millimeters thick and attaches to the top of the shower  walls with rubber-based adhesive tape. At the bottom of the liner is a semi-rigid foil frame, which is crimped into the edge formed between the bathtub and the shower wall. **********\"If you make a couple of incisions the plastic will stretch and slide over the bathroom fixtures,\" Mr. Williams said. **********The liner, which can be made of recycled plastic and is meant to be replaced  every few months, takes about 15 minutes to install, he said. \"But we've removed it in as little as 46 seconds,\" he added. \"It sure beats washing the goop off your walls with some kind of caustic soup.\" **********Mr. Williams said the liner could prove a valuable advertising medium. \"You would have the undivided attention of your naked consumer for 5 to 10 minutes every day,\" he said. **********Mr. Williams, who hopes to license the liner, received patent 5,435,021."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/06/business/first-bank-confirms-a-large-scale-buyback-of-its-stock.html": {"writer_name": "Saul Hansell", "pub_date": "1995-12-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 597, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "First Bank Confirms a Large-Scale Buyback of Its Stock", "print_headline": "First Bank Confirms a Large-Scale Buyback of Its Stock", "body_text": " **********First Bank System Inc. confirmed yesterday that it had begun buying back its  stock in large amounts immediately after announcing an agreement early in November to buy First Interstate Bancorp for about $10 billion in stock. **********Wells Fargo & Company, which is waging a hostile bid for First Interstate, raised the issue of the buybacks in recent weeks, contending that First Bank, which is based in Minneapolis, had \"artificially inflated\" its stock price. **********First Bank at first declined to comment, but said yesterday that it had bought 3.1 million of its shares in the fourth quarter, the vast majority of which were purchased in the four weeks after its Nov. 4 agreement with First Interstate. First Bank justified the purchases by noting that it had a longstanding program to reduce excess capital through buybacks and that it bought four million shares in the third quarter of this year. **********Because various rules prohibited the bank from buying back its stock in October, while it was negotiating the deal, and in December, when another deal is scheduled to be submitted to shareholders, First Bank said it needed to concentrate its stock purchases in November. **********\"We had been out of the market for much of the quarter, and we had a big pent-up demand for shares,\" said Lee Mitau, general counsel for First Bank. **********Some, however, have raised concerns about the timing of the buybacks. \"The investment community feels it is not getting a fair read on the value of First Bank System's stock price,\" said Thomas K. Brown, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. Still, he and other analysts said that the distortion of the  buybacks on the company's share price was relatively small. **********\"First Bank cannot really change where its stock is trading simply by buying  back some stock,\" said David S. Berry, research director at Keefe Bruyette & Woods. **********The gap between the value of the two bids for First Interstate has widened during the last month. Initially, First Bank's offer was worth only $3 a share less than the Wells bid. By yesterday, the gap had widened to $11 a share, with  Wells offering $144.25 of its stock for each First Interstate share and First Bank offering $135.20 of its stock. **********Yesterday, the shares of First Bank fell 25 cents, to $52, on the New York Stock Exchange, while shares of Wells Fargo fell 50 cents, to $216.375. Shares of First Interstate closed at $137.875, down 25 cents. **********Wells has also contended that because of the buyback, First Bank will not be  able to use a favorable accounting treatment for the deal known as a pooling of  interests. **********In its announcement yesterday, First Bank said it had received a letter from  its auditors advising that the bank would be able to use the pooling method. Ultimately, the Securities and Exchange commission will decide the matter, and the S.E.C. is generally thought to be hostile to pooling of interests, especially in cases of stock buybacks. **********If companies do not qualify for pooling-of-interests accounting, they are required to deduct the \"good will\" of an acquisition -- the amount by which the  purchase price exceeds the book value -- from their profits during at least 15 years. Wells Fargo, breaking with banking custom, has said that it will not use  a pooling and will accept $400 million a year in good will charges if it succeeds in buying First Interstate. **********The ultimate winner of First Interstate, the nation's 14th-largest bank, will be decided by its shareholders in a vote that will probably take place late in February or early in March."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/06/business/boeing-gets-jet-order.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-12-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 64, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Boeing Gets Jet Order", "print_headline": "Boeing Gets Jet Order", "body_text": " **********Air Berlin, a German charter-tour operator, has placed an $86 million order with the Boeing Company for two 737-400 jets.

Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb warrior charged with the massacre of thousands of Muslim men, now spends much of his time isolated in a mountain bunker surrounded by a coterie of officers. His moods are said to swing from rage to uneasy calm. **********His partner in the Bosnian Serb cause, Radovan Karadzic, the psychiatrist-turned-politician, had the foundation of his political program swept out from under him by the Bosnian peace accord. Those who have seen him say that his speech is now often slurred, apparently by medication, and his robust physique has been withered by anxiety as he faces an uncertain future that includes an indictment for war crimes. **********This is the picture acquaintances draw of the two people who were most conspicuously missing from today's peace ceremony in Paris: beaten men desperately dealing to save their jobs and stay away from the International War  Crimes tribunal at The Hague. **********The fate of General Mladic and Dr. Karadzic, yesterday's swaggering conquerors, have been left largely in the hands of the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic, a man who once was their patron. But Mr. Milosevic has been  distancing himself from them for 18 months now and went so far as to tell Assistant Secretary of State Richard C. Holbrooke last weekend that General Mladic had \"gone off the deep end,\" Clinton Administration officials said. **********President Milosevic has shown he can put the squeeze on the Bosnian Serbs when he needs to. The peace accord itself was evidence, as was the release on Tuesday of two French pilots who had been held for more than three months by Bosnian Serb forces. **********But Mr. Milosevic is in no hurry to make any drastic moves against the Bosnian Serb leaders, although the peace accord stipulates that all parties agree to cooperate with the war crimes tribunal and carries penalties, including the renewal of sanctions, for harboring indicted war criminals. **********The underlying reason for not wanting the Bosnian Serb leaders to appear before the tribunal at The Hague is that they would most likely argue they were  following the orders of Mr. Milosevic, a defense that would be harmful to Mr. Milosevic and uncomfortable for the Western leaders who have just orchestrated a peace with him, Western diplomats said. **********By the same token, the United States has softened its position, with the Pentagon saying that American troops will not hunt down the two men, for whom arrest warrants have been issued, but will seize them if they come across them. **********Earlier, the Pentagon had refused to deploy in Bosnia while General Mladic and Dr. Karadzic remained in office. Diplomats said the turnaround was a result  of the need for peace before justice. **********Legally, Mr. Milosevic does not recognize the legitimacy of The Hague tribunal, according to Borisav Jovic, a member of Mr. Milosevic's political party and a framer of the Serbian Constitution. Mr. Milosevic would like Dr. Karadzic and Mr. Mladic to fade away, or \"go to ground,\" as one diplomat put it. **********Mr. Milosevic has decided the best solution for Dr. Karadzic would be for him to avoid seeking office again or to be defeated in elections scheduled for next  year. He mentioned the elections again today in his speech at the signing ceremony in Paris. **********Dr. Karadzic was asked to resign but refused, saying he would stand by the wishes of the self-styled Bosnian Serb parliament, which is expected to vote on  his continued leadership within two weeks. **********\"Milosevic can only work in an oblique way,\" said Milorad Dodik, one of eight independent deputies in the assembly. \"Milosevic is not in a position to issue orders directly. To get rid of Karadzic in a violent way would make a martyr out of him and rehabilitate his position.\" **********Mr. Dodik, who has seen Dr. Karadzic, said the Bosnian Serb leader \"looked exhausted and has lost a lot of weight.\" **********The concentrated hold Dr. Karadzic once had on power has diminished sharply.  And popular feeling dismisses him as yesterday's man who brought huge bloodshed  and tragedy for no gain. **********The new power center, dominated by Mr. Milosevic's supporters in Banja Luka,  opposes Dr. Karadzic. The war profiteers who supported Dr. Karadzic in the Bosnian Serb \"parliament\" in Pale, a suburb of Sarajevo, are now looking to revamp factories and businesses, and they are not sure that he is the best figurehead for Bosnian Serbs as they try to make financial deals with the West. **********Some estimate that Dr. Karadzic's party, the Serbian Democratic Party, would  not win double digits in an election held now. His police, however, still control the Bosnian border with Serbia, making access for foreigners to Serbian-held areas of Bosnia virtually impossible without permission from his office. **********When Mr. Dodik asked Dr. Karadzic about his indictment, the Bosnian Serb leader said he expected to go to The Hague. **********\"He said he will deny all accusations and that he can prove he's innocent,\" said Mr. Dodik, who is a political opponent of Dr. Karadzic. Mr. Dodik said he believed there was such open conflict between Dr. Karadzic and the Bosnian Serb  military leadership that a case could be made that he had no control over local  commanders. **********General Mladic, described as essentially a physical and psychic wreck, may be a more difficult matter. One administrator from Banja Luka said officers loyal to General Mladic were concerned because his behavior had become so erratic. **********The general mostly lives in seclusion at Han Pijesak, a warren of bunkers dug into Bosnia's mountains for the use of Tito in case of an attack on Yugoslavia. **********General Mladic is said to be drinking heavily, railing about NATO and brooding over the death of his daughter, Ana, who committed suicide last year, reportedly over a Serbian magazine article that depicted her father as a murderer. He visits his Belgrade home occasionally, in part to seek medical treatment for kidney stones and gall bladder problems. **********In a speech two weeks ago at a rally in the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Vlasenica, General Mladic said NATO troops would meet a \"fiery welcome.\" **********\"Those who bombarded us are now infiltrating like lambs, saying they wish to  protect peace,\" he said. The speech was an embarrassment, according to one Serb  who listened, because it took no account of reality. **********On the one hand, Mr. Milosevic would like General Mladic sidelined and preparations appear to be underway, diplomats said, for his replacement either by Gen. Milan Gvero, a deputy, or Gen. Novica Simic, the head of the East Bosnia corps of the Bosnian Serb forces. **********But the administrator in Banja Luka said Bosnian Serb officers believe that demoting General Mladic would leave him \"easy prey,\" and that the best way to protect him was to \"build him into the system.\" **********General Mladic is being represented by a prominent criminal lawyer from Athens, Alexandros Lykourezos. In a telephone interview, Mr. Lykourezos said the defense would take the line that it did not \"recognize the competency of the Hague court.\" He added, however, that the real adjudicator in the situation was  the Serbian President. **********\"Milosevic is the main factor and the strongman in the whole crisis,\" Mr. Lykourezos said. \"I don't think he will want General Mladic arrested or want the army to do it.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/04/business/japanese-stocks-higher-036641.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-10-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 37, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Japanese Stocks Higher", "print_headline": "Japanese Stocks Higher", "body_text": " **********Stocks rose at midday, helped in part by higher futures prices.

The first step  is to begin on New Year's Day, when he will open the first Internet world's fair, to be followed in February by the start of what he is calling the Internet railroad. (A preview of the fair can be seen at the World Wide Web site http://park.org/fair.) **********The fair itself will be a digital exhibition set up on a vast global \"farm\"  of computer disks located primarily in Tokyo, San Francisco, Washington and Amsterdam, and created by people in more than 60 countries during the next year. Besides offerings like an interactive history of wind energy at the Netherlands' national site, and other downloadable multimedia material specially designed for the fair, there will be recorded and live events like an interview with the Dalai Lama in early January and video coverage of the 25th anniversary of the Kennedy Center in April. **********\"The impact of the fair is huge in Japan,\" said Joichi Ito, a Japanese business executive who is helping organizing the fair there. \"We have everyone focusing on it.\" **********The railroad is actually an ambitious effort to create a globe-girdling digital pipe to carry the digital world's fair, fast enough to transport multimedia information -- sound, full-motion video and computer data. While the  fair is scheduled to last only through the end of 1996, Mr. Malamud hopes the railroad will become a transport medium that endures into the future. **********In the last year Mr. Malamud has circled the globe seven times himself, logging 250,000 air miles, meeting with government agencies, telephone company and computer executives and raising $100 million in contributions of technology  and service to start the fair. **********In Japan, for example, industry and government have contributed two high-speed digital backbone networks, two terabytes of computer disk space and an I.B.M. supercomputer to help turn the Tokyo neighborhood of Harajuku into a digital city, where people on the scene can tap into the Internet from cybercafes while people around the world can log in for interactive events. **********Mr. Malamud has seized on the idea for the first Internet world's fair and the global railroad as an information-age analogy to the way world fairs in the  earlier, industrial era helped to usher new technologies into widespread use. **********The traditional world fairs \"taught people about the world around them, but they also challenged engineers,\" Mr. Malamud said. \"Most importantly, the world  fairs, because of their scale and scope, proved to business and home consumers that the technology had a place in their lives.\" **********As he prepares to put the fair -- the Internet 1996 World Exposition -- on line, he has assembled a dedicated chain of high-speed fiber-optic links capable of sending data at speeds as high as 155 million bits a second in an arc stretching from Taiwan, Korea and Japan in Asia to Finland, Sweden and Russia in Europe. By the end of 1996 Mr. Malamud hopes to stretch the Internet railroad fiber around the entire world. Along the way he has assembled endorsements from  presidents including Bill Clinton and Boris N. Yeltsin and has occasionally left some of those who have suffered his prodding a little exasperated. **********\"I've ended up doing more lobbying for Carl Malamud than I have for some heads of state,\" said a Federal official who has been called on repeatedly to help gain commitments for the project. **********In an era when the Internet has become synonymous with commercialism and instant fortunes, Mr. Malamud's commitment to public service has set him apart. **********\"This is an individual moving companies and countries by the strength of his  will and the obvious goodness of his ideas,\" said Larry Landweber, a computer scientist who is president of the Internet Society, an international organization that oversees the Internet's standards. \"He's an evangelist.\" **********For Mr. Malamud it is all part of the work that has been his passion since the early 1980's when he was first introduced to computer networking while studying economics as an undergraduate at Indiana University, where he subsequently got an M.B.A. A decade later he became an early volunteer helping to create the Interop conference, a computer-networking industry trade show that was one of the first venues to demonstrate the potential of the Internet. **********With the financial help of Dan Lynch, an Interop founder, Mr. Malamud set out in 1991 as a self-described \"Official Internet Explorer,\" physically traveling around the world three times in his quest to visit as many nodes on the Internet as possible and meet as many of the people who were building the network infrastructure as he could. **********That project led to his 1992 book \"Exploring the Internet: a Technical Travelogue,\" a chatty account of the then-little known elite that built the Internet, before it became a household word. **********The idea of a cyberspace world's fair was hatched in late 1994 when Mr. Malamud was talking with Vinton Cerf, a designer of the original technical protocols -- communications software standards -- for the Internet. Inspired by  the idea, he immediately hopped on a plane to persuade two Internet experts, Jan Murai of Japan and Rob Blokzijl of the Netherlands, whom he had met on his original global tour, to sign on to the idea. **********Today Mr. Malamud maintains that there are still two ways to build the Internet. One is the high-stakes, high-visibility route of initial public offerings in the stock market, the money-raising approach being pursued by people like Netscape Communication's founders, Jim Clark and Mark Andreeson. The other route, Mr. Malamud maintains, is by soliciting funds and building viable public works projects that benefit the common good. **********Mr. Malamud takes pains to point out that he hasn't organized the fair by himself. There are now hundreds of people working on the project around the world, including some of the Internet's best technical experts. **********Chris Swanson, a technical advise from SSDS, a network consulting firm in Englewood, Colo., is global project manager on a piece of the project known as the World's Central Park. Marten Tepstra, a special-projects engineer from Bay Networks Inc., is global project manager on the Internet railroad, responsible for installing and maintaining the router computers that will keep the global traffic flowing over the railroad. **********The effort, Mr. Malamud said, did not compete with the current rush to commercialize the Internet. \"People don't move to towns without parks and roads  and schools,\" he said. \"It's a viable part of the global business.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/18/business/futures-markets-shrinking-inventories-in-midwest-prompt-sharp-rise-in-oil-prices.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-11-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 306, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FUTURES MARKETS;Shrinking Inventories in Midwest Prompt Sharp Rise in Oil Prices", "print_headline": "FUTURES MARKETS;Shrinking Inventories in Midwest Prompt Sharp Rise in Oil Prices", "body_text": " **********Prices of crude oil surged yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange after a scarcity of supplies for delivery against the expiring futures contract  forced buyers to bid prices higher. **********On other markets, prices of natural gas also climbed.

America must choose peace as well.\" **********Clearly aiming his remarks at the American public, Mr. Clinton spoke of the  \"senseless slaughter of so many innocent people that our fellow citizens had to  watch night after night after night for four long years on their television screens.\" **********White House advisers were keenly aware that Mr. Clinton will have to make a major personal investment in the effort to convince Americans that their country's leadership responsibilities require that their soldiers be sent to a chaotic region to patrol a peace that could yet revert to war. **********With a NATO plan to enforce a Balkans peace expected to be submitted to the President within a week -- and large-scale deployment of troops possibly only weeks away -- Mr. Clinton and his foreign policy team were preparing to mount a  quick and extensive campaign, including a televised presidential address, to overcome expected domestic opposition. **********Senior European officials have said that the promised 60,000-strong NATO peacekeeping force could only take shape if the United States carried through on its promise to send 20,000 American troops. And European countries would probably also pull their troops out at the same time the United States did, French officials said today. **********The Republican leaders of Congress quickly pronounced the troop proposal a militarily risky venture that the President has yet to justify, but which nevertheless is the President's Constitutional prerogative. **********Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich said he would oppose a troop deployment. But he urged Congress to withhold judgment until Mr. Clinton has explained his actions, saying the President \"has an enormous burden in trying to lead NATO.\" **********At an appearance before Republican Governors in New Hampshire, Mr. Gingrich said the House of Representatives would hold hearings on the Bosnia accord next  week and would try to send a Congressional delegation to the region within the month. **********Senator Bob Dole, the majority leader, said he was pleased by Mr. Clinton's promise to consult with Congress on any peacekeeping mission, but that no troops should be dispatched without the permission of Congress. **********\"This is a very serious matter,\" Mr. Dole said. \"We have no greater responsibility than to prevent the needless shedding of American blood.\" **********A third Republican Presidential hopeful, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, flatly  opposed a troop commitment. \"American power cannot solve every awful problem in  the world,\" he said. **********Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana, also a Republican Presidential candidate, called Mr. Clinton's diplomatic achievement \"remarkable,\" but added that the details of any peacekeeping mission remain thorny. **********The reaction from the rest of Congress was sharply partisan, with Republicans who spoke on the issue uniformly criticizing the White House's policy. **********Just last week, ignoring warnings that the action could sabotage the peace talks, the House voted 243 to 171 to prevent money from being spent to send American troops to Bosnia. Mr. Gingrich said today that the House would hold extensive hearings on the issue. **********Mr. Clinton's own approach to Bosnia often changed and his attention had seemed episodic until the near collapse of the United Nations peacekeeping mission last summer. At that time, he began to chart a new course of greater American involvement that culminated in today's peace agreement. **********In recent speeches, Mr. Clinton has stressed that \"American leadership is indispensable\" in settling conflicts from Haiti to the Middle East. But he has never delivered a formal address laying out his Administration's policy toward Bosnia and explaining the commitment he made in 1993 to send ground forces there should peace be reached. **********The President's campaign to persuade the American public got under way even before Mr. Clinton appeared in the Rose Garden today to announce the peace accord. He had already begun calling Congressional leaders to inform them of the breakthrough. **********Even though Congress is in a Thanksgiving recess, the White House planned to  send Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Assistant Secretary of State Richard C. Holbrooke, the main American peace negotiator, to start briefing Congressional members on the agreement, perhaps as early as Wednesday. **********Anticipating the concerns in Congress, Mr. Clinton said in his Rose Garden remarks that the NATO mission would be \"clear and limited\" and that American troops \"will take their orders only from the American general who commands NATO.\" **********He said the troops would have the authority to meet any threat with \"immediate and decisive force\" and that there would be a \"reasonable timetable for their withdrawal.\" **********Once Mr. Clinton is satisfied with the NATO plan, he said he would consult with Congress and ask it to support the American participation. **********Although Mr. Clinton has never spelled out what form he expected that support to take, Administration officials have said he would seek a nonbinding resolution similar to the one President Bush narrowly pushed through Congress before the 1991 Persian Gulf war. **********The White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, said Mr. Clinton still held that under his Constitutional authority as Commander in Chief he has the right to commit troops abroad without Congressional approval. But he said he thought \"the case for American participation in helping make this peace will be clear to the American people and thus also clear to the American Congress.\" **********In fact, Congress has little power to stop the President from sending troops  except by trying to stop financing for the operation, which is expected to cost  $1.5 billion for a one-year troop deployment. **********And even Congressional critics of the President said today that they were unlikely to block deployment. More likely, they said, Congress will seek to force Mr. Clinton to agree to restrictions on any deployment before the troops go abroad. **********White House officials said they were not certain when the President would address the American people on the issue. The officials also said they were considering whether to add a visit to American troops in Germany to the President's long-planned trip next week to Britain, Ireland and Spain. **********White House officials said they were preparing two levels of arguments to make the case for American troops to be sent to the Balkans. **********Mr. Clinton would argue that America has a moral obligation to stop the killing in Europe and a strategic interest both in remaining the leader of the NATO alliance and in keeping the Balkan conflict from spreading in Europe."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/20/world/ex-communist-appears-to-best-walesa-for-president-of-poland.html": {"writer_name": "Jane Perlez", "pub_date": "1995-11-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1442, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ex-Communist Appears to Best Walesa for President of Poland", "print_headline": "Ex-Communist Appears to Best Walesa for President of Poland", "body_text": " **********In the most stunning result since the end of Communism in Eastern Europe, a telegenic, 41-year-old former Communist appeared set to defeat Lech Walesa, the  icon of democracy and anti-Communism, in Poland's presidential election today, early results showed. **********The outcome of the election, the second democratic ballot for President since the fall of the Communists, teetered all night and would probably be decided by  as few as several thousand votes, analysts said. **********With votes counted from 1,150 of 22,472 polling places, the former Communist, Aleksander Kwasniewski, led with 51.4 percent to Mr. Walesa's 48.6 percent. **********Despite the small number of votes counted, polling experts said the trend was against Mr. Walesa and public television's chief electoral analyst said he doubted the President would win a second term. **********The prospect of a victory by Mr. Kwasniewski, who has packaged himself as a social democrat with economic and foreign policies akin to Mr. Walesa's, sent deep tremors through a society that just six years ago was euphoric over the collapse of Communism. **********The downfall of Mr. Walesa, 52, would end an era that he began 14 years ago as a shipyard worker determined to topple Communism from his base as the leader  of the Solidarity trade union. **********A triumph by Mr. Kwasniewski would give the former Communists, who won legislative elections two years ago, control of Poland's Parliament, Government  and the presidency, furthering a trend throughout Central and Eastern Europe. In the last 18 months former Communists have won parliamentary elections in Hungary, Slovakia and Bulgaria. **********Mr. Walesa's supporters, bewildered and bitter as they appeared on television talk shows tonight, acknowledged that Mr. Kwasniewski's ascendancy would not mean that voters chose a return to Communism or that they even felt a deep nostalgia for the past. The election fight was more over symbols and style than  over differences on how to manage the transformation from Communism to capitalism. **********But with the highest voter turnout -- 67.2 percent -- since democratic elections returned to Poland in 1990, the results showed a society deeply divided. Speaking before early results were available, Mr. Kwasniewski recognized the divisions in a short, conciliatory statement before his supporters at a crowded headquarters in Warsaw. **********\"The biggest sin would be to divide Poles,\" he said. \"This is not about who has power or no power. Our argument is about vision. In Poland there is a lot of space.\" **********He added that Poland had to move toward Western Europe and could only do so with the combined efforts of his voters, Mr. Walesa's voters and those who abstained. **********Mr. Walesa's failure appeared to be largely the result of his frittering away the moral authority he earned as the imprisoned leader of the Solidarity movement. Those efforts won him the Nobel Prize for Peace and the recognition of world leaders. **********He tried to regain that authority by running a rough and demagogic anti-Communist campaign intended to raise fears about the return of the old system. He accused Mr. Kwasniewski of being part of a web of \"lies\" and \"thugs.\" His television commercials showed bleak black-and-white footage of food lines in the 1980's. **********While those tactics may have gained him some votes, they also alienated his own supporters, some of whom stayed home. A philosophy professor at the Polish Academy of Sciences, Pawel Dybel, a Solidarity supporter from the 1980's, said he was so disgusted by Mr. Walesa's performance during the presidential debates that he did not vote. \"If Walesa wins that's fine, but I don't want to feel responsible,\" he said. **********The breakdown of the vote reflected the uneven effects of Poland's fast-expanding market economy, which is expected to grow by more than six percent this year. The large urban centers, with low unemployment and streets lined with smart stores, largely voted for Mr. Walesa. Peasants and workers in small towns who have felt left out of the economic gains voted for Mr. Kwasniewski. **********The Roman Catholic Church, which lent catechism rooms and church basements to the Solidarity movement during the period of martial law under Communism, had swung behind Mr. Walesa in recent days. But it was done in a calibrated manner,  on radio stations and in pastoral letters, to avoid antagonizing voters who have expressed resentment of the church's intrusion in politics. **********In sermons this morning, several priests, like the Rev. Henryk Jankowski in Gdansk, who gave an anti-Semitic sermon in the President's presence this year, called Mr. Walesa the only candidate who could be the guardian of \"religious and national identity.\" Jozef Cardinal Glemp said after casting his vote that the choice was between two values: \"Christian\" and \"neo-pagan.\" **********In the end, Mr. Walesa had to overcome his erratic five-year tenure as President. He had been applauded by many for keeping checks and balances in the  new democratic system. But critics charged that he gradually became more obstreperous and inclined to petty interference in political issues. **********That behavior, combined with his lack of education, upset supporters who questioned his stature as head of state. On Nov. 12, in the first of two presidential television debates, he shocked even his most faithful backers. He chided a journalist who asked him about his opposition to abortion with the response: \"If abortion had been legal, you would probably have gone down the drain.\" **********As his sense of power and grandeur increased, Mr. Walesa's popularity dwindled. At times, he seemed to act more like a Communist Party first secretary, oblivious to legal restraint. Last year, a public opinion survey showed higher esteem for Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the Communist leader who imposed martial law, than for Mr. Walesa. **********Mr. Walesa repeatedly tried to strengthen his grip over the army, the police  and public television. He kept his roots in the shipyard city of Gdansk, returning there on weekends. **********But he moved out of the relatively simple presidential mansion, the Belvedere in Warsaw, in favor of an ornate 17th-century palace filled with antiques and chandeliers. **********And during negotiations on Poland's new constitution, a document yet to be finalized, Mr. Walesa kept insisting on the incorporation of strong presidential powers. His old friend, Adam Michnik, a Solidarity dissident and now editor of the largest-circulation newspaper, Gazeta Wyborcza, accused Mr. Walesa last year of preparing to establish a dictatorship. **********Nevertheless, his old friends from Solidarity insisted that he was preferable to the former Communists he had helped bring down in the 1980's. **********\"Walesa was always supporting economic reform and always supporting Poland joining the European Union and NATO in a very clear way and always making very clear our independence from Russia,\" said Bronislaw Geremek, an intellectual leader of Solidarity. **********Mr. Kwasniewski became a strong challenger not only because of his ability on television and his appearance of modernity. He was also able to diffuse the stark differences between the old Communist system and the new democratic Poland by sending a message about the future. Photographs in campaign leaflets -- of Mr. Kwasniewski in a fashionable tuxedo and his wife, Jolanta, in a Western-style kitchen -- were designed to show them as the model Polish couple. **********He insisted that he held no differences with Mr. Walesa on foreign policy: Poland would join the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance under his leadership too. **********In addition, he was able to marshal the organizational skills of the former Communist Party behind his new party, the Left Democratic Alliance, built on the ruins of the old Communist machine. **********The party's showing was impressive, analysts said. By gaining 35 percent of the votes in the first round of the presidential election two weeks ago, the Alliance expanded what was thought to be its universe of 25 percent of the electorate and more than doubled its vote in the parliamentary elections two years ago. **********But Mr. Kwasniewski had some last-minute political problems to overcome. He failed to report his wife's major shareholdings in an insurance company in a financial disclosure form required from all members of Parliament. **********His lack of candor contributed to an impression that the former Communists benefited more than other members of society in the transformation to a market economy. **********And in another embarrassment, Gdansk University, where Mr. Kwansiewski said he had earned his degree in economics in 1978, announced a few days before the election that he failed to complete all requirements for the degree. **********In a sign of how much Poland has changed in the six years since the fall of Communism, the investment bank Salomon Brothers considered the country of 40 million people with fast economic growth worthy of an election prognosis. **********The bank said in an analysis last week that a victory by Mr. Kwasniewski would not adversely affect the economy and would have the positive result of smoother relations between the presidency and Parliament."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/11/business/huge-photo-archive-bought-by-the-chairman-of-microsoft.html": {"writer_name": "Steve Lohr", "pub_date": "1995-10-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1109, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Huge Photo Archive Bought By the Chairman of Microsoft", "print_headline": "Huge Photo Archive Bought By the Chairman of Microsoft", "body_text": " **********William H. Gates, the software billionaire and champion of 21st-century technology, has purchased the Bettmann Archive, whose millions of historical photographs are a visual chronicle of the 20th century. **********For the last few years, Mr. Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, has been acquiring the electronic rights to thousands of images -- mainly works  of art -- through a small company in Bellevue, Wash., that he owns. But the purchase of Bettmann, announced yesterday, is by far his biggest step toward building a huge library of digitally stored images that can someday be sampled and sold on computer disks or over computer networks, not only to professionals  but to the public as well. **********The Bettmann acquisition is also part of the trend of converting the pictures, artworks and texts of the past into the digital code of computers. The goal is being pursued by museums and libraries throughout the world, though the  process is often slow and costly. **********The ideal of this electronic conversion is to democratize art and scholarship, enabling people who could never travel to the Library of Congress or the Hermitage to sample their intellectual treasures, and to preserve aging pictures and documents for posterity. **********Mr. Gates has shown himself eager to speed the process along with some of his own money. Yet for entrepreneurs like Mr. Gates, democracy also means mass markets, and big money could be made by collecting perhaps only a few pennies from each person who taps a computer mouse in search of cultural enrichment. And given Mr. Gates's immense wealth and shrewd business instincts, questions have been raised about whether there is a danger in having the electronic rights to so many historical images controlled by one man. **********\"The cultural issue raised by the Bettmann purchase is whether we're seeing history sold to the highest bidder or we'll eventually see history made more accessible to the public as a result,\" said Paul Saffo, a director of the Institute for the Future, a nonprofit research group in Menlo Park, Calif. **********The terms of the Bettmann acquisition were not disclosed, though people involved in the deal said it was a \"multimillion-dollar transaction.\" Both Mr. Gates's company, the Corbis Corporation, and the owner of Bettmann, the Kraus Organization in New York, are private companies. As such, they are not required  to make financial information public. **********For Mr. Gates, one of the nation's richest men, the money involved is small at present but likely to grow. His drive to build a digital storehouse of images is a long-term bet -- and one that suggests he believes there will be considerable demand for this so-called electronic content. **********The acquisition, his lieutenants say, is a part of the building process, but  only one step. \"We want to make Corbis the premier place to come for digital content,\" Doug Rowan, the president of Corbis, said. **********Before acquiring Bettmann, Corbis had the electronic rights to 500,000 images including art from the National Gallery of London, the Philadelphia Museum and the Barnes Foundation, and pictures from photographers like Roger Ressmeyer and  Galen Rowell. Corbis has been negotiating with the Hermitage in St. Petersburg,  Russia, Mr. Rowan said, and a licensing deal should be announced soon. **********But the Bettmann Archive, founded by Otto L. Bettmann, who fled Germany in the 1930's, has about 16 million images. Though the archive has many medical and technical drawings -- favorites of Dr. Bettmann -- its largest holding is 11.5 million photographic images, most of which were acquired from the United Press International news service in 1990. Those pictures run the gamut from Marilyn Monroe to Malcolm X, from Depression mothers to the Duchess of Windsor, from Albert Einstein sticking out his tongue to John McEnroe doing the same. **********Today the photo-archive industry -- with worldwide revenue estimated at $500  million a year -- caters mainly to businesses. A newspaper, magazine, textbook publisher or advertising agency in need of a certain photo image can call up Bettmann and receive it quickly for a fee of $50 to thousands of dollars. **********But the long-term appeal of Bettmann as a business is the promise that digital technology will enable its images to be distributed inexpensively to a far wider market. As more people have powerful home computers with access to the Internet and the World Wide Web, a consumer market for digitized images could well emerge. **********Once set up, it would work something like this: a child is working at home on a report on World War II. He or she decides it would be nice to have a picture of Winston Churchill in the report. The child browses through a Bettmann Web site on the Internet, selects a Churchill picture and clicks. On the screen, a box pops up asking whether the user wants to pay, say, 25 cents, for one-time use of the Churchill picture and ask for credit card or bank account information, which only a parent could provide. If Mom or Dad agrees, the Churchill picture goes in the report. **********There are, to be sure, many technical and legal obstacles to overcome before  a consumer market in digital images develops. Software standards on security and payment methods must be established, for example. Trying to enforce copyright claims will be difficult. And more households will have to have inexpensive, speedy access to the Internet. **********So for the next few years, at least, the Bettmann Archive's business of selling to professionals will change little. \"But the future is the use of digital images by millions of consumers instead of tens of thousands of businesses,\" Mr. Rowan of Corbis said. **********News of the Bettmann acquisition surprised people in the photographic archive business.

There are the coal mines, now just holes in the ground, that fueled the Industrial Revolution. There are the shipyards, now largely desolate, that helped Britannia rule the waves. There are the steel mills, now almost silent, that once roared with the nation's economic might. **********But alongside those industrial dinosaurs, a new economy is emerging. Lucky Goldstar, the South Korean electronics company, just opened a gleaming new, $45  million television and microwave-oven factory in the area. After looking at sites all over Europe, Siemens of Germany recently announced that it would build a huge, $1.7 billion semiconductor plant here, and Fujitsu of Japan is doubling  the size of its four-year-old chip plant. Nissan of Japan is expanding its nearby car factory. **********In politics as in geography, Britain has long been on the fringes of Europe. But, as northeast England's experience suggests, it is increasingly seen as ground zero by companies all over the world needing a manufacturing base for the European single market. **********Britain draws more foreign direct investment in new factories, research centers and other business operations -- and the jobs that go with them -- than  any other country in Europe. **********The volume has clearly surged since former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher took office in 1979 and began her free-market revolution. For example, the number of foreign projects more than doubled to 434 in the 1995 fiscal year ended June 30 from 183 in 1980, while the number of jobs those projects created, or kept from moving to other countries, rose to 88,000 from 14,000. **********Japan alone announced 44 projects last year, seven more than in the entire period of 1980 to 1986, according to the Japanese Embassy here. **********The influx has by no means solved all of the Newcastle area's economic problems, or Britain's. And it is hardly unusual for jobs to migrate to regions  where unemployment is high, especially if governments and workers bend over backward to lure and accommodate employers. In an age of ruthless global competition, though, when corporate investment decisions can amount to a highly  visible plebiscite on the economic future of the countries in which the companies do business, the investment flow to Britain has drawn the attention of other European nations. **********For years, much of Europe derided Britain for creating a low-wage, low-security economy -- one far closer to the American model of flexible work forces and intense pressure to drive down costs than to the European tradition of high pay, lavish benefits, strong unions, restrictive work rules, generous social welfare systems and high taxes. **********Now, however, policy makers in other countries are looking more closely at the British experience as they grapple with high unemployment and eroding international competitiveness. France's unemployment rate this year of 11.5 percent, for example, is more than three points above Britain's, but its average manufacturing labor costs are 30 percent higher. Britain's unemployment rate in  August was 8.2 percent. Germany has a slightly lower rate at 8.1 percent, but its wage costs are nearly double Britain's. **********Bernd Pischetsrieder, chairman of the German automaker BMW, said Britain had  gotten a huge head start over the rest of Europe in making the wrenching policy  changes necessary to compete in the global economy. Last year, BMW bought the British car maker Rover. **********\"Great Britain is currently the most attractive country among all European locations for the production of cars,\" Mr. Pischetsrieder said at an industry conference in Cambridge, England, last week. \"This results from the structural reforms initiated by Margaret Thatcher in the early 1980's, the most significant factor of course being the rearrangement of industrial relations between companies and trade unions.\" **********Noting that the United States invested 7.5 times as much in Britain between 1986 and 1993 as in Germany, Mr. Pischetsrieder added: \"The bottom line is that  what you started in Great Britain back in the early 1980's, other European countries still have to do today. They have to initiate a process of structural  renewal on all levels and in all significant areas.\" **********In Britain itself, some of the most economically deprived regions are grudgingly reassessing their longstanding antipathy to the policies pursued by the Conservative Government over the last 16 years, first under Mrs. Thatcher and now under her successor, John Major. Those policies include weakening the power of unions, resisting calls for a minimum wage, refusing to adopt European  Union regulations protecting workers' rights and generally letting free-market forces, rather than government intervention, shape the economy. AROUND Newcastle, those policies were seen by most people as causing considerable pain as the region's old economy died out over the last two decades, pushing unemployment rates to more than 20 percent at their peak at the end of the 1980's and creating considerable social tension and political disaffection. **********Now foreign investment is holding out the promise of an economic rebirth, albeit one shorn of the assurances of lifetime work and relatively high wages that workers once thought they could count on. While Newcastle still has some of the country's worst poverty, and the crime and other social problems that go with it, its unemployment rate has moved steadily down into the mid-teens. **********As a result, even some people suspicious of the Conservative Party's ideology are asking a prickly political question: Is the new economy, and the brighter future it promises, the legacy of Thatcherism? **********Ross Forbes, for one, is having trouble making up his mind about Mrs. Thatcher's legacy. A few years ago, Mr. Forbes was working for the National Union of Mineworkers, battling the Government's plans to close more of the region's pits and put thousands of miners out of work at a time when the other backbones of the regional economy were also breaking. (In 1975, 35 percent of the region's employment was in coal, shipbuilding and steel. Today it is less than 1 percent.) **********Now Mr. Forbes is the communications manager for the North Tyneside Council,  one of the local governments in the area, helping to promote the region's attractiveness to foreign investors. The Conservatives \"did not have to go as far as they did\" in closing unprofitable mines and allowing the region to go through such intense economic pain in the name of allowing the market to do its work, he said. \"The treatment of the northeast region in the 1980's was bloody.\" **********On the other hand, Mr. Forbes said, \"There are rules in the global market that the National Union of Mineworkers could not rewrite.\" **********The region is still a bastion of support for the opposition Labor Party. But  even Labor, which a decade ago was fighting ferociously but unsuccessfully to restore the power of unions and force the government to take a more interventionist approach to the economy, has now embraced a market-driven economic policy and is de-emphasizing its historic links to unions. **********Labor's economic policies, in fact, are increasingly difficult to distinguish from those of the Conservatives. As it has moved to the right, its popularity has risen sharply, and it now is far ahead of the Conservatives in the opinion polls. Around Newcastle, that means a growing acceptance that perhaps the changes of the Thatcher years contributed to putting Britain into something closer to international fighting trim than it was two decades ago. **********\"If the object is to attract investment on a global basis, someone has got the formula right,\" Mr. Forbes said. **********That formula, he said, encompasses many factors, including the cooperation of unions, local and national government agencies and universities, but also undoubtedly the pro-business environment at the heart of Thatcherism. **********\"Five years ago I would have been a cynic about the ability of [foreign] investment to transform an area,\" Mr. Forbes said. Now, he said, he is a believer. **********Thatcherism, of course, was aimed more at reinvigorating domestic industry than at attracting foreign companies. While there is a consensus that British industry is more vibrant and competitive now than 15 years ago, particularly in  industries that were privatized under the Conservatives, Britain is by no means  a world beater economically. **********But while Germany is seeing corporate trend setters like Daimler-Benz and Volkswagen moving production to lower-cost sites, and while France has retained  its traditional indifference to foreign investors, along with its high unemployment rates, Britain is at least reaping the benefits that come with new  employers and the jobs and technologies they bring. **********\"The U.K. has a long tradition of welcoming inward investment, under Labor as well as under Conservative Governments before Mrs. Thatcher, but the increase has certainly been influenced by the Thatcherite changes that took place,\" said  Sir Geoffrey Owen, the head of the Business Policy Program at the London School  of Economics. \"Certainly France and Germany are looking at the U.K. and the economic and political developments here and seeing what can be learned from it.\" **********American companies have a long tradition of investing in Britain, which over  the last several decades has been the site of more United States direct investment than any other country. In 1993, the most recent year for which figures were available, Britain accounted for 17.4 percent of America's direct investment worldwide and 35 percent of its direct investment in Europe. **********But Britain's appeal is now much broader. Over the last decade, Britain has become the primary European location for the three big Japanese car companies, Nissan, Toyota and Honda. In the last year or two it has emerged as the No. 1 European choice for many Asian electronics companies, including Samsung of Korea; Fujitsu, and Lucky Goldstar's LG Electronics. At the same time it is attracting more investment from German and other European manufacturers who want to expand outside of their high-cost home markets; the recent Siemens deal and BMW's acquisition of Rover are the two most prominent examples. **********THE surge of foreign investment is being driven by many factors, not least of which is that Britain, a trading nation throughout its history, has always sought out foreign investment more aggressively than its European neighbors have. **********It does not hurt that English is almost always the first or second language of international companies. At the moment, Britain has a relatively weak currency, making goods exported from here more competitive in other European markets. **********But in the end, most companies are looking for the best available combination of work force skills and flexibility and low costs. Different companies have different needs. In semiconductor manufacturing, labor costs are a small portion of total production costs. But Siemens found Britain attractive because the looser workplace restrictions made it cheaper and easier to run its new plant in the Newcastle area in three shifts around the clock than it could have elsewhere in Europe. **********Lucky Goldstar had run a smaller microwave-oven plant in the Newcastle area for several years before deciding last year to build its much bigger new plant.  But the company reviewed its British operation and its other big European plant, in Germany, where it produced televisions, and decided to move TV manufacturing  to the new British plant. **********\"The cost structure in the U.K. is much more competitive than in mainland European countries,\" said Ray Couch, the new plant's personnel manager. \"The casualty from our plant is the German factory, because we've taken their TV business from them.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/01/business/mutual-funds-funds-watch-where-the-new-issues-are.html": {"writer_name": "Carole Gould", "pub_date": "1995-10-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 624, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MUTUAL FUNDS: FUNDS WATCH;Where the New Issues Are", "print_headline": "MUTUAL FUNDS: FUNDS WATCH;Where the New Issues Are", "body_text": " **********THE continuing bull market is enticing large numbers of fledgling companies to go public.

Its analysts cross-checked the latest portfolios of diversified equity and specialty funds with its own stock data base to identify holdings that had come  to market in the previous 12 months. Because funds must provide a list of holdings only twice a year, their most recent portfolios may not reflect stocks  that were bought and flipped after a short period. Furthermore, Morningstar could not identify every holding. **********Still, the new stocks that turned up were clustered in the aggressive growth and small company fund categories, particularly in momentum funds, like Twentieth Century Giftrust and PBHG Emerging Growth, which focus on stocks whose prices are gaining rapidly. Real estate funds also held quite a few new issues,  probably because growing demand oustrips the supply of seasoned stocks in that category, the analysts surmised. **********New issues have an obvious allure. Bloomberg's I.P.O. index shot up 53 percent through the end of August, nearly double the gain of the Standard & Poor's 500 index.

In those areas, investors remain on their own. **********New N.A.S.D. members will have to have their electronic advertising approved  in advance; after a year, they simply have to file the ads with the agency within 10 days. **********Because of persistent questions about the use of telemarketing scripts, the agency is amending its definition of sales literature to include these scripts.  They are really no more than a form letter delivered orally, said Thomas A. Pappas, assistant director of the advertising regulation department. **********Finally, to stem the flow of poorly conceived ads that are submitted for its  approval, the association is requiring investment firms to have the appropriate  people, other than the ad's creators, scrutinize all ads first. **********New Funds **********Charles Schwab & Company has added a trio of asset-allocation funds with varying mixes of stocks and bonds under the name Schwab Asset Director.

Those percentages may change within target ranges based on market conditions. **********All three funds are sold without a sales charge.

With so many funds expected to post big gains this year, the tax could be  considerable. **********Albert Dickman, an investor in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., recently encountered just such a problem. He bought shares in the Brandywine fund in late September,  and the fund made a distribution to shareholders in October. To Mr. Dickman's chagrin, he immediately became liable for taxes on $5,600 of capital gains even  though the value of his investment barely changed. \"I'm a supposedly knowledgeable businessman,\" he said, of the common investment trap. \"I think a company of that size and stature should alert investors.\" **********Foster S.

In advertisements, Kaufmann notes that its capital gains distribution was made on Nov. 7, meaning anyone who buys after that time does not have to worry about a nasty tax surprise early next year. **********And of course, anyone buying in a tax-deferred retirement account does not have to worry about short-term tax consequences. For other investors, it may be  time to start counting up those distribution dollars and the tax impact. **********Among stock funds that made distributions in October and November, the fund with the biggest capital gain distribution as a percent of its net asset value was Federated Growth Strategies A. It distributed $5.39 in long-term gains for each share, valued at $21.77, on Nov. 9. The distribution amounted to nearly 25  percent of the share's net asset value. **********The best hope for Federated shareholders is that Congress and the White House agree on tax relief for capital gains. Under the proposal hammered out by a House-Senate conference, half of all long-term capital gains could be excluded from tax, lowering the top rate to an effective rate of 19.8 percent from 28 percent. **********For an investor with 1,000 shares of Federated Growth Strategies, the distribution amounts to $5,390, and the tax liability would be $1,509 at the top rate.

Under Securities and Exchange Commission rules, proxies must be circulated for at least 20 business days beforehand, analysts said. There would be a $50 million penalty if either party  broke the agreement before the deadline. **********Last week, Wellpoint and Blue Cross of California told regulators at the state's Department of Corporations that they wanted to extend the deadline to Jan. 15.

Mr. Cygul declined to discuss other details of the agreement. **********A collapse of the deal would upset plans for Wellpoint to hand over $1 billion in cash and new company stock valued at $2 billion to two health care foundations that were established to repay California taxpayers for decades of concessions to the nonprofit Blue Cross plan. **********A third organization, the California Wellness Foundation, was established when Health Net, a big, nonprofit health maintenance organization, was converted to a for-profit company before it was merged into Health Systems.

The hunt for General  Aidid began after his forces killed 25 Pakistani peacekeepers. **********\"It is difficult to understand the decision to omit the AC-130 gunships from  the Joint Task Force Ranger force package,\" the report concluded. \"The AC-130's  were part of all the force-package options and were included in all of the training exercises. This decision is inconsistent with the principle that you fight as you train.\" **********Tensions in Mogadishu increased sharply in the summer of 1993 after General Aidid's men ambushed the Pakistani peacekeepers, and the United Nations put a $25,000 bounty on General Aidid's head and began a manhunt. Commanders in Somalia, included Maj. Gen. Thomas Montgomery of the United States Army, requested commandos, AC-130's and, ultimately, tanks and more armored vehicles. **********General Powell initially opposed trying to capture General Aidid but he relented after the death of several American soldiers and repeated requests from American field commanders. In a phone call to Mr. Aspin in August 1993 while the Defense Secretary was vacationing in Wisconsin, General Powell recommended sending the commandos but not the AC-130's."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/10/business/mutual-funds-funds-watch.html": {"writer_name": "Carol Gould", "pub_date": "1995-12-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 982, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MUTUAL FUNDS;FUNDS WATCH", "print_headline": "MUTUAL FUNDS;FUNDS WATCH", "body_text": " **********Gauging the Cost Of 401(k) Plans **********The amount paid for 401(k) plans can vary widely, according to the Butler Index, begun recently by the Pension Dynamics Corporation of Lafayette, Calif. **********The index shows what 12 mutual fund and other companies would charge for a plan with $1 million in assets and 50 employees -- in other words, a small plan. The annualized costs are divided into the amount paid by the employer and that paid cumulatively by the 50 employees. Though they may not realize it, employees who check on their plans will generally find that a portion is deducted from the accounts of individual participants. **********For a plan of this size, the lowest-cost providers were Principal Financial,  T. Rowe Price Century Plan and Vanguard, according to the index. **********Along with costs, a critical factor is investment performance. \"A vendor may  say that, although its costs and fees are above average, you are being awarded with superior investment performance,\" said Stephen J. Butler, president of Pension Dynamics. \"Don't take this claim on faith. Check the performance of your prospective vendors' investments in a respected source, such as Morningstar.\" **********Best of the Bonds? Corporates and Munis **********Buying shares in a Government bond fund is easier than buying small quantities of Government bonds. But most Government funds lag behind their benchmarks. They're expensive, and there are better alternatives, John Rekenthaler, editor of the Morningstar Investor, wrote in the most recent issue. **********About 85 percent of Government Treasury and mortgage bond funds trail the Lehman Brothers Government index, and they don't compensate by showing lower risk. The reason is that the market is very efficient, and fund managers are handicapped by expenses, which average 1.05 percent of assets a year. **********Best bets for investors are the low-cost Vanguard funds, Mr. Rekenthaler concludes. Other options are Strong Government Securities, which stretches the definition of Government to include unusual mortgages and some corporate bonds,  and Sit U.S. Government Securities, which owns mobile-home mortgages. **********Otherwise, investors in low tax brackets should now go with corporates, Mr. Rekenthaler argues. They are less costly and their market is less efficient. FPA New Income has beaten the Government indexes for a decade with less risk, he said. Other funds he recommends: Loomis Sayles Bond, Dodge & Cox Income and Harbor Bond. **********For people taxed at 28 percent or more, municipal bond funds, especially single-state funds, are the way to go. Exempt from Federal and state tax for in-state residents, the single-state funds yield more without sacrificing long-term performance. Best bets are run by Vanguard, Fidelity Investments, T. Rowe Price and Scudder, Stevens & Clark, Mr. Rekenthaler says. **********Because long-term munis carry a lot of interest-rate risk, cautious investors might consider intermediate-term muni funds even though yields are lower. **********A Rift Over Money Funds **********A proposal by the Securities and Exchange Commission to force money market funds to report their holdings quarterly is running into opposition from the industry. **********The Investment Company Institute, the mutual-fund trade group, says the proposal is neither \"necessary nor appropriate\" and would result in unnecessary  costs. **********Not so, says Glen King Parker, publisher of the Income Fund Outlook, an investment newsletter in Deerfield Beach, Fla. Many institutional money funds already publish portfolios monthly and make them available to shareholders, he said, and those that sell to the general public should provide more disclosure. **********In fact, he would prefer reporting monthly instead of quarterly. \"Money funds have become quasi-banks,\" he said, \"and I don't think that there's anything wrong with an increased level of scrutiny.\" **********A Portfolio Thinks Small **********James Oberweis, manager of the $135 million Oberweis Emerging Growth fund, is starting the Micro-Cap Portfolio, which will invest in very, very small stocks.  The average market capitalization of the stocks in the Emerging Growth portfolio is $400 million to $500 million; in the new fund it will be less than $100 million. **********The new fund is being structured to let investors get in at the starting gate. Money will be collected from mid-December, but it won't be invested until  the fund begins operating on Jan. 2. **********To stay true to his small-cap mission, Mr. Oberweis plans to close the fund when it reaches $50 million in assets. Even existing shareholders won't be allowed to add new money, though they can reinvest their earnings. **********More New Funds **********Robertson, Stephens & Company, San Francisco, is adding three funds. Its Information Age fund, managed by Ron Elijah, who already runs the company's Value and Growth fund, will concentrate on small-capitalization technology companies with unusual offerings in multimedia, wireless communications, networking, software and the like. Global Natural Resources will be managed by Andy J. Pilara Jr., who also manages the Partners and Contrarian funds. Global Low Priced Stock will buy overlooked companies with share prices of $10 or less. **********Bank of America has started three Time Horizon funds with stated maturity dates in the life-style category. The funds aim to maximize total return and then emphasize capital preservation as the fund approaches its maturity date. Time Horizon Portfolio 1 is for investors with a financial goal near the year 2005, Portfolio 2 for 2015 and Portfolio 3 for 2025. **********Fidelity Investments has added to its international lineup with six aggressive growth funds that invest in single countries and regions abroad. All  the funds carry a 3 percent sales charge and a 1.5 percent redemption fee on shares held less than 90 days. They are Fidelity France, Germany, Hong Kong and  China, Japan Small Companies, Nordic and United Kingdom. **********New Management **********Ernst H. Von Metzsch, who picked up the Vanguard Wellington fund after the death of Vincent Bajakian in September, has been named the permanent manager. **********Catherine Dudley left Phoenix Growth to join Chancellor Investments. She is replaced at the fund by William J. Newman, the company's chief investment strategist. **********In Brief **********Fidelity Investments plans to make all its prospectuses available soon on the Internet.

Beyond some valuable detail we could not have gotten elsewhere, did it tell us much about which way Hashimoto would go? It would be hard to make that case.\" **********Spying on allies for economic advantage is a crucial new assignment for the C.I.A. now that American foreign policy is focused on commercial interests abroad. President Clinton made economic intelligence a high priority of his Administration, specifically information to protect and defend American competitiveness, technology and financial security in a world where an economic  crisis can spread across global markets in minutes. **********But the transition is a rough one for an agency far less comfortable with capital flows than with Communist foes. **********At the Treasury Department, the trade representative's office and the Commerce Department, officials say they now receive a torrent of information from the C.I.A. But in the next breath, they say the quantity is not matched by  the quality. **********The agency, they complain, often cannot separate the vital from the trivial,  and its analysis of economic data is still amateurish. Recently some in the Administration have begun to wonder aloud whether much of the analysis should be farmed out to better-trained experts in Government and the private sector. **********The C.I.A. tends \"too often to reproduce mainstream, middle-of-the-road views,\" Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers told Congress last month.  He questioned whether it \"can add much value\" to the financial information and analysis the private sector produces from a wealth of public information. **********With an increasing fraction of the $28 billion intelligence budget going to economic matters, the answer to that question may be crucial to the C.I.A.'s future. **********At the agency, economics is still more a buzzword than a mission. The new director, John M. Deutch, talks about it often. But in a recent interview, one of the highest-ranking officials of the C.I.A. confessed complete ignorance of the subject. Some inside the agency ridicule the idea that car exports and exchange rates -- which they call \"soft stuff\" -- are remotely as important as the spread of nuclear weapons and terrorism -- \"hard stuff.\" **********Moreover, a generation of American spies trained to steal secrets from Communist enemies is having trouble adjusting to the more subtle world of trade  politics. There, economic competitors are also political allies, and a far wider range of players -- industrialists, bankers, and politicians worried about jobs  back home -- want their say. Even many who believe in economic spying are asking if the information gained is worth risking some of America's most important alliances. **********Negotiating New Territory: C.I.A. at GATT **********In 1993, the Administration asked the C.I.A. for dramatic improvement in three areas where it had previously played only a bit role: supporting trade negotiations, tracking legal and illegal tactics other countries use to win business and spotting financial troubles that can become foreign policy crises,  as happened in Mexico last year. **********One of the C.I.A.'s first explorations into the new territory came during the 1993 negotiations over the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It provided accounts of discussions among key countries negotiating the worldwide trade accord, focusing on the thinking of the French President at the time, Francois Mitterrand; the French Prime Minister, Edouard Balladur, and the head of the European Commission, Jacques Delors. **********But in the end, the agency displayed more energy than results, Administration officials say. **********\"We discovered this doesn't come to them naturally, like an arms-control negotiation,\" said one senior official who got C.I.A. reports. \"Give them very specific direction on a limited basis, with a limited time and scope, where they can give you information that they have gathered electronically, and it's pretty helpful. But the minute that you rely on their political or economic assessments -- well, let me be delicate: their capabilities are limited.\" **********Another top American official was more direct: \"The important stuff is garbled. And most of what you get is garbage.\" **********By most accounts, the agency did better in this year's high-stakes negotiations with Japan, where a key question was what the Japanese auto industry was telling -- and was being told -- by the Japanese Government. Partly prompted by intelligence reports, the Americans told the Japanese automakers that negotiators from Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry were  misrepresenting American demands. **********American negotiators also asked for details of internal discussions between the ministry and rival agencies. Thanks to Tokyo's own internecine rivalries, the C.I.A. got a break. **********Most of the secure telephones in the Japanese Government are controlled by the Foreign Ministry. But officials at the trade ministry shunned those phones,  both to keep their own diplomats from listening in and because Mr. Hashimoto's chief rival for the prime ministership at the time was the Foreign Minister. **********In the end, intelligence proved of limited use in predicting how far Mr. Hashimoto would go. Critics of the unspectacular accord, which chipped away at market barriers without removing them, question whether the result justified the effort. But a senior Administration economic official said the political prominence of the car talks sent an important message to the C.I.A.: focus more  energy on economic security. **********\"We can't go into this kind of thing disarmed,\" one top official said. Mr. Deutch knows that, the official said: \"The question is whether he will have the  time to change the culture of the agency.\" **********Analysis On the Big Picture, A Fuzzy Vision **********Government officials who rely on the C.I.A. for economic intelligence say it has failed at the second major task: warning Government officials about imminent changes in other nations' fiscal policies or looming financial debacles. **********\"The agency is accustomed to a world where it has a monopoly on information,\" said one senior official who receives daily C.I.A. reports. \"If you are interested in Iraq's nuclear weapons program, you don't have many other choices  for your information. But if you want to know what the Bundesbank is going to do next, or whether Brazil is thinking of devaluing its currency, there is a lot of competition. And it is hard for the agency to add value.\" **********Many Administration officials suggest that the agency simply does not have the talent for such analysis. \"The best graduate students don't go there, and who can blame them?\" said one of the Administration's top economic officials. \"And yet, when you sit in a meeting, the views of the C.I.A. are often given more weight than the Council of Economic Advisors. Go figure.\" **********Tracking global capital flows or predicting currency crises is beyond the agency's ability, said Allan E. Goodman, a former C.I.A. official and academic dean of Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service. **********\"We don't have the sources, we don't have the expertise,\" he said. \"To develop an understanding of the people who trade currencies, their motivations,  their lifestyles, you'd have to send your people to Harvard, Stanford and Wharton for years. Currency traders keep secrets very, very well, and to penetrate that would be the equivalent of cracking all the Japanese codes in World War II.\" **********Enforcement Blowing a Whistle On Foreign Bribes **********When Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown went to Congress on Thursday with his annual report about how the United States is meeting foreign competition abroad, he brought with him a secret annex. **********It focused on tactics used by France, England, Germany, Japan and Canada to win deals, mostly in Asia. Most of the tactics were legal; many are practiced by Washington, including having the President press foreign countries to award business to American firms. **********But the unclassified version of the report also cited \"almost 100 cases of foreign firms using bribery to undercut U.S. firms' efforts to win international contracts worth about $45 billion,\" adding, \"The foreign firms that offer bribes typically win about 80 percent of the deals.\" **********The C.I.A. asserts that in several cases it has caught foreign companies bribing their way into billion-dollar contracts abroad. When that happens, the agency tells the State Department, which protests on behalf of American corporations and, on occasion, wins. \"This is probably an area where our intelligence can be used most effectively,\" a senior official said. \"It's where  the agency is getting better.\" **********Espionage Risks and Rewards Of Spying on Allies **********When corporate America talks to the C.I.A. about economic espionage, it often pleads for its competitors' secrets -- but in vain. **********\"If we're willing to do dirty tricks for the defense part of national security, then why aren't we able to do dirty tricks for the economic part?\" asks Robert Kohler, a retired C.I.A. official and general manager of TRW Avionics & Surveillance Group. **********The agency says it will not ask its officers to risk their lives for companies instead of their country. It will, however, continue to spy on American allies to understand national strategies. That entails its own risks. **********The issue has been a constant source of tension in the American Embassy in Tokyo. During the last years of the cold war, American officials told the Japanese that the station was chiefly devoted to keeping track of China, North Korea and Russia's eastern ports. But Japanese officials are increasingly unhappy as it becomes clear that they are a primary target. **********Tensions are also growing in Europe. France has spied on American companies for years, planting moles in companies like Boeing and Texas Instruments and breaking into hotel rooms to rifle through attache cases. In late 1993, the C.I.A. stepped up a counterattack. **********\"No more Mr. Nice Guy,\" a former C.I.A. chief, R. James Woolsey, has warned publicly. The C.I.A.'s Paris station got in the game -- with disastrous results. **********A young aide to the French Prime Minister, Mr. Balladur, found himself being  courted by an American woman who introduced herself as public relations director for a save-the-rain-forest foundation. French counterintelligence officers warned the aide, Henri Plagnol, that the woman was a C.I.A. operative -- and told him to play along. **********A two-year-long sting developed. A male C.I.A. officer quizzed Mr. Plagnol about key French positions on the GATT talks, especially on agricultural issues  and limits on the importation of American movies for French television. He handed the Frenchman 500-franc notes -- about $100 each -- for his information. **********Other C.I.A. officers fell under French surveillance. Two sought GATT information from a communications ministry officer. Another tried to bribe an engineer with the state-run France Telecom for information that would help the C.I.A. bug French telecommunications. **********In February, the affair blew up when the French publicly demanded the expulsion of the C.I.A. station chief, his deputy and two other C.I.A. officers. The agency's longstanding liaison with French intelligence -- crucial for joint  operations such as tracking terrorists -- has been suspended. The C.I.A. inspector general is assessing whether the operation was worth it."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/26/business/international-briefs-smithkline-profit-up-9.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-10-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 50, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;SmithKline Profit Up 9%", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;SmithKline Profit Up 9%", "body_text": " **********SmithKline Beecham P.L.C., Britain's second-largest drug maker, said third-quarter pretax profit rose 9 percent to L310 million, or $499 million, fueled by new-product growth.

The Clinton Administration had said that no American troops would be deployed unless the Bosnian Serbs accepted the accord, which has been signed by the two other parties in the Bosnian conflict, the Muslim-led Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Croats. **********The Bosnian Serb leaders initialed the very accords that they they had refused to sign on Tuesday, said Lawrence Butler, the ranking American diplomat  in Belgrade. Mr. Butler said he faxed the signed documents to Washington late tonight. **********In announcing the reversal, the official Belgrade television said the Bosnian Serbs had \"fully accepted\" the accord, even though they found provisions \"painful.\" **********Nikola Koljevic, a vice president of the self-declared Bosnian Serb republic, confirmed that the Bosnian Serbs had agreed to the accords. He said, however, that they were hoping for \"some improvements\" in the agreement. \"I can not be more specific,\" he said in a brief telephone interview tonight. **********The Bosnian Serb capitulation came after a meeting here today of their top leaders with President Milosevic, who may have lost his dream of a Greater Serbia but has taken another step in his drive to be seen in the West not as the man who started the war but as the moderate leader who brought it to an end. **********A Western diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity said he had thought it  would take longer for President Milosevic to bring the Bosnian Serbs around. \"It was a complete humiliation of the Bosnian Serb leadership,\" he said. \"I didn't expect it to happen so soon.\" **********In Washington, Administration officials greeted the Bosnian Serb announcement with relief, but cautioned that they still needed to review what the Serbs had agreed to. **********\"Milosevic assured us before leaving Dayton that he'd get the Bosnian Serbs on board, but that he'd need a couple of days to calm these guys down,\" said a State Department official. \"It sounds like he's been able to pull this off.\" **********Defense Department officials, in particular, had expressed concern that winning Congressional approval for the accord would be even more difficult without the Bosnian Serbs' consent. **********The acceptance suggests that moderates within the Bosnian Serb leadership, who are supported by Mr. Milosevic, have prevailed over the hard-liners, led by  Mr. Milosevic's political rival, Radovan Karadzic, political leader of the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb republic. **********The Bosnian Serbs' capitulation would appear to spell the political end for Dr. Karadzic and for Gen. Ratko Mladic, commander of the Bosnian Serb army. The  agreement says that individuals who have been indicted by the international war  crimes tribunal in The Hague may not hold political office. Both Dr. Karadzic, a former psychiatrist, and General Mladic have been indicted on several counts. **********The hard-liners had been angry with Mr. Milosevic, who was negotiating in Dayton on behalf of the Bosnian Serbs, for having agreed that Sarajevo would be  a unified city, which would require the return of Serb-controlled suburbs to the Bosnian Government. They also felt that he had given away too much other territory that the Bosnian Serbs had gained on the battlefield. **********Dr. Karadzic was present at the meeting with Mr. Milosevic, Belgrade state television reported. General Mladic, who has been reported to be suffering from  kidney stones, was represented by his deputy. Also attending, the state television said, were Mr. Koljevic, the vice president; Biljana Plavsic, another vice president of the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb republic, and Momcilo Krajisnik, speaker of its parliament. **********That Mr. Milosevic won over Ms. Plavsic and Mr. Krajisnik was considered of particular importance. While Mr. Koljevic is viewed as a moderate in the Bosnian Serb context, the others were considered hard-liners. **********Mr. Krajisnik, who was present in Dayton, had denounced the agreement; two years ago, Ms. Plavsic had rejected the peace proposal put together by the former American Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen of Britain, saying  that six million Serbian casualties was not too high a price for the Bosnian Serbs to pay for their goals. Mr. Milosevic retorted that she should probably be committed to a mental hospital. **********Reached by telephone at their headquarters in Pale, Bosnia, outside Sarajevo, the Bosnian Serbs said they would have no official comment on today's events. **********Details of the meeting between Mr. Milosevic and the Bosnian Serb leaders, including which person actually initialed the document, were not made public, but Western diplomats and Belgrade political analysts say they are certain Mr. Milosevic used some of the same strong-arm tactics on the Bosnian Serbs that the American negotiators had used in Dayton. **********\"You can just about bet that they had their arms twisted far up their backs,\" said a Western diplomat. \"They succumbed to his blandishments, and believe me, they can be pretty unattractive.\" **********Mr. Milosevic's position was as strong as that of the Bosnian Serb leaders was weak. **********To begin with, the United Nations Security Council had lifted economic and military sanctions, but if the Bosnian Serbs' intransigence upset the Dayton agreement, the sanctions might have been imposed again.  \"You can bet that Mr. Milosevic was telling them that they would have the wrath of all the Serbs on them,\" a Western diplomat said. **********In Belgrade today, an extended broadcast was devoted almost exclusively to the lifting of sanctions, with interviews of people on the street who welcomed the day and praised their leader. \"This is the happiest day of my life,\" said one woman. **********Then there is the Bosnian Serb army, which has been dependent on support from Belgrade. It has been badly routed in recent weeks by the Bosnian and Croatian armies, and was thus in no position to argue that it should fight on. **********While rogue elements of the Bosnian Serb military could still engage in guerrilla warfare, the army cannot be expected to achieve any significant military gains if Mr. Milosevic this time lives up to his promise not to support it. It is a promise he has made before, and then broken. **********As for Dr. Karadzic, \"it is too early to know what he will do,\" said a Western diplomat. \"He might try to hang on, but it will be very difficult, if not impossible, without the loyalty of the army, which he does not command.\" **********And the last 48 hours have accentuated a power struggle within the Bosnian Serb leadership, which had been remarkably united until recently. The hard-liners, principally Dr. Karadzic and General Mladic, have their base in Pale, but little remains there beyond their bodyguards and local residents who once catered to skiers in the winter resort village. The moderate leadership, led by Mr. Koljevic, operates out of Banja Luka."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/16/business/no-new-hits-but-many-old-favorites.html": {"writer_name": "Jennifer Steinhauer", "pub_date": "1995-12-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 701, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "No New Hits but Many Old Favorites", "print_headline": "No New Hits but Many Old Favorites", "body_text": " **********High tech is old hat. This Christmas, Americans seem to yearn for tradition. **********Sure, computers will still show up under the tree, experts say, but the hottest products mostly involve cuddling up, soft candlelight and sitting around the table playing board games. Cashmere and Gucci are popular again with the affluent set. And then there is the perfume inspired by Kermit the Frog. **********This year's shoppers are spreading their money around. \"There doesn't seem to be one particular product that is lighting up the Christmas tree this year,\"  said Mark J. Schoifet, a spokesman for the International Council of Shopping Centers, which monitors 80 big malls. **********Nostalgia and comfort are the big draws this year. Christmas Barbie is on back order, Mickey Mouse sweatshirts are back in business and jewelry for every  taste and budget is on a lot of lists. **********Apparel in general may be selling slowly, but Polar Tec pullovers and fleecy  sweatshirts are rushing out the door at stores like Old Navy and Sears. **********Stores that sell bath goods and candles that smell like food are doing well,  according to Mr. Schoifet. Kiehl's Since 1851, which offers simply packaged personal-care products in department stores and its own retail outlets, said it  had sold thousands of coriander and grapefruit bath gels. **********No toy stands out, but board games are making a comeback, from old favorites  like Monopoly to new ones like Sue You!, which mocks the legal profession.  The  season is also seeing a revival of traditional toys like Etch-a-Sketch and Mr. Potato Head featured in the hit Walt Disney movie \"Toy Story.\" **********All in all, it looks as if a lot of people plan to create a cabin-like intimacy this winter as they hunker down and ignore all those \"I'll get to it as soon as I can\" tool sets that are also selling well. **********In computers, the retailers who were counting on a blockbuster season have been disappointed so far. Mark Marcon, an analyst at Cleary Gull Reiland & McDevitt in Milwaukee, estimated that computer sales would rise 10 percent this  season. That is well below the rise of 15 percent or more that many experts were projecting in October and a long way from the 30 percent gains of the last two holiday periods. **********\"The sales will still be up,\" Mr. Marcon said. \"But not as everyone predicted. On top of that, you are seeing an extremely promotional environment.\" Big-screen television sets and multimedia computers are still moving, but profit margins are being squeezed on those and nearly every other high-technology product. **********While early November was solid, as colder weather created demand for winter clothes, the traditional holiday season got off to a relatively slow start after Thanksgiving, and the pace has slackened since. Sales in specialty stores in big malls fell 1.6 percent for the week that ended on Dec. 10, compared with the corresponding week last year, the shopping center council says. **********The use of credit cards continues to climb but at a slower pace than last year. And, Telecheck said this week that its tally of approvals showed a 7.2 percent decline in spending by check during the first 17 days of the shopping season. **********The popularity of some products this year defies explanation. At Bloomingdale's, one of the hottest items in cosmetics is Amphibia, a perfume based on Sesame Street's Kermit the Frog. **********With the stock market at record highs, luxury items are moving well. \"Any store with vowels at the end of their names are doing well,\" said Alan G. Millstein, editor of the Fashion Network Report. \"That would include Armani, Prada and Gucci. This is the year of the resurgence of luxury retail.\" **********Even the upscale merchants are cashing in on things for the home. Executives  at the Sharper Image, for instance, were surprised to see their $200 self-cleaning cat litter box selling well above expectations. Their catalogue department has received more than 1,000 orders, some of them on back order. The  full-size replica of a U.F.O. alien in a chamber, for $1,695, was moving more slowly. Still, Sydney Klevatt, senior vice president of marketing, had to confess that he was surprised. \"Would you believe?\" he said. \"We've sold six of  them.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/19/world/help-eases-burden-of-woman-with-ill-children.html": {"writer_name": "Sarah Jay", "pub_date": "1995-12-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 530, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Help Eases Burden of Woman With Ill Children", "print_headline": "Help Eases Burden of Woman With Ill Children", "body_text": " **********On some nights, Leonora A. feels like little more than a pendulum with a purpose, swinging back and forth from one sick child to the other. **********Janigris, 4, severely asthmatic and gasping for air, needs her oxygen mask.

She suffers  from chronic migraines, sinus pains, recurring cysts, high blood pressure and severe backaches. In the last seven years, she has undergone seven operations and survived a stroke. **********In this profusion of family illness, the Children's Aid Society has given the family support. After Janigris was born three months premature, the society found a foster family for Selena, giving Ms. A. some time to focus on Janigris's special needs. Selena returned home in October, and the society has provided a homemaker to assist Ms. A. during the day. **********The society is one of seven charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, now in its 84th year.

The drive runs through Feb. 28. **********The home attendant relieves some of the pressure on Ms. A., who otherwise is  very much alone in caring for her children. Her own mother has diabetes and is too weak to offer assistance. And Ms. A., who moved to New York from the Dominican Republic, struggles with a language barrier.

My boyfriend and I are moving into our first apartment in New York City. He earns about 25 percent more than I do -- and on top of that gets money from a family trust fund. Do you think it's fair that we split rent and expenses equally? **********A. Fair? \"All's fair in love and war,\" wrote Francis Edward Smedley back in 1850. But seeing as Smedley wasn't setting up housekeeping in a pricey Manhattan rental, we'll disregard that advice. After all, a quest for fairness can easily  put a couple on the warpath. **********Everyday money matters require a certain finesse by cohabitants -- a significant group these days. More than three million households are composed of unmarried couples -- roommates, people trying out a relationship, those planning marriage, heterosexual and homosexual couples and committed partners not planning marriage. **********To be sure, many of these couples, especially the young ones, just make ends  meet in cities with high costs of living. \"We call ourselves the new poor,\" says the female partner in a New York twosome with combined annual income of $135,000, which certainly amounts to middle-class comfort in most places. **********Still, a pinched pocketbook may be less disruptive than pinched expressions.  \"Most financial fights in a relationship are not about a shortage of money but disorganization, lack of communication, fuzzy goals and a confusion over investment choices,\" says Adriane G. Berg in \"Financial Planning for Couples\" (Newmarket Press, 1993, $10.95).  Once people have a blueprint of what works best for them, together and as individuals, cohabitation becomes a lot less fractious. **********So, the safest course is to determine your expectations for the budding relationship before deciding whether to split expenses evenly or proportionately, based on resources. The formula, of course, will most likely change along with the relationship. **********For lack of any hard and fast rules, roommates and couples who are test driving their relationship often split expenses like rent and food. To avoid squabbles over \"my cereal\" and \"your paper towels,\" many contribute equally to a joint household account. **********When Debbie Kohnstamm and Leon Baranovsky started living together, they split expenses by keeping a list on the fridge with columns marked \"his\" and \"hers.\" When one paid the electric bill or bought groceries, the cost was marked in the  appropriate column. Every few months they added up the columns and balanced them out. **********\"This way we weren't constantly exchanging money and didn't need a joint checking account,\" she said. It was the same system she had used with her college roommate. \"We even bought two kittens.\" **********Their system was based on equality. After a few years, they decided to get married and pooled their resources. As they found, the financial arrangement usually changes when you become a \"committed couple,\" whether marriage is in the air or not. **********\"Equality and fairness are not the same thing,\" Ms. Berg says. \"Feelings of fairness most often prevail when couples split expenses proportionately. If one  partner is making 25 percent more, then he or she should be spending 25 percent  more on necessities.\" **********For 18 months before being married, Kathy and Kevin McKinney lived together in San Francisco and split their expenses according to their salaries. \"We sat down and figured out our total income -- he earned 70 percent, and I made only 30 percent, so we added up the rent, bills, and groceries and paid accordingly,\" Ms. McKinney said. \"We kept separate saving accounts for personal spending, and  we never argued about money. In fact, we still use a similar system now that we're married.\" **********Trust funds, however, do not really belong in the pot. \"If one partner has a  special asset, which may have been inherited, shares of stock, a precious antique or a piece of real estate,\" Ms. Berg notes, \"the other partner should respect the privacy of that.\" **********It is not unheard of, though, for someone with additional income, to suggest  a better apartment or a more expensive vacation and to offer to pay the difference. **********Not surprisingly, feelings of unfairness among committed partners arise most  often about discretionary spending. You know, the type of disagreement in which  one person wants to buy a big-screen TV and the other longs for a 14-day Caribbean cruise. That's more the stuff of soap operas than real life, the experts say. Far more common is that one person wants to spend and the other prefers to save. Ms. Berg suggests that couples treat saving and investing as they would a car purchase -- something to plan for so both partners get what they want. **********When it is time to spend, a dash of indulgence may not be all bad. A survey by Savvy magazine showed that couples are rarely happy if they feel they are always compromising to accommodate the other. It works better to take turns getting what you want -- as long as the items are affordable. **********Suppose \"he\" wants a new stereo and \"she\" wants an expensive sofa. Rather than upgrading the old stereo by buying new speakers and settling for a cheaper  sofa, they should instead forgo some other item they both want or delay the stereo or sofa purchase a few months. **********One way to help make record keeping fair and easy is to keep separate bank accounts and open a joint checking account to cover household and other shared purchases and expenses. Many landlords prefer not to have two names on a lease and may resist the idea of two checks. **********Though some experts recommend a joint brokerage account and other investments to instill togetherness, don't overlook the tax consequences. As long as you are filing separate tax returns, how will you report capital gains, losses, dividends and interest? **********Keeping separate credit cards makes it easy to pay for personal items, and to preserve your credit identity. Most important for harmony's sake, put a car, house and big-ticket items bought with joint money in both names. For smaller items, like a TV, save receipts and note who paid how much. In case of a split, a settlement comes quicker with the original cost in hand. **********After a relationship fizzled in my early 20's, I owned the left side of a Jennifer Convertible sofa bed and the cups and plates, but not the saucers and cereal bowls, of a Pottery Barn dinnerware set. We couldn't agree on who had paid for what and how much each item had cost. **********Occasionally, committed couples revert to roommate status. Take two friends of mine who have a great deal on a West Side apartment in Manhattan. After a tumultuous five-year relationship, they broke up, but neither will give up the inexpensive living quarters. From Neil Sedaka's popular song \"Love Will Keep Us  Together\" has sprung a new urban refrain, \"The Lease Will Keep Us Together.\" **********Questions about investing, careers and personal finance can be sent to Minding Your Business, Money and Business, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York 10036.

Toll razed those structures and revised the design and floor plans of the houses, which are to be built over the next three years. **********Toll Brothers, a major builder in the Northeast, acquired Club Pointe for $4.5 million at a sealed-bid auction in June 1994 and closed the deal six months later. The seller was London & Leeds, a Manhattan-based development company. **********The $35 million project is rising in the North Street corridor, in the city's southeastern section, where estates once stood and the last sizable tracts of land available for development exist. It is one of five developments Toll has built or plans to build within one mile of another. Together they total 268 residences in a mix of single-family detached and attached homes. Rob Parahus, vice president of Toll's New York metropolitan division, said 116 residences in  two projects had been completed and most of them had been sold at prices ranging from $369,900 to $664,900. **********All but one of the projects were thwarted by the recession, and their revival underscores an increase in development activity in the city, said Daniel E. Armstrong, assistant planner for White Plains. He said the city was continuing to hold discussions with commercial developers looking to put up supermarkets, movie theaters and a hotel. **********Wayne F. Patterson, senior vice president at Toll, said his company became involved with Club Pointe and the other four projects because \"there is a demand in the White Plains market, which is large, for homes that provide quality and value.\" Another factor, he said, was location: the projects are close to the Hutchinson Parkway and Interstate 287. **********Mr. Parahus added that a concentration of projects in an area, an oft-used strategy of Toll, provided the company an economy of scale and enabled it to broaden its market by offering a diversity of housing. **********The two-story, cedar-sided town houses at Club Pointe, which is bordered on two sides by the private Westchester Hills Golf Club, have 2,555 to 2,775 square feet of space. Each features three bedrooms, a full basement and two-car garages. Base prices during preconstruction sales, begun in late September, range from $419,900 to $459,900. The monthly maintenance at the project, structured as a condominium association, will be $200 and annual taxes will be about $8,000. So far nine homes have been sold. **********Ed and Fran Opengart, both in their late 50's, will be moving from their home in Scarsdale to a residence at Club Pointe. \"We wanted an alternative life style where someone else would do the maintenance,\" Mr. Opengart said. \"We fell in love with the location and though the price is higher than we hoped to pay we feel we are getting a lot of value.\" **********In the third quarter of this year the average price of the 247 existing condominiums sold in Westchester county was $187,549; for the 37 such residences sold in White Plains and neighboring Hartsdale it was $178,500, according to data from the Westchester County Board of Realtors and Prudential RCR Realtors,  based in White Plains. **********Paul F. Stehnach, vice president at Prudential RCR Realtors, said the market  in central Westchester County \"has found its level, meaning if units are realistically priced they will sell.\" He said residences were selling within 95  percent of their listed price. **********Club Pointe is being developed under the city's conservation development ordinance, which was passed in 1981 as a way to preserve open space. It stipulates that on tracts of five acres or more in certain residential areas developers have the option to cluster houses. This results in all the development the zoning permits, but on less land, leaving the rest undeveloped in perpetuity. **********At Club Pointe, 24 of the 35 acres will remain open. The houses are grouped in twos and threes and many back up to the conservation area or the golf course. Those closest to the course carry premiums of $6,000 to $25,000. The land left undeveloped will be owned and maintained by Club Pointe residents. Other common  amenities will include a cabana, outdoor pool and two tennis courts. **********In February Toll expects to open its fourth project, 32 single-family detached homes, with 2,800 to 3,200 square feet. Introductory prices are expected to be $534,900 to $599,900. **********The last of the five Toll projects, which is still going through the approval process, is to have 50 larger, more expensive homes."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/09/world/the-greening-of-us-diplomacy-focus-on-ecology.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Greenhouse", "pub_date": "1995-10-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1148, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Greening of U.S. Diplomacy: Focus on Ecology", "print_headline": "The Greening of U.S. Diplomacy: Focus on Ecology", "body_text": " **********Environmental threats like the beautiful water hyacinths choking Lake Victoria and the desert sands eating away the sparse pastures bordering the Sahara are some of the issues deemed urgent today by American foreign policy makers in much the same manner as military threats like new surface-to-air missile sites alarmed policy makers several decades ago. **********These days, intelligence officials are being asked to look at softer targets  -- those flowers and sand dunes -- to shed light on this decade's hot wars. Through this optic, Somalia and Rwanda can be interpreted not as spontaneous outbreaks of clan warfare or ethnic violence, but as conflicts nourished by the  underlying strains of hunger, drought and a lack of arable land in Somalia, and  huge population growth and population density in Rwanda. **********So in addition to their traditional intelligence gathering -- arms, nuclear  weapons programs, expansion of foreign armies -- American policy makers are looking more than ever before at natural phenomena in their search for the deeper roots of war and threats to global security. They are expecting more wars like Somalia, where the United States sent troops to calm a desperate situation  spawned by environmental calamities and the brutal political response to it. To  prepare for such future wars, they are analyzing subjects like the water table levels in Central Asia and the water hyacinths in Central Africa. **********In August, the Defense Intelligence Agency finished a study on the rapid spread of the water hyacinth plant in Lake Victoria, which provides 120,000 tons of fish each year to Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. The agency noted with due seriousness how a single water hyacinth can multiply into a million plants in one year and, the report warned, these plants could ultimately strangle the lake and kill most of its fish. The consequences would be serious: famine and such political instability in neighboring countries that the United States could be called in to help. **********In looking at the underlying causes of war and crisis, the intelligence community now examines an expanded menu of subjects, including agriculture, demographics, economics and epidemiology. It looks, for instance, at China's economic boom and how it is causing considerable overcrowding in China's cities; at the AIDS epidemic in East Africa and how it is affecting the region's military and political elites; and at Mexico's industrial leap forward and how it has left millions of peasants behind. **********Some old-line intelligence officials disparage this new focus on what they call \"soft stuff.\" But the Clinton Administration, led by Vice President Al Gore, has deliberately added this new focus on environmental and natural factors -- famine, soil erosion, rapid population growth, the expansion of deserts -- that they believe will produce many of the world crises of tomorrow. **********\"During the cold war, most security threats stemmed from state-to-state aggression, so most of the analysis was of factors that could produce state-to-state aggression,\" said James Steinberg, the State Department's director of policy planning. \"Now we're focusing more on internal factors that can destabilize governments and lead to civil wars and ethnic strife. Now we're  paying much more attention to early warning factors, like famine and the environment.\" **********The United States looks less than before at who is sitting where in the Kremlin and more at how good this fall's harvest will be in the Central Asian republics. **********The Central Intelligence Agency recently commissioned a study to determine whether there was a correlation between a country's infant mortality rate, the openness of a country's trading system to imports and the stability of its government, hoping that finding a way to view these factors collectively would help the C.I.A. predict where the next crisis might erupt. **********Gathering of the so-called soft intelligence has become routine. The C.I.A. now does an annual study, called \"Global Humanitarian Emergencies\" that forecasts which countries are most likely to suffer from natural disasters. It set up a global affairs department two years ago that analyzes environmental matters, the global food situation and other issues the agency once gave little  attention. **********\"We've been looking at some of these softer issues for a long time,\" said one intelligence official. \"What's different now is these issues have moved from the periphery to take a more central role.\" **********Angelo Codevilla, an intelligence expert who teaches at Boston University, said this new approach is misguided. \"All this soft stuff is a silly idea,\" he said. \"The purpose of intelligence is to ferret out secrets from people who want to keep those secrets. To turn intelligence into environmental reports is not to understand environmental problems or intelligence.\" **********Professor Codevilla said it was wrong to switch from harder to softer intelligence. \"The hard stuff is as important as ever because guns will determine the future of the world as much as they ever did,\" he said. **********Toby Gati, Assistant Secretary of State for Intelligence, disagrees, saying,  \"This soft stuff immediately becomes hard when you have to send in the Marines.\" **********George Moose, the Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, is a promoter of this new approach and says that if the intelligence community had studied Somalia's water table levels in the three years before the outbreak of famine and clan warfare there, the information might have warned diplomats of an imminent crisis. Since Africa is his responsibility, Mr. Moose is particularly sensitive to the role of natural disasters in human conflicts. He argues that the rapid spread of the Sahara desert set off the 1989 conflict between Senegal and Mauritania, when herdsmen from the two countries went to war over a dwindling amount of grazing land. **********In recent years the Pentagon has sent troops to Somalia, where American soldiers made it safe for relief groups to deliver food to starving people, and  to Zaire, where the United States set up emergency camps for Rwandan refugees. Even in the more traditional Haiti operation, American troops were called upon to restore an ousted, democratically elected president who vowed to combat poverty rather than to take up arms in a classic government-to-government confrontation like the wars in Korean and Vietnam. **********The Administration says the American people care about the problems addressed recently. \"The issues of overpopulation, of refugees, of famine, of human rights problems are issues the American people have become more interested in,\" said one National Security Council official. **********This shift toward softer intelligence has brought with it another shift: more than ever before, the intelligence community is using public material, particularly relief reports produced by organizations like the International Committee of the Red Cross. **********In Africa, where the the C.I.A. is cutting back its presence, intelligence officials acknowledge that the thousands of relief workers there are a trove of  information about the continent. To take advantage of this, the Clinton Administration is setting up a computer information network, called \"Relief Net,\" to speed the flow of information from the Red Cross and other relief groups to Government agencies."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/07/business/company-news-hollywood-entertainment-s-shares-drop-nearly-53.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-12-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 94, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;HOLLYWOOD ENTERTAINMENT'S SHARES DROP NEARLY 53%", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;HOLLYWOOD ENTERTAINMENT'S SHARES DROP NEARLY 53%", "body_text": " **********Shares of the Hollywood Entertainment Corporation lost more than half their value yesterday after two analysts downgraded the stock and a Forbes magazine article questioned the company's accounting practices.

The  principal argument against a continuing ban on hemp cultivation is therefore no  longer valid.\" **********Mr. Seehofer lifted the ban after Germany's Parliament recommended that he do so. He said hemp may now be legally grown as long as it contains less than 0.3 percent of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the substance that gives marijuana and  hashish their psychoactive quality. **********Jochen Borchert, the Minister of Nutrition, Agriculture and Forests, said that hemp growers would have to obtain permits, and that their crops would be subject to inspection to insure that they do not grow plants potent enough to be used as intoxicants. **********Germany's principal farmers' association had lobbied for a lifting of the ban, as had representatives of textile companies and the printing industry, which is interested in hemp-based paper. **********Hemp was widely grown in Germany and across Europe until the 1930's, when an  anti-marijuana campaign in the United States led many other countries to crack down on farmers who cultivated it. There has been virtually no hemp grown in Germany since then, although the law banning it dates only from 1982. **********Although the new ruling may propel Germany to the forefront of Western Europe's producers, hemp is already cultivated on 24,000 acres in France, Spain  and Britain. Larger amounts are believed to be grown in Eastern Europe. **********As recently as two years ago, there was no visible interest in hemp production in Germany. Since then, a strong pro-hemp lobby has emerged. It is a  combination of industrial lobbies, farmers seeeking new crops and veterans of the alternative and hippie scenes of past decades. **********Interest in hemp was stimulated by the publication in 1993 of a 480-page book, \"Rediscovery of the Useful Plant Hemp,\" which was printed on paper with a  50 percent hemp content. More than 100,000 copies have been sold. **********According to the book, hemp is one of the world's oldest cultivated crops and requires little care and little or no pesticide or fertilizer. It says that cloth made from hemp is several times stronger than cotton and that hemp paper can be recycled 10 times, as opposed to three times for most pulp-based paper. **********The book's editor, Mathias Brockers, has emerged as Germany's first hemp entrepreneur. He opened a shop in Berlin last year to sell products made from hemp, and now helps run a chain of 14 shops across the country. **********The Berlin store offers hemp products ranging from jeans and neckties to furniture oil, shampoo and lipstick, and shoppers are invited to munch on hemp seeds that fill a bowl near the cash register."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/08/business/softkey-reaches-agreement-to-buy-learning-company.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-12-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 773, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Softkey Reaches Agreement to Buy Learning Company", "print_headline": "Softkey Reaches Agreement to Buy Learning Company", "body_text": " **********Five weeks after initiating a hostile bid, Softkey International Inc. said today that it had reached an agreement to acquire the Learning Company for a combination of cash and stock valued at about $606 million. Learning Company said it had terminated its previous merger agreement with Broderbund Software Inc., its preferred suitor. **********Coupled with Softkey's Oct. 30 agreement to acquire the Minnesota Educational Computing Corporation, known as M.E.C.C., and its agreement this month to acquire Compton's New Media from the Tribune Company, this deal would make Softkey the dominant player in educational software. Softkey's combined market share would be more than twice that of its closest competitor. **********Moreover, the company, a general producer of software that is based in Cambridge, Mass., is best known in the industry for its tactic of undercutting competitors on pricing. Analysts said that its aggressive pricing could lower the profitability of the entire educational-software sector. **********Softkey agreed to pay $67.50 a share, up from $65, or $558 million, in cash for 8.28 million shares of the Learning Company's outstanding common stock, and  is to exchange Softkey shares worth about $48 million for unvested Learning Company employee stock options. **********The price proved too high for Broderbund, but the company is looking at other possible acquisitions, a spokesman, Eric Winkler, said. \"We looked at the total  market, and the stakes for this one company, and decided it was beyond the risk  we wanted to accrue for our shareholders,\" he said. **********Shares of the Learning Company, which is based in Fremont, Calif., closed today at $67.125, up $3.875, in Nasdaq trading, while Softkey shares rose $1.875, to $31.125. Broderbund shares fell $1, to $58. **********Bill Dinsmore, the Learning Company's president and chief executive, said in  a telephone interview that Softkey's offer represented a 73 percent premium over what the company's shares had traded for before the Broderbund deal was announced in the summer. **********\"Strategically, the combination with Broderbund made a lot of sense, but in the end you really had to look out for the shareholders,\" Mr. Dinsmore said. **********Broderbund and the Learning Company had earlier agreed on a stock swap initially worth about $550 million, but that slipped to less than $500 million as Broderbund's share price dropped. When Softkey changed a previous cash and stock offer to all cash earlier this week, Broderbund elected not to raise its offer, which had already been sweetened once. Choosing between $67.50 in cash and a partial Broderbund share worth substantially less than that, the board took the cash. **********Founded in 1980, the Learning Company was one of the first personal computer  software companies of any kind, and among the early providers of educational programs for the Apple II, then a leading machine. With its mainstay title, Reader Rabbit, it created a lasting franchise that was unusual in crossing over  from home use to in-school, curriculum-based learning. **********Softkey has built a business by acquiring struggling software companies, repackaging and repricing their products. The company is going from almost no presence in the educational software market to a commanding lead, but analysts said there was no assurance these acquisitions would pay off. Softkey is investing more than $1 billion in M.E.C.C. and the Learning Company at a time when the entire industry has sales of less than $500 million. And though Softkey is an aggressive player, competitors like Davidson & Associates and the Microsoft Corporation are not likely to cede the market without a fight. **********Still, analysts could understand the gamble. \"If Softkey applies their discounting strategy here that is going to control the market and that may hurt  Broderbund, Davidson and others which haven't pursued that strategy,\" said Ann Stephens, an analyst with PC Data in Reston, Va. **********But some childrens' software experts said they doubted Softkey's ability to grow its market share by cutting prices without diminishing quality. Many of Softkey's current products sell for about $12.95, compared with Learning Company titles that range from $50 to $100; developers say there is not enough profit at lower prices to support the cost of producing quality programs. **********Kevin O'Leary, Softkey's president, said that he would not alter the current  products of the Learning Company or M.E.C.C. and that he hoped to retain those companies' development staffs. He said previous comments he had made about \"carving\" their titles into multiple products had been misinterpreted. **********\"I have no intention of changing the prices of any of the Learning Company's  products,\" Mr. O'Leary said in a telephone interview. \"I do want to work with their developers to produce products to service that 40 percent of the market that hasn't bought educational software because of pricing issues.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/14/business/bidding-starts-for-wireless-cable-rights.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-11-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 507, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bidding Starts For Wireless Cable Rights", "print_headline": "Bidding Starts For Wireless Cable Rights", "body_text": " **********Round one in the Federal Government's auction of video broadcast rights attracted $3.4 million in high bids today. **********Paradise Cable Inc. was the highest bidder, offering $188,750 for the right to provide wireless cable television to a Florida market.

The proceedings were expected to interrupted if the budget standoff between the Clinton Administration and the Republican-led Congress results in a shutdown of the Government. **********Analysts predicted that the auction would raise significantly less revenue for the United States Treasury than previous airwave auctions, because the available licenses are considered less than ideal. **********Eventually, analysts said, the proceeds could reach between $25 million and $100 million, a trifling amount compared with the $9 billion taken in by the F.C.C.'s auctions of personal communications services, the next generation of cellular phone and paging services. **********Wireless cable, a fast-growing but fledgling competitor to traditional cable  service, delivers video programming inexpensively over the airwaves to subscribers' rooftop antennas, and requires set-top boxes. **********The service is viable only in certain geographic regions because the signal cannot reach over buildings or mountains. Also, the service has little channel capacity and is perceived by many industry experts as a nonstarter. **********Still, wireless cable companies are bidding for the rights as a way to extend their reach in existing markets, and many of the local Baby Bell phone companies are looking at the technology as an inexpensive shortcut into the cable television business. **********The Grand Junction, Colo., market attracted eight bids, the largest number for any market today, while York, Pa., attracted the largest dollar volume of bids. **********Pacific Telesis Group, the GTE Corporation and a venture funded in part by the Nynex Corporation and the Bell Atlantic Corporation are among the auction's  biggest bidders, analysts said. **********\"From a phone company point of view, it's not a bad deal,\" said Christopher Dixon of Paine Webber. \"Wireless cable provides a Bell operating company a way to go to school to learn how video works.\" **********In the last few years, wireless cable has emerged in isolated markets as a viable, cheaper alternative to traditional cable television.

South Korean companies have essentially caught up to Japan's electronic giants in their specialty, memory chips, while the United States has  maintained a lead in microprocessors and other chips that do more advanced information processing tasks. **********Japan has long been known for Government-backed efforts to move the nation into specific industries. In the 1970's, the VLSI Project -- it stands for very  large system integration -- helped Japanese companies capture the world lead in  the memory chip market. **********But as Japan's electronics companies have become bigger and stronger and able to finance their own product development, the projects run by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry have shifted more toward basic research. **********Katsuhiko Kaji, deputy director of the industrial electronics division at MITI, said the new project would work on basic materials and techniques that would be needed 10 years from now rather than on particular products. **********These will include ways for making semiconductors with circuit patterns less  than 0.1 micron in width, compared with several tenths of a micron in today's most advanced chips. The project also will work on techniques for measuring features that small. A micron is a millionth of a meter. **********Mr. Kaji said a consortium of companies was expected to be set up next year to conduct the research. He said theministry wanted to continue the project for  at least five years, but the annual financing probably would be far less than in the first year. **********Mr. Kaji said the project might be open to some \"competitive\" non-Japanese companies, but added, \"We will not welcome free riders.\" **********In a separate development, 10 Japanese semiconductor companies are planning to work together to help introduce computer-chip manufacturing equipment that can handle silicon wafers that are 300 millimeters, or about 12 inches, in diameter. **********The project would require 5 billion yen, or about $50 million, to start, and  would need a budget of about $40 million a year, an industry official said, adding that there will be no Government financing. **********Currently, chips are made from silicon wafers that are 200 millimeters, or 8  inches, in diameter. The change to 12-inch wafers, which is expected to take place toward the end of the decade, would allow far more chips to be made from a single wafer, cutting manufacturing costs. **********The project is sponsored by the Semiconductor Industry Research Institute Japan, an organization formed last year by Japanese semiconductor companies to work on ways to increase the competitiveness of Japan's industry. The members of the institute include NEC, Toshiba, Hitachi and Fujitsu. **********American companies, led by the Sematech consortium, are also planning a project to help develop manufacturing equipment for 12-inch wafers. **********Taro Okabe, acting executive director of the Japanese institute, said there was a chance the two nations would cooperate."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/11/business/the-media-business-striking-newspaper-workers-out-in-cold-in-a-union-town.html": {"writer_name": "William Glaberson", "pub_date": "1995-11-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1676, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS;Striking Newspaper Workers Out in Cold in a Union Town", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS;Striking Newspaper Workers Out in Cold in a Union Town", "body_text": " **********Nearly four months into a newspaper strike here, the companies that own this  city's two daily papers appear to be defeating their unions. **********Here, in the city that is sometimes called the labor capital of the country,  the papers have published a newspaper every day since the strike began on July 13. Since September, the two papers have each been publishing their usual separate daily editions. **********Most encouraging for the companies, about half of the 500 journalists represented by the striking Newspaper Guild have crossed the picket lines and returned to work. **********At a time the newspaper industry is nearly obsessed with cutting costs, the papers' success draws comparisons with the 1981 defeat of the air traffic controllers' union, whose striking members were replaced. But with the companies' costs of winning the bitter and sometimes violent confrontation expected to climb to pretax losses of $100 million or more, it is not clear whether such a victory would be worth the cost. **********The strike is important to the newspaper industry, in part because the Detroit papers' owners, the Gannett Company and Knight-Ridder Inc., are the nation's largest newspaper publishing companies and because they have grown increasingly confident: they recently refused a union offer to end the strike and submit to binding arbitration. And they have hired 1,500 of what they insist are permanent replacements for 2,500 striking workers. **********The Newspaper Guild is one of six striking unions at Gannett's Detroit News and Knight-Ridder's Detroit Free Press. Some in the newspaper industry view the  strike as a turning point in what has become a city-by-city battle by newspaper  managers to cut costs to satisfy investors and try to remain competitive against new challengers for advertisers' dollars and readers' attention. **********\"The way the strike has developed reflects fundamental shifts in the newspaper industry and in journalism,\" said Charles Eisendrath, a journalism professor at the University of Michigan. \"What both sides are groping for is how to survive,\" he said, as newspapers and employees face new pressure for profits  and new competitive challenges. **********For the labor movement nationally, a defeat would be a special blow, because  of unions' historic strength in Detroit. The leaders of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the teamsters' union and the United Automobile Workers are giving the Detroit unions special help. **********But for newspaper unions in particular, which have been on the defensive nationally for years, a defeat here could be devastating. \"This is probably the last big urban newspaper strike,\" said John Morton, a newspaper industry analyst with Lynch, Jones & Ryan. **********Gannett and Knight-Ridder have gained momentum partly because of what executives describe as careful planning for a strike. Some union people here   said the planning showed the companies' eagerness to send a message about how serious they were to cut costs at other union and nonunion papers. **********Knight-Ridder, for example, is in the midst of tough negotiations aimed at increasing profits at its two Philadelphia newspapers. With the Detroit strike as a backdrop, the papers won a tentative settlement this week from 9 of its 10  unions in Philadelphia after suggesting that it might even close its tabloid, The Philadelphia Daily News. Knight-Ridder executives said this week that because of union concessions, The Philadelphia Daily News would be secure at least until the year 2000. **********In Detroit, the companies hired private security guards, bused in workers from other newspapers and used a helicopter to airlift papers out of a printing  plant, circumventing picketers. Such tactics are expensive, and even if the companies prevail, they may pay a high cost in damage to their images, to the papers, and to journalism in Detroit. **********In the short term, the companies acknowledge that they have already lost more than $46 million fighting the strike, and tens of millions of additional losses  are projected by year-end. P. Anthony Ridder, chairman of Knight-Ridder, told employees in Detroit this week that his company expected to lose $56 million this year because of the strike. **********The papers have separate news units but share business operations and profits under a joint operating agreement that began in 1989. Executives have said the joint operation made a $46 million profit last year. **********But whatever the short-term calculation, some newspaper people here say there have already been immeasurable losses in diminished good will and growing hard feelings. The union leaders say they plan to fight on to inflict maximum damage. The unions were encouraged when the regional office of the National Labor Relations Board issued an unfair-labor-practice complaint in August against the  companies, saying they had not bargained in good faith. If the unions ultimately win that case, the companies could be forced to take the strikers back if they offered to return. **********Many public officials here have condemned the papers, and some have said they will work to be sure the papers pay a lasting price for their stance against the unions. **********Some journalists say the strike is likely to hasten a merger of the two papers into one, or a cut in the resources they devote to news. The companies say that they plan to put out two papers for the length of the joint operating agreement -- 100 years -- and that financially healthier newspapers would allow  them to strengthen their news coverage. **********The human toll has been large. Teamsters and pressmen, most of whom did not cross picket lines, have been unsure whether they would ever work in the industry again. Old friendships have been broken, careers have been derailed and families have been uprooted as people leave town for new jobs. **********Outside on the picket line, The Free Press's restaurant critic, Molly Abraham, said the unions had been weakened by journalists who cast their lot with the companies. The strikebreakers, she said, \"are in it for themselves\" and do not understand why it is important for union people to stick together. **********\"If the unions can be crushed in Detroit,\" she said, \"they probably could be  crushed anywhere.\" **********Linda K. Foley, the national president of the Newspaper Guild, said, \"The two largest newspaper companies in the country have decided they want to bust their  unions, and we have to prove they can't do that.\" Among several steps the guild  announced here this week, striking workers plan to begin their own weekly Sunday paper to try to lure advertisers and readers. **********Inside at The Free Press, which has long nurtured a reputation for liberalism, Hugh McDiarmid, the political columnist, said the strike had been a  lesson in new business realities in the newspaper industry. **********Perhaps, Mr. McDiarmid said, his competitors at The Detroit News were not surprised that their corporate owner, Gannett, was so aggressive in its drive for profits. Gannett has long had a reputation for rigorously keeping costs down. **********But, Mr. McDiarmid said, \"most people recognize now that Knight-Ridder is also a big company that is far more concerned than some of them thought about the bottom line.\" **********Mr. McDiarmid, 60, returned to work after 27 days on strike. He said he was not angry about the developments, just realistic. \"Times have changed in the newspaper business,\" he said. **********Union leaders said the companies appeared determined to break the unions, with demands for sharp cutbacks in the number of employees, changes in staffing  rules and other concessions. For the Newspaper Guild, a primary issue was the companies' insistence on instituting a merit-pay system instead of simply granting across-the-board pay increases. The editors of both papers denied that  they were trying to break the unions. But they said they were determined to do away with the inefficiencies and \"featherbedding.\" **********Whatever the truth, it is difficult to measure how much damage has been done  to the papers. Boycotted by some advertisers, the papers have lost revenues, though they will not say how much. And they acknowledge that they have lost 24 percent of their prestrike combined daily circulation of 886,228. **********The unions say the circulation numbers are sharply inflated, with many papers piled into garbage bins or delivered to people who do not want them. The newspapers, which deny those assertions, say distribution is returning to normal despite occasional incidents of violence, like a pipe bomb found recently in a newspaper rack. Circulation has not been audited during the strike. **********But even the acknowledged circulation decline of 24 percent could permanently hurt the papers. John Polich, a newspaper management specialist at the Fordham University Graduate School of Business, who has studied reader attitudes about newspapers after strikes in other cities, said circulation declines prompted by  strikes were often long-lasting. And once circulation falls sharply, he said, a  cycle of decline is often difficult to stop. **********\"If the strike in Detroit ended tomorrow,\" Mr. Polich said, \"management and the unions would still remain angry, the readers would have had months to find other media or give up on the reading experience entirely, and advertisers will  have been forced to exploit other means of reaching their prospects.\" **********Outside both newspapers' separate headquarters on West Lafayette Boulevard here, a cold wind was blowing. It was quiet on the street. Three or four strikers, bundled against the chill, moved about in front of each of the buildings. Inside, people sold advertising and planned layouts in the calm of a  normal workday. In the newsroom, reporters, some of whom were working somewhere  else until a few weeks ago, called news sources in Detroit. **********In front of The Detroit News, Dwight Fields, a member of the teamsters' union, said he thought it was too early to say that the unions had lost. \"It's far from over,\" he said.

Case 3d started out in investment banking in 1981, he decided  against joining Morgan Stanley & Company, or some other powerful Wall Street barony. **********Instead, the young Princeton graduate and Rhodes scholar from Hawaii, went off to San Francisco to join Hambrecht & Quist Inc., the investment banking boutique where denim mixes with pinstripes and socks are optional. Founded in 1968, Hambrecht specializes in raising capital for young, growing companies, particularly in high-technology businesses. **********I wanted to work some place that had a cross-section of strategic and financial advice work, as well as investment banking and consulting,\" Mr. Case said in an interview last week. William R. Hambrecht, the company's founder and  chairman \"was on President Carter's committee on capital formation, and he wanted me to do some of his staff work.\" **********\"And I had a girlfriend at Stanford,\" Mr. Case added. **********Things did not work out quite as Mr. Case envisaged. \"The Presidential committee never met so there was no staff work, and the girlfriend dumped me within a month,\" he said. **********Now, just 14 years later, Mr. Case, 38 years old and still looking like a graduate student, is president and chief executive of Hambrecht, which is enjoying a record year. **********Hambrecht is hardly alone in its success. This has been a banner year for smaller investment banking and brokerage firms that specialize in raising money for high-technology companies. Such companies as Robertson, Stephens; Alex Brown & Sons; Hambrecht; Montgomery Securities; Volpe, Welty & Company and Cowen & Company have all had heavy workloads. **********The success of smaller firms in bringing so many technology companies to market also illustrates the degree to which much of the more promising business  in the American securities industry -- high-growth companies -- slips through the fingers of the big Wall Street firms and winds up in the hands of relative newcomers like Hambrecht & Quist. **********As more technology companies have chosen to go public, raising money to expand operations and invest in research into the next potentially cutting-edge  product, they have often turned to local investment firms for help. In part, this is based on a cultural affinity. All the small firms other than Alex Brown  and Cowen have headquarters near Silicon Valley, so the bankers and entrepreneurs are steeped in the same easygoing California culture. In part, it  is because many partners in the investment firms have backgrounds in engineering, and speak the same language as the high-tech entrepreneurs they serve. **********\"I spend a whole lot more time in Silicon Valley than I do on Wall Street,\" Mr. Case said. And his firm and other smaller investment houses were already familiar with the Internet when it suddenly became one of Wall Street's favorite industries. **********Mr. Hambrecht remains chairman of Hambrecht & Quist, a privately held firm that is 90 percent owned by its employees and has equity capital of over $100 million. It has 36 partners and 470 employees worldwide, including more than 20  analysts following technology companies. The firm's other founding partner, George Quist, died in 1982. **********Not surprisingly, Mr. Case is an unabashed booster of the Internet. \"The personal computer market in the 1980's, the railroad industry in the 19th century, there are a lot of metaphors for the Internet,\" said Mr. Case, whose colleagues at Hambrecht project it will be a $13-billion-ayear industry by the end of the decade. **********Being savvy about coming technologies, however, isn't everything.  Hambrecht, Robertson and others do not have the huge capital of their bigger New York competitors, who have billions of dollars behind them. This financial muscle quickly becomes important as companies grow. **********\"Capital is very important in developing strong banking relationships,\" said  Carter McClelland, president and chief executive of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in  North America, \"particularly because it's so key to developing strong market support in the over-the-counter trading business.\" **********Larger technology offerings like those for the AVX Corporation, the ceramic capacitor maker, and MEMC Electronic Materials Inc., a silicon wafer manufacturer, are still the province of Wall Street , but in terms of the number of high-tech initial public offerings, or I.P.O.'s, it is the minnows that are gobbling up more of the meal. **********Oak Technology Inc., the Netscape Communications Corporation, Computron Software Inc., the Check Free Corporation and UUNet Technologies Inc. are among  the better-known technology companies that these smaller investment banks have helped to take public this year. **********\"These people are professionals, they've done well, but the market has been with them,\" said John Fitzgibbon of I.P.O. Aftermarket, a securities industry publication. \"They've caught lightning in a bottle.\" **********The majority of the high-tech I.P.O's of the last 12 months are trading above their issue prices, according to Mr. Fitzgibbon, citing Pinnacle Systems Inc., which closed Friday at $31.25, up from an issue price of $10 last November and Oak Technology, which closed Friday at $37.50, up from an issue price of $14. **********\"We were very satisfied, they had good distribution to institutions and helped us win market acceptance,\" said George A. McMillan, chief operating and financial officer for Renaissance Solutions Inc., a consulting and systems integration company that Hambrecht and Cowen took public at $13 a share in April, and whose stock closed Friday at $23. **********Despite the healthy market, there have been some flops among Hambrecht's I.P.O.'s, including ACT Network Inc., which ended the week at $9.25 a share, down from its May issue price of $13. **********Although the market for high-technology stocks has softened slightly recently, the industry has still driven the market for stock offerings this year. \"High technology has been the Florence Nightingale for the new-issue market in 1995,\" said David L. Menlow, president of the I.P.O. Financial Network Corporation of Springfield, N.J., a company that projects the opening prices of  initial public offerings. **********Mr. Case is careful not to seem disrespectful of the bigger Wall Street firms whose muscle can be important to his clients. \"A constructive relationship is helpful to the client,\" he said, but Wall Street comes at high-technology investment banking \"from a different cultural perspective.\" **********\"The world needs both of us,\" he added. \"We ultimately believe their brand is overvalued in our markets.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/10/world/honduras-trying-to-identify-disease-that-kills-infants.html": {"writer_name": "Larry Rohter", "pub_date": "1995-12-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 705, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Honduras Trying to Identify Disease That Kills Infants", "print_headline": "Honduras Trying to Identify Disease That Kills Infants", "body_text": " **********The baffled health authorities here are struggling to identify and combat a mysterious disease that has apparently afflicted only infants, often killing them in a matter of hours, in the six weeks since it suddenly appeared in Honduras. **********At least 10 children under the age of 12 months have died of the disease, whose origins remain unknown. The Ministry of Health has determined that an orally transmitted bacterial infection was the cause of death, and has sent material from three autopsies to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  in Atlanta in an effort to isolate what Honduran health officials describe as a  particularly aggressive \"mutant\" micro-organism. **********There are some very strange features to this disease, and we don't have the facilities we need here or in neighboring countries, so we have asked the C.D.C. for help,\" Dr. Enrique Zelaya, an official of the Health Ministry, said in an interview here. **********\"This is an intestinal infection, but without the dehydration you would normally see, and with some other oddities, such as a very low pH level in the blood,\" he said. **********The first cases of the illness were reported early in November, most of them  in this capital. The Government quickly put an educational campaign into effect, urging parents to take infants to the hospital at the first sign of diarrhea, and appeared to have brought the situation under control until this week, when another infant was hospitalized and died less than 24 hours later. **********The outbreak here is the fourth major epidemic to strike the six countries of Central America this year. More than 100,000 cases of dengue, an often-fatal disease transmitted by mosquitoes, have been reported throughout Latin America and the Caribbean in 1995, but the highest and most severe levels of incidents,  more than 35,000 cases, have occurred in this region, where the rainy season has been unusually long and intense. **********Then, in October, an outbreak of what was later identified as leptospirosis,  which is transmitted by the urine of mammals, hit Nicaragua, killing at least 26 people and infecting more than 2,500 before spreading to Honduras and El Salvador. At about the same time, El Salvador was afflicted by an epidemic of hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, which is not fatal but can lead to blindness. **********\"The clear linkage in all these cases is poverty,\" said Dr. Berta Gomez, a specialist in transmissible diseases who works for the Pan-American Health Organization here. \"The poor live where environmental conditions are the most precarious, where sanitation is not the best, where educational efforts arrive late, if at all.\" **********That seems to be the case with the disease in Honduras, the poorest country in Central America. All the young victims lived with their families in the sprawling shantytowns that have sprung up in the last decade on the sides of the mountains around Tegucigalpa, as tens of thousands of peasants have flocked here in search of jobs and a better life. **********Several of those who died lived in an area near a huge garbage dump where foods like powdered milk and cereal are supposed to be burned when their expiration dates pass. Many poor residents often rummage through the dump, scavenging for items that they can either consume themselves or sell illegally at a discount on the open market. **********Dr. Elsa Palou, president of the Honduran medical association, said she was particularly disturbed by the re-emergence of \"old diseases\" thought to have been vanquished. She attributed the phenomenon not only to the lack of hygiene but also to the unwillingness of governments throughout the region to spend money on disease prevention and health education programs. **********Dr. Zelaya, the Health Ministry official, said the Government increased spending on health programs by nearly two-thirds last year and by 10 percent this year. But those were the first real increases in more than a decade, he said, and have not been sufficient to address the problems that have built up over the years. **********\"Our costs are obviously much higher, and it's hard to get an adequate supply of the raw materials we need, like insecticide,\" he said. \"All of our programs have been deteriorating little by little, and we have fallen so far behind that  it is hard to catch up.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/08/business/funds-watch-money-market-funds-jump-113-billion-this-year.html": {"writer_name": "Carole Gould", "pub_date": "1995-10-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 982, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FUNDS WATCH;Money Market Funds Jump $113 Billion This Year", "print_headline": "FUNDS WATCH;Money Market Funds Jump $113 Billion This Year", "body_text": " **********ASSETS in money market funds have really surged this year, suggesting the category will hit $1 trillion by February 1998, said Money Market Insight, a newsletter in Ashland, Mass. **********So far this year, the funds have added $113 billion, reaching $732 billion last week. The category grew by $43 billion for all of 1994. **********It's not as if money was flooding out of stock and bond funds, either. Given the strong inflows into other mutual funds, money must be coming into the money  market funds from new sources, analysts said. **********Money continues to shift out of bank certificates of deposit, in part because money fund yields have surpassed those on 6-month and 12-month C.D.'s. Investors seem to be seeking the best investment, not sticking with the old standbys. **********Other factors contributing to the growth are the increasing popularity of mutual funds and retirement plans, whether 401(k)'s or individual retirement accounts. Through these accounts, people are learning about saving and investing choices. **********Money market mutual funds are well on their way to hitting $1 trillion in assets. Then they would be overseeing a significant part of the country's liquid assets, from individuals, municipalities, small companies and Fortune 500 companies. **********Fleet Bank Adds Sales Charge **********One of the few banks to offer mutual funds without a load, or sales charge, is changing course. Fleet Financial Group, based in Providence, R.I., plans to add an up-front sales fee of 3.75 percent to its Galaxy stock and bond portfolios on Nov. 1. **********The company said the charge was prompted by its effort to offer more investment counseling services, but it follows on the heels of Fleet's merger with Shawmut Bank, which already offers fund shares with a load. **********Current shareholders would be exempt from the new charges, as would all buyers in individual retirement accounts and other retirement plans, and anyone  who uses an automatic investment plan or mutual fund wrap account. **********Galaxy II shareholders would not be affected by the new fee. **********On-Line Service For 401(k) Plans **********The Vanguard Group has started a computer service to help 401(k) participants develop a sound retirement plan.

Each segment allows people to incorporate their own financial data and to calculate whether their savings plans are sufficient to meet their goals. **********The company toots its own horn, too; one segment gives comprehensive information about Vanguard's funds.

Investors can choose shares with an up-front sales charge of 4.75 percent or with a deferred sales charge of 5 percent that disappears after six years. **********MFS and Foreign and Colonial have started three new funds: International Growth and Income will own a mix of stocks and bonds mostly outside the United States; International Growth will own stocks of overseas companies, and Emerging Markets Equity will be in developing markets around the world. The sales charge  is 4.75 percent. Fee Waivers **********Stein Roe & Farnham has extended fee waivers to all individual-retirement, simplified employee-pension and rollover retirement accounts. Previously, only accounts of $5,000 or more qualified for the waiver. Investors who have paid the $12 fee for 1995 can expect a refund. **********Three Fidelity funds -- Puritan, Equity-Income and Export -- have waived their sales charges, but the waivers expire at the end of the year. **********Annuities Made Simple **********The promise of tax-deferred growth makes annuities tantalizing. To help you  decide if an annuity is a good investment, T. Rowe Price is offering free software that compares the after-tax return of annuities with various investments in mutual funds. **********Price, which introduced a low-cost annuity last month, urges investors to take advantage of individual retirement accounts, 401(k) plans, Keoghs and other tax-deferred options before considering annuities. **********The program allows you to create examples, using assumptions about life expectancy, tax rates and investment returns, both before and after retirement.  The software, for use with Windows 3.1 and an I.B.M.-compatible computer, is available by calling 800 469-5304. **********Following Up On Settlements **********Say you have a problem with a salesman who sold you fund shares. A settlement is reached in your favor in arbitration conducted by the National Association of Securities Dealers, a self-regulating body of the securities industry. But what  if the offending party fails to fulfill the settlement's requirements? **********Because the N.A.S.D. was concerned that some of its members were not honoring arbitration agreements, as of Oct. 2 it has given itself the authority to suspend or cancel the membership or registration of the a broker who won't comply with an arbitrated settlement. **********The N.A.S.D. said investor costs were rising because of delayed settlement payments and enforcement expenses. Sometimes, the N.A.S.D. has had to reschedule hearings or appoint a new arbitrator. Perhaps most important, regulators want to insure the credibility of the arbitration process.

Steven Reynolds, the new chief investment officer for equities at Kemper Financial Services, will manage the fund until another manager is found. Mr. Reynolds was formerly a senior vice president with Alliance Capital Management. **********Paine Webber Growth has picked up Blue Chip Growth and Communications and Technology; all three funds are or were managed by Ellen Harris. **********Tom Marsico is turning over control of the three broker-sold Idex funds -- Idex, Idex II Growth and Idex Fund 3 -- to a co-manager, Scott Schoelzel, in January, if the board approves the move.

Mr. Chretien also wants to give Quebec a veto over future constitutional changes affecting the province and to speed the decentralization of other powers to all  provinces, including greater authority over immigration, job training and higher education. **********\"I will bring about these changes very quickly,\" Mr. Chretien said in Ottawa  today. And in an address to business leaders tonight in Toronto, he promised that the House of Commons \"will speak out\" in the near future on a resolution to give Quebec \"distinct society\" status.

They want an independent country, not just a distinct society, and in their concession speeches Monday promised a new independence referendum is around the corner. **********\"Mr. Chretien has learned nothing from the referendum and is simply spouting  the same old meaningless cliches about change that almost put this country over  the edge,\" said Preston Manning, leader of the weatern-based Reform Party, the third-largest in Parlilament after the Bloc Quebecois and the Liberals. **********In the last quarter-century, Canada's political life has been dominated by the Quebec question and by trying to alter Canadian federalism to accommodate Quebec's demands. **********Twice in the last 10 years, in the Meech Lake and Charlottetown accords, Ottawa failed to win the necessary national backing to grant Quebec the \"distinct society\" status it wants to protect its Francophone culture in a sea of English speakers. Quebec also has a significant population of immigrants, many of whom principally speak a language other than French or English. **********In light of the failed earlier initiatives, analysts give the Chretien reforms little more than a 50-50 chance of heading off a new independence drive  in the province. **********\"It strikes me as awfully late in the day to be making such minimal gestures,\" said Mel Watkins, a political economist at the University of Toronto. **********One of the main problems is that many Canadians, especially those in western  Canada, believe that all provinces should be equal and that Quebec is not entitled to special treatment. **********During the Quebec referendum campaign, Mr. Bouchard, who rescued the flagging separatist effort and brought it close to victory, made much of the unwillingness of English Canada to recognize Quebec's differences. The new reforms are intended to take some wind out of Mr. Bouchard's sails in the event  a new referendum is actually called. **********Quebec's referendum law prevents the provincial Government from holding another vote on the same issue within the same term of office. The present Quebec Government's term expires in September 1999. **********But if Mr. Bouchard replaces Mr. Parizeau as Premier of Quebec and forms a new provincial government, he could call for another referendum as early as next year.

But is this  the year that all the pieces for electronic consumerism will fall into place? **********Don't unhitch those reindeer just yet. The merchants point to surveys that show a growing dissatisfaction with surly and poorly trained clerks, with the crowds, the parking headaches and other drawbacks of the retail shopping experience. **********More important still, for many people, is the lack of time available for physical shopping. Virtual shopping malls are open all night, and one can shop in robe and pajamas, bathed in the warm glow of a Pentium processor. **********But there are many remaining obstacles -- some technical, some psychological. The highest barriers are those needed to assure secure transactions and privacy. **********Many people are reluctant to send their credit card information over the Internet, their fears heightened by news accounts of computer bandits vacuuming  gigabytes of financial data from computer systems around the world. **********The truth is that sending a credit card number to an electronic merchant over the Internet is probably the safest way to make such a transaction. **********In the last week, for example, I handed my credit card to a waiter who disappeared with it for five minutes. I faxed my credit card information to a business in New Jersey, and the fax probably lay exposed to everyone in that office for hours and perhaps to the cleaning crew that night. **********I called a hotel and gave my card data to a reservations clerk and continued  my recklessness by ordering some merchandise from a clothing catalogue, again by reading my credit card information to some unseen operator. **********Yes, there is a risk that someone was tapping my telephone when I read my credit card number aloud or faxed it. (A reminder: Never, ever, give a credit card number over a cordless or cellular phone.) A spy might have snapped a picture of my credit card with a hidden camera when I handed it to the waiter. A hacker might have intercepted my numbers as they passed through an Internet router in Hackensack, N.J. **********But compared with the risk of handing my credit card to a stranger, which I do nearly every day, sending it over the Internet is pretty secure. **********The real risk of sending my unencrypted number is not that some cyberspace cowboy will intercept it en route to the electronic merchant, but rather that the receiving company will store my credit information in an insecure computer.  (No, not one racked with doubt about whether its hard disk is big enough, but one that lacks firewall, authentication, authorization and physical protections.) **********My credit card number was probably among the 30,000 or so that were lifted last year from unsecured computers of Netcom On-Line Communications Services by  any number of hackers, possibly including the notorious Kevin Mitnick. As far as I know, no one has charged a powerful work station or a vacation to the Caymans  to my account. **********How did Netcom get my credit card number in the first place? I read it to them over the telephone, because they warned me that it was insecure to send it  over the Internet. Then they typed it into their computer, which was connected to the Internet, and left a door open. **********Willie Sutton did not mug individuals for their wallets; he robbed banks, because, as he noted, that's where the money was. A hacker bright enough to break into an Internet server is also bright enough not to waste time picking isolated Mastercard and Visa numbers from the data stream. **********Today's Willie Suttons rob corporate computers, because that's where the data are. The people who should be really nervous about electronic commerce are the banks, brokerage houses and those who do business-to-business transactions. **********As an individual, I can shrug off the recent news that two students cracked the security mechanism in World Wide Web servers of Netscape Communications. But if I were a business about to risk my future on electronic commerce based on the Netscape server or any other Web server, I would want to wait a while longer until I was confident that the security issue had been resolved. **********It will not be resolved before Christmas. **********According to a recent survey by Commerce Net and Nielsen, 2.5 million American and Canadian adults have purchased something over a computer network. There are plenty of places for them to shop. **********For example, CyberShop (http:// cybershop.com), in Montclair, N.J., is trying to lure customers with a sweepstakes, in which the winner gets a $25,000 on-line shopping spree for items including fine china, towels and cameras. **********The Internet Shopping Network (http://www.internet.net) of Palo Alto, Calif., boasts about 25,000 computer products, plus flowers, steaks and lobsters. **********A new electronic shopping mall called eShop Plaza, from a company called eShop Inc., allows \"virtual 3-D\" shopping of Tower Records, (800) Flowers and Spiegel catalogues, among other offerings, for users with the proper Windows software. **********The eShop Web site can be found, along with scores of other Internet shopping areas, through the Yahoo directory (http://www.yahoo.com/ BusinessandEconomy/Companies/ShoppingCenters/). **********Yet, as David Kline pointed out in a recent opinion article in the on-line magazine Hotwired (http:// www.hotwired.com/market/95/43/ index1a.html), the amount of shopping done on line is dwarfed by the amount done over insecure telephone lines. **********\"The real reason people aren't buying very much on line yet is that there's nothing much to buy on line that can't be bought more easily or less expensively and with better service in more familiar surroundings,\" Mr. Kline said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/24/business/investing-itwhy-the-january-effect-might-take-a-vacation.html": {"writer_name": "Leah Ward", "pub_date": "1995-12-24", "snippet": "JANUARY 1996 may turn out to be a cold month for investors who seek out the so-called January effect. \n\n     The effect is a decades-old market quirk in which small stocks have often been given a big bounce in January.

In January 1994, for example, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, made up predominantly of large-capitalization stocks, rose 3.35 percent, while small stocks, defined as the smallest fifth of companies traded on the New York Stock Exchange, gained 6.18 percent, according  to Ibbotson Associates, a research firm. **********And in the previous January, when the S.& P. 500 rose seven-tenths of 1 percent, small stocks jumped 5.43 percent. In about six out of seven Januaries since the mid-1920's, small stocks have outperformed the market by an average of about five percentage points. **********But next month -- like January 1995, when the S.& P. 500 and small stocks rose 2.60 percent and 2.83 percent, respectively -- may be one of the exceptions. **********A common theory behind the effect is that many investors sell losers for tax  purposes in December, and that those castoffs are often small issues. The selloff reduces the prices of these stocks in January, making them attractive and prompting a run-up for the month. **********But the surge in stocks -- large and small -- in 1995 might be bad news for the January effect. **********\"This market is up so much there aren't a whole lot of losses to take,\" said  Gus Sauter, a vice president at the Vanguard Group of mutual funds. Without losses, there might not be much tax-driven selling. **********Then come the pending Congressional bills to cut the capital gains tax. Uncertainty over whether Congress will do so, and the effective date if it does, have led some investors to defer selling their stocks that have appreciated in value. \"People are holding out until the last minute,\" said Claudia E. Mott, an  analyst at Prudential Securities. \"Some selling that might ordinarily take place has not.\" **********But the mystery will soon end, either with the bills' defeat or with their passage, probably with an effective date of Jan. 1. In either case, investors who have held stocks only to see what happens on Capitol Hill will no longer have a reason to defer their decisions. **********Robert Willens, a tax expert at Lehman Brothers, has been thinking along those lines, because many investors seem to fit this profile. \"We expect a great selling of pent-up assets early in 1996,\" he said. If there is such a market selloff in January, of course, investors are unlikely to make strong profits from small stocks during the month. **********\"The January effect may be turned on its ear this year,\" Mr. Willens said. **********But other factors suggest that the effect will not be upended, or at least not completely. Having been treated so well by the 1995 market, investors may hold their stocks even after the fate of the tax bills is known, and thus help prevent a January selloff. And there is a second part of the pending legislation that may influence the January effect. **********Under current law, investors can offset long-term capital gains with long-term capital losses. Any leftover losses, up to $3,000 a year, can be written off dollar for dollar against ordinary income. The bills, however, would substitute a 2-to-1 ratio starting next year, so $6,000 in losses would be needed for the same tax benefit that $3,000 brings today. **********Given this prospect, investors who fear losing half their tax benefit may now be scurrying to realize losses. And although Mr. Willens sees the market's strong 1995 performance as limiting the impact of this provision, any rush to sell now would portend a stronger January effect, other things being equal. **********Moreover, tax-driven selling is just one possible explanation of the January  effect, and the others don't look any weaker this year than in the past. Some experts say the investment of Christmas bonuses plays a role in the January jump in small stocks. Others explain the effect as the greater willingness of money managers to place risky bets on stocks at the beginning of the year. **********ROBERT A. EISTHEN, equity analyst with Bartlett & Company in Cincinnati, which is soon to be a unit of Legg Mason, is confident of at least a selective January effect. His candidates include yearlong losers in the energy and retail  industries. **********Ms. Mott, of Prudential, has a list of 29 small-capitalization candidates for possible January gains, including Coltec Industries, a maker of automotive and aerospace equipment, which closed Friday at $11.50, down 32.9 percent this year, and Zenith Electronics, which closed at $7 on Friday and is down 39.8 percent in 1995. **********But betting on bad performers is risky, even more so in a year when the January effect may or may not appear. A safer play may be small-stock mutual funds, like Fidelity Low-Priced Stock and Hancock Special Equities, two of the 18 best-rated such funds tracked by Morningstar, the fund research company. **********Investors can also consult their brokers about futures, options and other sophisticated ways to ride the January effect. But whatever the tactic, there will be much bated breath as 1996 rolls in. \"This is going to be a weird year,\"  Ms. Mott said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/04/business/business-travelexecutives-are-scouting-opportunities-in-cuba-these.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Finney", "pub_date": "1995-10-04", "snippet": "CUBA is a potentially profitable market that is not emerging, thanks to the American economic embargo.

Ratko Mladic, the military leader, charging them  with genocide in the days after the Serbs invaded the Muslim enclave of Srebrenica in July. The indictment details numerous instances in which Muslim captives, in small and large numbers, were summarily shot. **********Thousands of men executed and buried in mass graves, hundreds of men buried alive, men and women mutilated and slaughtered, children killed before their mothers' eyes, a grandfather forced to eat the liver of his own grandson,\" a judge for the tribunal wrote, citing prosecutorial evidence that led to the indictments. **********The indictment charged that the attack was authorized by Dr. Karadzic and carried out by forces under the command of General Mladic, who was seen at several sites of systematic mass killings. **********The two men have already been indicted for genocide and crimes against humanity in connection with the killing, shelling and deportation of Bosnian civilians. **********The prosecutor for the tribunal met with Administration officials in Washington today, pleading that they make the surrender of indicted suspects a condition of any accord. **********At the peace talks, President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, who is negotiating on behalf of the Bosnian Serbs, has refused to turn in the indicted  men, saying that while he would like the men out of the politicalpicture, they should be allowed to leave office eventually through the electoral process, an official connected to the talks said today. **********An official close to Mr. Milosevic said the Serbian President believes that such a gesture warrants removing all economic and diplomatic sanctions against his country in the event of a peace agreement. **********But the Bosnian Government today demanded in writing that the peace agreement require that the signers commit themselves to \"arrest, detain and transfer\" indicted individuals to the tribunal's custody, people close to its delegation said. **********The Bosnians have also asked that the final peace agreement include a threat  that any parties that do not cooperate would be subject to mandated United Nations sanctions. **********Alarmed by reports that the framework agreement might produce only a vague commitment from the parties to \"cooperate\" with the tribunal and might not force those indicted out of office immediately, the tribunal prosecutor, Judge Richard J. Goldstone, spent two days meeting with top officials from the White House, State Department, Pentagon and Central Intelligence Agency on that and other issues. **********But Judge Goldstone, a South African, acknowledged in interviews that he did  not receive a clear-cut assurance that the agreement would specifically require  warring parties to turn over indicted suspects. **********Judge Goldstone said he told Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and John Shattuck, the Assistant Secretary of State for human rights, in separate meetings today that any peace agreement that does not specifically require indicted war criminals to be turned over to the international court is unacceptable. **********\"I asked specifically that the peace agreement require strict compliance with the war crimes tribunal, and I specifically asked that it include the surrender of those indicted,\" Mr. Goldstone said. \"It would be unthinkable if it isn't. They said that is entirely in accordance with U.S. policy. But I got no firm commitment.\" **********If the peace agreement does not require Serbia to surrender Dr. Karadzic and  General Mladic, Mr. Goldstone said he feared that they could end up living as private citizens in a de facto safe haven in the Serbian capital of Belgrade. **********Referring to Richard C. Holbrooke, Mr. Goldstone said that he had the utmost  respect for the chief American negotiator, but that he would not embrace an agreement that traded justice for peace. **********\"While I understand the attitude of Richard Holbrooke might be, 'Look here, I'm not going to forgo peace and endanger the lives of tens of thousands more people of the former Yugoslavia,' if that's the choice, I don't accept it,\" Mr.  Goldstone said. **********The judge also said he told American officials that some sanctions should be  retained against Serbia, specificially restrictions on membership and participation in international organizations and lending insitutions, until Mr.  Milosevic surrenders the Bosnian Serb leaders he controls. **********But it is not at all certain that the so-called outer wall of sanctions will  remain if the Serbs make peace, and the American position is unclear. **********At the State Department briefing on Wednesday, a spokesman, Nicholas Burns said such sanctions will \"perhaps be extended beyond the implementation of a peace agreement,\" adding that although the United States believed it was important to keep sanctions, there might not be universal support to do so. **********During today's briefing, Mr. Burns took a tougher line, saying, \"The United States will support the maintenance of this so-called outer wall of the sanctions until we are fully satisfied that Serbia is cooperating with the war crimes tribunal on the indictments that have been handed down.\" **********The use of sanctions as a tool of the tribunal has become more important because of the decision by President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia earlier this week to promote a military officer indicted for war crimes. **********American negotiators and representatives of the four other countries involved in the peace talks -- France, Germany, Britain and Russia -- protested to Mr. Tudjman on Wednesday about the promotion of Gen.

But both Israeli and Palestinian officials insisted that the pullout would continue. **********The first incident began late Wednesday when Israeli soldiers tried to arrest a Palestinian in the village of Qabatiya, south of Jenin, a Palestinian city in the north of the West Bank that was turned over to Palestinian control this month. Qabatiya is in a Palestinian self-rule zone where Israel has overall responsibility for security. **********The man, Samir Zakarneh, was among several hundred prisoners freed by Israel  under the Palestinian-Israeli agreement signed in September, and the Israelis reportedly tried to arrest him because he was restricted to Jericho, which is also under Palestinian control. **********But Mr. Zakarneh, who was said to have been armed, took refuge in a cafe in Qabatiya, where residents surrounded him and refused to let the Israelis approach. As tensions rose there, members of a militant Palestinian organization known as the Black Panthers kidnapped two members of the Israeli paramilitary border police in Jenin. The Black Panthers are a wing of Fatah, the main group in the Palestine Liberation Organization. After negotiations through the night between Israeli and Palestinian officials, the two Israelis were released, and Mr. Zakarneh was allowed to surrender to the Palestinian authorities, who said they would take him back to Jericho. The Palestinian officials also said they had arrested the Black Panthers responsible for the kidnapping. The Israelis sealed off Jenin. **********Later in the evening, a military patrol accompanying a bus carrying Israeli settlers west of Jenin was fired on, and the Israeli radio said two Israeli soldiers had been slightly wounded. **********In Nablus, a Palestinian city 20 miles south of Jenin that is still under Israeli control, Palestinian demonstrators went into the streets in commemoration of the sixth anniversary of the killing of four Black Panther leaders by the Israelis, pelting Israeli patrols with stones. **********The Israelis opened fire in response, and 18 Palestinians were reported wounded, two seriously. The clashes lasted four hours. **********The clashes in Jenin and Nablus are certain to be used by critics of the peace agreements as evidence of the dangers to security posed by the Israeli withdrawals. Israeli forces were also active in southern Lebanon, with aircraft  attacking suspected guerrilla targets with rockets for the third day in a row in retaliation for rockets fired into northern Israel by guerrillas of the Party of God.

The papers were filed Oct. 23 in the United States Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., where the Hastings Group is incorporated. **********Either way, it could spell the end for most of the group's stores -- including the venerable Wallachs chain, which in the mid-1970's offered classes  in how to tie a scarf, and which at one time invited customers and passers-by alike to stop in and have loose buttons sewn on or missing buttons replaced at no cost. **********With annual sales of about $100 million, the Hastings Group -- including Hastings (USA) Inc. and West Belt Distributors -- estimated its assets at the time of the filing at approximately $34.6 million and liabilities at about $38.3 million. The liquidation sales, which include store equipment, fixtures and furniture, are intended to stem what Hastings described as \"losses that are occurring on a daily basis.\" **********In recent weeks, vendors have stopped shipments of merchandise.

Most of the suffering was caused by America's trend toward more casual attire, particularly  in the workplace, by widespread layoffs among white-collar workers, and by customers who were skittish about the economy and switched to department stores  or discount stores. Even when the economy improved, many former customers did not return to the specialty stores. **********The Hastings Group, based in Chicago, acquired the stores in August 1994 from the HSSA investment group, which had been operating under Chapter 11 proceedings for nine months.

[Page D12.] The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell to 6.02 percent, trading intraday below 6 percent, the first time in more than two years. [Page D20.] **********A year ago, when there were more bulls than bears among strategists at big Wall Street firms, Mr. Shulman was still not alone in his bearishness. But the others have since changed their opinions or lost their jobs, and he was the last of the holdouts. For a brokerage-house official, whose opinions are cited by brokers trying to make sales, it is painful to be both bearish and wrong because the brokers want to make trades. **********It is an old Wall Street adage that prices peak when the last bear gives up,  and then decline. Asked if he was concerned that he might be that last bear, and that the market was therefore likely to fall with him being cited as a determining factor, Mr. Shulman allowed that he had considered this. And he indicated in the title of his new report, \"1996: Stock Market Bubble or Paradigm Shift?\" that the alternate explanation for the market's rise remained what he formerly believed -- that it was in a bubble that would eventually burst. **********Even in turning bullish, Mr. Shulman remained more cautious than many of his  rivals, saying that his new valuation method created a fair-value range for the  Standard & Poor's 500 index of about 550 to 585. That is far above the range of  400-430 that he had been using, based on his old valuation methodology, but it is far below current levels. Yesterday, the index rose 6.70 points to close at 613.68, or 5 percent above the high end of the new range. **********Mr. Shulman forecast, though, that over the next year the index would trade between 540 and 640, and he recommended that balanced accounts raise their stock allocations from to 50 percent from 45 percent, with the bond allocation going to 35 percent from 30 percent. The cash allocation was slashed to 15 percent from 25 percent. **********At current prices, he said in an interview, \"I couldn't jump in with both feet, so I jumped in with one foot.\" **********Mr. Shulman said that this year's leap in stock prices -- the Dow industrials up 34 percent -- was evidence that investors were no longer worried about inflation, and were therefore willing to pay more for a dollar of future earnings. **********\"Inflation has been much more subdued than we ever expected, and profits have been much stronger, given the sluggishness of the economy,\" he wrote. \"Thus we are beginning to allow for the possibility that the valuation clocks we are using have been broken.\" **********He said the market's movement was reminiscent of 1958, when share prices surged as fears of an inevitable postwar depression were finally vanquished and  the dividend yield on stocks permanently fell below the yields on corporate bonds. **********And he recalled that in 1962, Benjamin Graham and David Dodd, two legendary market analysts known for their conservative approach, sharply raised their estimates of fair value for the Dow, citing investor confidence that the Government would hold off any depression. **********The next great shift in investor perceptions, Mr. Shulman wrote, came in 1974, when the reality of inflation depressed investors' views of proper valuations. \"Instead of depression, the new trauma for investors became inflation,\" he said, arguing that now that trauma had been vanquished. **********Mr. Shulman, far more than most analysts, has focused on dividends since he turned more negative on stocks at the end of August 1994, when the Dow was at 3,913 and the S.& P. 500, at 475. \"I was right for three months,\" he said yesterday, but then prices took off. **********The dividend yield on the S.& P. 500 -- the return you'd get from dividends if you bought all 500 issues -- had never before fallen below 2.65 percent without dire consequences. Now it is down to 2.3 percent. **********\"I paid a lot of attention to dividends and it has been leading me astray,\" Mr. Shulman said, adding that his revised methodology placed far more emphasis on interest rates, whose plunge this year has buoyed stock prices. **********As recently as September, Mr. Shulman had stuck to his bearish view, citing six factors that he said had been associated with market tops and were again present. They included a new wave of mergers and acquisitions, corporate executives as cultural heroes, money managers as cultural heroes, glorification  of equities in the mass media, academic articles that emphasize the long-run infallibility of equity investing, and a belief in the ability of new technologies to permanently change society. **********But now, while conceding all those things seemed to still be present, he has  concluded that he was probably wrong. Whereas he had been looking for a relatively strong economy, he now thinks that the greater risk is a weaker economy -- an outcome that he thinks would lower interest rates and lead to higher price-to-earnings ratios for many companies. **********His stock recommendations are concentrated in consumer cyclical companies, while avoiding most issues in basic industries."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/12/business/staff-cuts-at-sizzler.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-12-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 91, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Staff Cuts at Sizzler", "print_headline": "Staff Cuts at Sizzler", "body_text": " **********Sizzler International announced today that it was reducing its administrative staff by 30 percent, or 72 workers, in a revamping intended to save $5 million a year.

(Even when Grandpa thinks all Ike wants is a raise, his response is \"Shoot him.\") **********This is the setting of South Africa's newest sitcom, \"Suburban Bliss.\" **********By Episode Two, Ike is a partner and he and the Dwyers both buy new houses, each family lying about the fancy neighborhood it has moved to. To their horror, they turn out to be next-door neighbors. The plots, naturally, thicken. **********There are signs of change -- big and small -- all over South Africa, and \"Suburban Bliss\" is certainly one of them. After more than 40 years of having race divide them, record numbers of South Africans have been tuning in to have their racism pilloried -- no barb withheld, no stereotype unexplored -- as the Dwyers and the Malois have at each other. **********The show would have been unthinkable only a few years ago. But during its first week on the air, in October, it won the top slot in South Africa's equivalent of the Nielsen ratings. Since then it has hovered at No. 2. Whether it is truly funny or simply vulgar has been the subject of talk shows and the mainstay of cocktail parties lately as South Africans debate whether they are ready to laugh at themselves, a characteristic that has hardly been in evidence  until now. **********\"The show is extremely valuable, extremely necessary for us and a definite ground-breaker,\" said Barry Ronge, culture editor of The Star, the largest newspaper in Johannesburg. \"Finally we have a show that looks at race relations  in a South African context -- a reflection of our own reality, not an American one.\" **********Indeed, the dreams and strains of the new South Africa, which held its first  free elections only 19 months ago, are there in every twist and turn. In one episode, the two wives, ever competing, decide they must have maids. Ike's wife, Thando, the epitome of South Africa's new upwardly mobile blacks, revels in the  sound of being called \"Madam.\" Next door, Kobie, busy trying to prove she is not a racist, finds herself cooking breakfast of bacon and eggs for the maid and giving her a shorter and shorter workday. **********But the most vicious exchanges are between the older generation. In one scene, the grandfather of the Dwyer family introduces himself over the garden fence, assuming the elderly black women he sees is the maid in the household next door. He demands that she address him as \"baas,\" the Afrikaans equivalent of \"master.\" The woman, actually Ike's mother, doesn't bother to correct him. Instead, she brags about her huge salary, leaving the old man totally intimidated about keeping up in the new neighborhood. **********The creators of the show say they hope it will be as provocative and influential as \"All in the Family\" was for Americans in the 1970's. The principal writer is an American, Craig Gardner, who has lived in South Africa for 16 years and is married to an Afrikaner. Mr. Gardner, a former actor, has never written a sitcom before. **********\"My aim is to make South Africa stand back and laugh at how ludicrous they have been, and hopefully by doing this help dilute some of the racism,\" Mr. Gardner said. \"I think that is what Archie Bunker did. I would be delighted if we accomplish anything like that.\" **********The show does not have any of the polish of American sitcoms. But then South  African television does not remotely resemble television in the United States. It did not even exist until 1976, as it was considered to be a dangerous and corrupting influence. And it has always been in the control of the Government. Changes are on the horizon, but right now most households get only three channels. The most successful shows tend to be American imports. **********The creator of \"Suburban Bliss,\" Gray Hofmeyr, says he came up with the idea  when TV1, the channel that catered to whites under apartheid, asked him to create a show that would attract black viewers. The current hit is actually a remake of a show that he tried to create in 1986, but that failed miserably back then. **********Before going ahead, TV1 did some testing to see whether South Africans were indeed ready. The surveys indicated that most black South Africans and those of  English origin loved the idea. Afrikaners did not. But Afrikaners are a small minority and could be ignored, said Paul Kemp, who heads the English drama department for the TV1. So \"Suburban Bliss\" is shown only in English, without dubbing or subtitles for other languages. The station has ordered 104 episodes,  the largest advance order in its history, Mr. Kemp said. **********\"The wounds were too raw a few years ago,\" Mr. Hofmeyr said. \"Now, I think, people are ready for this. \""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/12/business/blue-chip-stocks-climb-with-dow-up-by-27.46.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-12-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 540, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Blue-Chip Stocks Climb, With Dow Up by 27.46", "print_headline": "Blue-Chip Stocks Climb, With Dow Up by 27.46", "body_text": " **********Blue-chip stocks ended higher yesterday, bolstered by a strong rally in oil stocks. **********The Dow Jones industrial average rose 27.46 points, to 5,184.32, recovering part of the ground lost in the two days since closing at a record 5,199.13 on Dec. 6.

Simpson trial, a judge here has thrown out an assault case and threatened editors of eight newspapers with contempt charges because of pretrial publicity. **********Judge Roger Sanders called newspaper coverage \"unfair, outrageous and oppressive\" in throwing out the case on Wednesday and said it had damaged the rights of the defendant, Geoffrey Knights, to a fair trial. Mr. Knights, a businessman who is often the subject of tabloid newspaper articles, was facing assault charges from an altercation with the driver of a cab carrying a soap opera star he has been dating for seven years. **********The collapse of the case at the pretrial-hearing stage shows how differently Britain grapples with the complicated free-press, fair-trial issue. Here, newspapers and broadcasters operate under strict rules that prohibit publishing  or offering details on the air that could influence a jury. Those who flout the  rules can receive fines that usually run to the tens of thousand of pounds. **********Juries are rarely sequestered to keep them away from news reports. Instead, the reports themselves are usually bare bones and contain none of the lurid details familiar to readers of American trial coverage -- although the tabloids  are known to engage in excesses in the course of the coverage of other events. **********Cameras are not permitted in British courtrooms, although one was allowed several months ago inside a courtroom in Scotland as an experiment. It was not widely seen as a success, and the fallout from the Simpson case now makes it doubly unlikely that the idea will spread. The Simpson case is widely seen here  as one in which justice went haywire, in part because of frenzied coverage. Still, broadcasts of the trial drew large audiences. **********As an example, a sensational trial opened on Tuesday in Winchester, that of Rosemary West.

Until the trial is finished, lawyers are not allowed to comment publicly. **********Restrictions on trial coverage were tightened by a new law in 1981, the Contempt of Court Act. Essentially it said that in bringing a case against editors or owners of news organizations, the Attorney General did not have to prove that they intended to create a substantial risk of serious prejudice to a  trial, merely that they did create it. **********\"I think that in both the United States and Britain the balance between free  speech and other public interest needs to be adjusted,\" said Lord Lester, who often argues before the European Court of Human Rights. \"In the U.S. it's slanted too much in favor of free speech against fair trial. In this country it's traditionally been too much in favor of fair trial and against free speech.\" **********The tabloids' fascination with Mr. Knights stems in part from his stormy relationship with Gillian Taylforth, who is a star in the soap opera \"Eastenders.\" Last year they lost a libel action against a tabloid that said they had performed a sex act in a parked car. **********Today Attorney General Nicholas Lyell said he was examining the case against  the eight newspapers, which printed headlines such as \"Knights Beats Me to a Pulp.\" He said he would contact the editors to hear their side and then decide whether or not to bring contempt charges."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/12/business/nationsbank-settles-customer-lawsuits.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-12-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 261, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Nationsbank Settles Customer Lawsuits", "print_headline": "Nationsbank Settles Customer Lawsuits", "body_text": " **********The Nationsbank Corporation has agreed to spend $30 million to settle class-action lawsuits from more than 18,000 customers who contended that they had been misled about the risks of buying two Nationsbank bond funds and lost $40 million to $50 million. **********The settlement covers the Nations Government Income term trusts 2003 and 2004.

Fuller Company of St. Paul, a leading manufacturer of industrial glues, coatings and paints. Awards, honors and inclusion in various socially conscious mutual funds attest to its standing as a good corporate citizen. **********But that reputation is being clouded by the company's handling of a stubborn  image-staining problem: the illegal abuse of its shoemaker's glue by homeless Central American children, who have become addicted to the product's intoxicating but dangerous fumes. **********Some child welfare advocates, led by Covenant House in New York City, have demanded for years that the company add a noxious oil to its glue to discourage  abusers. The company has resisted that approach -- possibly because it might reduce the glue's effectiveness, possibly because the smell would be irritating  to legitimate users. Fuller will say only that it is doing all it reasonably can to prevent abuse. **********Now this simmering dispute may boil over into something more serious for the  company's image, and for its shareholders. Lawyers will decide by the end of the year whether to press ahead with a wrongful-death suit against Fuller on behalf  of the family of a Guatemalan teen-ager who died in 1993. The legal team is also weighing the expansion of that suit into a class action, said one of the lawyers, Scott Hendler of Austin, Tex. By some estimates, tens of thousands of Central American children sniff some sort of glue. **********Officers of Covenant House's Latin American subsidiary are \"anxious that we go forward with this case,\" Mr. Hendler said, \"because they are absolutely convinced that Fuller's glue was responsible for the boy's death and that Fuller has been negligent in dealing with this problem.\" **********William Belknap, a Fuller spokesman, would not respond to specific questions  but provided a one-page statement. \"We are a law-abiding company with a long history of concern for product safety,\" it said. \"We make and sell only legitimate products for legitimate purposes.\" The statement also listed briefly  the steps the company has taken in recent years \"to reduce the likelihood\" of its glue being abused, including substituting a slightly less toxic formulation  and curbs on retail sales in Honduras and Guatemala. **********The Fuller experience provides a textbook example of the thorny moral equations that lie beyond the simple arithmetic of the bottom line. But few agree on what lessons it offers: Does it teach that those who pursue the \"good citizen\" label too aggressively leave themselves vulnerable to attack? Or does it simply underscore how important it is for a corporate citizen to live up to its self-created image? **********And Fuller does repeatedly present itself as a good citizen. Year after year  it sprinkles its annual reports with statements proclaiming that it has a commendable corporate conscience. In 1992, for instance, its \"mission statement\" said the company \"will conduct business legally and ethically, support the activities of its employees in their communities and be a responsible corporate  citizen.\" In material sent to shareholders, it chose as one benchmark for its overall performance an index of socially responsible companies, thus underscoring that that is a peer group it considers important. And it has endowed a chair in business ethics at the University of Minnesota. **********Fuller, of course, is not the only company to be accused of not living up to  its own good-citizen image. In September 1994, the Body Shop International P.L.C., the cosmetics retailer whose advertisements stress a commitment to natural products, high environmental standards and philanthropy, was accused of  exaggerating its adherence to those principles. And the founders of Ben and Jerry's Homemade Inc. have been tweaked frequently for preaching corporate democracy while practicing a more autocratic management style. **********Nor is glue-sniffing a new issue for the makers of solvent-based adhesives. The Testor Corporation added a noxious ingredient to discourage abuse of its hobby glue in July 1969. And Henkel, a German chemical company that competes with Fuller, stopped making certain toxic glues in Central America last year. **********But Fuller, which dominates the Central American market with its Resistol brand of glue, seems to have been singled out for more than its share of recent  criticism, one industry consultant said. For four years, protesters have demonstrated outside Fuller's annual meetings, often in Minnesota's cold and rain. And some have bought Fuller shares and tried to get their complaints on the record at those meetings. **********\"If they had a lesser reputation they would be less of a target,\" said William Broxterman, president of Chemquest Group, a consulting firm in Cincinnati. **********Timothy Smith, executive director of the Interfaith Center for Corporate Responsibility, which coordinates the work of 275 religious investors with about $50 billion in assets, agreed that a high profile in the corporate citizenship arena can invite attack. \"But as I see it, the hazard is not in acting in a socially responsible way,\" he said. \"The hazard is in over-marketing yourself as a saint.\" **********Whatever the lesson one draws, however, the Fuller case should be required reading for corporate directors, said Lawrence Bear, a New York University professor and co-author of the textbook \"Free Markets, Finance, Ethics, and Law.\" As Professor Bear sees it, \"the question of how directors ought to act in  circumstances like this is a terribly serious one, because when it gets out of hand, it gets into court.\" **********Even if Fuller loses the wrongful-death suit, it would be unlikely to affect, in any meaningful way, the bottom line of a company with more than $30 million in profits on $1 billion in revenues. But if it is expanded to a class action, the impact is more difficult to predict, since that step would make the case more difficult for the plaintiffs and more potentially damaging for the company. **********The litigation will also be an important test for Fuller's reputation not only at home but in Latin America. In 1994, fully 27 percent of its operating profits of $66 million came from Latin American operations. **********The company -- no relation to Fuller Brush -- has deep roots. Founded in 1887 by Harvey Benjamin Fuller as a one-man wallpaper-paste shop, it now has operations worldwide. Its glues -- in more than 10,000 varieties -- hold together everything from cars to cigarettes to disposable diapers. The company was run for years by Elmer L. Andersen, a former Minnesota Governor, whose son Anthony L. is now chairman. **********HOW did the Fuller dispute become so bitter? Most participants agree that the answer lies in the events of the summer of 1992, when Fuller's board adopted a resolution that seemed to be a victory for the company's critics. **********For years, the directors had been under pressure by a loose alliance of child advocacy groups concerned about the hazards of glue-sniffing among the homeless  children of Central America. Those young glue-sniffers are widely called \"resistoleros\" -- for Fuller's Resistol -- regardless of which brand they actually abuse. As that summer began, a national television news magazine was preparing to feature Fuller's product as part of the glue-sniffing problem. **********Then, on July 16, 1992, the board abruptly but unanimously voted to stop selling Resistol adhesives in Central America. As the company explained in its 1992 annual report: \"Faced with the realizations that a suitable replacement product would not be available in the near future and that the illegitimate distribution was continuing, the Board of Directors decided that our Central American operations should stop selling those solvent-based Resistol adhesives that were commonly being abused by children.\" **********Local newspapers quoted Mr. Belknap as saying that until an alternative was found, \"we simply don't believe it is the right decision to keep our solvent product on the market.\" **********Mary Swenson, a member of the informal Coalition on Resistoleros in St. Paul, said her group was \"ecstatic.\" \"We had a party,\" she recalled. \"We had champagne.\" **********But jubilation soon turned to anger. By October 1992, the advocates had learned that Fuller had not stopped selling Resistol in Central America -- and did not intend to. It no longer sold the glue to retailers and small-scale users in Honduras and Guatemala, but it did sell large tubs and barrels of it to industrial customers in those countries, and to a broader list of commercial and industrial users in neighboring countries. **********According to the company's statement, it has since taken other steps to address the abuse. It has changed the product's formula, dropping the sweet-smelling but highly toxic solvent toluene and substituting the slightly less toxic chemical cyclohexane. It has tried to develop a water-based glue, which is not intoxicating. It has studied the issue \"thoroughly and carefully\" and has contributed to community programs for homeless children in Central America. **********But those who expected Resistol sales in Central America to stop in 1992 describe those steps as mere image-polishing. Bruce Harris, the director of Latin American programs for Covenant House, asserts that Resistol is still readily available to children in Nicaragua and El Salvador and, to a lesser degree, in Costa Rica. \"If they are genuinely concerned about the children,\" he  asked, \"why haven't they pulled out of all the countries -- as their board mandated?\" **********Mr. Harris is not alone in wondering about the gap between the board resolution of 1992 and the company's subsequent action. Indeed, among experts in business ethics, that remains the biggest mystery. **********\"They shot themselves in the foot,\" said Mr. Smith of the Interfaith Center for Corporate Responsibility, who nevertheless gives Fuller high marks for corporate conduct. The company has been praised for a high level of corporate philanthropy, including giving 5 percent of its profits to charity in each country where it operates. Moreover, the company has committed itself to safe environmental practices worldwide -- practices \"often more stringent than local  government standards,\" Fuller said in an S.E.C. filing last year.    ALICE TEPPER MARLIN, executive director of the Council on Economic Priorities, a leading advocate for socially responsible corporate conduct, agreed that that the 1992 episode damaged Fuller's credibility. \"If a company seems to go back on its commitments, they have sowed such distrust that it makes it very difficult to proceed,\" she said. \"And that is the board's responsibility.\" **********Mr. Belknap, the Fuller spokesman, said none of the company's directors would comment about their handling of the issue, which he said has not been the subject of any other board resolution since the July 1992 action. \"I'd have to say that the position statement I provided you with is consistent with the thinking of our board,\" he said. \"I can't really go beyond that.\" **********Whatever happens with the threatened litigation, the dispute has certainly tarnished the company's once-pristine reputation as a good citizen. The attacks  are coming on several fronts, including accusations that its paints made and sold abroad exceed United States limits on lead and a quarrel over the company's role as a big supplier of glue to the tobacco industry. **********According to Mr. Harris and Ms. Swenson, paints purchased from hardware stores throughout Central America were tested in a St. Paul laboratory. The test results, which were provided to The New York Times, show high levels of lead in many, of the samples, including some but not all that are identified by  the group as being Fuller products. Even though selling such paint is legal in Central America, critics point out that high lead levels are a known hazard, especially to children. **********Asked about the group's accusation, Mr. Belknap said, \"We have publicly stated at our annual meeting that all of our products are within the U.S. standards for lead in paint.\" He would not respond to questions about whether Fuller's Central American paints have always conformed with United States lead standards, and if not, when the formula was adjusted. **********Given this history of mutual mistrust and frustration, it is not surprising that the Fuller dispute ultimately wound up in lawyers' hands. On Jan. 3, 1995,  Mr. Hendler and a co-counsel, Michael Brickman of Charleston, S.C., filed their  wrongful-death claim against Fuller in state court in Dallas. **********The case was filed in Texas to stop the clock until Mr. Hendler could determine that the statute of limitations for such cases was three years in Minnesota, his preferred venue because he wants to take the case right to Fuller's home town. He then obtained court permission to withdraw the case in Texas, but must refile it in Minnesota before the first week in January. **********A class action against Fuller is \"something that is under consideration,\" Mr. Hendler said, adding, \"We are still evaluating certain factors, such as how much of their product was out there, how many children are affected, and the extent of the impairment caused in the children who use the glue chronically -- that's  the most significant factor.\" **********But, according to Mr. Smith of the Interfaith Center, Fuller's board may soon face another test in the treacherous world of corporate citizenship, regardless  of what Mr. Hendler decides about his lawsuit. \"Fuller is a major seller of adhesives to the tobacco industry,\" Mr. Smith noted. \"They are selling glues that go into a lethal product.

What else can we reflect?\" He paused, then said, \"Why should we struggle with ourselves?\" **********His question was reflected in the results of the Russian parliamentary elections this month. Nostalgia was at least partly responsible for the Communists' first-place finish.  And nostalgia -- some call it amnesia -- might  help a Communist or nationalist get elected President next June. **********As young entertainment moguls like Mr. Parfyonov try to cash in on the trend  sweeping Russian popular culture, they are also dancing around the edges of a political revival that could nip their brash, breezy capitalism in the bud. **********\"It became absolutely clear the week after the election that there is a common mood among the people,\" said Anatoly Smelyansky, director of the Moscow Arts Theater. \"People are longing for the lost paradise -- the lost Communist paradise.\" **********The infatuation with Western culture and democracy that gripped Russia after  the collapse of Communism and the Soviet state in 1991 has long worn off. Russians are increasingly looking inward, sifting through their Soviet past in search of a palatable identity. **********And Communism, once again, is selling. Not the orthodox party line that once  tethered Russian life, but some of the order and economic certainty of Soviet power. There are those who regret the loss of empire, but most are caught up in  remembrances of a shared past that included simple childhood pleasures along with mass suffering, and one that looks better and better as it recedes. **********Particularly at New Year's, nostalgia is as unmistakable among established artists, entrepreneurs and entertainment figures as it is among the tens of millions of poor, mostly older Russians who voted for the Communists this month. **********There is one difference, however. **********The new intelligentsia of Moscow and St. Petersburg, and particularly the raffish young professionals who attend Come-as-You-Were parties, watch campy old Stalinist movies, dance to Soviet-era hits in expensive nightclubs, collect Revolutionary poster art and shop at chic Soviet thrift shops, do so with ironical detachment, certain that whatever happens, the Soviet system will never return -- that it is safe to look back not in anger, but with wry affection. **********The angry, impoverished Russians who speak mistily of the days of subsidized  meat, free rent and a guaranteed income say they are voting for pensions and a strong social safety net and not the Communist repression of the Soviet state. But they are not averse to the kind of strict Government control that could put  irreverent young capitalists like Mr. Parfyonov, who works at the independent network NTV, out of the free enterprise business. **********Mr. Smelyansky described the current nostalgia as a kind of backlash, a revolt against the abrupt break with the past that occurred in the initial euphoria of 1991. **********\"This is not Eastern Europe,\" he said. \"Communism here was more organic. After 75 years, it leaked into the genetic pool. It was the everyday life of millions, and they wanted to be recognized and respected.\" **********Those Russians take their nostalgia like vodka -- neat, undiluted by irony or self-mockery. **********Yet the happy few who have prospered under Russia's rocky transformation to capitalism believe they will continue to do so, whatever government comes to power next. **********\"I don't believe radical Communists will ever get into office,\" said Vladimir Pelsh, 28, the host of a hot new television game show, \"Name the Tune,\" which features Russian and Soviet golden oldies and has ridden the nostalgia wave to become the second-highest rated show in the country. \"But if they do, I'll survive anyway,\" he said with a grin. \"I'll just do a show called 'Name the Red  Tune.' \" **********The revival of Soviet kitsch can also be found outside Moscow. At the Kirov Park in St. Petersburg, park managers plan a new attraction, Retropark, a $100 million Soviet theme park expected to open next summer as a kind of Leninland. **********After paying a hefty admittance fee, as yet undetermined, visitors will be issued kopeks minted before 1961 to work the antique slot machines and soda-water fountains. They will roam around flowerbeds arranged in the shape of  Soviet symbols beneath Communist-era banners and dance as 1940's bandstand orchestras play the old songs. **********Young park attendants will be dressed as Soviet Pioneers. Policemen will wear the white uniforms they wore under Stalin. **********One of the most successful FM radio stations in Moscow is Rossiskaya Radio (Russian Radio), which in the last five months has become one of the top five stations by playing only Russian music -- mainly pop tunes of the Brezhnev era. **********\"The audience is fed up with Western music,\" said Aleksandr Bunin, the station manager. \"Fifteen-year-olds call in to request songs that were hits in the 1970's and 1980's.\" **********Among intellectuals and artists, there is a strong urge to isolate the esthetics of the Soviet era from its politics. **********\"Those Communist demonstrations across Red Square were very beautiful,\" said  Yelena Yazykova, the art director of a chic art gallery-thrift shop, Roza Azora. \"I remember the balloons, the smell of candy, the big dinners afterwards around  the kitchen table.\" **********\"The important thing is that it is the past, that now life is normal, and that we don't have to be afraid of our history -- we can remember it with humor  and sympathy.\" **********On Nov. 7, the anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, Mrs. Yazykova gave a tongue-in-cheek Soviet costume party at her gallery a fashionable section of Moscow. **********The theme was the 1917 Revolution, and fashionable actors, artists, writers and television personalities shed their Armani jackets and Versace ties to dress up as Soviet Pioneers, party apparatchiks in wide ties and bulky suits, and aproned workers decorated with the Order of Lenin. A retired professor of political economics at Moscow State University delivered a mock Marxist-Leninist lecture, to giddy laughter and applause. **********Mrs. Yazykova explained that she and her guests feel nostalgia for the sounds, sights and smells of their youth, not the politics. But the election results this month, she admitted, were troubling. \"I think it is impossible to be a little bit Communist,\" she said uneasily. **********At ORT, the once state-owned network that was partly privatized last year, giving the Government 51 percent and 49 percent to a consortium of banks and major businesses, there is no complacency about the future. Communists and nationalists are intent on passing legislation to renationalize ORT. **********\"This nostalgia movement is not just a passing fad, it is complicated and important,\" said Aleksei Pushkov, the network spokesman. \"It's an image of the Soviet Union based on memory, and also on the old glossy propaganda, and it's an image that the Communists are playing on now.\" **********ORT did not hesitate to broadcast the New Year's Eve special based on old, beloved propaganda movies.  \"ORT is not interested in boosting this nostalgia, but we cannot be immune to it,\" Mr. Pushkov said. \"We are a commercial enterprise now and we have to take into account what is commercial in this country.\" **********The rival, privately owned network, NTV, is also trying to feed viewers' nostalgia. NTV's New Year's special is a tribute to Soviet Pioneer childhood, with famous performers singing old Soviet children's classics. **********The network's top executives will also appear on the air, wearing red Pioneer scarves around their necks. Even Yevgeny Kiselyov, the urbane, high-minded host  of the respected weekly news program \"Itogi,\" is expected to wear the red scarf, the emblem of Communist Youth. **********Those who can afford it plan to revel in their Soviet past in adopted capitalist comfort. **********\"On New Year's Eve, we'll sit in front of a Sony TV, drinking Absolut vodka as we watch Russian films and sing Russian songs,\" Mr. Parfyonov said with a wicked smile. \"Of course, the film is a remake shot in 35-millimeter Kodak film  and cost millions of American dollars. We're nostalgic, but we're not crazy.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/20/business/2-of-brazil-s-big-banks-combine-operations.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-11-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 128, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "2 of Brazil's Big Banks Combine Operations", "print_headline": "2 of Brazil's Big Banks Combine Operations", "body_text": " **********Brazil's central bank said this weekend that Banco Nacional had been taken over by Unibanco, ending speculation about a possible merger and creating one of the country's largest privately owned banks.

They come to kill us with  work.\" **********Then she paused, reflecting. \"But we have to recognize that they're important for Juarez.\" **********During the last 25 years, 310 mostly foreign-owned assembly plants, called maquiladoras, have set up operations to take advantage of cheap labor and special tax breaks. They have come to dominate life in this sand-blown city across the Rio Grande from El Paso. Like Ms. Serratos, six of her siblings work  in maquiladoras, and there are thousands of other families also marching to the  daily rhythm of the assembly plants, which employ more than 150,000 of Juarez's  1.2 million residents. **********The city is growing fast, and Juarez's 40-year-old Mayor, Ramon Galindo, who  belongs to the pro-business National Action Party, says he hopes to attract still more maquiladoras to Juarez. But in an interview in his City Hall offices  he also said the fact that a vast majority of taxpayers earn the minimum wage of about $18 a week or not much more is a critical problem for the city. **********\"We're creating an enormous mass of wretchedly poor people,\" he said. **********Mexico's minimum wage, which varies from region to region, is to increase by  10 percent on Dec. 4, bringing Juarez's minimum up to about $20 a week. The increase comes after a 30 percent decline in Mexican wages this year. **********Because most Juarez residents have little to give, and the maquiladoras are required to give little, the city raises only meager tax revenues, Mr. Galindo said. And to make matters worse, the federal Government keeps 90 percent of the  minimal taxes the maquiladoras pay to Mexico City. **********\"Our problem is, where is the money going to come from to provide services for all these people?\" Mr. Galindo asked. **********Juarez's entire 1995 budget was just $37 million, said Jesus Abrego Lopez, Juarez's economic development director. Even if the city were not to grow at all and were to spend its entire budget for 15 years on paving projects, many streets would still be unsurfaced in 2010, Mr. Abrego said. **********Other huge challenges confront the city. Juarez's working-class sections, where many residents already must buy their drinking water by the jug from tank  trucks, now sprawl across the desert horizon, and the water is running out. **********\"We need huge investments to dig deeper wells, but the city doesn't have the  money,\" said Vicente Jaime, managing editor of the newspaper Norte. **********Along a potholed track off the main highway near the Juarez airport, five young men, all maquiladora employees, were repairing a car. Their wages, they said, ranged from 68 cents an hour, which Gerardo Hernandez earns for punching holes in electric motor covers, to the $1.06 an hour Ivan Villanueva makes as a  maintenance mechanic in a seat-cover factory. Theirs were good jobs, they said.  And what is attractive about Juarez, they said, is that there are plenty more available. **********\"If you don't like one job, you can walk down the street and get another,\" said Ruben Hernandez, Gerardo's brother. **********Cesar de la Rosa, 26, a foreman in an appliance repair plant, listed the benefits of maquiladora employment: workers qualify for membership in Mexico's social security system, which provides low-cost medical care, and another Government agency extends accessible home loans. Mr. de la Rosa said he also gets five days of vacation each year, with his full $37-a-week salary paid. **********Two miles away in another working-class enclave, seven of the Serratos siblings were listening from the edges of their father's cramped living room as  Ana talked about life in the maquiladoras.

The rout, coming after Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's nine years in office and nine more  months by another Progressive Conservative, Kim Campbell, was the most punishing blow to a governing party in Canadian history. **********Mr. Charest (pronounced sha-RAY) used to be Deputy Prime Minister, entitled to one of the most impressive offices on Parliament Hill. Now, political satirists do routines in which his office is a remote broom closet.

Spindler, chief executive of Apple Computer Inc., a day after his top lieutenant resigned and the board gave Mr. Spindler what was widely perceived as merely a pro forma vote of confidence. **********In an interview at Apple's headquarters here, Mr. Spindler conceded that the  company had made mistakes -- but not fatal ones -- and that it would continue to be profitable, only more so. And discounting reports that Apple, the nation's third-largest maker of personal computers, has been seeking a merger partner, he implied that the company intended to remain independent -- even if in a scaled-down version. **********After hitting production snags and underestimating demand for its Power PC line of Macintosh desktop and laptop computers, Mr. Spindler said, the company is on the upturn and ready to make up lost ground in an industry that has seen explosive growth in the last year, especially in the consumer market. Because its hardware and software designs do not conform to the industry standards, Apple feels the effect of production shortfalls more severely than other computer makers. It has been working on a product transition to a new processor chip, the Power PC, that it jointly designed with Motorola Inc. and I.B.M. Apple began the transition a year ago, but customers have rushed to adopt it more rapidly than the company had anticipated, with unfilled orders reaching  a staggering $1 billion in June. **********Apple's fourth quarter, which ended on Sept. 30, was especially trying, as the company scrambled to finish converting its entire product line to the Power  PC. In mid-September, the company said its earnings for the quarter, which some  analysts had forecast at $1.03 a share, would be much lower. **********\"This has been the most difficult quarter in the history of Apple Computer,\"  Mr. Spindler said today in an interview in a conference room down the hall from  his office. \"With all the media attention the stress is very high,\" he said. \"I've been around the block a couple of times, but there are days when I have trouble looking in the mirror. But if we fundamentally believe in Apple, then focus, focus, focus will eventually pay off and we have to communicate that.\" Mr. Spindler drew an analogy to the San Francisco 49ers, the champions of the National Football League. \"They lose one game and they're calling for the coach's head,\" he said. **********Mr. Spindler, who offered a well-publicized critique of his industry peers last year -- \"too many visionaries\" -- said he saw no reason to change Apple's basic business strategy. That plan is to shift Apple from a \"product oriented\" company, competing head-to-head with Compaq Computer, International Business Machines and other computer makers, to a \"market oriented\" company that specializes in areas like education and publishing, as well as home PC's. **********Helping create the air of crisis at Apple was what some analysts called an insurrection by Apple's chief financial officer, Joseph A. Graziano, who resigned on Tuesday after Apple's board, led by the chairman, A. C. (Mike) Markkula Jr., reaffirmed its support for Mr. Spindler. Mr. Graziano was reported to have been campaigning for Apple to find a buyer, arguing that the company could no longer survive independently in an industry that many see as increasingly monolithic, under the dominance of the chip leader, the Intel Corporation, and the software leader, the Microsoft Corporation. In personal computer sales, Apple's market share has lately declined to less than 8 percent. Mr. Graziano has been unavailable for comment, and Mr. Spindler was not willing  today to address the uprising directly, although he did hint that new alliances  might be in Apple's future. I.B.M., which has several alliances with Apple, has  frequently been mentioned as a potential partner. \"What's going on right now with I.B.M. is a continuation of our technical relationship,\" Mr. Spindler said. Many industry executives say I.B.M. should have moved more quickly to adopt Apple's Macintosh software for the alliance to  prove strong, but it has not, for corporate reasons. \"Why don't you ask them why they haven't adopted Macintosh software?\" he said. Talks on alliances continue with I.B.M. and other companies rumored to be possible Apple suitors, he acknowledged, but no decisions have been made. \"The big question is, how will we stand together,\" he said. The issue is facing  Apple and other companies that are trying to slow the Intel-Microsoft axis, including Sun Microsystems, the work-station maker, and the Oracle Corporation,  the software company. Declining to discuss specifics, Mr. Spindler hinted that Apple might be forced to sell part of its business in order to focus on areas in which it is best positioned to compete. \"There are crucial decisions that are going to have to be made about letting go of some parts of a business that are quite unnerving to some people, including ourselves,\" Mr. Spindler said. **********Critics of Apple contend that its failure to correctly forecast demand can be traced in part to its planning process, in which Apple sales executives have incentives to keep sales projections artificially low so it is easier to exceed  targets and receive annual bonuses. But Mr. Spindler disputed this analysis, calling it simplistic. **********In his view, Apple failed to anticipate two important industry trends. One was the explosion of the home computer market in the fall of 1994, when consumer specialists like Packard Bell Electronics were able to gain market share with low-priced machines. When Apple raced to catch up, it found that suppliers of its key hardware components required six-month lead times to expand production to adequate levels. The other failure, he said, was Apple's slowness to upgrade its line of popular  Powerbook portable computers, which were seen for several years as exemplars of  innovation, but which were eventually surpassed by various brands of Intel-chip  portables with superior screens, better power supplies and other embellishments. But Mr. Spindler said he believed that both strategic errors had been addressed  in the Power PC transition from which Apple is now emerging. **********To be sure, many computer industry analysts say Mr. Spinder has not received  enough credit for the company's deft handling of important facets of its technology transition. Such migrations can be risky, but customers who made the  switch from Apple's former Motorola 68000 chips to the Power PC found that their old software ran just as fast on the new machines, and that new software designed specifically for the new chips could substantially outperform comparable software on Intel-based equipment. **********Mr. Spindler said Apple was not yet willing to give up on two new businesses  started by his predecessor, John Sculley. Apple has given up looking for partners on its eWorld on-line service, a laggard in the market, but the company has no plans to kill the service, he said. Instead, Apple is repositioning eWorld to serve as the platform for the company's Internet offerings. Nor is Apple ready to give up on the hand-held Newton personal digital assistant, although Mr. Spindler said the company was seeking partners to share  development work on future generations of the product, which has generated more  ridicule than sales in its two years on the market. **********For Mr. Spindler, two criticisms may be the toughest to shake. Some in the industry say that he guards his power too closely and that the company's view of the changing industry landscape is too narrow. Mr. Graziano's departure on Tuesday follows the resignation last year of the previous No. 2 executive, Ian W. Diery. **********But Mr. Spindler rejected the notion that he was intentionally leaving a power vacuum below him in the Apple organization. \"I'm flabbergasted by those comments,\" he said of his industry critics. \"I'm working very hard to distribute power inside Apple.\" **********He conceded that he had not yet decided whether to proceed with a management  model he has contemplated -- an office of the president, in which top duties would be shared by several key executives. Part of his reluctance apparently stems from the inevitable line-of-succession handicapping that would ensue. **********\"People will say, 'So he's picked his heir!' but that's irrelevant,\" Mr. Spindler said. \"What I'm trying to build is a corporation that is substantial, and which can win in this marketplace.\" **********And he figures he deserves at least another quarter to show he can do it."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/28/business/company-news-ibm-plans-to-create-internet-software-unit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-11-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 107, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;I.B.M.

He said the negotiators \"will meet as long as they see fit\" over the next few days. **********As a biting winter wind chilled the eastern fork of the Wye River, the negotiators began talking over lunch at the River House of the Wye Conference Center, 70 miles east of Washington, reopening a mutually suspicious dialogue that collapsed six months ago. **********The deliberate informality -- choreo-graphed by the American hosts -- extended to a crackling wood fire and bowls of hard candy placed within reach of all 10 participants at a round mahagony table.

The Syrian side was represented by Walid al-Moualem, Syria's Ambassador to Washington, and two officials from the Foreign Ministry. **********The American presence was equally low key. Dennis B.

But Syria exerts such influence  over its weaker western neighbor that Beirut is expected to fall into line with  whatever Damascus decides. Prime Minister Peres said earlier this month that the new talks would also have a Lebanon component. **********Mr. Peres said earlier this month that the new talks, which are closed to the press, \"will be flexible, not rigid -- open.\" **********\"Each side will be able to bring up anything they want,\" he said. **********But the talks are bound to involve the future of the Golan Heights, a barren  mountain plateau between the two countries that Israeli troops seized in the 1967 Mideast war. **********Until now, Syria has demanded return of the entire plateau as a condition for peace. Israel has been unwilling to relinquish such strategic terrain, which overlooks its heartland and forms the watershed that supplies nearly a third of  Israel's fresh water. **********As a result, Israel has insisted that the extent to which it gives back the Golan Heights depends on the extent to which Syria cooperates in a genuine peace.

To take the same approach with your portfolio, you would strip away the most volatile investments -- like  technology-laden mutual funds -- that would probably plummet in a market downturn. **********What you would replace them with, however, is not so obvious. **********It's easy to buy a low-risk fund,\" said Thurman L. Smith, editor of Equity  Fund Outlook, a newsletter published in Boston. \"But that's not the ultimate goal of an investor. You have to make some money.\" **********Though most low-risk stock funds have generated very low returns, at least a  handful have managed to keep pace with the stock market the last 10 years. These funds are intended for the long run, not to dazzle in a roaring bull market. Most are in the growth and income and equity income categories, meaning they have steady income from dividends or other sources to cushion them should stock  prices fall. Often adhering to a value style of investing, they are what Mr. Smith called \"good choices if you are in a defensive mood.\" **********And who isn't feeling a little defensive, what with the Dow Jones industrial  average toying with new highs last week and with pundits noting how long it has  been since the last market correction (the last time the Dow industrials fell 10 percent was in 1990). **********Among the 340 diversified equity funds with 10-year records tracked by Morningstar Inc., the fund analyst in Chicago, 7 funds in the lowest 10 percent in risk have produced average returns of at least 14 percent a year -- roughly even with broad market gauges. **********There are many measures of risk. For this purpose, the proprietary scale from Morningstar was used. On its scale, the average for equity funds is 1.0, and to  find the 10 percent of funds with the lowest risk, Morningstar searched for funds with a risk measure of 0.7 or less. The seven funds have fallen 30 percent less than the average equity fund in down months over the last 10 years. **********MUTUAL SERIES Run from the Short Hills, N.J., headquarters of the investor Michael Price, the Mutual Series funds are perennial favorites of value investors. Three of the family's funds, Mutual Beacon, Mutual Qualified and Mutual Shares, made the low-risk, solid-performance list. **********Bill Mahoney, an investment adviser at the Rise Company in Oxford, Mass., said, \"What I love about Price's funds right now is that they're really low in technology, so when the 20 percent correction hits, these funds shouldn't be hurt as much as other funds.\" **********Each of the three funds has produced average total returns of more than 15 percent in the last decade, and none have a 10-year Morningstar risk measure over 0.55. That means they have roughly half the risk of the average diversified equity fund. **********The Mutual Series funds are virtual clones of each other, investing primarily in midsize companies. Mr. Price's strategy is to buy cheap and hold. He favors corporations on the mend from failures and in the process of reorganizing, often buying huge stakes in such companies, like Sunbeam-Oster, and taking an active role on their boards. It was Mr. Price who stampeded Chase Manhattan Bank into a merger with Chemical Bank earlier this year, by taking a big stake in Chase and  publicly hounding its management to strengthen the stock price. **********T. ROWE PRICE EQUITY-INCOME \"I love this fund,\" said Clint Willis, editor of the Independent T. Rowe Price Adviser, a monthly newsletter. \"You have two forms of  protection on the downside: They buy really cheap stuff, and you've also got above-average income.\" **********Since 1993, the fund has been managed solely by Brian Rogers. Before that, Tom Broadus was co-manager. They share a zeal for value, buying large company stocks when out of favor and holding on. Among the top holdings are stocks once  or continually despised: Philip Morris, Exxon, Upjohn, Mellon Bank. Turnover was a scant 27 percent last year, and a minuscule 4 percent in the last bear market, in 1990. **********\"Sometimes they are early in their calls,\" Mr. Willis said, \"but, judging from their record, not too early too often.\" **********The fund's performance record is third best on the low-risk list, with annual average returns of 15.36 percent over 10 years. The Morningstar risk measure is  0.60, meaning that, in market downturns, this equity income fund has fallen 40 percent less than the average equity fund. Meanwhile, the fund is yielding 3.2 percent, significantly more than the Standard & Poor's 500 index. **********PUTNAM GROWTH AND INCOME Managed since 1993 by Anthony Kreisel and David King, the Putnam fund has attributes of both the value and the growth styles of investing. Once or often-controversial names like Philip Morris, Eastman Kodak and Exxon abound in its portfolio, but it also has industrial stocks like General Motors and utilities like US West and Nynex, stocks that tend to rise and fall with the economy. **********Having gained an average of 14.86 percent a year over the last decade, the Putnam fund is ahead about 29 percent this year. Its managers called the big bond rally of 1995, at one point holding 6 percent of assets in Government bonds, then taking profits. The portfolio is about 90 percent invested in the S.& P. 500. Pat Regnier, a Morningstar analyst, called it \"a good choice for investors who don't want to venture much beyond the S.& P. 500, but who can't quite bring themselves to index.\" With a Morningstar risk measure of 0.55, the Putnam fund is much less volatile than the S.& P. index. **********SCUDDER GROWTH AND INCOME Howard Stein, the longtime boss at Scudder, has been bearish since 1980, and most Scudder equity funds have been dismal performers as a result. This one, however, has a 10-year performance record of 14.28 percent a year and only 70 percent of the risk of the average equity fund. **********Robert Hoffman, who has led a team of managers on the fund since 1991, produced a 2.6 percent gain last year, when most stock funds posted declines. Part of the fund's success is a yield consistently one percentage point higher than the group average, gleaned both from high-yielding common stocks and from convertible securities, which may account for 20 percent of assets. **********The manager's investing style is a blend of growth and value. The biggest holding in the $2.49 billion fund recently was Eli Lilly, which the fund bought  amid the health-care gloom of 1993 and watched rise in value. **********MAP-EQUITY This little-known fund, with a mere $53.5 million of assets, has badly trailed the market in 1995. But as a tortoise, it hasn't lost the most important race, producing 14.27 percent average gains for investors since 1987. **********The fund's management at Markston Investment Management in Newark has been in place since the mid-1980's, and it marches to its own drummer. While the average equity fund recently had 41 percent of assets devoted to just three sectors -- technology, finance and health care -- MAP-Equity had only 16 percent in those areas. For that reason, performance has been far behind the market this year, but the managers, who keep turnover low, are not budging. **********The iconoclastic portfolio looks like one chosen by committee: Rite Aid, Panhandle Eastern, McDonald's and Gillette. Large-cap stocks are leavened with enough small-cap and mid-cap issues to produce a blend in terms of stock size and investing style. The managers -- John Stone, Michael Mullarky and Roger Lob  -- look for strong management, product and market-share dominance and a low stock price. The combination has produced very consistent returns and a Morningstar risk rating of 0.68. **********Aside from the well-known Price offerings, few of the seven low-risk funds find their way into financial advisers' model portfolios. Mr. Willis, for example, favors T. Rowe Price Blue-Chip over its equity-income fund, because of  higher returns. **********The funds are not necessarily bear-market funds either. \"The Mutual Series funds had terrible results in 1990,\" the year of the last bear market, said Amy  Arnott, senior editor of the Morningstar Mutual Funds newsletter. Contrarian funds with large stashes of cash hold up the best in bear markets, but they cannot match these funds in long-term results. **********Nor do these funds fit everybody's definition of low risk. Colette Coffman, manager of the Value Line Mutual Fund Survey, recommends Lindner Dividend Fund for investors worried about a market setback.  The Lindner fund fell less than a third the amount of the average equity fund in the bear markets of 1987 and 1990. Lindner Dividend, however, has 10-year average returns of 12.5 percent, three percentage points below the market average and too low to make the short list here. **********For investors, finding the right balance between risk and reward is like the  right combination of healthful foods and a satisfying diet.

Representatives of the Continent's two biggest economic powers, Germany and France, bickered for much of the day over procedural issues  and tried to win support for their positions from other Governments of the European Union. **********The issues debated included which economic figures were reliable to show whether a country qualified for participation in the single-currency arrangement, how quickly national debt should be issued in the new currency, how soon to make the new currency legal tender, and how soon European leaders should decide who would be the first nations to join in the common currency. **********And almost invariably, France and Germany were at odds. **********But despite the disagreements, officials were optimistic that in Madrid next  month, the leaders of the 15 European Union countries would be able to sign perhaps the most important economic accord since the Maastricht treaty of 1992,  an agreement that clears the way for the creation of the first stage of a new currency on Jan. 1, 1999. **********\"There are some issues that are not resolved, but we are in a position to take a package to Madrid for approval by heads of state where the final issues will be resolved,\" Finance Minister Pedro Solbes of Spain said at a news conference. **********While there are skeptics, including those who think that Germany will pull out at the last minute, not wanting to give up the mark, officials of European Governments are doing more than just putting down agreements on paper for such a currency. Many are making painful cuts in their budget deficits to meet a tough  set of economic-performance criteria set out in the Maastricht treaty. **********The two most rigorous standards require a country to have a budget deficit of less than 3 percent of its gross domestic product by the end of 1997 and total debt not exceeding 60 percent of G.D.P. Only Germany and Luxembourg now meet those criteria, but almost a half-dozen other countries are expected to bring down their deficits over the next two years to qualify. **********Most economists agree that without German and French involvement, a European  currency would be meaningless. The two together would create a big economic market -- one that could draw in Britain, which is skeptical about giving up the pound, as well as other European countries. Eventually, it is envisaged, a monetary bloc roughly equal to the United States would emerge. **********But between now and 2002, the projected date when the new bank notes could be in full use and old national currencies no longer accepted as legal, there will  be plenty of moments that can weaken and slow the process. **********Today was one such time. France, for instance, wanted a decision on which countries qualified for monetary union at the end of 1997, using projections for debt levels that year. Germany wanted to delay the decision until early in 1998  to have confirmed figures on 1997 economic performance. **********In addition, France wanted countries that will use the single currency to begin issuing all debt in that new currency as of early 1999. Germany wanted that decision left to the individual governments. Both disputes were put off, to be decided by the heads of government in Madrid over the weekend of Dec. 16. **********A big decision in Madrid will be the name of the new currency. Though the French want the name ECU -- the current European Currency Unit, used in many accounts and already the issuance of some debt -- the Germans insist on Euro, a  name its Finance Minister, Theo Waigel, floated in September when the finance ministers last met. **********Delegates predicted that Germany would prevail in most of the disputes with France, including the dispute over the currency's name. **********\"I think Euro's won, even though it's a terrible name,\" a Brussels official said today."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/10/business/the-media-business-advertising-people.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1995-11-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 21, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;People", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;People", "body_text": " **********Salome Yilma, Eastern regional director at Business Travel News, New York, a unit of CMP Publications, was promoted to associate publisher."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/08/business/real-estatethe-first-new-suburban-mall-in-nearly-20-years-in-the.html": {"writer_name": "William Lubinger", "pub_date": "1995-11-08", "snippet": "BIG national retailers are increasingly being drawn to the outer suburbs of Cleveland, spurring the development of the first new suburban mall in the region in nearly 20 years. \n\n     In the last two years, chains like the Target division of Dayto...", "word_count": 769, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Real Estate;The first new suburban mall in nearly 20 years in the Cleveland region is going  up.", "print_headline": "Real Estate;The first new suburban mall in nearly 20 years in the Cleveland region is going  up.", "body_text": " **********BIG national retailers are increasingly being drawn to the outer suburbs of Cleveland, spurring the development of the first new suburban mall in the region in nearly 20 years. **********In the last two years, chains like the Target division of Dayton Hudson, Best Buy, Circuit City, Walgreen's and Kohl's have opened their first stores in the Cleveland area. And Nordstrom plans to open its first department store in Ohio in an suburb east of Cleveland in 1997. **********But the most significant sign of renewed interest by retailers in this market is the development of Southpark Center, the metropolitan area's first suburban mall since 1978. It is being built on 187 acres of former farmland in Strongsville, about 15 miles southwest of Cleveland. **********The two-story mall, with 362,000 square feet, is scheduled to open in October 1996 after a delay of more than two decades by a sluggish economy, development hurdles and a commercial real estate slump. **********\"It took that long for the area to mature and for the department stores to realize it had matured,\" said Donald M. Jones, vice president of real estate development for the Richard E. Jacobs Group, the project's developer. **********The $215 million mall will have about 130 stores, a 10-store food court, parking for 5,500 cars and 4 department stores within the mall, with space for a fifth on the 1.2- million-square-foot construction site. **********The tenants anchoring the mall will be Dillard's, J. C. Penney, Kaufmann's and Sears, Roebuck. Each department store will own its own store and land parcel.

Schaul, a Cleveland retail broker, said. \"It has the full boat of retail.\" **********The developer calculates that 486,000 residents will live within 15 to 20 minutes of the mall by 1998. Shoppers in those suburbs now drive at least 30 minutes to the nearest malls. **********The start of Southpark Center took much longer than the developer, Richard E. Jacobs, had expected. **********Mr. Jacobs and the late Edward J. DeBartolo bought the former grain farm together in 1973, had it rezoned for retail use and planned to develop the project jointly. But a sluggish local economy delayed development. **********\"You had recession after recession that curbed the growth of many tenants and made financing more difficult,\" said Mr. Jacobs, who also owns the Cleveland Indians baseball team. \"And you had a plethora of shopping centers entering the  market.\" **********Mr. Jacobs, who owns and manages 40 million square feet of office and retail  space nationally, was able to ride out the slump in the market.  His company's portfolio includes 38 regional malls, mostly in the Midwest and Southeast. **********Last February, the DeBartolo Realty Corporation sold its interest in the Southpark project to Mr. Jacobs for $10 million. **********Retailers are now being drawn to Strongsville and other growing outer suburbs to the east and west by desirable demographics and highway access. **********\"The site always made sense for a regional mall,\" Mr. Schaul said. \"The problem was they had to wait for the population to grow in sufficient numbers so the retailer could survive out there.\" **********Strongsville, for example, has averaged 400 home-building permits annually for the last 17 years. About 5,000 new houses have been built in the last five years. **********National retailers have entered the market with plans for continued expansion. Target, a Minneapolis-based discount chain, will anchor a new $18 million, 300,000-square-foot strip shopping center being built about a mile from the Southpark site. **********\"Strongsville was always kind of a quiet, sleepy little town,\" said the town's Mayor, Walter F. Ehrnfelt. \"The growth that has happened in here in the last few years has been phenomenal.\" **********Remaking the suburb has not been without its growing pains. Mall approval took three public votes. The mere widening of access roads to five and seven lanes has snarled traffic. **********Southpark Center received no tax abatement or other incentives from the city.

In a series of four magazine ads, the agency has used a minimal supply of mementos to create a maximum amount of ambiance in evoking the pre-Castro era, when Mr. Cifuentes and his brothers managed the legendary Partagas cigar company. **********The $4 million campaign is running in Details, Esquire, Forbes, Rolling Stone, Smart Money, Wine Spectator, Cigar Aficionado and half a dozen other consumer and specialty magazines. **********Under the slogan \"Partagas: the cigar that knew Cuba when,\" McCaffery & Ratner has used photographic ingenuity, archival images and male models in an attempt to recreate the lost world of the pre-Castro cigar. **********As might be expected, the ads extol the excellence of Partagas: not those Partagas cigars now made in Cuba in the factory that Mr. Castro's regime appropriated from Mr. Cifuentes's family, but the ones now created by Mr. Cifuentes in the Dominican Republic. **********Mr. Cifuentes helped build the new Partagas into one of the world's best-selling premium cigar brands, which, in the United States, is a strong rival to Macanudo. Premiums sell for $2.50 or more apiece. **********\"I think the Partagas campaign is a clever and distinctive way to set the line apart from other companies' cigars,\" said Bob Forbes, a cigar aficionado who happens to be president of Forbes FYI, the life-style quarterly of Forbes. **********His magazine, as well as Forbes, is running the Partagas campaign, \"which evokes the romance of the fine cigar and the reminiscence of time past,\" he said. \"The pre-Castro era in Cuba has assumed a mythical aura for cigar smokers.\" It has long been illegal to import or sell Cuban tobacco or cigars in  the United States. **********Partagas is trying to capitalize on this aura in the persona of Mr. Cifuentes, who still oversees the company's cigar-making operations in the Dominican Republic. \"He is the sole living cigar maker still actively involved in cigars today who was a manager in the pre-Castro period,\" said Austin T. McNamara, president of the General Cigar Company, which owns both Partagas and Macanudo. Mr. Cifuentes declines to give his age, which some say is the best-kept secret in the cigar industry, but he is believed to be 82. **********The campaign was introduced last spring with a Partagas ad that featured the  sepia-toned 1951 picture of Mr. Cifuentes and Sukui. The second advertisement carried the message \"I wanted to grow up to be a cowboy, until my father taught me how to make a Partagas.\" The ad depicts Ramon as a little boy, astride a horse outside a Cuban estate. **********The third ad shows the Partagas factory store in Havana with 1950's cars parked in front, and the youthful Ramon striding across the street. The last in  the series portrays a pensive adult Ramon, smoking a cigar at the mantelpiece of the ancestral manse. **********Given the reality of Mr. Cifuentes's journey to America, only the picture in  the first ad is authentic. The rest are \"ingenious\" fictions, as Mr. Forbes described them. **********For example, the little boy on the pony is not Mr. Cifuentes, but \"an authenticated picture from Cuba of the 1950's from a private collection,\" said Bill McCaffery, the agency's president and creative director. **********\"Even as a boy Ramon was involved in cigar-making,\" said Mr. McCaffery's wife, Sheila, the agency's associate creative director. The Partagas store in Havana was shot only last spring by the photographer Sheila Metzner, who snapped the pictures while playing the tourist. The store is still open and unchanged after its appropriation by the Castro Government. The two cars were rentals -- they cost $15 each -- and the Ramon-like pedestrian was a photography assistant. **********As for the image of Mr. Cifuentes at the mantelpiece, Warren Pfaff, an executive vice president at McCaffery, said, \"We photographed it in the most similar setting we could find: the Woolworth mansion in Manhattan.\" **********McCaffery & Ratner has handled General Cigar's account for five years, mounting campaigns for the top-selling Macanudo as well as the Temple Hall and Ramon Allones brands. **********But what does the founding father himself think of all this? \"I like the campaign because it reveals the past but looks forward to the future,\" said Mr.  Cifuentes, who says he still smokes 10 cigars a day. **********Thanks to the campaign, \"now he is becoming something of a celebrity,\" said Celia, his wife of 60 years.

Gen. Hussein Kamel, the brother-in-law of the Iraqi leader and architect of Iraq's weapons buildup whose defection to Jordan last August prompted King Hussein to call for the first time for a change in the Iraqi Government. **********General Kamel remains ensconced with his family in a royal palace here, but his past role in quashing opposition within Iraq has caused many dissidents to regard him with unease. **********But with Jordan continuing to suffer economically from the United Nations sanctions in effect since 1990 on what was once its largest trading partner, diplomats here say that King Hussein had concluded that more should be done now  to lay the groundwork for a change in the Iraqi Government. **********\"He feels very strongly that Iraqis have to begin to come to grips with and talk about the structure of a post-Saddam Hussein environment,\" a Western diplomat said. \"He clearly appears to have concluded that Jordan's interests are best served by a change in the regime in Baghdad.

That could establish Amman as the base for a kind of Iraqi government in exile, and would serve as a  further sign that King Hussein did not fear retaliation from Baghdad. **********Lees Kobba, a leading Iraqi Shiite opposition figure based in London, said he welcomed King Hussein's initiative and hoped the Jordanian would \"sponsor an administration that operates from Amman until the Iraqis cross to the side of change.\" **********But in the interview here, Crown Prince Hassan declined to discuss a specific timetable for the Jordanian initiative, and he referred ruefully to the fact that Syria, Egypt and Saudi Arabia have all expressed skepticism about it. **********\"Have you heard the Israeli political joke?\" he asked during a 75-minute conversation in the sitting room of his elegant home in the Royal Palace compound here. \"The Israeli says to the Jordanian -- the usual Israeli complaint -- 'We're surrounded by enemies.' **********\"And the Jordanian says, 'You think you have a problem?

But a recent Federal case, Wells v. Huntleigh Technology, shows that corporations themselves can blow the whistle on rivals, make money for themselves and be seen as heroes that clean up their industries and recoup taxpayer dollars. **********The whistle-blower -- or qui tam -- provisions of the Federal False Claims Act (qui tam being Latin shorthand for \"he who acts as much for the king as for  himself\") and state equivalents in California, Florida, Tennessee and Illinois,  allow a private citizen, whether corporate or individual, with unique knowledge  of fraud against the Government to bring a lawsuit in the name of the Government and to receive a percentage of the recoveries. **********The Wells case shows that the qui tam law, like the civil RICO statute, can  be used by companies to act effectively against what they see as fraud in their  own industry and potentially turn a profit at the same time. The settlement of the case for nearly $5 million is a wake-up call to the business community. **********RON WELLS of Florida was a self-employed dealer in medical equipment for more than a decade when he hired our law firm to file his qui tam case against Huntleigh. He contended that Huntleigh was defrauding the Medicare system, and he gave these details: **********He was approached in 1991 by a Huntleigh sales manager with a \"new\" lymphedema pump, which is used by patients at home to treat swelling of the limbs. Huntleigh was selling the pump to dealers for less than $500 but asserted that the pump had design features making it eligible for Medicare reimbursement  at the highest rate -- $4,000. **********Mr. Wells examined the pump, named the Flowplus, and concluded that it was the same as Huntleigh's low-grade pump in virtually every respect but color. He  told this to Huntleigh and to Medicare officials. **********Meanwhile, Flowplus sales through other dealers soared -- as did Medicare reimbursements for the device. After Mr. Wells went to trade shows displaying the pump with a sign \"Medicare rip-off,\" Huntleigh threatened to sue him. **********In early 1993, Medicare downgraded the reimbursement for the Flowplus from the highest to the lowest payment (about $475), but Mr. Wells felt that was not  enough. After 18 months, he became discouraged that Huntleigh and the dealers who sold the Flowplus had not been compelled to repay their earlier gains, and he acted to file the qui tam case. Huntleigh settled the suit in July for $4.9 million. Mr. Wells's share was $882,000, with the Government getting the rest.    MR. WELLS'S decision to blow the whistle, beyond being public-spirited, was also a business decision intended to benefit the company he owned and his industry. Mr. Wells believed that Huntleigh was not only committing a fraud on the Government, but that it was also ruining the market by forcing other manufacturers to bring out substandard pumps in order to compete. His decision to refuse to participate in what he saw as rampant profiteering, and finally to  avail himself of the qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act, protected his own business interests as well as those of United States taxpayers. **********Had Metpath and Metwest made a similar decision to blow the whistle on industry practices described to them by Jack Dowden, their fortunes might have taken a strikingly different turn than they did. **********Mr. Dowden was a sales manager for Metwest in the late 1980's when he reported to company executives that a rival diagnostic testing group, National Health Laboratories, was engaging in Medicare billing practices involving the \"unbundling\" of blood test packages that he -- and later the Federal Government  -- characterized as fraudulent.  Metwest's response, Mr. Dowden said, was to ignore his warning not to follow National Health's example. **********Believing that National Health was damaging his sales in his region, and in order to prevent his employer from also engaging in such practices, Mr. Dowden went to the authorities. Ultimately, he filed a qui tam suit against National Health as well as the Metpath unit of Corning Inc. and Metwest, which had adopted National Health's billing practices. The three settled with the Government for $150 million, of which Mr. Dowden received around $23 million. Had Metpath and Metwest joined Mr. Dowden in his lawsuit instead of copying National Health's billing practices, they would have likewise been awarded millions of dollars rather than having to pay $40 million in the settlement. **********These cases demonstrate a simple truth: \"anti-fraud\" is not \"anti-business.\"  Like RICO, the False Claims Act can be a powerful weapon in the service of the business community. **********Indeed, in an era in which corporate compliance and self-policing are necessitated by the Federal Corporate Sentencing Guidelines, law-abiding companies need to take action to protect their ability to compete honestly in an honest market. **********Companies routinely do so now under the antitrust laws when confronted with anti-competitive practices by rivals. The False Claims Act permits companies that adhere to the law to level the playing field by exposing questionable practices of competitors for Federal dollars and offsetting the business losses  incurred as a result of them. It does so not only with an eye to bottom-line profitability, but also to the greater public good."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/20/business/fox-opens-its-checkbook-in-a-search-for-hit-comedies.html": {"writer_name": "Andy Meisler", "pub_date": "1995-11-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1055, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fox Opens Its Checkbook in a Search for Hit Comedies", "print_headline": "Fox Opens Its Checkbook in a Search for Hit Comedies", "body_text": " **********Can money buy laughter? **********Rupert Murdoch certainly seems to think so.

By attracting top writing and producing talent, Fox hopes to create hit shows that will run long enough to make them hot commodities in the second-run syndication market. **********\"All we need is one big hit like 'Home Improvement,' which can bring in hundreds of millions of dollars,\" Mr. Roth said. **********He added that the high-priced hirings also reflected a desire to create successful comedy series for the far-flung outposts of Mr. Murdoch's television  empire, which include the Fox network and its owned-and-operated station group in the United States, and satellite services in Britain, South America and Australia. **********To develop a fresh batch of new comedies to sell, Fox Television has signed three writer-producers and two teams: Chuck Lorre of ABC's \"Roseanne\" and \"Grace Under Fire\" and CBS's \"Cybill\"; Danny Jacobson, co-creator of NBC's \"Mad About You\" and one of the original writers on \"Roseanne\"; Eric Gilliland of \"Roseanne\"; the team of Vic Rauseo and Linda Morris of NBC's \"Frasier,\" and Jeff Strauss and Jeff Greenstein, who were writers on NBC's \"Friends\" and who now run \"Partners,\" a Universal Television-produced series now running on the Fox network. **********The highest-paid member of the group is believed to be Mr. Jacobson, whose contract is estimated to be worth $20 million. Mr. Lorre is said to be receiving $12 million to $13 million. Several others, who are currently working on shows created by other production companies, will not be available to work for Fox Television until the 1997 season. **********In paying such high prices, Fox has underlined the importance of so-called show runners, an unofficial title earned by each of the new hires. These are the people given responsibility for both creative and organizational control of a weekly series, and who write many of the scripts, supervise the writing of the rest and make budget and casting decisions. **********All the show runners signed by Fox have been given credit -- how much credit  is a matter of fierce debate within the industry -- for the success of one or more of the prime-time shows they have worked on. **********Some of Fox's rivals contend that pouring millions of dollars into the bank accounts of comedy writers -- and their agents -- might ultimately serve only to raise the cost of producing unsold scripts and pilot episodes. **********\"It makes life harder for me,\" said Larry Lyttle, president of Big Ticket Television, a year-old division of Blockbuster Entertainment that has several network series and pilots in the works. \"A couple of years ago $6 million was a  good development fund. Now it's not so good. I'm pretty well funded, but I'm not going to spend $13 million on three writers who haven't proven they can come up  with a hit series.\" **********Mr. Lyttle said several of the new Fox writer-producers gained their reputations not by creating new shows but by running the sixth or seventh seasons of long-running series. All have produced at least one dud -- some, two  or three -- for every hit show they've worked on. **********\"It's tough enough to get one hit,\" Mr. Lyttle said. \"The question is: Can they do it again? When you look at the history of television, you realize that's a tough question.\" **********Other critics of the Fox deals noted that 5 of the top 10 network shows last  season starred stand-up comics who successfully translated their stand-up routines and personas into a sitcom format. **********Mr. Roth was a bit impatient in responding to rival executives who questioned the wisdom of awarding such large contracts to behind-the-scenes talent. \"The fact of the matter is that we will support our writing talent with the best acting talent -- some of which will be stand-up talent -- that we can possibly put together,\" he said. **********This sounds fine to the newly signed writers, all of whom work long hours in  an extremely high-pressure environment, but who already earn more than perhaps 99 percent of all those who have ever put words to paper for a living. **********\"I feel like I kind of understand those hot-shot rookie sports stars now,\" said Mr. Strauss, 32, who has been writing for television for 10 years. \"They thank their parents and they thank God. How can you possibly make sense of a financial gain of this size?\" **********Mr. Lorre, 43, a former Long Island-based musician who made the transition 10 years ago to sitcom writing, said, \"I guess if I don't come through, Rupert Murdoch will shoot me with a death ray from one of his satellites.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/27/business/international-briefs-whitbread-to-bid-for-forte-operations.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-12-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 166, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Whitbread to Bid For Forte Operations", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Whitbread to Bid For Forte Operations", "body_text": " **********Whitbread P.L.C. has agreed to offer L1 billion ($1.54 billion) for the restaurant operations of Forte P.L.C., which is fighting a hostile bid from the  Granada Group, British newspapers reported yesterday.

But in slums like Imbaba, whose poverty makes it fertile soil for Islamic militants, the President's visit to Jerusalem  is seen by some as a crucial mistake. **********\"Mubarak has just signed his own death certificate,\" Sheik Nasser said this  afternoon, speaking in his apartment here. **********Although the sheik commands wide respect among his neighbors, he insisted he  was not making a threat. And even in this impoverished neighborhood, the notion  that Egypt's President is now at greater risk is an extreme view. **********But the shiek expressed the frustration of many in saying that Muslims cannot tolerate a leader who would visit Israel when it still controls Jerusalem. Mr. Mubarak's predecessor, Anwar el-Sadat, visited Jerusalem in 1977, even before Egypt made peace with Israel. Four years later, he was assassinated by Islamic militants who were angered both by the peace accord the two nations reached in 1979 and by Mr. Sadat's visit. **********Despite the peace, many in Egypt still look upon Israel as an enemy. And while Mr. Mubarak's careful words at Mr. Rabin's funeral on Monday stopped well short of an embrace, his supporters have hurried to head off charges that the President's presence was an affront to Islam. **********The Government has taken pains to insist that Mr. Mubarak's first trip to Jerusalem since he took office in 1981 was a human gesture that did not carry political weight. **********A lengthy editorial this morning in Al Ahram, the main Government newspaper,  offered seven reasons for the visit, saying that on balance it had been justified by \"the exceptional situation.\" And Mr. Mubarak, who had previously refused repeated invitations to Israel, has told reporters, \"I don't consider this a visit.\" **********With parliamentary elections just three weeks away, the Government is plainly concerned that opposition parties may seize on the visit to strengthen their attacks against a Government that some portray as hostile to Islamic leaders. **********In interviews across Cairo today, it was evident that Mr. Mubarak's hope of avoiding a public backlash has been strengthened by comparisons between him and  King Hussein of Jordan, whose more effusive eulogy to Mr. Rabin is being widely  described here as offensive. **********Indeed, by the standards of the student protests that followed Sadat's visit  to Jerusalem 18 years ago, the reaction to Mr. Mubarak's journey has been muted. Under emergency laws that have banned street demonstrations since the Government began its crackdown against Islamic militants three years ago, only opposition newspapers like Al Shaab have called critical attention to what it described as  Mr. Mubarak's visit to \"occupied Jerusalem.\" **********While many ordinary Egyptians said they were untroubled by the visit, the forceful antipathy expressed by Islamic militants suggested that the step so welcomed in the West may carry domestic consequences. **********\"It is not befitting an Arab and a Muslim leader to visit Jerusalem when it is still occupied,\" said Mohammed Ezzat, 21, a leader of Islamic students at Cairo University, where student union elections today pitted Islamic candidates  against those from a Government-supported secular society. **********\"We should never have had relations in the first place with anyone who still  occupies our land,\" he said. **********In a barbershop in Imbaba, Hatem Gharieb, a restaurant worker, pointed with frustration to last month's vote by the United States Congress to move the American Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem by 1999, and said Mr. Mubarak's visit was \"bad timing.\" **********\"This is a mistake,\" Mr. Gharieb said, adding that Mr. Mubara \"was not adding anything to Egypt by going there.\" **********Only three years ago the Government dispatched 14,000 troops to Imbaba as part of its crackdown on Islamic militants, and the firm hand Cairo has wielded  across Egypt has left many people reluctant to express dissent. **********Sheik Nasser, one of several imams in his local mosque, was unusual in his neighborhood today only for allowing his name to be used as he criticized Mr. Mubarak's visit as an endorsement of Israel's control of Jerusalem. **********\"It is bad for both Arabs and Muslims,\" said the religious leader, an impoverished former chicken merchant who had to tug at his shabby djellabah to hide its holes. **********In its editorial, Al Ahram defended Mr. Mubarak's journey as necessary because Menachem Begin, then Israel's Prime Minister, attended Sadat's funeral. **********The newspaper also said right-wing Israeli forces would have seized on Mr. Mubarak's absence to obstruct the peace effort. It said the unusual circumstance of Mr. Rabin's death provided Egypt with an \"ideal opportunity\" to put an end to American and Israeli complaints about the Egyptian President's long-standing refusal to visit Jerusalem. **********On Cairo's crowded sidewalks, bustling campuses and dusty back streets, men like Mukhtar Ali made it clear that they were more concerned with their own affairs than with such debate. Smoking a water pipe in a coffee shop in Imbaba,  Mr. Ali, a 33-year-old civil servant, shrugged his shoulders and told a visitor  that what Mr. Mubarak did was \"a human gesture.\" **********But Hend Mohammed, 21, a Cairo University student whose hair and face were shrouded in a veil, said Mr. Mubarak's visit was a major misstep. \"For the President to visit Jerusalem, it is a big risk,\" she said. \"For Rabin to be buried in Jerusalem, that's a tragedy.\" **********-------------------- **********16 Wounded in Train Attacks **********ASYUT, Egypt, Nov. 8 (Reuters) -- Two Egyptians and two tourists were wounded in an attack tonight on a passenger train near Farshut, in southern Egypt, the authorities said. **********It was the second shooting attack on a train in two days.

Only AT&T, the largest long-distance provider, would have more customer lines. **********At the same time, Wall Street executives said that a third regional Bell, the Pacific Telesis Group, was trying to negotiate deals with several phone companies, including Nynex and Bell Atlantic. **********Investment bankers and communications executives floated an array of other potential deals yesterday that would pair local phone companies with long-distance carriers or overseas phone companies. **********These days, picking up a rumor about a telecommunications deal is about as easy as picking up the phone. \"With the starting gate going up, the Bells are going to have AT&T in their business tomorrow,\" said Robert Waldman, corporate bond research chief at Salomon Brothers, \"They want people to know that they can potentially serve far more customers, too.\" **********For Wall Street, a frenzy of deals would be a bonanza. For many consumers, though, the activity is unlikely to make much difference in the price or quality of their phone service. Only in metropolitan areas, where the lure of lucrative  markets might intensify competition, could the small customer hope to see much benefit. **********Congress has yet to pass the telecommunications bill, which would allow the local and long-distance carriers to compete in each other's markets. But a House-Senate conference has nearly completed a compromise measure. And if a bill does not make it to the White House before the end of the year, many industry executives and lawmakers expect it to do so early next year. **********A report of discussions between Nynex and Bell Atlantic, something long assumed in the industry and the subject of a Wall Street Journal article yesterday, caused little stir in Washington, where the conference did not hold a meeting. **********But Senator Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska, who has harshly criticized the  monopoly power of the regional Bells companies, threatened to mount a filibuster against the bill when it reaches the Senate floor. \"This is a signal of where the industry is going after the legislation,\" he said, \"and it is toward greater concentration.\" **********Industry consolidation, though, may be a fact of the future, with or without  a law, as companies seek the advantages that size and economies of scale can bring. The antitrust consent decree, the court-supervised settlement that has governed the seven so-called Baby Bells since they were spun off from AT&T in 1984, does not prohibit two of these companies from merging. Nor does it prohibit a long-distance company other than AT&T from acquiring or merging with  a Baby Bell. **********Although telephone executives are still treading lightly around regulators for fear of derailing the bill, most are scrambling behind the scenes to line up partners and allies to help them compete. **********And in a public gesture, AT&T announced a move yesterday to further distance  itself from the local phone companies with which it expects to soon be competing. It said it would begin billing some customers in Florida, Texas and California directly for long-distance service. Until now, AT&T has generally paid local phone companies to add its charges to their monthly bills. **********A merger of Nynex and Bell Atlantic has been talked about in recent months as increasingly likely, a powerful local-phone franchise stretching from Maine to Virginia. The companies have merged their cellular properties, and they are partners with Pacific Telesis in a television programming venture, Tele-TV. **********Nynex and Bell Atlantic declined to comment on the talks yesterday. And an investment banker familiar with the discussions cautioned that the two were at least weeks away from any deal. **********Ivan G. Seidenberg, chairman and chief executive of Nynex, said in an interview yesterday that his company was exploring a broad range of relationships with other phone companies, ranging from joint ventures to marketing alliances. **********\"This industry is so dynamic that we have to be flexible,\" Mr. Seidenberg said. \"We have explored any number of options to do that, and we will continue to do so. But any discussion that we've had with any company is inappropriate to comment on.\" **********He noted that Nynex had not waited for telecommunications legislation to strike several of its deals. But he acknowledged that the bill, if it became law, would open the door to new relationships. Mr. Seidenberg said Nynex would try to gain some share of the huge number of international calls in and out of New York City. To do that, analysts said, Nynex could conceivably form an alliance with an overseas carrier. **********In seeking to compete against AT&T in the domestic market, analysts said Nynex and Bell Atlantic would each benefit by consolidating their local-phone franchise on the Eastern Seaboard. \"What you need to have is a large footprint to reach more customers with one network,\" Mr. Waldman said, \"There's no reason  on God's earth why you have to have seven Bell companies.\" **********If a merger would help both companies, most analysts said that on balance, it would be more beneficial to Nynex. Mr. Waldman said Bell Atlantic -- which covers the area from New Jersey to Virginia -- had better debt ratings and was viewed as one of the best run of the regional Bell companies. Though Nynex, serving New England and New York, had improved its reputation under Mr. Seidenberg, it was viewed as the weaker of the two. **********Nynex shares bucked a sharp stock-market decline yesterday, rising 25 cents,  to $49.875, on the New York Stock Exchange. Bell Atlantic shares dropped $1.625, to $67. **********Regional Bell companies are not the only candidates for deals. Several analysts said MCI Communications was an obvious partner for a local phone company because it could gain access to local customers while offering access to its long-distance network in return. **********Analysts regard GTE as another natural candidate for a deal because it controlled local markets throughout the country. Indeed, an investment banker said Pacific Telesis had expressed interest in merging with GTE because the two  companies both controlled lucrative local phone markets in California. **********Consumer advocates, however, were alarmed by a linkup of regional Bell companies. \"In a merger like this, you're talking about two companies that border each other,\" said Bradley Stillman, director of telecommunications policy at the Consumer Federation of America. \"This assures that they will never compete in each other's markets.\" **********Critics of the legislation, including Senator Kerrey and Mr. Stillman, want the Justice Department to help determine whether there is adequate competition in the local phone business before the regional Bells are let loose in the long-distance business."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/13/business/singing-steelworker-blues-mini-mill-deal-ltv-leaves-union-feeling-jilted.html": {"writer_name": "John Holusha", "pub_date": "1995-12-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1761, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Singing the Steelworker Blues;A Mini-Mill Deal at LTV Leaves Union Feeling Jilted", "print_headline": "Singing the Steelworker Blues;A Mini-Mill Deal at LTV Leaves Union Feeling Jilted", "body_text": " **********For seven long years, the steelworkers here say, they stood by the LTV Corporation as it fought its way back from the brink of collapse.

But the local steelworkers' union, based in this Cleveland suburb, sees it differently. It says LTV never consulted the union about the investment and is purposely pursuing a policy that will eventually lead to the shutdown of its aging mills in Cleveland and East Chicago, Ind., which together still employ 8,500 workers. **********Many of the union's members are furious at what they view as LTV's greed and  ingratitude. \"When they were in trouble, the company called us 'brother' and was glad to have our help,\" said George Lapp, a member of Local 1098 of the United Steelworkers of America. \"Now they are trying to stab us in the back.\" **********Whatever its outcome, the dispute has wider implications than just the future of LTV's work force.

Mr. Sweeney promised to  \"pour our resources into organizing at a pace and scale that is unprecedented.\" **********The United Steelworkers, whose membership has plummeted to 140,000 from 380,000 in 1979, is likely to prove a receptive audience to Mr. Sweeney's message. **********For the moment, there does not seem to be much the union can do about the mini-mill in Alabama, which is scheduled to open in 1997. Michael Scarver, a former local union president in Cleveland who is now on the national organization's staff, says workers are following a rule-book strategy to slow production and are staging noisy demonstrations in Cleveland and Alabama to alert steel buyers that labor relations in the older plants are poor. **********But LTV, cheered on by the rest of the industry, is determined to move forward with its plans. David H. Hoag, chairman of the company, said the joint venture would enable the company to cope with foreign competition and the technology revolution that together have forced the restructuring of American industry during the last decade. \"It is important that this company grow, and grow profitably,\" he said. **********LTV holds a 50 percent stake in the mini-mill venture, called the Trico Steel Company L.L.C., while Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd. of Japan and British Steel  P.L.C. each own 25 percent. **********LTV is the first large American steel company to switch to mini-mills from the old integrated plants that have been the norm since the turn of the century. And analysts leave no doubt that its strategic reasoning is sound. **********\"Not only are these new mills less capital intensive, but they have production cycles measured in hours, rather than days,\" said Michael F. Gambardella, a steel analyst with J. P. Morgan Securities Inc. \"That makes them  more flexible in meeting shifts in the market.\" **********He added that other traditional steel companies in the United States would have to move in a similar direction if they wanted to remain competitive. **********The new mill could have a formidable cost advantage. Based on its planned output and announced manning level, Trico should be able to produce steel with less than half a man-hour of labor per ton. Even the most efficient integrated mills require at least two man-hours per ton. **********LTV says that overall wages and benefits will be roughly the same for its workers in Alabama but that the pay package will be more flexible, with a lot of pay tied to incentives related to production. But if both companies pay $35 a hour in pay and benefits, Trico would have a labor cost of $17 a ton, compared with about $70 for a traditional steelmaker like LTV. With a product that sells  for about $300 a ton, that arithmetic provides a compelling argument in favor of mini-mills. **********Union officials argue that the new mini-mills are crowding into a business with too much production capacity already, particularly during the industry's periodic downturns. **********\"Mini-mills represent 25 percent of the capacity for making steel in the United States,\" said George Becker, president of the steelmakers' union. \"The new mills are being built to take business away from the integrated companies and shut them down.\" While the industry is thriving now, that could happen in the next big downturn, union officials say. **********For Mr. Becker, the company's abandonment of its workers would be the worst sort of ingratitude. LTV spent nearly seven years operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, paring away nearly 60 percent of its work force before emerging from bankruptcy in June 1993. In 1986, LTV's workers agreed to a wage cut of $1.60 an hour from an average wage then of $12 an hour and gave up a week of vacation and other benefits. The cuts were rescinded starting in 1992 and the company says that subsequent profit sharing has made up more than half the lost  income. **********\"LTV survived the 1980's with the help of the workers,\" Mr. Becker said. \"If  the union had not convinced workers to give concessions, the company would not be in existence today.\" **********Mr. Scarver echoed his boss's bitterness. He contends that the company has reneged on a solemn compact. \"We worked out partnership agreements with LTV,\" he said. \"We were going to get away from adversarial relationships and move into the 1990's.\" **********But the company says the labor leaders are misguided. \"The decision to invest in Trico had nothing to do with the union,\" said Mr. Hoag, the chairman. He said the products made at Trico, at least initially, would be low-priced sheet steel, which has little overlap with the more highly processed coils from the Cleveland and Indiana plants. **********LTV officials acknowledge that the union's work-to-rule campaign is souring the atmosphere at the two Midwestern plants, but maintain that the protest is having little impact on production. \"The most troubling part is that local presidents are not working with us to improve the productivity of our facilities,\" said A. Cole Tremain, the company's vice president for industrial relations. \"They will not even come to safety meetings, which is shortsighted.\" **********Though they say they deplore the deterioration of labor relations, LTV executives are refusing to support the union's efforts to organize workers at the Alabama mill. \"The union ought to compete and make an effort at organizing Trico,\" Mr. Hoag said. \"Unions have to be competitive like everybody else.\" **********For Mr. Becker and others in the steelworkers' union, that stance adds insult to injury. They say big corporations in general have grown sophisticated in thwarting organizing drives, especially by screening out workers with pro-union  attitudes. And they fear that the traditional antipathy in the South to unions can only play into the hands of LTV's management. **********\"A company that is willing to spend enough money can bust up an organizing drive,\" Mr. Becker said. **********Contrary to the union's contention, Trico will produce a form of sheet steel  that will not directly compete -- at least initially -- with LTV's products. But it may nibble away at the edges of the only market left to the integrated producers: the high-quality sheet metal that goes into automobiles and appliances.    LTV is the first American integrated steel company to get into the mini-mill  business, but it is not the first to recognize the advantages of the process. Dofasco Inc., an integrated producer in Canada, is one of the investors in Gallatin Steel Inc., a mini-mill that began making sheet steel in northern Kentucky early this year. And Broken Hill Proprietary, an Australian steelmaker, is a partner in a mini-mill being built near Toledo, Ohio, that is to go into operation late next year. In all, more than a dozen new sheet-making mini-mills  are in operation or under construction in the United States. **********According to Mr. Hoag, it was the threat from the new mills plus a desire to  get on the technology bandwagon that drove LTV to form Trico, despite a personal appeal from Mr. Becker not to build the mill. Under the terms of the latest contract between LTV and the union, which was adopted in 1994, the union has the right to name a member to the board of directors and to address the board on important issues. **********\"Within the next 20 to 30 years steel will be made by entirely different methods,\" Mr. Hoag said. \"We are in a transition away from the capital-intensive ways of the past.\" **********These methods may include making steel in one step from treated iron ore rather than relying on the multiple steps needed now, and casting liquid steel into its final shape, eliminating the costly rolling mills currently in use. **********LTV has longstanding links with Sumitomo, one of its partners in Trico. The company operates two electrogalvanizing mills in Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio, that use the Japanese company's technology. **********British Steel already operates a mill in Alabama, Tuscaloosa Steel, and is planning to move two iron ore preparation mills from Scotland to the Mobile area. The output of those plants, which is called direct reduced iron, could be  used in the electric furnaces of Trico. **********The Trico project is being closely watched by steel industry executives, particularly those in the older mills where the union is strong. \"If Dave Hoag can stand up to the union and pull this off,\" said the chief executive of another company, who requested anonymity, \"the whole industry will be in his debt.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/16/business/at-at-t-nerves-on-edge-but-few-signs-of-gloom.html": {"writer_name": "Jon Nordheimer", "pub_date": "1995-11-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 934, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "At AT&T, Nerves on Edge but Few Signs of Gloom", "print_headline": "At AT&T, Nerves on Edge but Few Signs of Gloom", "body_text": " **********With the adroitness of the world's largest communications company, AT&T reached around the world today to deliver \"voluntary termination\" notices to 77,800 managers. **********Thick envelopes containing the buyout offer went by overnight mail to reach managers on vacation in Europe or on sun-splashed beaches.

There are now 302,000 employees and 151,000 managers, he added. **********The typical manager, he said, is 42 years old, has 16 years with AT&T and earns $1,000 a week. **********Mr. Stinson, who has been at AT&T 26 years, opened a sealed package this morning and learned that if he took the buyout option, he would be entitled to 30 weeks of pay, and an additional 20 percent of that total would be paid to him. **********\"After divestiture,\" he mused, \"there was a feeling around here of a divorce  in the family. Now there's more a feeling that the kids have grown up and need a house of their own.\" **********The long-awaited buyout offer was the talk of Basking Ridge today. **********\"Most of the AT&T guys I know don't know what January will bring,\" said Rich  Peacher, managing partner of the Store, a popular local restaurant and bar. **********Recalling a big 1989 buyout, which some 12,000 AT&T workers took, he said, \"We used to do a big business with retirement parties, picnics and other events, which seem to have been hurt by budget cuts.\" **********\"Guys who used to come in for a martini lunch and leave at 4 o'clock now are  in their offices.\" **********But Evelyn Pruiskema, who owns the Somerset Hills flower shop filled with the smell of roses, peonies and lilies, expressed confidence. \"There's still a lot of old money and estates here that are a world apart from the corporate world,\"  she said. **********Mary Lanzara, manager of a Weichert real estate office here, agreed that home values, which start at $300,000 and quickly run up to $500,000 or more in better locations, would not be hurt. **********\"We're getting calls from young couples who ask if there are going to be any  great deals on houses now that AT&T is cutting back,\" said one of her agents, Sue Pinzuti. \"But I don't see it happening.

Appropriately enough, the moniker was inspired by an advertisement:  a sign in a luncheonette where the pair were meeting to talk over their fledgling venture. **********\"It's a place where they make great carrot juice and the sign said 'fresh carrots,' \" Ms. Evans recalled. \"I said why don't we just change the spelling.\" **********Ms. Evans described Fresh Carats as offering clients \"gemlike thinking in the simplest of settings.\" (Pause here for loud groans.) It also offers the services of \"creative problem-solvers,\" she said, rather than those available from a conventional agency. **********In that regard, Fresh Carats is emblematic of a trend that has enabled advertisers to consider using small, creatively focused shops or boutique consulting outfits for tasks ranging from the evaluation of campaign concepts to media services and product naming. Such companies often handle a short- or long-term project, a brainstorming session and other assignments separate from the work performed on an account by an agency. **********\"Whether it's skywriting or the Internet, it all comes down to -- it all begins with -- the idea,\" said Mr. Chereskin, 67, who joined Ms. Evans, 46, for  an interview at which they discussed Fresh Carats. **********Mr. Chereskin, trained as an art director, began in advertising in 1950 at a  New York agency known as Hockaday Associates. He co-founded AC& R 15 years later and began working for Lauder soon after. **********\"I saw the Estee Lauder budget go from a couple hundred thousand dollars to $80 million,\" he said. Fueled by other accounts like Seiko, the Wool Bureau and  Foot Locker -- and with the backing of Ted Bates Worldwide, which bought AC& R shortly after its founding -- the agency grew to $360 million in billings by the late 1980's. **********But serious problems began eating away at the agency, which was shaken by the loss of accounts and the departures -- some bitter -- of top executives. Billings fell to $150 million, a large entertainment division in Los Angeles was closed and in 1991, the Saatchi & Saatchi Company, which had bought Bates, shifted AC& R to an autonomous unit of Bates rather than a stand-alone shop. **********In May 1994, Mr. Chereskin said he would retire that December. In July 1994,  Saatchi & Saatchi, by then called Cordiant P.L.C., merged AC& R into Bates and the AC& R name vanished. The portion of the agency handling Lauder became Bates  Manhattan, which recently survived a lengthy review on the Lauder account. **********Asked his reaction to the rise and fall of AC& R, Mr. Chereskin replied: \"I'm not disappointed. I didn't sit around feeling sorry for myself. I helped 100 people in this business; that's a better legacy than a name on a door.\" **********In the last few months, which Mr. Chereskin puckishly referred to as \"going into the Saatchi retirement system,\" he said he busied himself with Japanese gardening and \"becoming computer literate -- up to a point. I'm not going to say I'm a techie.\" **********He started considering a return to ad work during the summer, he said, after  being called by acquaintances with one-day consulting offers and other requests  for advice. **********\"I think there's an urge in all of us,\" Mr. Chereskin said. \"You can slow down but you can't stop.\" **********Besides Ms. Wang, known for her bridal gowns, Fresh Carats is working for Annick Goutal Parfums in Paris, which sells a collection of fragrances in specialty and department stores like Barneys, Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue. **********An ad for Goutal in the December issue of Vogue magazine shows a woman asleep on a bed of autumn leaves with the headline \"Perfume is the music of my dreams.\" **********Mr. Chereskin said, \"It's fashion plus, how people live rather than what they wear.\" **********Fresh Carats also hopes to land assignments in categories that Ms. Evans has  handled at her own companies, the Joan Evans Marketing Group and Adrian & Evans.

Deutch. The consequences were enormous. **********The United States failed to see the deep decline of the Soviet and Russian military and sped up spending on Pentagon programs. It misapprehended the hard-line resistance in the K.G.B. and the old Communist Party to the reforms of the last Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev. And it did not fully fathom President Boris N. Yeltsin, especially his policies on the spread of weapons and his sometimes violent attitudes toward the former Soviet republics **********The scheme to manipulate American intelligence began after the mole, the C.I.A.'s Aldrich Ames, began working for Moscow in 1985. It grew to involve a team of Soviet double agents who whispered falsehoods salted with grains of truth into the C.I.A.'s ears for nine years. **********And it succeeded when the agency passed along at least 95 top-secret reports  without warning Presidents, Pentagon officials and policy makers that it knew or suspected the reports came from spies controlled by Moscow. **********The deception \"had a substantial role in framing the debate\" over military policy and strategy toward Moscow, Mr. Deutch said. While no one weapon or strategy was created solely on the basis of the deception operation, \"the overall effect was to sustain our view of the U.S.S.R. as a credible military and technological opponent,\" he said. **********\"The net effect,\" he concluded, \"was that we overestimated their capability.\" The C.I.A. thus failed in its central mission of the cold war: understanding the depth of the Soviet threat. While the C.I.A. was criticized in the past for failing to foresee major events in the Soviet Union -- for example, the invasions of Hungary in 1956 and Afghanistan in 1979 -- the double agents' reports appeared to have colored many of its most crucial analyses in every sphere. **********The Pentagon used the reports \"as part of an overall justification for multibillion-dollar investments in weapons system,\" and stepped up its spending  by hundreds of millions of dollars, the chairman and deputy chairman of the Senate intelligence committee said. **********Why would Moscow want to inflate its military prowess in Washington's eyes? \"We take credit for the fact that we bankrupted the Soviet Union by getting them to build more than what they needed,\" said the deputy chairman, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, \"and I presume that they may have had the same thing in mind.\" **********While the full extent of the operation will never be publicly known, Mr. Deutch's report, released by the committee today, provides the most detailed look yet at a sophisticated scheme run by the Soviet and Russian intelligence services and aimed at the highest levels of American Government. **********The double agents under Moscow's control fed the C.I.A. a carefully crafted mixture of truth and falsehood. To the extent they succeed in manipulating Washington's perceptions, they were helped immeasurably by the C.I.A. itself. **********Senior C.I.A. officials delivered the information to the Pentagon and the White House without revealing that they knew or suspected that the information came from double agents. This self-deception was crucial to the success of the scheme. **********The deception operation began in late 1985 or early 1986, after Mr. Ames, a counterintelligence branch chief in the C.I.A.'s Soviet division, secretly sold  Moscow the identities of every important Soviet military and intelligence officer secretly working for the United States. These agents were arrested and,  in most cases, executed. Soon new Soviet officials offered their services to the C.I.A. -- but they were double agents, under Moscow's control. **********Mr. Ames said in an interview last year that his Soviet handler, Vladimir Metchulayev, a senior K.G.B. counterintelligence officer, told him at an October 1986 meeting in Rome that his spy service would do \"everything we can to divert, to mislead\" the C.I.A. **********The double agents protected Mr. Ames by feeding false theories to the agency  about the disappearances and deaths of the agents Mr. Ames betrayed. And until Mr. Ames was arrested in February 1994, they fed carefully selected facts and falsehoods about the inner workings of the Kremlin to the agency. **********\"One of the primary purposes of the perception management program was to convince us that the Soviets remained a superpower and that their military research and development program was robust,\" Mr. Deutch said. But after 18 months of internal investigations, which are continuing, the extent to which the program influenced the Pentagon's decisions to build or upgrade weapons systems  remains unclear. **********\"It's difficult to pin them down as to exactly what decision was made based on this information and how much money it cost,\" said the intelligence committee chairman, Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania. In one instance, he said, a Pentagon official spoke of spending $200 million to speed the development of one weapon system. Pentagon officials identified it as the F-22 fighter plane. **********Some senior Pentagon officials are \"reluctant to state\" that the deception influenced billion-dollar decisions, Mr. Deutch said. But the Pentagon's chief spokesman, Ken Bacon, said that since \"the amount of information that goes into  making decisions about weapons systems is so large, and the amount of information in these channels was a very small slice of the pie, our initial conclusion was that we probably would not have done anything differently.\" **********That attitude, Mr. Kerrey said, is \"revisionist, in my judgment,\" given the \"shock and outrage\" throughout the Defense Department when the agency's duplicity was revealed. **********\"No single strand of intelligence information ever serves as the full justification for undertaking a large program,\" said Mr. Deutch, who served as a senior Pentagon official in 1993 and 1994 and was exposed to some of the double-agent reports. But the intelligence reports clearly had the capacity \"to influence U.S. military research and development and procurement programs costing billions of dollars,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/10/business/no-thanks.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-12-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 118, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "No, Thanks", "print_headline": "No, Thanks", "body_text": " **********I have climbed to the top of the greasy pole!\" proclaimed Benjamin Disraeli  when he became Prime Minister of Britain. **********Some people, though, do not think success is worth the scramble.

At the height of the recent burning season, the forest was cloaked in shadow, the sun appeared veiled and neither stars nor moon could be seen in the night sky. **********The vast fires are not runaway blazes alone, but an annual ritual from early July to November as ranchers, farmers and developers clear land for cattle grazing, planting or building. Much of the smoke rises from regrown forests in areas that were felled years ago, along with pastures and savannas. But the locations of some fires suggest a large amount of virgin rain forest is being cleared as well. **********Airports in much of the Amazon have been closed for at least part of every day because of the thick smoke. Doctors at one hospital in Rondonia said they were seeing many more patients as a result of the burnings this year than last,  with many children suffering from respiratory problems. **********\"According to our statistics, this year is the worst year as far as fires are concerned,\" Marcio Nogueira Barbosa, director general of the Brazilian Government's National Institute for Space Research, said in an interview. \"We know that the situation in some parts is very dire.\" **********The increase comes after several years of claims by the Government that destruction of the Amazon rain forest had slowed thanks to steps it had taken, including the elimination of Government subsidies for clearing virgin forest. But environmental experts contend the country's failure to analyze the extent of deforestation since 1991, along with the stepped-up levels of burnings in the Amazon region, raise doubts about those claims. **********The fate of the Amazon rain forest has drawn worldwide interest because it is believed to be home to a large share of the world's species. Atmospheric scientists also say that extensive clearing of the rain forest may contribute to the threat of global warming. **********Alberto Setzer, who tracks burnings in the Amazon for the National Institute  for Space Research, said that in July, weather satellites detected 39,900 fires, more than four times the 8,503 fires a year earlier. In the first half of August alone, his agency's weather satellites showed 72,200 fires. In August 1994, the  figure was 61,000 for the entire month. **********\"In general we notice a very strong increase in fires in the Amazon region, and in regions where we didn't expect to see the fires,\" Mr. Setzer said. \"It means that for sure we'll have a very high figure of new deforestation this year.\" **********Elaine Prinz, a professor at the University of Wisconsin who has been studying the Amazon region using a geostationary satellite that transmits data every three hours, said the burnings were not limited to Brazil. **********\"There are millions of square kilometers covered with smoke in the Amazon basin,\" she said. \"On one day, around Aug. 30, we saw a smoke plume, over six million square kilometers covered by smoke.\" Smoke hovered over parts of Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay, she said. **********While starting fires in the virgin rain forest takes deliberate action, in this year's brittle heat the chance cigarette thrown out a car window can start  dramatic conflagrations in previously cleared areas, with the flames rolling over twigs, shrubs and dry leaves. **********Mr. Setzer and other ecologists could not be certain about the extent to which the fires involve first-time clearing of virgin rain forest because after  the 1992 Earth Summit, Brazil virtually stopped analyzing the 230 or so annual Landsat satellite images that provide an overview of deforestation, government officials said. Apart from isolated areas within the Amazon, the most recent wall-to-wall analysis of deforestation is based on images from 1991. **********Though officials here say that international accords require Brazil to analyze the images only every five years, government ecologists acknowledged that analyzing them steadily was crucial to understanding the extent of destruction. **********To critics, the gap in monitoring also throws into doubt repeated assertions  by the Brazilian Government that destruction of the rain forest has slowed in recent years. **********\"To the extent that the images are the only real data on the total deforestation of the Amazon, then the absence of the data would suggest that Brazil's claims are, shall we say, smoke and mirrors,\" said Stephan Schwartzman, a senior scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, a private American group. **********Mr. Schwartzman, who works in Washington and Brasilia, said officials from Brazil's environmental agency were typically upbeat when questioned in Congress  about cracking down on illegal logging and deforestation. \"But I've never heard  a coherent account of what they're actually doing on the ground,\" Mr. Schwartzman said. **********Mr. Barbosa, the space research director, said the analysis of the data had stopped because the Brazilian Congress had stopped allocating the $500,000 a year needed to contract the 50 or so scientists to do it, though the Institute's total budget amounts to some $25 million. \"It's simply because we didn't have the money to do it,\" he said. **********After the enormous expense of the Earth Summit and the international attention it received, Mr. Barbosa said, he appealed to government and congressional officials for money to continue analyzing deforestation, but interest seemed to wane. **********\"After that, we did not receive the same priority to maintain this study,\" he said. \"It's a strange thing to have $25 million to fund a variety of programs and not $500,000 to get this very basic information.\" **********Thelma Krug, head of the government institute's remote sensing department, said her agency could still answer isolated questions by analyzing spot data. \"But when you think we have to answer broader questions about global change, this information is really necessary and extremely fundamental,\" she said. **********Mr. Barbosa said that based on the images from 1989 to 1991, he believed destruction of the rain forest had slowed as a result of Government initiatives, but he had no complete information to substantiate the claim. **********He said that in recent months, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso had ordered the space agency to resume analysis of the Landsat images, which the agency had been collecting but not analyzing, and had provided the money through a special allocation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/28/business/international-business-forte-selling-budget-hotels-to-whitbread.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-12-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 399, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;Forte Selling Budget Hotels To Whitbread", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;Forte Selling Budget Hotels To Whitbread", "body_text": " **********Forte P.L.C. of Britain, taking another big step in its defense against a hostile takeover bid by the Granada Group P.L.C., announced plans today to sell  its restaurants and budget hotels in Britain to Whitbread P.L.C. for L1.05 billion ($1.62 billion). **********Forte, trying to show shareholders that it can raise cash from the company's  holdings faster than Granada, has recently raised about $1.7 billion through asset sales. **********The deal with Whitbread, a British brewing concern, is conditional on Forte's fending off Granada's buyout offer of L3.2 billion ($4.9 billion) initiated in November. **********Granada's chief executive, Gerry Robinson, deplored the Forte deal with Whitbread as \"bad news for shareholders\" and said it should help persuade them to sell to his company. **********\"It is a poor price,\" Mr. Robinson asserted. \"It is tax inefficient.

But what happens when the welfare checks stop? \"Not a lot of people have thought about it,\" says LaDonna Pavetti, a researcher at the Urban Institute. **********They will soon have to. A dozen states have already received Federal waivers  to set time limits. The others will probably not even have to ask: both the House and Senate welfare bills would drop any requirement to provide monthly stipends. But researchers who watched the states cope in haphazard fashion with  rising caseloads in the early 1990's are not sanguine about the consequences. **********At best, they say, time limits on cash benefits will force the dependent poor and the bureaucrats who serve them to focus on finding work for the able-bodied. Those who cannot find work on their own will be shunted into public service jobs that teach the value of work and help to break the cycle of dependence. **********But it is also possible that welfare will become meaner as well as leaner. Tens of thousands now live on the streets. Perhaps Americans will learn to turn  their backs on tens of thousands more. **********The idea of time limits was part of what Judy Gueron, president of the nonprofit Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, calls \"the liberal-conservative consensus\" that dominated thinking about welfare for much of the last decade. From this perspective, public assistance was a right -- but  only as long as those who needed it did their best to get off it. **********Society would never abandon the irredeemably dependent. But the notion of a fixed limit on cash grants meshed with the new emphasis on \"workfare.\" Some, it  was assumed, would find jobs before the time limit. The rest would earn their welfare checks raking leaves, helping in child-care centers or cleaning storm drains. **********The catch, well known to policy specialists if not to taxpayers, is that workfare is very expensive unless a high percentage of chronic welfare recipients find jobs. For even if public service jobs pay little, the cost of providing day care and administering the programs would far exceed the cost of welfare as usual. Indeed, it was fear of the price tag that stood in the way of  welfare reform on the workfare model during the Bush and early Clinton years. **********But the liberal-conservative consensus is gone, victim to the priorities of the new Republican majority in Congress. If the Republicans have their way, there will be no new money for public service jobs. Indeed, there will be $100 billion less for welfare over the next seven years. What's more, states will be  free to spend fixed block grants any way they please. **********How they please will almost certainly include time limits: 24 states have already applied for waivers to set limits. And while a few are committed to workfare, the link between time limits and jobs of last resort is fraying and will likely be severed once state legislatures understand that Federal aid is no longer linked to the ambitions of state welfare programs. **********Everyone expects deadlines to create \"a sense of urgency\" among welfare recipients, says David Butler, a policy analyst at the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation and the co-author of the organization's first study of time-limited welfare. But just how far will a kick in the pants move the welfare system? **********The typical user of welfare is off the dole within two years. But the majority of those on welfare at any one time are there to stay: Ms. Pavetti estimates that three-quarters of four million to five million adults currently on welfare will remain dependent for at least five years. And she is skeptical that a large proportion of them can soon be bullied or cajoled into private-sector jobs. **********Even if they could, it is far from clear that the bitterly competitive market for unskilled labor would make room for them. Sheila and Sheldon Danziger of the University of Michigan found that just one-third of the nonelderly adults without children forced off Michigan's \"general assistance\" welfare roles in 1992 snagged full-time jobs within two years. And those were years of falling unemployment. \"All bets are off for recessions,\" Mr. Danziger concludes. **********So what happens to the losers? Those who subscribe to the old workfare consensus hope that the prospect of poor families living on the streets will force Americans to face up to the reality that reducing dependence is a time-consuming and expensive business. **********But Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution is skeptical it will come to that. More likely, extreme poverty will be driven underground, as families stripped of welfare grants get by on a combination of temporary work, food stamps, Medicaid, charity and help from relatives. **********\"We shouldn't kid ourselves that time limits will make most recipients' lives better,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/23/world/world-news-briefs-serial-murderer-is-jailed-for-life-in-britain.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-11-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 96, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "World News Briefs;Serial Murderer Is Jailed For Life in Britain", "print_headline": "World News Briefs;Serial Murderer Is Jailed For Life in Britain", "body_text": " **********One of Britain's most infamous murderers was sentenced to prison for life today, protesting she was innocent of torturing and killing 10 women and girls,  including a daughter and a stepdaughter. **********The lawyer for the killer, Rosemary West, 41, said afterward, \"We are actively pursuing an appeal.\" **********Throughout the seven-week trial, Mrs. West blamed all the killings on her husband, Frederick West.

It also is the first day of what looks like a long siege of uncertainty and belt-tightening for the Securities and Exchange Commission, the chief regulator of the nation's securities markets. **********When it opens for business tomorrow, the S.E.C. will be operating under a Federal stop-gap spending plan that will entail at least a temporary cut in its  budget. (By the way, anyone filing a new securities offering tomorrow should check to see if the plan has altered the S.E.C.'s fee schedule.) **********Even beyond this short-term budget squeeze, the S.E.C. faces 1996 with prospects that bode ill for its ability to keep pace with the expanding size and accelerating pace of the American markets. Indeed, the best it can hope for seems to be a freezing of its 1996 budget at 1995 levels - about $297 million, a figure already endorsed by the House. **********It might fare worse: until the 11th hour last week, Republican Senator Phil Gramm of Texas was pushing for a 20 percent budget cut. By late Thursday, Republican Senator Alfonse D'Amato of New York had written Mr. Gramm to urge him to agree to a zero-cut budget for the commission. As the week ended, the Senate  had agreed to an amendment calling for a 10 percent cut. A zero-cut budget may yet emerge from the senatorial thicket, but its fate in the ill-named congressional reconciliation process is uncertain. **********What is quite certain, of course, is that no one expects -- or even wants --  the S.E.C.'s workload to remain frozen at current levels. On average, since 1980, the volume of shares traded in markets has grown by about 15 percent a year; the number of mutual funds has grown by more than 8 percent a year; and the number of registered investment advisers has grown by nearly 14 percent a year. **********Almost as certain is that the outlook is bleak for the S.E.C.'s tiny Office of Investor Education and Assistance, which Mr.  Gramm wants to eliminate as being beyond the S.E.C.'s mission -- despite arguments by the S.E.C. chairman, Arthur Levitt Jr., that fully 18 percent of the commission's enforcement cases are triggered by complaints the unit receives from investors. **********Whatever the deregulatory spirits in Congress assume, Wall Street does not support these initiatives. John L. Steffens, an executive vice president at Merrill Lynch & Company and chairman of the Securities Industry Association, said cutting the S.E.C.'s budget when its regulatory burden is growing \"just doesn't make any sense.\" Nor does the industry favor scrapping the investor education office: \"Speaking both personally and for the S.I.A., the whole issue  of educating the public is one of the things that should be a primary mission of the S.E.C.,\" he said. **********So why does the S.E.C. appear so friendless in Congress? Perhaps because its  Wall Street friends have spoken too softly in its defense. Mr. Gramm is the powerful chairman of the Senate securities subcommittee, and Wall Street is wary of alienating him. And the industry has found much that it likes in the deregulatory campaign that encompasses the S.E.C. budget issue. \"So it is hard to get people ignited on the issue,\" one industry executive said privately. For  all Wall Street's support for a strong S.E.C., he added, \"nobody has called Phil Gramm to say this is a crazy idea.\" **********The S.E.C. may well have ideological foes in Congress.

But the experts said that both groups still pose a threat to Peru's stability, even in their weakened state. **********\"If you have a small group of 20 or 30 people who are well-armed, well-trained and ideologically controlled, you can pull off a major attack like  taking over Congress or killing a general or hijacking an airplane,\" said Enrique Obando, an expert on Peru's guerrilla insurgency. \"I believe it was possible for Tupac Amaru to capture the Congress.\" **********Those detained on Nov. 30 were taken into custody after an all-night gun battle with the police at a hideout in an affluent Lima neighborhood.

That is a reason for concern because there could be other safe houses in Lima and other parts of Peru.\" **********The latest arrests come at a time when President Alberto Fujimori has been claiming victory over terrorism in Peru, a poor Andean country of 22 million people that is undergoing an economic revitalization. More than 35,000 people, mostly civilians killed by soldiers and rebels, have died in the fighting since  the early 1980's, when Shining Path and Tupac Amaru began their insurgencies. **********Mr. Fujimori, who was re-elected to a second term in April, seized dictatorial control of Peru in 1992 saying that Congress was hindering the fight against terrorism. **********But experts and diplomats said that, in response to Mr. Fujimori's aggressive and successful counterinsurgency campaign, Tupac Amaru has shifted tactics, no longer concerning itself with controlling territory or ambushing army or police  patrols. Instead, the group is undertaking \"commando-style\" missions intended to destabilize the Government and capture world attention by such as actions as capturing Congress or kidnappings. **********Tupac Amaru, which is estimated to have between 300 and 600 members, operates mainly in the upper Huallaga Valley, an area in eastern Peru controlled by guerrillas and drug traffickers. Named for an 18th-century rebel leader who fought Spanish colonial control, Tupac Amaru was founded in Lima and took up arms in 1984. **********The group had been led by Victor Polay, who was a college roommate of a former President, Alan Garcia, in the early 1970's. Mr. Polay was captured in June 1992 and is serving a life prison term, as is his lieutenant, Peter Cardenas. **********Shining Path, which has about 2,000 active members, considers Tupac Amaru a traitor to Communism, and the two groups have often warred against each other for \"taxes\" from cocaine smugglers in the Huallaga. Abimael Guzman, Shining Path's founder, was captured in Lima in 1993. **********While the Shining Path has been responsible for carrying out most guerrilla attacks in Peru, Tupac Amaru has attacked Western embassies, robbed banks, kidnapped business executives, bombed American fast-food restaurants and battled army units. **********It is believed to have tens of millions of dollars in foreign bank accounts,  mainly from levies on drug dealers and from kidnappings of businessmen and wealthy individuals who were held for ransoms often exceeding $1 million. **********In addition to its violent streak, the group had a Robin Hood image of stealing from the rich to help the poor. As a condition of releasing its kidnap  victims, the group often required that food be distributed in shantytowns. **********In last month's raid against the Tupac Amaru, the police captured the group's second-in-command, Miguel Rincon Rincon, who is known as Francisco. **********When the police presented Mr. Rincon to the public at a news conference this  week, the rebel leader said that he accepted full responsibility for his group's actions and that \"I do not repent anything.\" The group's new leader, Serpa Cartolini, remains at large. **********Lawyers for Lori Helen Berenson, the New York woman who was also arrested in  the raid, said their client had been duped into providing information that Tupac Amaru used to plan the attack on Congress.

[Page 12.] Of the eight men now under arrest, five are Israeli-born religious students. **********Ehud Sprinzak, a professor at Hebrew University and a leading Israeli expert  on the radical right, said the anger of the religious right has been building since the peace agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization two years ago, which was reached after secret talks in Oslo. **********The accord paved the way for Israel to start handing over parts of the West Bank to the Palestinians, a process that began this fall and that has led many Israeli settlers in the West Bank to accuse the Rabin Government of betraying them. The religious right took up the settlers' cause, fervent in their conviction that the region is part of Israel's biblical heritage. **********\"It has welled up in the last year or so, a conviction among the Yeshiva students that Rabin is a traitor,\" Mr. Sprinzak said. **********\"There was a process of radicalization in the late 80's with the intifada\" -- the Palestinian uprising -- \"but the real change came after Oslo. This is a disaster of the first degree for these people, a theological crisis. **********\"These are true believers,\" Mr. Sprinzak said. \"They believe it was God, not  so much the Israeli Army, but the hand of God that gave them back these lands in 1967. It was God sending a message that he was ready to redeem them. They have built a world of Torah, with Yeshivas, schools, a religious life style. Now this is committing a huge religious sin, a sin against God.\" **********At a court hearing after the shooting, Mr. Amir, according to the Hebrew transcript, said: \"According to Jewish law, the minute a Jew gives over his people and his land to the enemy, he must be killed. My whole life has been studying the Talmud and I have all the data.\" **********One conservative rabbi said that rabbis invoking religious law against Israeli leaders were also naming Acting Prime Minister Shimon Peres as a possible target. **********Police on Trail Of Spiritual Adviser **********Police Minister Moishe Shalal declined to give any names on Friday night when he spoke of a rabbinical link to the slaying. But the police are believed to be on the trail of a man they say is a spiritual adviser to those arrested, and a prominent rabbi among Jewish settlers has threatened to reveal the identity of the rabbi he says sanctioned the killing. **********\"This will be a very, very dramatic crisis,\" Mr. Sprinzak said. \"This could involve several important rabbis, very revered authorities.\" **********The rabbinical ruling of a moral imperative to kill Mr. Rabin has its roots not only in the dismay of Jewish zealots over the peace accord that will turn over what they believe to be their biblical land to the Palestinians, but also in the long-running conflicts between right and left, sacred and secular, that have marked Israel's history. **********It came amid mounting passion among the settlers and the religious right over the imminent withdrawal of the Israeli Army from the West Bank and a wave of bombings by Palestinian Islamic militants who also oppose the peace accord. **********Mr. Sprinzak recalled in an interview that this fall, after speaking on the radio, he got a call from a student at the Tomb of Joseph Yeshiva in Nablus who  said \"the situation is worse than you thought.\" Rabbis at his yeshiva, or religious school, were saying the Prime Minister must be killed, the student said. **********Indeed, Mr. Sprinzak said that only a week before the shooting he met with top security officials to discuss \"the very real possibility\" of a Jewish plot to assassinate Israeli leaders. But, he added, \"we just couldn't bring ourselves to really believe it.\" **********And by then, the police now say, there had been at least two occasions on which Mr. Amir had set out to kill Mr. Rabin, but had been thwarted. **********Unusual Interpretation Of 'Pursuer' Concept **********The lethal interpretation of religious law, according to both the police and Rabbi Yoel Ben Nun, a founder of the settlers movement who charged at an emotional meeting of the religious right that other rabbis had sanctioned the killings, revolves around the concept of the \"rodef,\" or pursuer. **********Under Jewish law, if a pursuer is chasing a Jew with the intent to kill him,  one is required to kill the pursuer to save the life of the intended victim. This is one of the few exceptions to the general rule against killing. Some settlers have considered Arabs to be rodef as a class. The Talmudic reasoning here appeared to be that Mr. Rabin's policies had put Jews in such danger that he in effect had become a pursuer himself. **********Mr. Amir's motives, Police Minister Shahal said, \"drew on Halachic rulings made by rabbis who decreed that the 'pursuer's decree' has effect on Rabin.\" Halachic rulings are oral interpretations of religious law. **********Rabbi Ben Nun, who is threatening to expose the rabbis involved unless they resign their religious posts, warned, \"there are people still callng certain people pursuers, invoking the law of pursuer about Shimon Peres.\" **********Mr. Sprinzak also suggested another religious concept, that of a \"moiser,\" meaning a Jew who surrenders other Jews to the Gentiles. The Halachic rule there, he said, \"is that the person who commits this crime should be killed.\" **********Almost as if in confirmation of such views, the agreement with the Palestinians was soon followed by scores of Jewish deaths at the hands of Islamic militants, frequently suicide bombers, who launched a wave of attacks. **********The West Bank settlers are fearful, too, that once the Israeli Army withdraws, their isolated compounds will be in great danger from Palestinian terrorists and even the Palestinian police, whom they regard as recently uniformed terrorists. **********Sparks of the Past Ignite Present Anger **********The beliefs of the religious settlers, particularly Gush Emunim, or Bloc of  the Faithful, is based largely on the teachings of Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook, who was brought in tears from his yeshiva in 1967, after the Israeli Army seized eastern Jerusalem, to the Western Wall by two paratroopers who were his former students. **********If Jews were to regain the land of biblical Israel, he held, it would be possible for the Messiah to come. **********The debate over the settlements in the occupied territories in part reflects  the struggle over the vision of Israel between the secular left and the right-wing Zionism generally known as Revisionism. **********There are constant, eerie echoes. Mr. Rabin, for example, was remembered not  only as the general who led Israel to victory in the 1967 war but also as a young officer in the Labor movement's Palmach commandoes who in 1948 fired on the Altalena, a ship bringing illegal arms to the Irgun underground. One Irgun leader, Menachem Begin, would later become Prime Minister. **********It was with the electoral victory of Mr. Begin's Likud Party in 1977 that settlement of the West Bank rapidly expanded as a matter of policy. **********There are now more than 100 Jewish settlements, ranging from clusters of prefabricated huts to virtual cities along the stony hilltops. And, in recent years, religion has come to exercise a greater role in Israeli political life as small Orthodox religious parties became critical in forming governing coalitions and extracted their price in return. **********\"In 1948, the religious were a tiny minority,\" recalled Yisrael Harel, chairman of the council of Judea and Samaria, the biblical names the settlers use for the West Bank. \"It was after the Holocaust. The big theological thinkers had been killed and there was resentment because many rabbis had been anti-Zionist. **********\"But slowly, slowly the religious have become more powerful politically,\" said Mr. Harel, who along with Rabbi Ben Nun lives in Ofra, the original Gush Emunim settlement. \"Now, Oslo has put us in a corner. The agreement is a danger to our very existence.\" **********A Deadly Parallel To an Old Underground **********The new Jewish underground that killed Mr. Rabin, the police say, appears to have almost uncanny parallels with the earlier Jewish underground growing out of Gush Emunium in 1984. **********That underground was galvanized by shock at the Camp David accords, in which  Egypt and Israel made peace and Israel promised to address the Palestinian issue. The underground set off car bombs that crippled two Palstinian mayors, and plannned to bomb five Arab commuter buses and and blow up Al-Aksa Mosque in  Jerusalem, partly in hopes of provoking a war so cataclysmic that it would hasten the arrival of the Messiah. **********Members of the group, which included a founder of the Ofra settlement, were arrested before most of the plans could be carried out. **********Like the earlier underground, the new group apparently has also consulted rabbis for approval of its plans. And, as is happening today, Rabbi Ben Nun, a moderate figure among the settlers, openly criticized the religious approval of the Jewish terrorist group, breaking sharply with other rabbis who were widely believed to be sympathetic to the underground. **********A Rabbi Warns: 'Woe Is Us!' **********Shaking with emotion, Rabbi Ben Nun vowed at a gathering of figures on the religious right Wednesday night to \"fight them before the whole people of Israel; I'm going to fight them even if I die.\" **********\"Woe is us,\" Rabbi Ben Nun cried. \"If this terrible thing is not rooted out,  if, God forbid, there will be another killing, it is doubtful there will be a Jewish state.\" **********He demanded that the rabbis resign their positions by the end of the mourning period, which will come Sunday, or else he would identify them. And, he suggested, they were prominent. \"These are not weeds or wild growths, these are  great authorities,\" he said. **********As the police continued to search for more suspects, details emerged about those arrested and their alleged terrorist cell, which seemed to have developed  from a more militant offshoot of Rabbi Kahane's Kach organization called Eyal. **********An article in the Yediot Aharonot newspaper discussed arms training and code  names and recounted a trip of young people to Hebron to support the settlers there, in which the two Amir brothers took part. **********Such trips to Hebron were one of the brothers' frequent activities. Several weeks ago, witnesses say, the two swaggered in the lead of such a group, some of whom broke ranks and attacked a line of Christian women peace activists who regularly placed themselves between the Jews and Palestinians, knocking two of them down and dragging them by their hair."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/23/business/company-news-quality-dining-purchases-grady-s-restaurant-chain.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1995-12-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 75, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;QUALITY DINING PURCHASES GRADY'S RESTAURANT CHAIN", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;QUALITY DINING PURCHASES GRADY'S RESTAURANT CHAIN", "body_text": " **********Quality Dining Inc. said yesterday that it had bought the 42-restaurant Grady's American Grill chain for $74.4 million.

The deal, the terms of which were not disclosed, is another example of the accelerating, seemingly relentless consolidation of the agency industry. **********Anderson & Lembke, as an independent shop, has been praised for its creative  skills in selling technical products from computer chips and operating systems to modems and fax machines. Billings from clients like AT&T, Agfa, Microsoft, Motorola, SAP and 3Com have doubled in the last two years, to $200 million. Interpublic, the world's third-largest agency company, with billings of $15 billion, owns global behemoths like Lintas Worldwide, the Lowe Group and McCann-Erickson Worldwide. **********Anderson & Lembke, which traces its roots to a Swedish agency started in 1970, began American operations in Stamford, Conn., in 1982. It now has 220 employees in offices in New York, San Francisco and Amsterdam. A cover article this month in the trade publication Advertising Age's Creativity described Anderson & Lembke as \"perhaps the consummate business-to-business agency,\" which \"might at last be ready to cross over into the mainstream\" because many of the products it pitches are now being aimed at consumers as well as business users. **********\"It's a really terrific agency with a very different philosophy of doing business that focuses on the creative product,\" said John J. Dooner Jr., chairman and chief executive of McCann Worldwide in New York. Though Anderson & Lembke will report directly to him, he added, it will operate autonomously under present management. **********\"Domestically we'll give them systems, media and management support,\" Mr. Dooner said, while overseas, \"I'm hoping we'll be able to expand their capabilities,\" for instance, by helping Anderson & Lembke open additional offices. **********From 1989 to 1992, Anderson & Lembke was owned by another large agency company, Chiat/Day/Mojo, but regained its independence in a buyout by top managers. Those same executives -- Steve Trygg, 48, chairman and chief creative  officer, and Hans Ullmark, 49, president and chief executive -- have now agreed  to sell the agency to Interpublic. William S. Keating, associate general counsel of Interpublic in New York, said the two parties expected the transaction to be  completed by the end of the month. **********This is the most recent in a skein of Interpublic purchases during the last two years, which included Scali, McCabe, Sloves; the Martin Agency; Ammirati & Puris; Western International Media, and half of Campbell Mithun Esty. **********Interpublic was involved in a second transaction yesterday, agreeing to form  a joint venture with All American Communications in Santa Monica, Calif., to buy substantially all of the assets of Mark Goodson Productions in Los Angeles, which produces and licenses game shows like \"The Price is Right,\" for $50 million and future bonus payments. **********Those transactions are emblematic of an industrywide buying binge by giants like Interpublic, the Omnicom Group and True North Communications, which have strong cash flow and little debt. They are eager to extend their dominance by snapping up successful smaller shops. **********\"One factor is a practical realization that clients want and need power,\" Mr. Dooner said, \"especially to take brands globally in an efficient way.\" **********Mr. Ullmark, speaking from San Francisco, agreed that \"the driving force\" of  the deal, as he put it, was meeting the increasingly multinational demands of clients rather than \"the personal greed thing.\" **********\"Steve and I felt limited,\" he said, referring to Mr. Trygg, \"because all of  our clients are going global on a large scale. **********\"They kept asking over and over, 'How can you help us in Latin America, in the Pacific Rim?' and we had to say we couldn't,\" he added. \"Now we can offer them ways of getting to global advertising.\" **********For example, Mr. Ullmark said, \"we're already working with McCann on an office in Hong Kong,\" though in the United States \"we're going to compete; we're actually in a couple of pitches against McCann.\" **********Mr. Dooner traced the deal to a meeting he said he had with Mr. Trygg perhaps eight months ago. **********\"The more we talked, the more we felt we shared some ideals and dreams,\" he added. **********Mr. Ullmark said the acquisition was appealing because Mr. Dooner said Anderson & Lembke \"can be very independent,\" adding that he and Mr. Trygg were looking to \"what we call the Goodby model.\" His reference was to the autonomy enjoyed by Goodby, Silverstein & Partners, the creatively focused agency in San  Francisco owned by Omnicom. **********\"I can't have bosses, personally,\" Mr. Ullmark said, \"but John Dooner is an interesting guy and I don't mind working with him, to tell the truth.\" **********Mr. Ullmark said he and Mr. Trygg would give part of the sale proceeds to all of Anderson & Lembke's other employees, based on a \"share value plan\" devised a  year and a half ago. **********One jewel in the Anderson & Lembke crown is a relationship with the Microsoft Corporation, for which the agency's San Francisco office has created print product campaigns with spending estimated at $75 million. Those ads complement the work produced by Wieden & Kennedy in Portland, Ore., which handles the consumer portion of the Microsoft account.

F. Shattuck, the State Department's top human rights official, went to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, near Dayton, Ohio, to  meet with President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and seek his cooperation. The talks are being held at the air base. **********Nicholas Burns, the State Department spokesman, said Mr. Milosevic promised that the United States, the Red Cross and the United Nations would have direct access to sites in Banja Luka, Srebrenica and Zepa, towns in Bosnia and Herzegovina where the United States believes vast human rights abuses, even slaughters, have occurred. **********The United States is taking great pains not to criticize Mr. Milosevic -- who is negotiating for the Bosnian Serbs at Dayton -- for allowing the reported massacres to happen. But the American side clearly believes he could be more cooperative in reining in the Bosnian Serbs. **********\"The oral commitment has been good,\" Mr. Burns said. \"The practice has been pretty good. We'd like to have a higher degree perhaps of performance, and we continue to make that point.\" **********The purpose of Mr. Shattuck's trip is \"to have him, as our chief official here concerned with human rights, look into and investigate the allegations of human rights abuses,\" said Mr. Burns, adding that the United States finds the allegations credible. **********By getting Mr. Shattuck involved on the scene in Bosnia, the United States hopes to deflect criticism that it has elevated Mr. Milosevic to a negotiating partner with the same standing as the Bosnian and Croatian Presidents. The Bush  Administration branded Mr. Milosevic a probable war criminal. **********Washington also hopes to allay some of the concerns of Bosnian officials, who insist that \"you cannot speak of peace in Dayton and still have ethnic cleansing in Banja Luka,\" as one put it. **********In the opening session on Wednesday, President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia appealed to Mr. Milosevic and to the American, French, German, British and Russian delegations to take measures to end atrocities in Banja Luka. **********Mr. Shattuck is also to pursue the case of David Rohde, a correspondent from  The Christian Science Monitor, who has not been heard from since Sunday. **********The State Department sharply criticized the Bosnian Serbs who, according to the Bosnian Serb press agency, detained Mr. Rohde in Zvornik on charges that he  had illegally crossed the border into Bosnian Serb territory with false documents. **********Mr. Rohde, 28, headed into the area on Sunday, apparently intending to follow up stories he had written about atrocities that ethnic Serbs were accused of committing when the Muslim enclave at Srebrenica was overrun. **********\"We are demanding two things: we want to have immediate consular access to him and want him released immediately,\" Mr. Burns said. \"There is no justification for holding him.\" **********Earlier in the day, Mr. Burns suggested that Mr. Milosevic himself could be more helpful on this matter, saying, \"We expect that President Milosevic, as leader of the Serb-Bosnian Serb delegation, will use his influence to help in this. He has said he will do so.\" **********At the talks today in Dayton, the three delegations spent much of the day poring over four draft agreements presented to them on Thursday by the United States. **********Saturday will be largely a day of recreation. Some of the Serbs, Bosnians and Croats will be \"seeing movies, going bowling, swimming, and there's a soccer match planned,\" Mr. Burns said.

It was its second intervention this month. The peso had weakened to more than 8 to the dollar, a little more than 12 cents. With the purchases, it rebounded to settle here at 7.7 to the dollar. The peso has lost a little more than 17 percent of its value since early October. **********Mr. Ortiz remained steadfast in his speech, his first broad statement since  the peso went into its recent slide. \"Speculators will not make us change our course,\" he said. The Finance Minister had chosen to remain silent and wait for  this long-scheduled appearance before the House of Deputies to answer the markets with an overview of Mexico's economic plan for 1996. **********Today, he did not announce any major economic changes, and he reiterated projections for Mexican economic performance next year that many private economists had already rejected as unrealistic. **********The Government says that it expects the peso to hold to an average rate in 1996 of 7.7 to the dollar. Growth, it predicts, will be about 3 percent after inflation, which will not exceed 21 percent, Mr. Ortiz said. **********He repeated his 1996 growth estimate -- one that the Government has given for months -- even while saying that the economy this year would shrink by about 6 percent, a greater retraction than forecast early in 1995. Mexico is in the midst of a recession set in motion by a bungled, two-stage devaluation of the peso in December 1994. **********Analysts said they hoped that Mr. Ortiz would announce a more forceful program to fortify the nation's weakened banking system, which received new blows this week as the Government raised short-term interest rates above 50 percent. Some reports said overnight lending rates had reached 75 percent. **********Economists did not find in Mr. Ortiz's speech any initiative that would generate the growth that big investors want to see before they begin returning to Mexico. The stock market was down modestly, off just over one-half of 1 percent, at 2,241.53. **********\"This Government has been able to bring the patient to a stable condition,\" said Jorge Mariscal, director for Latin American equity research at Goldman, Sachs & Company. \"But now, the markets are asking when the patient will be able  to get up and walk out of the hospital. It's still not clear.\" **********Mr. Ortiz dismissed the recent peso turmoil as the result of \"purely speculative attitudes\" that \"have nothing to do with the real conditions of our  economy.\" He said the peso would eventually stabilize, but cautioned that this might take several weeks. The Government, he added, would keep interest rates high to support the peso, but only as a temporary measure. **********Mr. Ortiz's budget was a compendium of careful fiscal policies that agencies  like the International Monetary Fund have long required for wayward economies. Overall spending will slightly decrease, and the central bank will keep firm control on inflation. **********His strategy is to pursue these policies consistently, in a way that restores foreign investors' faith in Mexico's reliability. But those investors do not seem to be satisfied with reliability alone. **********They are eager to spot signs that Mexico can find ways to spur growth, and seem to regard Mr. Ortiz's restatements of policy as evidence of a lack of imagination to take the necessary steps. **********Traders estimate that the central bank entered the market today with about $75 million to buy pesos. Officials at the bank confirmed that the amount was less than a peso purchase last Thursday, estimated at $200 million, but did not  disclose the figure. **********Central bank officials denied that they were forced to move after Mr. Ortiz's speech failed to stem the peso's fall.

The negative sentiment also spilled  over into blue-chip stocks, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling 42.99 points, to 4,726.22. [Page D14.] **********The initial catalyst for the decline was an announcement late Friday by Novell Inc. that its fourth-quarter financial results would fall far short of Wall Street estimates. But analysts noted that Novell was only the latest in a series of big technology companies to disappoint in the September quarter, and they expected more to follow. **********Technology stocks, which have led the broader stock market higher all year, have had a series of one-day selloffs in the last few months that were followed  by immediate rebounds. But because there was more bad news after the close of the market yesterday, some analysts concluded that this decline might last longer. **********Motorola Inc. reported earnings of 81 cents a share, slightly below the average estimate of 83 cents, based on 25 analysts surveyed by IBES International. Sequent Computer Systems also said that its earnings would fall below estimates. **********In addition, orders for computer chips dropped 2.1 percent in September, although the ratio of new orders to sales remained positive, an industry association reported. **********\"We're going to see a selloff until you see some flow of good numbers,\" said  Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock Letter, \"and that will not happen until next week, if it happens at all. The rest of this week is going to be anticipation and fear of more negative surprises.\" **********The Microsoft Corporation is to report its third-quarter earnings next week,  and many analysts expect them to be positive. But if they are disappointing -- or perhaps, just on target -- this could lead to more selling. **********After any sharp run-up in the market, analysts worry about what they call corrections -- sharp selloffs as investors decide that the rally is over or that it has just gone too far too fast. Because of such correction jitters, bad news  is more damaging and even usually positive news can be interpreted negatively, setting off selling as money managers try to lock in profits before prices plunge. **********But corrections are also seen as positive because once over, there is room for stocks to rally again. **********Novell attributed its expectation of lower earnings to a steep drop in the sales of its Wordperfect line of personal computer applications, primarily due to the fact that the company had not yet shipped versions of the programs tailored to Microsoft's new operating system, Windows 95. **********Novell said applications sales could fall 56 percent, to $59 million, from $134 million in the period a year earlier, and that it expected earnings of 15 cents to 18 cents a share while the consensus estimate had been for the company  to earn 28 cents. **********In response, Novell shares plummeted $2.75 yesterday, to $14.625, in Nasdaq trading. **********Although Novell's problems in the quarter were partly predictable, and partly specific to the company, analysts said they contributed to a growing anxiety among investors about technology stocks in general. After a dramatic run-up in the first eight months of the year, many analysts have suggested that the group  is ripe for a selloff, and any piece of bad news from a major company can act as a catalyst. I.B.M. began a series of earnings warnings from large companies on Sept. 13. **********\"Anybody who follows Novell closely was probably not surprised by the announcement Friday, but in terms of the technology-stock anxiety, it just reinforced what was already going on,\" said Peter Rogers, an analyst with Bear,  Stearns & Company in San Francisco. He noted that his index of 31 software stocks was up 135 percent since June 1994, so some sort of correction was inevitable. **********\"One has to view this as painful in the short term, but healthy in the long run,\" Mr. Rogers said. **********Technology companies appeared to defy their usual seasonal dip this summer, and confident analysts began talking about a \"secular change,\" spurred largely by the unexpected growth of the consumer computer market and a similarly unexpected surge in use of the Internet. The introduction of Windows 95 in August was also seen as a spur to continued growth. **********But as third-quarter results begin to be announced, there is a growing perception that growth has slowed, and indeed, that Windows 95 may not have met  analysts' high expectations. **********Mr. Murphy said that after a few false starts, technology stocks had entered  the long-anticipated correction. **********\"It's what we had feared; the industry had built up too much inventory in anticipation of Windows 95,\" he said. \"They believed the Microsoft hype, and it  clearly is not happening.\" He said he expected canceled orders for chips and other components, and retail price cuts that would keep technology stocks depressed for three to four months. **********Firm numbers for Windows 95 sales are not yet available, and will not be until Microsoft reports its results next week, but anecdotal evidence is beginning to show up indicating that its sales are strong, but not up to the most optimistic estimates. Microsoft's European president, Bernard Vergnes, said yesterday that there was excess Windows 95 stock in distribution channels. **********\"The problem is they shipped 8 million to 10 million copies on Day One, and we only expect them to sell 10 million copies in total over the next 18 months,\" said Rick Sherlund, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs. \"The distribution channel was reluctant to under-order -- they didn't know what would happen -- so everyone over-ordered,\" he said. \"The sell-through rate is not living up to the  original hype.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/23/business/new-disclosure-on-arakis-head-s-stock-sales.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-11-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 608, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Disclosure on Arakis Head's Stock Sales", "print_headline": "New Disclosure on Arakis Head's Stock Sales", "body_text": " **********The president of the Arakis Energy Corporation, Terry Alexander, sold 198,837 shares of the company's stock in August, an insider trading report filed recently with the British Columbia Securities Commission shows, even though Mr.  Alexander said at the time that he had not sold any stock. **********The disclosure is likely to raise questions among Arakis shareholders, who saw their investment plunge in the weeks after Mr. Alexander's stock sale. **********Mr. Alexander could not be reached for comment today on the securities filing. **********Shares in Arakis, which is seeking to develop oilfields and a pipeline in the Sudan, were among the most active issues on the Nasdaq market last summer.

After a day of counting papers marked in Gaelic and English, \"Ta-Yes\" to end the ban or \"Nil-No,\" the country had to wait until this evening for the result. **********The \"yes\" result came as the Dublin area, home to a third of Ireland's population, voted heavily to allow divorce and as rural areas, while voting mostly \"no,\" gave measure more support than in 1986, when the last divorce referendum proposal was defeated 2 to 1. **********\"It's been a very worrying day, but it was a clear verdict,\" said Prime Minister John Bruton, whose Government proposed and fought vigorously to remove  the prohibition. **********There was no immediate comment from church leaders. **********The change to the Constitution will make it possible for a couple to obtain a divorce after living apart for four years, and means that one partner can secure a divorce without the other's consent. There are an estimated 80,000 people now  involved in broken marriages, many living with new partners and children. **********The referendum was in part a test of the authority of the church, whose leaders acknowledge that its image, and possibly its influence, have been weakened by a series of cases involving priests accused of sexually abusing children. **********Although priests spoke against divorce from their pulpits, bishops said that  Catholics could vote their conscience, and that a \"yes\" vote would not be a sin. **********One leader of the anti-divorce campaign, Des Hanafin, said as he conceded defeat, \"I believe that divorce will have a terrible effect.\" **********Another opponent, Rory O'Hanlon, a well-known retired judge, said he was considering a court challenge to invalidate the result. He noted that the Supreme Court had already ruled that the Government had to stop spending public money in the campaign, and said that might be grounds for arguing that the vote was invalid. **********If there is no challenge in the high court within 21 days, the approved amendment will go to the Prime Minister, who will pass it to the President, who  signs it into effect. **********In the rancorous campaign, the anti-divorce groups, led by the influential church hierarchy, argued that a \"yes\" vote would introduce a divorce culture that would undermine the country's Christian values, weaken the value of Catholic wedding vows and send Ireland reeling into an irreligious way of life.  They cited statistics to show that divorce had corrupted other Catholic countries, like Italy and France, where divorce rates are rising. **********Opponents also argued that divorce would lead to the division of farms into small parcels. In Ireland, land ownership is almost as sacred as religion, as the national memory recalls the centuries in which the Irish were denied property rights under English colonialism. Divorce, they argued, would lead to the formation of new families that would deprive original families of their land. **********They said divorce would lead as well to a tax increase to support broken families. **********They also argued that children would be hurt by divorce and remarriage. One of the campaign's most striking billboards said: \"Hello Divorce. Bye-Bye Daddy.\" **********The opponents largely ignored statistics showing that most separations in Ireland are now sought by women, often by wives who have been repeatedly assaulted by their husbands, or whose children had been subjected to paternal incest. **********The Bruton Government and all the major political parties supported the \"yes\" campaign. They said that couples who are now legally separated should have the civil right of divorce and remarriage, and that statistics showed that Italy, which allows divorce, has a lower rate of broken marriages than Ireland. **********The Government denied that there would be a tax increase.

What the Administration defined two years ago as a supercomputer requiring Government approval for sale abroad is today a widely available desktop computer used by businesses from banks to movie animators. **********The proposal, Administration officials said, would help American manufacturers sell billions of dollars of powerful computers to civilian customers in China, Russia, Israel, Pakistan and India. **********They said exports to military customers in those countries would remain under tighter controls. **********\"If you try to control the uncontrollable, it's not tough and pious,\" one senior official said. \"It's feckless and wasteful of Government resources. We'd  like to target our resources to where we think we could make a difference.\" **********But Gary Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control, said the Administration was about to make a crucial tool available to countries building missiles and nuclear weapons. **********He denounced the proposal to relax export controls as a \"political decision designed to help California\" and said the Chinese, among others, would inevitably order the computers for civilian uses and then give them to the military. **********Mr. Clinton has not yet formally approved the proposal, which was worked out  after months of wrangling among the Defense, State, Energy and Commerce Departments. **********But an Administration official said Mr. Clinton told Israeli officials last week that he intended to liberalize the rules that have made it difficult for Israel and many other countries to buy advanced computers from the United States. **********Announcement of a decision, which Administration officials said was expected  within days, is likely to stir criticism on Capitol Hill. Several lawmakers, including Representative Floyd Spence, the South Carolina Republican who is chairman of the House National Security Committee, have already written to Mr. Clinton and urged him to reconsider. **********The letter expressed particular concern that India, Pakistan and China -- countries with \"major nuclear and other advanced weapons programs\" -- might obtain computers as powerful as those used to design this country's most sophisticated weapons. **********The proposal was sent to Mr. Clinton after months of intense lobbying by the  computer industry. Several Washington-based advocates for the industry said they had been reminding the White House in recent weeks of the computer industry's importance to California, Texas and Massachusetts. **********\"For years and years, Administrations have had this attitude: when in doubt,  control it, without taking a serious look at what the technology is used for and whether or not we can actually control it,\" said Greg Garcia, senior manager of  the American Electronics Association. \"This Administration is asking those questions appropriately.\" **********Current rules require computer manufacturers to apply for Commerce Department licenses to export any computer more powerful than 1,500 MTOP's, or million theoretical operations per second. Lower thresholds are set country by country.  The MTOP is a standard measure of how fast a computer operates. **********Industry officials complain that proposed sales are sometimes delayed for months while the Government reviews whether the buyer is involved in illicit weapons programs. Sometimes Government officials will allow the sale only if the manufacturers take expensive security precautions like monitoring the machines 24 hours a day. **********Administration officials said the plan before Mr. Clinton would create a multi-tiered system that would determine the appropriate treatment for a country based on its history, the state of its nuclear and missile programs and the identity of the customer planning to use the computer. **********Officials said the Clinton Administration planned to maintain the ban on exports of powerful computers to Iran, Iraq, North Korea and Libya. American intelligence agencies say each of these countries is actively trying to develop  nuclear weapons. **********On the other hand, most remaining restrictions on sales to allies like Britain or France would be lifted. And friendly countries without nuclear arms programs could import machines of up to 10,000 MTOP's for civilian uses. Anything larger would still require an export license. **********The plan before Mr. Clinton would lift restrictions on exports of American computers of less than 2,000 MTOP's, both civilian and military. A rule that forbids American manufacturers from selling powerful computers to anyone using them to make nuclear weapons would remain in effect, and the Administration intends to give companies additional training in how to recognize suspect users. This change alone is important to manufacturers because it permits companies to  sell the more powerful work stations, which are the heart of a modern computing  network. **********Administration officials said the most hotly debated issue among the agencies was how much to loosen controls over sales of powerful computers to Israel, India, Pakistan, Syria, Egypt, China and Russia. These countries are classified  by American officials as having a nuclear arsenal or having attempted in the past to produce missiles and other weapons of mass destruction. **********Under a plan advanced by the Pentagon and eventually adopted by the other agencies, civilian customers in these countries could import computers slower than 7,000 MTOP's without Commerce Department review and approval. Officials said the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency had suggested that the Government be given 20 to 30 days to veto such sales, but that option was rejected by other agencies. **********Military users in those countries could import computers of 2,000 to 7,000 MTOP's, but only after obtaining an export license. **********Several Administration officials expressed concern that more powerful computers sold to China or other countries in this category might be diverted from civilian to military uses. They said the line between military and civilian uses was hazy in several of these countries, particularly China, which has been  largely unsuccessful in developing its own high-performance computers. **********With the advent of the nuclear test ban next year, they said, nuclear powers  like China will have to rely on computer simulations to test the designs for new warheads. **********Controls over the export of computers date to the cold war. As recently as 1991, the United States and Japan -- which dominate the high-performance computer industry and have agreed to cooperate on setting rules for exports -- defined supercomputers as 195 MTOP's. After negotiating with Japan, the Clinton Administration raised the level to 1,500 in late 1993. **********By February of this year, the computer industry was pressing the Clinton Administration to revisit the issue. A study financed by the Commerce Department and completed in August concluded that the industry had leapfrogged past the controls. **********It said the basic work for a nuclear program could be done on widely available machines, and more powerful computers were needed only for \"second generation\" bombs. **********Some industry officials, including Mr. Garcia of the American Electronics Association, are arguing for an end to all controls. He said countries could already evade the rules by buying smaller computers and lashing them together with software allowing them to work in parallel, or by interlinking them in networks."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/19/world/haitian-leader-s-angry-words-unnerve-elite-and-worry-allies.html": {"writer_name": "Larry Rohter", "pub_date": "1995-11-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1452, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Haitian Leader's Angry Words Unnerve Elite and Worry Allies", "print_headline": "Haitian Leader's Angry Words Unnerve Elite and Worry Allies", "body_text": " **********With an emotional outburst at the funeral of a slain relative a week ago, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide set off an outbreak of street violence, provoked panic among Haiti's elite and undermined his relations with the United  States and other members of the international coalition that restored him to power a year ago. **********At least seven people have been killed and more than a score wounded in the unrest that erupted after Mr. Aristide urged his followers a week ago today to \"go to the neighborhoods where there are big houses and heavy weapons\" to help the police disarm \"the big men with heavy weapons\" and other suspected wrongdoers. **********Do not sit idly by, do not wait,\" he demanded in an impassioned eulogy for  Jean-Hubert Feuille, a cousin and close political associate. **********Since then, dozens of homes of suspected Aristide opponents have been burned  or looted, a radio station critical of the President has been attacked and vigilante squads have erected roadblocks and stopped and searched vehicles. In the coastal town of Gonaives earlier this week, Nepalese soldiers who are part of the United Nations peacekeeping force clashed with a pro-Aristide mob, firing shots into the air to disperse them, while in the northern town of Limbe, 21 foreign relief workers, 16 of them Americans, took refuge in a hospital after a  band of Aristide supporters became unruly. **********Mr. Aristide's tirade also included sharp criticism of what he described as the failure of the United Nations mission here to disarm Tontons Macoutes and other members of hostile paramilitary groups. Foreign officials who have been working closely with the Aristide Government in efforts to build democracy here  after nearly three decades of dictatorship described themselves as shocked and even betrayed by the President's unexpected behavior. **********\"He wanted to flex some muscle and take aim at an issue important to all Haitians, but he went way too far, and has brought the process of national reconciliation almost to a halt,\" one diplomat said. Another said: \"He played with fire a little bit, and I'm sure he did it on purpose. He was sending everyone a message.\" **********But a close aide to Mr. Aristide said he had not intended to encourage violence in the streets, only to get the attention of the international community before the scheduled departure of the United Nations troops at the end of February. **********\"Some slogans against the United Nations mission have been appearing, and he  was telling them they must do more disarmament so that the people will kiss them and dance with them again,\" the aide said. **********After meeting with Mr. Aristide on Monday, Lakhdar Brahimi, who heads the United Nations mission here, scoffed at the idea of a widening rift between Haiti's Government and the United Nations. **********\"We have no problems or difficulties,\" Mr. Brahimi said. Disarmament efforts  will continue, he said, adding, \"One cannot find things which are only said to be here or there.\" But he also urged Haitians not to respond to Mr. Aristide's call for vigilantism. **********\"The Constitution and the law say that it is the police who are responsible for keeping order, and not self-declared volunteers who say they are,\" he said. **********With Haitians scheduled to go to the polls Dec. 17 to choose a successor to Mr. Aristide, \"the latest violence has thrown a shadow over the presidential campaign,\" the Port-au-Prince newspaper Le Nouvelliste declared this week. **********The incidents of violence by vigilantes and intimidation against perceived opponents of Mr. Aristide coincided with the registration period for presidential candidates, and dropped off as it came to an end on Wednesday. Many of Mr. Aristide's most fervent supporters have called for the vote to be canceled altogether so he would remain in office. Under Haiti's Constitution, the President cannot serve two consecutive terms. **********The crisis began on Nov. 7, when Mr. Feuille, a newly seated member of Parliament, was shot and killed by unknown assailants as he arrived at the home  of another lawmaker. The two men had earlier that day attended the swearing-in ceremony of Haiti's new Prime Minister, Claudette Werleigh, and stopped at a bank, where they withdrew several thousand dollars. That money disappeared in the shooting, but the Haitian Government has said it regarded Mr. Feuille's death as an assassination. Within hours, the police began searching for suspected arms caches among supporters of the former military rulers. **********One of those whose arrest was sought was Gen. Prosper Avril, a former military dictator. But since taking refuge in the Colombian Embassy on the day of the killing, General Avril has been granted asylum and negotiations are under way to gain his safe passage out of the country. **********Last Saturday's outburst was uncharacteristic for Mr. Aristide, who since returning from three years in exile on Oct. 15, 1994, has steadfastly preached reconciliation, peace and patience. **********\"It is the first time that I have spoken like this since my return to Haiti,\" he acknowledged toward the end of the eulogy, delivered from a church pulpit as  Haitians cheered wildly and the diplomatic corps sat by silently and grimly. **********For the political and economic elite that has always distrusted Mr. Aristide, his remarks stirred memories of the incendiary oratory he employed shortly before being overthrown by the military in September 1991. Fearing the worst, some prominent political and business figures have quietly left the country, while others have approached friends at foreign embassies, seeking guarantees of protection. **********\"The private sector has a great deal of fear,\" said a businessman who has generally supported Mr. Aristide. \"Things are very tense.\" **********Mr. Aristide's aides and supporters maintain that his outburst, and the violence it provoked, were spontaneous responses to a deeply felt personal tragedy. **********\"It was an emotional reaction,\" said Jean-Robert Sabalat, who was briefly Mr. Aristide's Foreign Minister in 1991 and is now a member of the Senate. \"Now everything is calm and back to normal.\" **********But Mr. Aristide's opponents argue that his real motives are otherwise. \"There is a political strategy behind this campaign,\" intended to make the presidential election meaningless, said Evans Paul, a former ally and Mayor of Port-au-Prince who broke with the President after this summer's parliamentary elections. **********On Wednesday, Mr. Aristide's Lavalas movement chose Rene Preval, a former Prime Minister who heads a foundation that finances small development projects,  as its candidate, and he is expected to win handily. Most major opposition parties are boycotting the election, and the field of 14 includes candidates from such obscure entities as the Virgin Mary Party and Haitian Party of God as  well as three senators running as independents. **********Relations between Mr. Aristide's Government and the United Nations coalition  that brought him back to power have been fraying since Prime Minister Smarck Michel stepped down last month. Mr. Michel resigned and was replaced by Mrs. Werleigh after failing to persuade Mr. Aristide to carry out an agreement signed with Haiti's creditors to privatize nine state companies. **********As a result of the Government's failure to move ahead with that program, the  United States is withholding $4.6 million in aid, some $100 million in other foreign assistance is also in jeopardy, and the value of the gourde has dropped  by 20 percent. That has not only frustrated the Government, which sent Finance Jean-Marie Cherestal off to Taiwan in an unsuccessful quest for money, but also appears to have reduced the leverage of the United States and its allies over Mr. Aristide. **********Mr. Aristide's funeral eulogy, which was broadcast repeatedly on television and radio for several days afterward, included what many interpreted as a jab at the United States Ambassador here, William L. Swing, and Mr. Brahimi, the chief  of the United Nations mission, who were seated together at the funeral. **********\"I am reminding you that until further notice there are not two or three heads of state, but just one,\" Mr. Aristide said. **********In addition, he suggested that a second term for the Clinton Administration is linked to his success or failure here. **********\"The month of November 1995 must be a month of peace, a month of success, so  the month of November 1996 can be a success also in the United States,\" he said. **********Mr. Aristide also pointedly reminded American and United Nations officials of the profound emotional hold and bond he has with the Haitian people. \"Dear friends of the international community, I know you need me just as I need you,\"  he said. **********To many diplomats here, that is perhaps the chief lesson of the week's unrest. **********\"It doesn't matter whether Aristide is sitting in the presidential palace, or retires to his home in Tabarre\" after his scheduled departure from office on   Feb. 7, one diplomat said. \"He will still be the one who has the power in this country.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/14/business/company-news-black-decker-to-sell-a-technology-unit.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1995-12-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 98, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;BLACK & DECKER TO SELL A TECHNOLOGY UNIT", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;BLACK & DECKER TO SELL A TECHNOLOGY UNIT", "body_text": " **********The Black & Decker Corporation of Towson, Md., agreed yesterday to sell PRC Inc., its information technology and services business, to Litton Industries for $425 million.

Trump, who delivered a commencement speech at Lehigh University several years ago, said he had been asked \"to give commencement speeches in return for an honorary degree a number of times.\" **********With slim purses, such degrees are often the shiniest coin many schools have  to lure prominent executives. **********\"With a big celebrity speaker, the school might say, 'We only have $3,000, so we'll pay your air fare and give you an honorary degree,' \" said Kevin MacRae, vice president for college speaking at Lordly & Dame. **********And, just as in business, connections count. \"A lot of the schools never go through a speakers' bureau,\" Mr. MacRae said. \"They go through powerful alumni or somebody in the president's office.\" **********Those connections count more when times are tough -- as they seem to be for universities now. \"So many schools are broke,\" said Anne Wold, vice president for college engagements at the Washington Speakers Bureau. \"We didn't have a lot of calls this year; they're probably calling in favors. When I see in the paper  one of our people is speaking and they didn't go through us, I know there was some good wheeling and dealing going on.\" **********Also as in business, brand value counts big. Mr. MacRae said: \"The prestigious schools \"traditionally put it on the table: 'An honorary degree from here is worth its weight in gold. You should come for free.' \" **********Just as in any deal, both sides also have unwritten wish lists. Marquette University, for instance, would probably not turn down a gift from Mr. Brennan,  its active alumnus and recent honoree. \"Certainly, if he decided to, we need a couple of things around here,\" said Mr. Nenno, the spokesman. **********What do speakers hope for? \"People give speeches because they respect the institution,\" Mr. Trump said. But then he paused, laughing. \"Or maybe because they want to get their son or daughter into the school.\" **********Jokes aside, Mr. Trump and others say campus speaking is not just another straight-out commercial activity. Old school ties, of course, lead many executives to devote time to institutions with no expectation of payment, for example, and most executives believe it inappropriate to accept compensation for commencement speeches. **********Sometimes the rational for accepting an invitation to speak at a commencement is more whimsical. Take the case of Bennett R. Cohen and Jerry Greenfield of Ben & Jerry's ice cream fame, who spoke at Long Island University on May 21. **********Why did they accept the invitation? **********\"We must've been in a good mood when we opened the letter,\" Mr. Cohen said. Mr. Greenfield added: \"Plus I like the academic hoods. The hoods are really cool.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/15/business/company-s-buyout-was-it-that-good-rush-doors-insurer-shows-pitfalls-cutting.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1995-12-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1598, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Company's Buyout: Was It That Good?;Rush to the Doors at an Insurer Shows Pitfalls in Cutting Staff", "print_headline": "Company's Buyout: Was It That Good?;Rush to the Doors at an Insurer Shows Pitfalls in Cutting Staff", "body_text": " **********What if a company made a buyout offer to its employees and everybody took it? **********That is nearly what happened here at the Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company, which is in a hurry to trim its work force before its merger early next year with the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company. In recent weeks, after more than two-thirds of the 1,650 employees at Connecticut Mutual's home offices said yes to the offer -- a reflection of dismal morale and jitters about the future, many workers said -- the company found itself wooing those it wanted to stay. **********Even after extending the deadline for workers to reconsider, and then persuading 220 to remain, the company will lose 890 people. **********Such a rush for the door -- particularly in Hartford, where insurers have shed thousands of workers in recent years -- came as a surprise to many, and far exceeded the 475 jobs the company said it planned to cut as part of the merger.  Connecticut Mutual now finds itself in the embarrassing position of needing to hire several hundred replacement workers. **********\"When that many people take an offer, it suggests a planning problem in the company and a perception problem among its employees,\" said Marti Smye, chairwoman of People Tech Consulting, a Boston firm. Workers at the smaller company in a merger -- like Connecticut Mutual -- are particularly vulnerable to such problems, experts say. **********Indeed, Connecticut Mutual's experience is a case study in the potential pitfalls of shrinking a company, experts say. As a cautionary tale, it will have increasing relevance, they add, since layoffs and buyouts are on the rise again  amid a new wave of mergers. One in every six of the 385,000 big company job cuts announced so far this year is the result of a merger, Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a Chicago-based out placement firm, has estimated. **********As layoffs and buyouts become more of a fact of life, the social stigma for affected workers has been disappearing. As a result, companies should be prepared for many more workers to accept buyout offers that a few years ago would have attracted only a small minority, employment benefits experts say. **********The risk of too many workers accepting an offer is one reason why offers to all employees are becoming less common, said Garrett L. Dietz, a managing principal at the Towers Perrin consulting firm. **********\"Voluntary buyout offers seem like a way to avoid the pain of layoffs, but they can be costly in the long run,\" he said. \"That's why you see so many companies do their downsizing in rounds, offering deals to small groups of workers.\" Some companies also reserve the right to pick and choose among those who do take an offer, but they leave themselves open to lawsuits by workers who may accuse them of discrimination, Mr. Dietz said. **********David E. Sams Jr., Connecticut Mutual's chairman and chief executive, is not  expressing any regret over the loss of workers he would rather have kept, and says the company \"never had any goal\" for the number of people it wanted to take the buyout. By keeping some departing workers on until next June, the company says, the turnover will not disrupt customer service. **********\"We wanted to give everyone an equal opportunity to make a choice,\" Mr. Sams  said, \"and the people who now remain are energized and excited.\" He added that \"we achieved our goal of avoiding any involuntary terminations as part of the merger, except at the senior executive level.\" Connecticut Mutual did not use any of the consulting firms that specialize in advising companies on buyouts. **********But for many of those leaving, the reason was not the generosity of the offer -- a minimum of half a year's pay for those with at least three years of service -- but rather worry about the rapid pace of change at the company and uncertainty about where they fit in top management's merger plans. And many attributed their anxiety to the 52-year-old Mr. Sams, who joined Connecticut Mutual in 1993 as its first chief executive hired from the outside. **********\"A lot of people are fed up with the way they have been treated,\" said Shirley Brown, an administrative assistant in the real estate investment department who took the buyout and is leaving. \"They have been screwing around with everybody's job for two years, since the transformation project, and people can only take so much,\" she said in an interview. **********The \"transformation\" project was an effort to stir the pot at a company suffering from lagging profits and sales by requiring all employees, except Mr.  Sams, to reapply for their jobs. The company contends that fewer than 100 workers lost their jobs in the project and that it hired enough new workers to actually increase its job rolls. Even so, the exercise left an unpleasant aftertaste for many. **********\"I want there to be the right amount of anxiety in the system,\" Mr. Sams said two years ago in the midst of the project. He conceded then that there was some  danger in trying to cut costs and inject new vigor at a lethargic mutual company that has never had the scrutiny and prodding of shareholders. Mutual insurers are owned by their policyholders. **********Mr. Sams, formerly a senior executive at the shareholder-owned Providian Corporation of Louisville, Ky., did not come to Connecticut Mutual with a reputation as an ogre. Irving W. Bailey 2d, his boss at Providian, an insurance  and financial services company, expressed surprise over the turmoil at Connecticut Mutual, and described Mr. Sams as \"great with the troops\" and \"certainly not a bull in the china shop.\" **********Still, although the 1,650 workers at headquarters knew that Connecticut Mutual was promising to keep 1,200 employees, that promise alone was not enough  to assure them of their future prospects. Company executives were not offering the information that many workers wanted to hear -- which jobs would survive, whom they would work for and whether they would be relocated to the Springfield, Mass., headquarters of Massachusetts Mutual. **********\"They didn't make available any of the information that a person would need to make a decision,\" said Lee Otero, a secretary who also took the buyout and is leaving. \"With nothing to go on, a lot of people decided they weren't wanted, and should take the money.\" **********After 1,110 people said yes, Connecticut Mutual extended to Dec. 6 the deadline to reconsider. In the week leading up to that deadline, company managers began talking in more specific terms with some workers, assuring them that they were wanted and could continue working in Hartford. That, plus an appeal over the company's telephone message system just a few hours before decisions were due, was enough to persuade 220 to stay. **********But for 890 workers, the appeal did not work, even though the employment outlook in Hartford grew even bleaker in late November when the Aetna Life and Casualty Company said 1,500 insurance jobs would be lost in the sale of its property and liability division to the Travelers Group. **********The last-minute effort to change some minds \"was not because we had kept knowledge of our plans hidden until then,\" Mr. Sams said. \"We are accomplishing  in five months what takes other companies 17 or 18 months to do,\" he added. Because of the fast pace of the job- cutting, he said, the detailed plans for individuals were not known until very recently. **********So far, the networks of sales agents at both insurers have been little touched by the merger turmoil, though their day will come. About 1,000 of the least productive agents will be let go as Connecticut Mutual's 2,000 agents merge with the 4,000 at Massachusetts Mutual, said Thomas B. Wheeler, chief executive of Massachusetts Mutual, who will be chairman of the new company, which will use the Massachusetts Mutual name. **********Larry Mayewski, head of life insurance ratings at the A. M. Best Company, Oldwick, N.J., said that expenses at Connecticut Mutual and Massachusetts Mutual were not high by life insurance company standards, \"but the real benchmarks they should be judged by are at mutual funds and banks, their competitors.\" He said job-cutting could be limited if the new Massachusetts Mutual succeeded in expanding its sales, but if growth did not come, he said, more cuts were likely. **********Connecticut Mutual executives have promised Gov. John G. Rowland and the state insurance department that when the dust clears the company will still have 1,200 jobs in Hartford and maintain its charitable spending. **********Most of the remaining jobs will involve such relatively low-paying tasks as handling new policies and collecting premiums. Connecticut Mutual's managerial ranks will be reduced by elimination of many duplicated jobs in public relations, accounting, law and other areas. **********But Hartford will get some new jobs, too, becoming the home base for Massachusetts Mutual's Oppenheimer Asset Management, a mutual fund company, and  a real estate management and advisory firm. **********\"None of this has been any fun,\" said Mr. Wheeler of Massachusetts Mutual, who was greeted recently with a smattering of hisses and boos at one meeting in  the Connecticut Mutual cafeteria. \"But the fact is that these changes are necessary for both companies. Our alternative is to eventually go out of business.\" **********TERMS OF THE BUYOUT **********WORKERS with the company for three years or more were given three weeks pay for  each year of service, with a minimum of 26 weeks pay and a maximum of 78 weeks. **********HIGHER RANKING EXECUTIVES got four weeks pay for each year of service, with a minimum of 26 weeks and a maximum of 104. **********THOSE NEAR RETIREMENT were allowed to collect benefits at age 50, rather than 55."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/14/world/world-news-briefs-challenging-vote-parties-withdraw-in-tanzania.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-11-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 165, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "World News Briefs;Challenging Vote, Parties Withdraw in Tanzania", "print_headline": "World News Briefs;Challenging Vote, Parties Withdraw in Tanzania", "body_text": " **********All opposition candidates, denouncing widespread election irregularities, withdrew from Tanzania's presidential election today, opening the way for the governing party's candidate, Benjamin Mkapa, to become head of state. **********At a news conference, a coalition of 10 opposition parties said they had no confidence in the first round of voting on Oct. 29 and that they would boycott presidential and parliamentary elections in the capital Sunday, which are to be  repeated because of problems with the voting. **********Because of the irregularities that took place everywhere I do not see any point in contesting the presidency,\" said Augustine Mrema, leader and presidential candidate for the NCCR-Mageuzi party. **********He said the opposition had no confidence in the National Electoral Commission, which ran the Oct. 29 election.

But the stock has since slumped to $120.50, including a decline of $10.50 yesterday. Wells Fargo's shares were down $12.25 yesterday, to $207.25, well shy of the $229 they hit last Wednesday and lower even than their close the day before the hostile bid was announced. **********While most financial stocks fell yesterday on fears about increasing losses  on consumer loans, Wells and First Interstate were down more sharply than the others. **********More significantly, the fallin Wells's stock price reduces the pershar value of its offer for First Interstate to $129.53 from $143 last Wednesday, which would make it look less attractive to Interstate's stockholders. Wells proposed  exchanging 0.625 of its shares for each First Interstate share. **********The decline in both banks' stock price also creates an opportunity for First Interstate to strike a deal with another company instead, a so-called white knight that could possibly outbid Wells and be more to the liking of First Interstate's management and board. **********Because of their size and high stock prices, the two most likely partners for First Interstate are Norwest Corporation of Minneapolis and Base One Corporation of Columbus, Ohio, and the market was a buzz with rumors yesterday that both regional banking giants were considering a deal with First Interstate. Both firms said it is their policy to decline comment on any merger negotiations. **********It is very unlikely that another bank will make public hostile bid for First Interstate, rather than trying to arrange a friendly deal. Since Wells Fargo is  the only potential suitor with significant overlapping operations - and thus with the highest potential cost savings - it is assumed to be in the best position to with an outright bidding contest. **********But some merger experts suggest that First Interstate will try to lock up a  signed merger agreement with a white knight with various break up provisions that would make it expensive for Wells to press a higher hostile bid. **********Such a deal is by no means a certainty. Wells is already offering to pay three times First Interstate's book value, an unusually high premium. Still, some analysis and investment bankers say that Norwest or Banc One could well be  lured into offering as much as $150 a share for First Interstate in order to gain access to its unmatched 13-state Western franchise. **********First Interstate and its advisers are maintaining a stony silence. In its brief statement last week. First Interstate said it is evaluating all of its options including the Wells offer. People close to the company insist that is new chief executive, William E. B. Sart, will not merely try to preserve his job but will act in shareholders' best interests although these people do not say what Mr. Sart said that it would not make sense to sell First Interstate for several years because the company's stock price has yet to reflect fully the improvements in its operating efficiency and credit quality. **********Were First Interstate to want to fend off Wells, merger experts say its most rational strategy now would be to bide its time and not even approach potential  white knights. Lawyers who are expert in hostile takeovers said that they would  advise First Interstate to avoid the appearance of putting the company up for sale, because such moves could open First Interstate to shareholder suits later  if it eventually chooses to accept anything less than the highest offer. **********\"Time is on First Interstate's side,\" said Charles Nathan,, a partner with Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, whose firm is not representing either  side. \"FIrst Interstate does not need to rush to judgement, but Wells needs to keep up the pressure and push things along.\" **********For now, First Interstate's first line of defense will likely be an aggressive publicity campaign creticizing the Wells bid. Wells, in fact, does have several vulnerabilities, merger experts said. Wells' stock is itself valued so highly that First Interstate could argue the the shares its holders would receive in the merger are more likely to go down than up. **********First Interstate could also challenge the complex financial plan Wells has proposed for the deal in which it will use much of the profits of the combined bank to buy back its own stock. Such a plan reflects the rather pessimistic view held by Wells management that banking is such a rapidly shrinking industry that  banking companies must reduce their capital bases accordingly. First Interstate  will have to comeu p with a credible explanation about how it could, instead, build its business up yet come close to matching the efficiency of Wells cost cuts. **********Similarly, First Interstate could try to play up the antitrust problems a combination with Wells would bring, especially in San Diego and Sacramento, Calif. And it could appeal to politicians in California to slow the deal in order to preserve the thousands of jobs that a merger with Wells would eliminate. **********Wells, of course, can argue in response that the deal benefits from $700 million in potential savings from eliminating overlapping operations and that it has a long term record as one of the most profitable companies in banking. **********Ultimately, if both sides dig in, such a contest would be decided in one or  more shareholder votes. Yet unlike an industrial company that can almost instantly propose a hostile cash tender off er for a target's stock, a bank must negotiate myriad regulatory hurdles before such a deal can be completed in particular a bank acquisition paid for with stock must be cleared by the Justice Department on anti-trust questions, by the Securities and Exchange Commission on the adequacy who look at everything from safety and soundness to minority lending records. **********Takeover experts expect Wells to press quickly on all three fronts. On Monday, it filed with the Justice Department under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, an antitrust law, for permission to buy First Interstate shares. While an eventual  acquisition would be subject to another review, receiving clearance to buy shares would help neturalize potential antitrust arguments by First Interstate. **********Wells could well demand a shareholder vote before receiving all these approvals. First Interstate has never adopted anti-takeover defenses that would prohibit shareholder proposals. And thus Wells could ask for a vote to remove First Interstate's board of directors, replacing them with people committed to merger. But Wells may wait until the regulatory issues are cleared  up and it could tempt First Interstate shareholders with q quick pay off after their vote."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/23/world/wrecked-by-years-of-civil-war-beirut-is-rising-from-the-ashes.html": {"writer_name": "Douglas Jehl", "pub_date": "1995-12-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1280, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Wrecked by Years of Civil War, Beirut Is Rising From the Ashes", "print_headline": "Wrecked by Years of Civil War, Beirut Is Rising From the Ashes", "body_text": " **********Five years after the end of Lebanon's civil war, the lights are burning brightly again in this ravaged capital. **********Its famous hotels -- the Phoenicia, the St. George's, the Holiday Inn -- remain scarred monuments to battle. Its city center, much of it, has been bulldozed, wrecked beyond repair by the savagery along the Green Line, the dividing line between the Muslim and Christian-held sectors. **********But now a grand rebuilding plan is under way, and the city's citizens once again cross between East and West Beirut without a second thought. On both sides of the old divide, Beirut's stores boast the latest in French fashions. It is a  city pulsing with life. And now Beirut, once the pearl of the Middle East, is on a breakneck quest to reclaim its lost glory. **********\"Wherever you go in Lebanon, you see a construction site,\" said Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri, who lists the restoration of round-the-clock electricity as yet another step on Beirut's road to recovery. \"This is a very good thing.\" **********Beneath blueprints showing landscaped parks, new marinas and tree-lined boulevards lurk questions about whether peace and reconstruction can repair years of lost time. With Syrian troops the main guarantor of security, Beirut in important ways remains a satellite of Damascus. **********But in dozens of conversations here, diplomats, scholars and people from nearly all of the country's 17 recognized religious communities all expressed conviction that Beirut would soon become a metaphor for something other than devastation. **********\"I think failure is really not in the cards,\" a Western ambassador said of the city's redevelopment plan. \"The only question is whether it's going to be a    success or a raving success.\" **********For now, the indications are clearly good. It has been five years since the warring militias put down their arms, four years since Terry A. Anderson became  the last Western hostage in Beirut to be released. **********Snarled traffic is the only obstacle between the city's mostly Muslim West and its heavily Christian East, and even Hamra Street in West Beirut is again awash in Christmas trappings. **********Work has begun on more than $2 billion in further contracts to rebuild power  supplies, telephone services and roads, and the 24 hours of electricity now available reflect a doubling from just six months ago. With Beirut soon to be freed from the snarled wires that connect homes and offices to gas-powered generators, a fabric shredded by 15 years of war that killed 150,000 people is slowly being restitched. **********For Beirutis who fled the city or had to hunker in their respective quarters  during the years of war, the recovery can be felt in the spirit on the streets. **********\"There were so many years when people just seemed to shout, at each other and among themselves,\" said Elie Hajj, a 38-year-old insurance man who lives in East Beirut. \"It's not that all is perfect now, but everything is much smoother.\" **********Another measure of Beirut's confidence can be seen in its population, which now stands at 1.2 million, a 20 percent increase from its wartime level. Tens of thousands more live on the coast to the north, where much of the Christian population has spread, creating a greater Beirut of as many as 2 million people. **********Among those who have returned from self-imposed exile include financial institutions like Citibank and cultural ones like the British Council, both hoping for a broader peace between Israel, Syria and Lebanon that might unlock the region's economic and social potential. **********Foreign capital has also flowed back into the country, accommodating even a heavy trade deficit. **********And for the first time in 10 years, an American president of the American University in Beirut, Robert Haddad, is visiting the seafront campus this week,  though under a one-time waiver granted by the State Department, which continues  to prohibit most Americans from traveling to Lebanon. **********Still, in its dingy airport, antiquated port and the rubble that is everywhere, there remain countless reminders of just how far Beirut has to climb. **********The average wage remains only about $300 a month, and in the Shiite Muslim southern suburbs, it is the militant Islamic group Party of God, and not the Lebanese Government, that provides the social safety net. Across Beirut as across Lebanon, the 40,000 Syrian soldiers who brandish bayonets at strategic checkpoints remain the most important lid on a resurgence of sectarian violence. **********With some of its old role in fields like finance and economics taken over by  upstarts like Dubai, Beirut must find a way to recapture the two lost decades since it began its slide into self-mutilation. Many of its best and brightest remain overseas, holding prominent positions in places like Brazil, Saudi Arabia and the United States, and holding wealth that has only begun to make its way home. **********In recent months, the capital influx has begun to slow, suggesting that investors may be looking elsewhere for quick profits. Even at Solidere, a Lebanese company in charge of a $1.8 billion development project that is the country's largest, officials say it remains far from certain that companies will flock back in their old numbers. **********And while Christians and Muslims once again work, shop and eat in the others' quarters, very few have pulled up roots to relocate on the other side of town. **********\"In Lebanon each takes care of its own,\" said Samira Hamdan, a 45-year-old jewelry merchant in West Beirut. **********At the heart of the redevelopment effort is Solidere, which was established in May 1994 to help raze and rebuild Beirut's shattered city center, so battered by fighting between Christian and Muslim militias that it was a virtual no man's land throughout the years of war. **********Of the 800 buildings that once stood in the square-mile sized tract, the company has leveled all but 265, and even they remain so scarred that it will be at least two years before most are made habitable. But with workers due soon to  begin laying new power cables, phone lines and roads, the $1.8 billion project is envisioned as the platform that will make it possible for Beirut to jump ahead in time. **********With sleek hotels, soaring skyscrapers and high-tech office buildings planned alongside sites like the grand Ottoman Palace, the project has impressed enough  investors that its shares, ownership of which is limited to Lebanese and other Arabs, are selling on secondary markets at 125 percent of the initial price. **********Its major investors include Prime Minister Hariri, a billionaire who has pledged to donate any profit to charity. Ramez Bahij Maluf, Solidere's international manager, says that what the company has in mind amounts to \"almost a miracle.\" **********For now, though, landmarks like Martyr's Square and the Opera House stand as  islands in a sea of dirt. And others among the city's venerable institutions, like the American University in Beirut, still show wounds inflicted by the war,  which at A.U.B. included the assassination of a president, Malcolm Kerr, and the kidnapping of two administrators, Thomas Sutherland and Joseph Cicippio. What was once an international student body is now almost entirely Lebanese. **********With American Embassies here blown up before and after the 1983 car-bomb explosion that killed 241 American servicemen, their successor is a remote fortress in the hills above the city, guarded by the Lebanese Army's Seventh Brigade. **********But while the United States says the threat posed by Shiite Muslim militants  still justifies its travel ban for most American citizens, other Westerners say  they fell scant threat from either terrorism or commerce. **********\"What hasn't changed is that Beirut is still the largest port in the eastern  Mediterranean, with a population that is still the best-educated and most cosmopolitan in the Middle East, and at the hub of new markets,\" a British businessman said. \"That's location, location, location.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/20/business/when-murdoch-moves-fleet-street-follows.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Stevenson", "pub_date": "1995-11-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 761, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "When Murdoch Moves, Fleet Street Follows", "print_headline": "When Murdoch Moves, Fleet Street Follows", "body_text": " **********When Rupert Murdoch moves, the British newspaper industry shakes, a lesson that was pounded home here again last week. **********News International, the British subsidiary of Mr. Murdoch's Australia-based company the News Corporation, said on Thursday that it had decided to cease publication of Today, a 10-year-old tabloid that had rung up losses throughout its existence. **********Today, with a daily circulation of 573,000, was the least prominent of Mr. Murdoch's papers here -- he also owns The Times of London, The Sunday Times, The Sun and the weekly News of the World -- but its death was still significant. In  a nation where newspapers are closely identified with political parties, Today was the only one of Mr. Murdoch's papers to support the opposition Labor Party,  which holds a big lead in the polls over the governing Conservatives. **********With the poll ratings making it likely that Labor will win the next general election, which must be held within 18 months, Mr. Murdoch has forged closer ties in the last year with the new Labor leader, Tony Blair, and has suggested that his continued support for the Conservatives is not a given. **********Mr. Murdoch has been feuding with the Conservatives over their proposals to limit media ownership in a way that would restrict his ability to increase his television holdings unless he scaled back his newspaper holdings. He said earlier this year that the proposals, still making their way through Parliament, might lead him to close money-losing papers. **********A spokeswoman for News International said the media-ownership proposals had no effect on the decision to close Today, and that the company had invested millions of dollars in the paper just this summer. In a statement on Thursday, Les Hinton, chairman of News International, said, \"We deeply regret the decision to cease publication, but with a modest circulation, insufficient growth and rapidly rising costs we have no alternative.\" **********The closing put Today's readers up for grabs, with the main combatants being  The Sun, which has historically been anti-Labor, and The Daily Mirror, which is  owned by Mirror Group P.L.C. and is strongly pro-Labor. **********Having shaken up the tabloid market, Mr. Murdoch, whose papers control more than a third of Britain's newspaper circulation, did the same to the broadsheet  newspaper business. He also said on Thursday that he was raising the price of The Times, his flagship paper here, from 25 pence, or 39 cents, to 30 pence, or  47 cents. **********Mr. Murdoch set off a price war two years ago by sharply cutting the price of The Times, first from 45 pence to 30 pence, and then to 20 pence, moves that helped increase the paper's circulation by 90 percent, to 675,000. The Times, which does not release details of its financial performance, bumped its price back up to 25 pence earlier this year, largely to offset the rising cost of newsprint, the same reason given for the current price increase. **********The latest increase allowed The Daily Telegraph, which with a circulation of  one million is the nation's biggest-selling broadsheet, to say on Friday that it would raise its price to 40 pence from 35 pence. The previous day, The Telegraph said that its pretax profits for the nine months that ended Sept. 30 fell 24 percent, to L25.6 million, or $40 million, from the corresponding period last year.

The talk of the London media scene for the last several weeks has been the public acknowledgment by Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber, the theatrical composer and producer, that he is interested in forming a group to make a bid for Express, which is owned by United Newspapers Ltd. **********Mr. Lloyd Webber has made it clear that he would want partners with newspaper experience if he pursued a bid for Express, which is not formally for sale. Lord Stevens, the company's chairman, said he had not received any offers, and said he would sell only if he got an offer so high that it would be impossible to resist. **********Mr. Lloyd Webber has not disclosed why he is interested in the newspaper business, and it is unclear how serious he is about a bid."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/02/world/mexico-s-indians-face-new-conquistador-drugs.html": {"writer_name": "Anthony de Palma", "pub_date": "1995-06-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1679, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mexico's Indians Face New Conquistador: Drugs", "print_headline": "Mexico's Indians Face New Conquistador: Drugs", "body_text": " **********There are basically two ways to get to this town in northern Mexico -- by small plane or a trek over horrible roads. Twenty-five years ago the place hardly existed. Then the drug trade invaded the heart of the western Sierra Madre and transformed the lives of some of the most traditional of Mexico's Indian people. **********Now Baborigame (pronounced bah-bore-ee-GAH-may) is one of the biggest towns in the mountains, and probably the most dangerous. How it got that way is a story of violence, temptation and tragedy. **********For the Indians, drugs now signify death,\" said Maria Teresa Jardi, the outspoken former federal prosecutor for the state of Chihuahua, where Baborigame is located. \"This problem is national, and the chain of death has no end.\" **********State police agents holding AK-47 automatic rifles ride through the town on the back of a blue pickup. Baseball caps embroidered with marijuana leaves are the rage. And on Saturday nights the dirt streets fill with flashy new pickups driven by red-eyed young men who have already found their vocation. **********Down a side street is Fort Baborigame, a frontier outpost made of wood that looks like something from the Wild West. Green army helicopters take off almost  every day on missions to spot marijuana or the opium poppies planted among the corn by the Tarahumara Indians who have lived in the hills above Baborigame for  hundreds of years. **********The Tarahumara were never conquered by the Spanish. But they could not resist the temptations of the latest conquistadors, who showed up 25 years ago with envelopes of strange seeds and promises to pay more for a single crop than the Indians could earn over several years. **********For the most part, the Indians have no use for the drugs themselves; most barely understand what they are for. But in this area of towering mountains and  deep chasms, a few acres of marijuana or opium poppy can bring 3,000 pesos (about $500) to a Tarahumara -- if he can stay alive. **********In time those latest bosses stopped paying and simply threatened to kill anyone who did not follow their new rules. Some Indian leaders were killed, and  the violence increased, practically wiping out some small Sierra settlements. When traditional Indian governors walked miles to complain, the Government generally ignored them. **********In the harsh beauty of the Sierra, about 250 miles south of El Paso, two crippling ills of Mexican society have struck simultaneously. **********One is the poverty and marginalization of the Indians, who are 10 percent of  Mexico's population. These same forces were behind the uprising in the southern  state of Chiapas. There are about 55,000 Tarahumara and Tepehuan Indians in the  Sierra, nearly all of the inhabitants of the region. **********The second element present here is the rampant drug trafficking that has destabilized large parts of Mexican society, corrupting officials and souring relations with the United States, the vast consumer market to which the drugs -- hundreds of millions of dollars' worth from the Sierra alone -- are headed each  year. **********On the edge of Baborigame, alongside the lumber mill, Fidel Torres, 56, spends most of his time building a small wooden house. He is a Tarahumara Indian who moved to Baborigame three years ago after deciding he could no longer stay in the only other place he has called home: a small fold of the Sierra called Coloradas de la Virgen. **********\"I didn't want to leave, but they killed my son and that's why I came here,\"  Mr. Torres said. His son, Luis, was shot in the heart while attending a dance in a church at Coloradas de la Virgen on Nov. 7, 1992. He looks out of place among  the less traditional Tepehuan Indians who predominate in Baborigame, and he misses home. But he cannot go back, he said, \"not until all the robbing and stealing and killing stop.\" **********One of the few people who is willing to go back to Coloradas de la Virgen is  Edwin Bustillos, a 30-year-old half-Indian, half-white who for the last three years has been fighting to protect the mountains and the Indians who live in them. **********Mr. Bustillos, a slight man with only one good eye, has been attacked several times by the drug traffickers he has challenged. They have run him off the road, and beat him so badly that he now has only partial use of his arm. **********They beat him but did not frighten him, he said, as he prepared recently for  the three-hour trip by four-wheel-drive vehicle from Baborigame to Coloradas. He brought two assistants, bulletproof vests, a 9-millimeter pistol, an AK-47 automatic rifle and an audiotape of weepy ranchera music to set the mood. **********Mr. Bustillos passed the burned-out carcasses of several pickup trucks, testimony to the anger and vengeance that have come over this area where pine trees grow alongside cactus plants, and jaguar coexist with thick-billed parrots. **********On this day, most of Coloradas is deserted. The walls inside the old church of adobe brick are pockmarked by bullet holes, the wooden floorboards still stained by blood spilled when men with wild eyes came to the door and loosed a deadly spray of automatic rifle fire, killing Luis Torres and severely wounding another Tarahumara. **********\"It was the drugs, that's what caused all the violence,\" Isidro Baldenegro said. He pointed out a spot behind the church where two small wooden crosses mark the spot where on another afternoon two men were cut down by an assassin. **********There are no markers in the small plaza in front of the church, but the 29-year-old farmer pointed to no fewer than five spots where other men were killed in drug-related encounters over the last few years. **********He could also show the place not far away where his father, an Indian leader, was shot through the stomach and killed, the school from which frightened teachers fled and never returned, the construction site of the new clinic where  no mason has dared come back to lay a brick, the graveyard filled with young Tarahumara Indians who died violently in this dying place. **********The federal prosecutor in Chihuahua, Arturo Chavez Chavez, said that in his first three months in office he arrested 400 people and destroyed more than 600  acres of marijuana and poppy plants, some in the Sierra. The state Attorney General, Francisco J. Molina, has discovered 819 clandestine airfields in the state that are used for the illegal transport of drugs. **********But Mrs. Jardi, the former prosecutor, said that the army helicopters sometimes spray only water and that for every field that is supposedly destroyed, several others are untouched. **********\"This Government is not worried about the Indians,\" she said, \"or about fighting the drug traffickers either.\" **********The state penitentiary in the city of Chihuahua is one of the toughest prisons in Mexico, where the halls smell of sweat and the role of Jesus Christ during a recent Easter passion play was played by a drug dealer named Jesus. **********An inmate there, Rogelio Fontes, is accused of killing the two men whose names appear on the crosses behind the church at Coloradas de la Virgen. He says he is innocent and, in an interview inside the prison director's office, he said he was framed by members of his own family. **********\"They're distant relatives, and they've killed many, many people,\" Mr. Fontes said. Even in prison he wears a thick gold chain, an expensive watch, a Looney Tunes cap that says on the brim \"I Love My Friends.\" **********Mrs. Jardi brought several charges against the Fontes family, identifying them as the moving force behind the drug problems in the Southern Sierra since 1970. **********The head of the family, Artemio Fontes, has been charged with robbery and murder, according to state police records, but never served any time. Mrs. Jardi said a recent case against Artemio Fontes for murder, intimidation and drug trafficking, in which more than 60 Indians gave testimony, was halted in December 1993, when a federal judge granted him indefinite protection from prosecution. **********\"The police are in his pocket,\" Rogelio Fontes, in the state penitentiary in  Chihuahua, said of his third cousin. **********Artemio Fontes lives openly in Chihuahua, in a large two-story house covered  in fake white brick. He could not be reached for comment, but a woman who said she was his wife, but would not give her name, answered one phone call and said  her husband was simply a rancher who had left Coloradas long ago and had nothing to do with drugs. **********\"You should not listen to what people say about him,\" the woman said. \"They're just lying. I can assure you that my husband is a man of good faith.\" **********The federal prosecutor in Chihuahua called Artemio Fontes \"one problem of many.\" The state prosecutor, almost three years in office, says he has never heard of him. **********Edwin Bustillos, battered and bruised, knows Artemio Fontes all too well, and he says that as long as the Government is willing to turn its eyes from the problems in the Sierra, everything President Ernesto Zedillo says about creating a true state of law in Mexico is hollow talk. **********Mr. Bustillos's organization, the Advisory Council of the Sierra Madre, is helped by Forest Guardians, a environmental group in Arizona that supports his efforts to protect the Tarahumaras' vanishing forest homeland from exploitation  by large lumber companies. **********Last year the Forest Guardians sent a letter to President Zedillo outlining some of the abuses taking place in Coloradas de la Virgen and other parts of the Sierra. It was also signed by 90 international environmental groups. So far there has been no response from Mr. Zedillo. **********\"It is absolutely clear to us that it doesn't mean anything to him that in the Sierra dozens of Indians are dying at the hands of drug traffickers,\" Mr. Bustillos said. **********He finds it hard to square Mr. Zedillo's pledge to make Mexico a country of law with the image of Coloradas, the bullet holes, the sad crosses, the empty school rooms, the well-used cemetery. **********\"We cannot believe in the lies of the President of Mexico,\" he said. \"I would believe in his deeds but never, never in his words.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/04/business/nearing-the-500-computer-for-internet-use.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-12-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 607, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Nearing the $500 Computer for Internet Use", "print_headline": "Nearing the $500 Computer for Internet Use", "body_text": " **********The $500 PC may not be here yet, but how about the L500 PC? A British computer maker is about to introduce a stripped-down machine for Net surfing that sells for about $900, roughly L590. **********Even as the chief executives of the Oracle Corporation and Sun Microsystems Inc. proclaim their intention to produce low-cost, easy-to-use devices for viewing the World Wide Web, Acorn Computer Group P.L.C. already has a product that comes close: the A-7000, a multimedia personal computer equipped with a color monitor and software. **********By stripping the A-7000 of its monitor and hard disk drive, and adding a high-speed modem, Acorn executives say they can hit a retail price less than $500 for a machine that could provide access to the Internet and could perform most routine functions of a personal computer. They plan to ship such a device,  called the Netsurfer, by early next year, and are discussing licensing with a number of American and Asian companies. **********Indeed, executives close to Oracle say the company is considering Acorn's machine as the basis for an Internet computer. Neither Oracle nor Acorn officials would comment regarding such talks, but Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracle's  chairman and chief executive, has said the company's proposed machine would probably use the ARM microprocessor produced by Acorn's sister company, Advanced RISC Machines Ltd. of Cambridge, England. Oracle and Acorn are collaborating on  a TV set-top box, as well. **********\"I don't think anybody can make the total system cost as low as we can,\" Robin Saxby, Advanced RISC's president and chief executive, said. **********As the company's name implies, Advanced RISC's microprocessors employ reduced instruction set computing technology, which is commonly used to make the highest performance chips by companies like Sun and Silicon Graphics Inc. **********In Advanced RISC's case, the technology is used to make a chip comparable only to the Intel Corporation's 486DX2, but in a much smaller size and with lower power consumption, hence at a lower cost. That is why Apple Computer Inc.  uses the ARM chip in its Newton. **********At $20, the ARM chip costs far less than Intel equivalents, and Acorn uses its own operating system software, so it does not have to pay licensing fees to  the Microsoft Corporation. The operating system is loaded in read-only memory chips, which are less costly than random access memory chips. **********\"We have been forced through price competition to use every single trick we can find to square the circle of price performance against the behemoths,\" said  Peter Bondar, director of Acorn's Applied RISC Technology unit. **********Early on, Acorn developed a method for displaying high-quality text on televisions because monitors were too costly for many. That technology is applicable to the Netsurfer, which most analysts believe will be used as a living room machine. **********While few Americans have seen an Acorn computer, they are well regarded in Britain, where they are popular in schools. **********\"The problem Acorn has always had is because it is a U.K. company, it has no  profile in the United States,\" said Guy Kewney, a London correspondent for PC Magazine. \"If somebody like Larry Ellison were to climb on that particular bandwagon, I don't think he would find it to be without wheels. I think it would roll.\" **********But United States computer analysts are more skeptical, doubting not that Acorn can make a $500 machine, but that such a machine can be sold profitably, and that the Internet could serve as the repository of all software. **********\"What are you going to do for software?\" asked Kimball Brown, an analyst with Dataquest. \"If we had two-way cable into the home that would be a whole other ball game, but that's 10 years away.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/03/world/nigeria-frees-politician.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-06-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 117, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Nigeria Frees Politician", "print_headline": "Nigeria Frees Politician", "body_text": " **********The Nigerian police released an 86-year-old opposition leader today, but they continued to hold 39 other opposition politicians who were arrested with him on  Thursday, an aide to the freed leader said. **********The freed opposition leader, Michael Ajasin, and the 39 others, including former cabinet ministers and members of Parliament, were arrested and driven away to undisclosed locations.

By the end of the week, it could be the happiest year ever. **********Yesterday's new high for the Dow Jones industrial average -- with the index rising 2.53 points, to 4,872.90 -- was the 56th time this year that a new peak has been registered. That topped the recent high of 55 times, set in 1987, a year that ended badly with a stock market crash. **********The record for this century is 59 new highs in one year, set in 1925 and matched in 1964, according to Birinyi Associates in Greenwich, Conn. **********This year, along with 1925, 1964 and 1987, are the only years that ever saw the Dow average at least one new record a week. As it happens, in each of the previous three, the final high for the year was set by Nov. 18. **********There are plenty of other indications of what a happy market this has been for those who are in it. Not only is this market likely to set a record for hitting new highs the most, it is also on its way to setting a record for the smallest decline within a year. It has been very hard to lose money buying the Dow stocks this year, no matter how bad one's timing. **********Another indication of continuing happiness, in which 1995 is setting a record, is that the Dow has now set a new record at least once in each of the last seven years, starting in 1989. That breaks the old record of six consecutive years, set from 1924 through 1929. **********And the Dow has now set at least one record in 12 of the last 14 years -- every year since 1982 save for 1984 and 1988. That exceeds the figures of setting records in 11 of 13 years from 1954, when the Dow first exceeded the 1929 peak, through 1966, when it first neared 1,000. The exceptions in that string were 1957 and 1962. **********It was between those two streaks -- from 1966 through 1982 -- that the Dow wandered in the wilderness, with 1,000 becoming a psychological barrier that could not be permanently topped until the 1980's bull market began in 1982. **********The large number of new highs is just one of the indications that this market has been extraordinary. Steve Leuthold of the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis notes that it has been more than five years since the Dow had a fall of at least 12 percent from high to low -- the longest such stretch in history. **********And Richard Russell, a market historian, notes that the worst possible market timing for an investor buying and selling the Dow this year would have involved  buying July 17, when the Dow hit a record of 4,736.29, and selling on Aug. 24, with the index at 4,580.62, a loss of 3.29 percent. Never before in this century has the Dow been so friendly, in terms of small declines, during the period of January through October. **********In 1925, the first time the Dow recorded 59 highs in a year, the average hit  its high for the year of 157.67 on Nov. 6, while in 1964 it hit its high for the year of 891.71 on Nov. 18. In neither case could the market make a new high in December, but both times the Dow resumed doing so the following January. In neither case was the Dow about to reach a high that would last for a sustained period, as happened in 1987. In the year, the Dow peaked on Aug. 25, only to slip in September and then plunge on Oct. 19. But it was back to making new highs within two years, on Aug. 24, 1989. **********The big number of new highs this year, and the paucity of market dips, is indicative of the confidence that many investors feel. In sharp contrast to the  way the 1980's bull market began -- in 1982, each of the two new records was followed by a significant decline as investors assumed that such good news could not last -- by now it is bad news that investors assume will soon pass. Any decline is seen by many as a buying opportunity, and soon prices rally. **********So long as that attitude endures, and investors are eager to buy whatever shares are offered, the record run of good news is likely to keep rolling."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/12/business/stocks-move-higher-with-technology-issues-setting-pace.html": {"writer_name": "Leonard Sloane", "pub_date": "1995-10-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 677, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Stocks Move Higher, With Technology Issues Setting Pace", "print_headline": "Stocks Move Higher, With Technology Issues Setting Pace", "body_text": " **********Technology stocks led the stock market higher yesterday, continuing the U-turn they began on Tuesday. **********The Nasdaq composite index, which is heavily weighted with technology stocks, climbed 18.10 points, or 1.84 percent, to 1,001.57.

This could indicate that Fidelity Investments,  the giant mutual fund organization, has become a seller, rather than a buyer, of technology issues. **********For example, in the third quarter Fidelity lowered its stake in Apple Computer from about 11 percent of the outstanding shares to around 2 percent. During that period, Apple fell approximately 30 percent from a high on July 10 of 49 7/8, to 34 7/8 yesterday. Yesterday Apple just made it to the plus side, rising 3/16 . **********Among the other market indicators, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.93 points, to 579.46. Advances on the New York Stock Exchange were far ahead of declines, 1,451 to 814. Big Board volume shrank to 340.7 million shares from  Tuesday's volatile level of 412.7 million shares. **********The Dow Jones transportation index vaulted 33.49 points, to 1,925.80, spurred by CSX, which announced a 2-for-1 stock split yesterday and an 18 percent increase in its quarterly dividend. CSX spurted 3 1/8, to 81 3/4, and was followed by other railroads, such as Burlington Northern, up 2 1/8, to 75 1/4; Conrail, up 2 1/2, to 71 7/8; Union Pacific, up 3/4, to 64 1/2, and Norfolk Southern, up 1 7/8, to 75 3/4. **********Automobile shares were also higher after General Motors raised its fourth-quarter production schedule by close to 3 percent. General Motors closed  at 45 1/4, up 3/8; Ford Motor closed at 30, up 1/2, and Chrysler -- even though  it reported a 46 percent drop in third-quarter earnings -- closed at 52 3/4, up  1/8. **********In contrast, international oil issues were weak amid concern over the coming  OPEC meeting. Mobil slipped 7/8, to 99 1/2; Exxon fell 1/2, to 73 1/4; British Petroleum dropped 1/2, to 86 3/4, and Shell Transport declined 7/8, to 71 1/2. **********Beverage stocks closed on the downside, as traders rotated out of consumer-oriented groups and into the cyclicals. Coca-Cola fell 1/4, to 71 1/8 and Pepsico eased 1/8, to 51 3/4. **********Another decline was posted by the Robards home furnishings chain, which dropped 1 1/2, to 10 1/2, after reporting lower same-store sales for September.  But R.G. Barry, which said that third-quarter profits almost doubled, spurted 2  1/8, to 18 5/8.

Politically, Americans and their lawmakers are looking inward. **********But on Sunday in Madrid, Mr. Clinton will move to strengthen American relations with Europe. He plans to sign a document specifying more than 120 joint studies, initiatives, projects, proposals, agreements, goals and expectations, with the aim of freshening the American-European alliance and reconciling old friends. **********While the agreement should make it easier to sell foreign-made goods in the United States or Europe, it will not do all that much to promote an accord along the lines of the North American Free Trade Agreement. **********On the political front, the agreement nearly spans the globe, calling for joint efforts in the Middle East, the former Soviet bloc, Bosnia and Korea. It also calls for closer cooperation on fighting drug trafficking, illegal immigration and organized crime. **********In the trade area, it is to create a Trans-Atlantic Marketplace, where tariffs and nontariff barriers between the United States and Europe will be reduced. **********\"There was real concern in Europe that the United States was downgrading its  relationship with its allies, concern the relations were going to atrophy,\" said Stuart E. Eizenstat, United States Ambassador to the European Union in Brussels. \"I think this shows Europe remains our most important market and the region where we have the most common ground.\" **********Mr. Eizenstat said that under the agreement, tariffs on European imports of computer equipment and semiconductors would be cut by as much as half, and both  sides would commit themselves to harmonizing testing standards across a host of  industries. For example, a pharmaceutical approved and tested in Europe could be sold in the United States without further testing. **********But many economists and political analysts are already asking whether the agreement represents a lot of words aimed mainly at soothing hurt feelings, or an initiative that will open up business flow and genuine political cooperation. **********One aspect is clear: it is by no means what some initially envisioned. Many leaders called for the creation of a Trans-Atlantic Free Trade Zone. They included Prime Minister John Major of Britain, Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada, senior political leaders like Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel of Germany and business leaders like Edzard Reuter, former chairman of Daimler-Benz. **********The logic seemed impeccable. The United States and Canada created such an accord with Mexico, hoping to extend it to all of Latin America. In Europe, United States business involvement is much higher, tariffs are much lower and business practices so similar that a trans-Atlantic free trade zone, or Tafta, as it came to be called, would be far easier than negotiating Nafta. Even the A.F.L.-C.I.O. said it would support such a deal because wages in the two continents were so similar. **********\"But it soon became clear that neither side, neither the United States nor Europe, was ready for a free trade area,\" said Sir Leon Brittan, the European Union's trade commissioner. \"But that doesn't mean that the agreement does not keep that hope alive.\" **********One reason there was little enthusiasm for a free trade agreement was that after the seven years of recent negotiations to create the World Trade Organization to succeed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, there was little desire to begin another protracted round with Europe. **********France, in particular, ruled out any negotiations on changes in its vast agricultural subsidies and continued to insist that broadcast programming include a majority of European shows. Most trade experts agree that a free trade agreement would be meaningless if these two areas were not included. **********And business leaders began arguing that lower tariff barriers were not their  top priority. The average tariff between the United States and Europe is a meager 3 percent. **********\"We really don't worry about existing customs duties,\" said Hanns Glatz, head of European affairs for Daimler-Benz in Brussels. \"Currency fluctuations are far greater concerns to us than tariffs. What we really are interested in are identical regulations.\" **********Corporate heads told political leaders on both sides that the end of duplicate testing requirements and cutting through a hodgepodge of regulations were far more important to their competitive needs than reducing tariffs. **********For example, to sell cars in the United States, European manufacturers have to install different headlights, as do American makers selling in the European market. Cars that have gone through a set of tests in Europe have to be put through other tests in the United States and adjustments made before they can be sold. Peugeot, for example, has given up selling cars in the United States in large part because of the costs of testing. **********Mr. Eizenstat said that under the Trans-Atlantic Marketplace, the two sides planned on trying to open the European market to many biotechnology products now banned here but fully tested, approved and considered safe in the United States. These would include beef hormones that make cattle produce more milk and grow fatter, and a number of bioengineered pharmaceuticals. **********In the end, only time will tell whether the trans-Atlantic accord will be as  much as the politicians bill it to be. **********\"Everyone is asking, 'Where's the beef?' \" said James Elles, a member of the  European Parliament and president of the Trans-Atlantic Policy Network, a Brussels-based association to promote trade. \"I think it is there. I don't think this is an empty declaration.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/26/business/attention-kmart-watchers-floyd-hall-says-he-really-will-save-the-ailing-chain.html": {"writer_name": "Jennifer Steinhauer", "pub_date": "1995-12-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1577, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Attention Kmart Watchers;Floyd Hall Says He Really Will Save the Ailing Chain", "print_headline": "Attention Kmart Watchers;Floyd Hall Says He Really Will Save the Ailing Chain", "body_text": " **********The toughest task, it seems, for the man with the toughest job in American retailing is selling himself. **********Floyd Hall, who was installed in June as chief executive of the embattled Kmart Corporation, has had anything but a honeymoon on Wall Street. Analysts wonder how committed he can be to his job if he refuses to put down roots here,  where Kmart is based, and jets off instead to Montclair, N.J., on weekends to be with his family. They also question his judgment in taking a nine-day junket with other retail executives this fall through the Far East, Cuba and Russia while things at Kmart were falling apart. **********Mr. Hall said he believes his family situation is an advantage because he has \"no other social obligations during the week.\" But he acknowledges that taking the world tour when he did was a public relations gaffe. **********Still others worry that he is a bit of a soft touch. \"He has a sort of avuncular nature,\" said Barry Bryant, the senior director of equity research at  Rodman & Renshaw in New York. \"But you wish he projected something tougher.\" **********More fundamentally, Wall Street critics complain that Mr. Hall has failed to  articulate a convincing strategy for turning around the discount chain that captured the hearts of American shoppers with its low prices and folksy style long before Wal-Mart Stores Inc. bulldozed its way across the country. **********Mr. Hall said he thinks he can prove his critics all wrong. He has a very detailed strategy, he said. It is geared to a very specific demographic group -- young mothers. He is instituting it at about two dozen test sites across America, he says, and it seems to be working. **********So why hasn't he gotten the message across to investors? \"I didn't spell this out for analysts because at the time, we were trying to get to the second level  of test marketing,\" he said. \"While you want to be candid and honest, it doesn't mean you have to give away all of your competitive advantage.\" **********Although he has failed to make a good impression on Wall Street, Mr. Hall does look good on paper. From the mid-1970's until the early 1980's, he ran B. Dalton Booksellers, and then moved on to the Dayton Hudson Corporation's Target  Stores discount-store chain, where he was chief executive from 1981 until 1984;  later he was credited with turning around the Grand Union supermarket chain. **********But in the Darwinian struggle for survival that retailing has become, Kmart is grappling with such deep-rooted problems that it could become only the most recent in a succession of stores that America has decided it can live without. **********For 11 consecutive quarters, it has posted disappointing earnings. In the fiscal year ended last Jan. 25, Kmart swung into a modest profit of $296 million, on sales of $34 billion, from a loss of $974 million, on sales of $36.7 billion, the previous year. But it has lost a total of $151 million in the first three quarters of the current fiscal year. **********The only way Kmart has been able to increase sales has been to cut prices so  low that its margins are squeezed nearly to zero. The reason for its distress, most people agree, is the sorry state of many of its 2,200 stores: At least 500  of them are aging buildings in undesirable locations, full of dated merchandise  and beset by poor service. If they manage to stay in the black, it is usually because their long-term leases enable them to pay cheap rent. **********All the while, Wal-Mart and Target are luring Kmart's customers away with bigger, cleaner and better-stocked stores. Unlike Kmart, both rivals enjoy sophisticated inventory technology and, unlike Kmart, Wal-Mart has the standing  to force suppliers to lower prices. **********As a result, Kmart's shares have taken an unrelenting beating, and even value investors who place their money in pummeled stocks have unloaded Kmart in recent months. In New York Stock Exchange trading on Friday, shares of Kmart closed at $7.25, far below a 52-week high of $16.25. Bond-rating agencies have downgraded its bonds or threatened to do so. And factors -- companies that insure payments of goods shipped by suppliers -- have raised their premiums on shipments, in some cases by as much as 50 percent. **********Mr. Hall inherited this mess from Joseph E. Antonini, who was forced from the chief executive's job in March. Mr. Antonini fended off shareholder revolts for  months, in part by the force of his confident, even blustery, persona. **********Mr. Hall, by contrast, is publicity-shy and given to mumbling and obfuscation in dealing with Wall Street. But past successes suggest that if anybody can salvage Kmart, it is probably him. **********Mr. Hall took over Grand Union in 1984, just after the grocery chain closed 400 stores. By spiffing up its inventory and setting its finances in order, he steered the company into the black within four years. After that, in the mid-1980's, he organized the startup of The Museum Company, a successful specialty store that sells museum reproductions. In interviews, former colleagues at these companies, as well as B. Dalton and Target, described Mr. Hall as a team builder and a shrewd merchandiser. **********\"If Kmart is to survive,\" said Ronald L. Lunde, the former vice president of  merchandising for Grand Union, \"they picked absolutely the perfect guy to effect the turnaround.\" **********Middle America is certainly rooting for him. Memories of the spur-of-the-moment sales known as blue-light specials that Kmart stores used to  offer still hold a special spot in the hearts of millions of shoppers. **********\"It's like your favorite child has gone bad,\" said a supplier who spoke on condition of anonymity. \"You desperately want them to get better.\" **********So far, Mr. Hall is showing himself to be adept at maneuvering Kmart out of tight corners. Last week, his management team negotiated a delay in a $548 million bond payment that, had it been called, would almost surely have sunk the company. The agreement came after lengthy negotiations and cost Kmart a fourth-quarter charge against earnings of $70 million to $100 million. **********But that is an example of a short-term, tactical move. The broader question is what Mr. Hall's long-term strategy will be to woo shoppers. **********The only plan Mr. Hall has offered for public consumption is what he calls the \"pantry\" concept. It involves filling the area customers see first with a selection of low-priced grocery items, from potato chips to laundry soap. The theory is that once shoppers load up on those bargains, they will grab higher-priced products on their way to the cash registers at the other end of the store. **********Wall Street has dismissed this plan as inadequate. But Mr. Hall said Wall Street misunderstands his ambition. The pantry approach, he said, is just the first step of a master plan to reconfigure Kmart stores to attract younger customers. **********And at test stores sprinkled across the country, he said, he has already put  that broader plan into effect. In them, children's clothes and infant supplies are all on the left side of the store as the customer enters, rather than scattered throughout, and women's fashions are adjacent, presumably so that Mom  can browse the shirt rack after picking up diapers. **********Rows are wider to accommodate strollers. The plastic bins filled with jumbles of single-priced products like underwear and can openers have been replaced by attractive displays in smaller bins neatly stacked on top of each other. **********In the kitchen aisle, dishes are displayed on a table, Pottery Barn-style. **********Mr. Hall said he is also working to upgrade the quality and fashion appeal of Kmart's wares. For example, he said, he has asked the Jaclyn Smith clothing line to spruce up its styling. **********\"The American dream has been kind of priced out,\" he said. \"That is important. We're not trying to deal with the department store, upscale customer, but our customer has the same desires.\" **********Mr. Hall said that the efforts at the test stores have paid off, with sales surging between 10 and 20 percent, and profit margins by almost as much, over the last year. **********Despite talk by some that he is not tough enough, Mr. Hall is also lighting a fire under managers. **********Mr. Hall has made half of the annual bonuses for store managers contingent on ratings by \"mystery shoppers,\" and he plans to pepper similar incentives throughout the company.\" **********Still, a visit to a Kmart store in Westbury, L.I., showed how far the company has to go. In the parking lot, yellow lines were barely visible. Inside the store, some bins and sections of shelves were empty, rugs spilled out into a home furnishing aisle, check-out lines were slow-moving and some clerks' shirts  were soiled. **********Retail analysts predict that Kmart will have to close 500 of its 2,200 stores to survive. Mr. Hall said he would prefer to shut just 100 and fix up the others, though he is short on specifics of how to pay for it. **********For all of his efforts, dissatisfaction with Mr. Hall's performance continues. His critics complained that he is too secretive; that he has not acknowledged the full extent of Kmart's problems. **********Mr. Hall retorted that Wall Street is too hungry for a quick fix. \"There is a misconception out there that there is a silver bullet,\" he said. \"I understand the frustration, because this company has a history of over-promising and underachieving.\" Better products, better service and a cleaner environment will  come, he said. \"But this takes time.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/02/world/us-signs-azores-pact.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-06-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 81, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Signs Azores Pact", "print_headline": "U.S. Signs Azores Pact", "body_text": " **********Secretary of State Warren Christopher signed an agreement here today that extends a 44-year-old accord with Portugal allowing the United States to use the Lajes air base on the Azores Islands, 800 miles west of Lisbon. **********The agreement, which American officials say is part of an effort to improve trans-Atlantic ties, also promises to broaden military, scientific and commercial cooperation. **********To compensate Portugal for the use of the base, Washington has agreed to provide millions of dollars of aid."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/19/world/us-troops-still-trickle-into-bosnia.html": {"writer_name": "Raymond Bonner", "pub_date": "1995-12-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 704, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Troops Still Trickle Into Bosnia", "print_headline": "U.S. Troops Still Trickle Into Bosnia", "body_text": " **********It was hardly a pleasant day, with the temperature struggling to stay above freezing, intermittent bone-chilling rain, and the sky depressingly gray. **********But by noon, there was at least enough daylight between the snowy ground and  the clouds to allow the huge American cargo planes to begin landing for the first time in five days. **********By early evening, 16 of the 27 flights planned for today had touched down, including a Danish C-130 bearing soldiers in black berets who will be attached to the Scandinavian battalion that will be part of the international force.

Gen. Stanley F. Cherrie, commander of the American base here, said in a brief meeting with reporters at the airfield. Much about the American operation is as hard to penetrate as the fog. The United Nations is scheduled to turn over command of this sector to the Americans on Wednesday. **********American commanders said that while they were behind schedule, it was not a matter of great concern. **********\"There is no reason to rush,\" said Col. Bob Gaylord. \"We're being deliberate.\" He added that the increase in the number of troops would be \"gradual.\" **********General Cherrie said he had attended a meeting today between Gen. Hagrup Haukland of Norway, the commander of the United Nations peacekeepers here, and local commanders of the Bosnian Serb Army, the Bosnian Croat Army and the Bosnian Government Army. **********He described their attitude as \"genuinely agreeable\" and said they would allow the Americans to send reconnaissance patrols along the routes the Americans are to use in entering Bosnia. The routes pass through the Posavina corridor, which has been bitterly contested by the Bosnian Serbs and the Bosnian Government, and where both still have forces. **********General Cherrie said nothing further about the meeting. **********He said that the deployment of American troops along the confrontation line was \"on schedule,\" but he did not say what that schedule was. **********Other officers said that no date had been set for when the American troops would actually be deployed beyond the air base, where they are confined at the moment, not even being allowed to venture into Tuzla. But they said it would probably not be for at least a week. **********American officers have not yet begun the preparatory meeting with officials in the towns and villages where the Americans will deploy. **********British troops, who are based in Gornji Vakuf, roughly 80 miles southwest of  here, have already begun establishing outposts in contested areas and will begin a major deployment to the confrontation line on Wednesday. **********Colonel Gaylord declined to comment on why the British had been able to move  more rapidly. **********The British have one distinct advantage in that most of their troops were in  country well before the Dayton agreement, either as members of the United Nations peacekeeping force or of the rapid reaction force.

The dozen students sit on cement blocks, rocks or rusty chairs, playing their cowhide drums and wooden marimbas. **********In a building nearby, three men practice handstands and dance steps undisturbed by a couple playing the guitar and rehearsing the same song over and over. In the thatched-roof theater, mime students perform for their teacher. **********Only 10 students a year are accepted to the three-year program at the School of Art at Bagamoyo, one of the few national art schools in sub-Saharan Africa, and one of the few of those devoted expressly to preserving traditional cultures. **********The 30 full-time students who study here, many without previous artistic training, take courses in traditional music, dance, theater and acrobatics, as well as costume design, lighting, English and Swahili. **********\"Our country is so big that the aim of being here is to learn something about our other traditions,\" said Joyce Hagu, 27, a student here who is a teacher from the northeastern coastal region. **********In many ways, the school is the legacy of two decades of socialism and a Government policy aimed at overcoming ethnic divisions and creating a shared sense of national identity. The dance and art studied here reflect Tanzania's 120 ethnic groups and many languages. **********After graduation, many students want to return to their home regions to perform or teach. But now, like Tanzania itself, which has just held its first multiparty elections, the school is trying to redefine its role and cope financially in a post-socialist state. **********Until a couple of years ago, the school's graduates were employed by the Government as performers, but now they are struggling to find jobs on their own, sometimes in cultural offices or as members of their own performance groups in a country where traditional music, as opposed to modern Zairian or Western, is difficult to market to local audiences. **********\"If a nation does not have a cultural identity, it is a nation without a spirit,\" said Penina Mlama, professor of theater and art and the chief academic  officer at the University of Dar es Salaam. \"Bagamoyo is very unique. In Africa  you have the problem that artists don't have schools for practical training.\" **********\"Now, more than ever before, it is important to assert Tanzanian identity,\" Professor Mlama said. \"We need to come up with deliberate policies or we will end up as a nation all over the place. At the moment, I don't see a cultural direction.\" **********The school was founded in 1981 at this fishing hamlet about 80 miles north of the capital, Dar es Salaam. Bagamoyo -- the name in Swahili means \"lay down your heart\" -- was infamous as the assembly point on the east African mainland for slaves before they were shipped to the slave market in Zanzibar. **********Even before independence from Britain in 1961, traditional art was used for political mobilization by nationalist groups. By 1967, specific policies were adopted by the new socialist Government to use art as political propaganda and to suppress ethnic differences. **********The School of Art was founded as a training ground for a national performance troupe, Professor Mlama said. Its mission soon expanded to include the promotion of Tanzanian culture by preparing teachers in the arts. **********But Government policies to advance a national culture, like the institution of Swahili as a national language, have also had the effect of effacing many indigenous traditions, said Rashid Masimbi, the Bagamoyo school's founder and principal. Students sent away to boarding schools for their secondary education  are cut off from their local ways. **********\"Fifty percent of the students when they come cannot seriously sing us a song from home or dance a dance,\" Mr. Rashid said. \"Our philosophy is that we'd like  to develop a performance more suited to our own people. Everything we learn is based on what it is like in our own traditions. But we then develop and bring it into the present tense.\" **********But the future for the school and for these young men and women is uncertain  at best. In the past, the Government paid 90 percent of the roughly $400 annual  tuition fee. But the new Government -- the governing party's presidential candidate, Benjamim Mkapa, is to be sworn in on Nov. 23 -- is inheriting empty coffers. **********This year, all the school's graduates have had to market themselves. Some have given up performing and taken ministry office jobs. As for theater, music and dance groups others form, they spring up for a few months in Dar es Salaam and then go broke and disappear, Professor Mlama said. **********But the students at Bagamoyo say the future does not intimidate them. At a music class continually interrupted by laughter and teasing, they rehearsed a southern coastal song of celebration and then picked a particular rhythm and began to improvise. **********\"This makes me feel so joyful,\" said Victor Mutalemwa, 26, who expects to return to primary school teaching after graduation. \"Here we learn music from all our traditions. We learn we are all the same -- we are all Tanzanians.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/11/business/pc-makers-are-focusing-on-finetuning-the-sound.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-12-11", "snippet": "The personal computer, which is swiftly evolving into an all-purpose home entertainment and work center, has lagged behind in a sound-technology backwater.

While you can listen to National Public Radio on the Internet or slide Beethoven into your CD-ROM player, the sound wafting from the PC has the crackly ring of grandpa's radio -- the one he retired to the attic long ago. **********But this \"incredible magnet\" of tasks and entertainment -- as Robert W. Stearns, vice president of technology and corporate development at the Compaq Computer Corporation, called the PC -- might finally be ready to deliver sound quality on a par with its number-crunching skills. Compaq, the Hewlett-Packard Company, the International Business Machines Corporation and other PC manufacturers are making an aggressive effort to refine PC sound. **********The main obstacle, said Tommy Freadman, a loudspeaker designer, has been sound cards designed by digital whizzes who do not know how to refine the signal once the digital stream has been converted into the analog sound that you hear. **********Another problem, added Mr. Stearns at Compaq, is overtaxed microprocessors. \"There is a tremendous amount of processing going on for full-motion video and high-quality sound,\" he said. **********A conventional high-fidelity system threads a digital signal through a CD player's digital-to-analog converter then to an amplifier and then the loudspeakers. In a PC, the digital-audio signal from a floppy disk, CD-ROM or Internet site passes through a sound card containing a digital-to-analog converter and amplifier. **********While some PC sources offer potentially excellent sound, radio on the World Wide Web is still fairly primitive. The amounts of data are too much for a microprocessor to handle smoothly and quickly. **********Manufacturers have been trying to find a cost-effective solution. Shifting the sonic burden from the microprocessor to a dedicated chip, for example, could produce excellent results but the cost of the chip and the added storage capacity would drive up the basic price of the PC. **********Manufacturers feared that consumers would balk at the built-in cost of better sound. The solution seemed to be in add-ons. **********Pentium processors operating at 75 megahertz and faster have opened the door  for better PC sound through a relatively new technology -- wave-table synthesis. It has been sold in computer sound cards for about a year and is coming in supplemental software. **********The wave-table is a bank of digitally synthesized musical sounds, for example, from a violin, trumpet or guitar. These stored sounds are drawn on and  blended, either by the musical instrument digital interface system, or M.I.D.I., used in computer sound cards or by a new generation of dedicated chips. **********\"The quality of sound you can get through the wave-table is astonishing,\" said Gerald W. Tschetter, an assistant general manager at the Yamaha Corporation of America, a unit of the Yamaha Corporation. \"For a few hundred dollars' worth  of add-ons, you can do things on your PC now that 10 years ago musicians in the  best studios in the world could not have done.\" **********Hewlett-Packard used the wave-table in its new Pavilion series of PC's, featuring loudspeakers from Altec Lansing Technologies, a unit of Mark IV Industries. **********\"In many ways, audio quality has become one of the more important aspects of  PC's in the home,\" said Webb McKinney, general manager of Hewlett-Packard's home products division. **********Consumer expectations for PC sound are likely to rise when the CD-size digital video disk, capable of holding an entire movie with spectacular audio, comes to market in late 1996 or early '97. **********While the sound available from PC program sources has improved, the mediocrity of sound cards must be addressed on two fronts: the quality of the digital-to-analog converter and the quality of the power amplifier. **********Mr. Tschetter at Yamaha said that the modest amplifiers built into sound cards were never expected to meet the demands of hi-fi quality loudspeakers and  the converted analog signal should be fed to an amplifier outside the PC. **********\"In most instances,\" said Mr. Tschetter, \"the amplifier provided in a sound card is the same used for the headphone output of a cassette deck; its power output amounts to a fraction of a watt.\" He said computer sound needs only 5 to  10 watts. **********Other engineers contended that the sound card had the potential to carry the  full load. **********Peter Theran, senior manager for multimedia products at the Bose Corporation, said, \"The reality is that PC companies haven't invested in putting high-quality sound in PC's. **********\"We've steadily improved sound in PC's, but it's still nowhere near on a par  with the average stereo system. For PC manufacturers, it's really a twofold investment -- the necessary electronics and the additional space required to accommodate them.

But as others gathered here to mourn the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, neither President Hosni Mubarak nor King Hussein saw reason any longer to stay away. **********For Mr. Mubarak, it was his first journey to Jerusalem ever. In the 14 years since he took office after the assassination of Mr. Sadat, Mr. Mubarak had upset Israeli officials by refusing many invitations to follow his predecessor's example and make a visit. **********For King Hussein, it was his first return in 28 years to a city whose eastern half he once governed. **********Wearing a red-and-white checked headdress and a look of deep sorrow, the Jordanian King made plain his own amazement at the spectacle as he stood beside  Mr. Rabin's coffin and declared that \"never in all my thoughts did it occur to me that my first visit to Jerusalem\" would come on such an occasion. **********\"He had courage, he had vision and he had a commitment to peace,\" King Hussein declared of Mr. Rabin. **********\"As long as I live, I'll be proud to have known him, to have worked with him, as a brother and as a friend and as a man, and the relationship of friendship that we had is something unique and I'm proud of that.\" **********The King and the Egyptian President joined their fellow world leaders here with deceptive nonchalance, although their words and demeanor made clear that they remain divided about how fast and far to go now in pursuit of a wider peace. King Hussein spoke with obvious emotion and at some length; Mr. Mubarak spoke more briefly and in guarded diplomatic language. **********Still, it was clear that the death of Mr. Rabin had jarred some old thinking. After shunning Israel since taking office, Mr. Mubarak said this morning that the strides toward peace that Mr. Rabin had taken meant that he had a duty to pay his final respects. **********\"He defied the prejudices of the past to tackle the most complicated of problems,\" Mr. Mubarak said in a eulogy of his own. \"These achievements have undoubtedly established him as a true hero of peace.\" **********In a pageant that would have been unthinkable when Mr. Rabin took office just three years ago, King Hussein and Mr. Mubarak were joined here by white-robed Government ministers from Oman and Qatar, their presence marking the first visit to Israel by any delegation from a Persian Gulf country. **********Prime Minister Abdellatif Filali of Morocco and members of the Palestinian Authority also attended the funeral at Mount Herzl cemetery, the burial place of Theodor Herzl, the founder of Zionism, which lies just a few miles away from one of Islam's holiest sites, Al Aksa Mosque. **********And even after a succession of White House ceremonies that has made joint gatherings of Arab and Israeli officials appear commonplace, today's gathering was remarked upon with wonder by ordinary Israelis. They recognized the fact that two Arab heads of state were finally standing in Jerusalem represented the  breaching of a formidable barrier. **********As Egypt's Vice President in 1978, Mr. Mubarak visited the Israeli town of Beersheeba with Mr. Sadat, but he did not accompany the Egyptian leader on his historic trip to Jerusalem that year. **********Mr. Mubarak sought first to mend the deep ruptures caused by his predecessor's decision to break with the rest of the Arab world and sign the Camp David accords. More recently he has appeared to hesitate about reaching out toward Israel because of opposition by Muslim militants who are waging a guerrilla war against his Government, in part because of their opposition to any peace with the Jewish state. **********But as the former Egyptian Air Force pilot took his place at the podium today, he spoke with unhesitating praise for Mr. Rabin, saying that the loss of  the Israeli leader had dealt \"a severe blow\" to efforts to achieve a just and lasting peace. **********\"Only through our unwavering commitment to this objective can we truly honor  the memory of this fallen hero of peace,\" Mr. Mubarak said. \"And I could say that the best memorial for Yitzhak Rabin is to continue what he started, which is the peace process.\" **********The joint appearance, however, left little doubt that King Hussein and Mr. Mubarak, whose Governments have been sniping at one another for months, still hold different views about the path ahead. **********King Hussein, whose Government reached peace with Israel just a year ago, spoke today as an unabashed champion of seizing the moment, urging others \"to come out openly\" on behalf of peace. **********\"This is where we stand,\" he said. \"This is our camp. Maybe God will bless you with the realization that you must join it, and we pray that you will, but otherwise we are not ashamed.\" **********By contrast, Mr. Mubarak, whose Government has criticized Jordan for being too quick to seize the benefits of peace, spoke in language that was careful and businesslike. He told reporters that he did not regard the trip as an official visit with political significance. **********And while King Hussein spoke with pride about his grandfather, King Abdullah, who was assassinated in Jerusalem in 1951 by Muslim extremists, Mr. Mubarak made no mention of Mr. Sadat. **********King Hussein's grandfather had made contacts with Israel in search of peace beginning soon after the 1948 war. The young Crown Prince was standing at his grandfather's side when Abdullah was slain in the Old City of Jerusalem, near Al Aksa Mosque. **********While the two countries have now reached separate peace accords with Israel,  the Jordanian King and the Egyptian President are still bound by what remains unanswered about the fate of Jerusalem and its Islamic holy sites. These include Al Aksa Mosque, to which Muslims around the world insist upon free access. **********The issues of Jersusalem and the custodianship of its holy sites are now scheduled to be taken up as part of the final settlement talks between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization beginning next spring. But the differences in manner that the two leaders displayed today reflected in part the debate about what should happen between now and then. **********King Hussein, who appears eager to persuade the West that he is the most reliable of Israel's former foes, has shown less and less regard for the sensibilities of other Arab countries, particularly Syria, whose absence today served as a reminder that a central element of the peace process remains unsettled. **********\"Let us not keep silent,\" the King said this afternoon. \"Let our voices rise  high to speak of our commitment of peace for all times to come.\" **********But Mr. Mubarak, while playing a behind-the-scenes role in brokering the latest accord between Israel and the P.L.O., has been more muted about urging swift action on others.  Mr. Mubarak has reached out to Syria in recent months as part of an effort to strengthen an old bond, and Egyptian officials have suggested that issues surrounding Jerusalem can be settled only as part of a final peace between Israel and all of its former foes. **********The Egyptian President must also still contend with Muslim militants at home, and his attempt today to play down the momentousness of his visit appeared aimed in part at a domestic audience. **********But if King Hussein was greeted in Jerusalem by Israeli officials today as if he were a member of the family, Mr. Mubarak also found an enthusiastic welcome. **********After the Egyptian President found himself in the rear at the final ceremony  at which Mr. Rabin was laid to rest, he was quickly escorted forward. In deference to Jewish tradition, which requires men to cover their heads at religious ceremonies, Mr. Mubarak returned the courtesy by donning a blue baseball cap given to him by Israeli officials."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/23/world/world-news-briefs-government-ousted-in-mauritius-election.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-12-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 205, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WORLD NEWS BRIEFS;Government Ousted In Mauritius Election", "print_headline": "WORLD NEWS BRIEFS;Government Ousted In Mauritius Election", "body_text": " **********The main opposition alliance has won a landslide victory in a general election, final results showed today. **********The National Electoral Commission said the alliance, led by Navin Ramgoolam and Paul Berenger, took 65.2 percent of the 556,297 votes cast on Wednesday to take all 60 parliament seats on Mauritius. **********The alliance's allies also won the two seats on Rodrigues, an island dependency. **********The governing coalition of Prime Minister Sir Anerood Jugnauth won just 19.7  of the vote; it was one of the most resounding defeats for a government since independence from Britain in 1968.

For proof, just ask Doug Lennick, an executive at American Express. \"Absolutely\" the financial services giant considers itself a direct competitor of Schwab, he said. \"And tell them I said so.\" **********Of course, Schwab, as one of the first and most successful discount brokers,  has long had its rivals. And some are heavyweights, like Fidelity Investments. But now Schwab is knocking heads with bruisers like American Express, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch, and these rivals possess strengths that Schwab's current competition does not, from huge research staffs to access to public offerings to other lures for the advisers and clients using Schwab. **********This is the first time,\" said Kurt Cerulli, a Boston consultant, \"that Schwab has faced players of this magnitude.\" Merrill Lynch alone is four times Schwab's size. **********The baring of knuckles comes from several corners. For one, nobody gets as big as Schwab has without jostling someone formidable. \"The history of the business is you can always get a share\" of the market, said A. Michael Lipper, who heads his own research firm. But \"when you start impinging on others, the artillery starts coming out.\" Many industry developments -- such as the slow retreat from commissions to fee-based pay -- have also put Schwab in closer contention with others on Wall Street. **********Then there's Mr. Schwab's grand plan to grow. He already has 3.3 million clients with a collective $170 billion in assets, and took in $1.1 billion in revenue in 1994. But within 10 years he wants 10 million clients with a total of $1 trillion -- a feat that would require annual compounded growth of 20 percent. **********To get there, he has a variety of projects. He has begun to establish a service that refers his customers to independent financial advisers. He plans to get into the business of helping small companies set up and run 401(k) retirement plans for their employees. He expects to go further into managing other people's money by creating more Schwab mutual funds and maybe even gobbling up a mutual fund family. **********But to make all or even some of these moves means stepping on some big toes. **********Mr. Schwab, who is 58, is unflappably confident, however. \"We're beautifully  positioned\" for the future of financial services, he said, and he has lots of fellow optimists.  Schwab \"is doing very, very well,\" said Guy Moszkowski, a principal at Sanford C. Bernstein, the investment research firm. **********Customers of Schwab and investors in its stock, which has risen from $2 in 1990 to a close on Friday of $24.875, may still want to size up the budding rivalry seriously before taking the bulls at their word. When you go toe-to-toe  with titans, the outcome is never clear. **********To be fair, Mr. Schwab sure knows how to grow. Since he started the company in 1971, the San Francisco company has become the country's largest discount brokerage. Schwab has also captured about $47 billion in mutual fund assets, about half through its Onesource program, which allows investors to buy nearly 400 no-load mutual funds without a transaction fee. And the firm has roughly $30 billion parked in its own money market funds. **********Typically, the growth has rested on great insight. Take the Onesource strategy. \"Schwab redefined the landscape in the fund industry\" with that program, said Michael McCaffery, the president and chief executive of Robertson  Stephens & Company. In it, investors can buy funds from many fund families with  a single telephone call and get a single shareholder statement. The participating no-load funds, like Robertson Stephens, pay Schwab a part of their assets and give access to their shareholders' names in return for Schwab's distribution muscle. **********BUT the success of Onesource is now sparking imitation. True, Fidelity, which is already the nation's second-largest discount broker, started its own \"fund marketplace\" several years ago. But the list of competitors from all parts of Wall Street has now expanded greatly, endangering Schwab's lock on the business. Mutual funds like T. Rowe Price and Vanguard now peddle their own versions of Onesource, and brokerages like Waterhouse Securities and Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette are moving in the same direction. Because investors seeking advice also want more investment choices, companies like American Express have expanded the  number of funds they offer, too, and Prudential, Merrill Lynch and Smith Barney  are examining the idea. **********Many of the fund families feel they have no choice. While some are content to let as much as half of their assets sit at Schwab, where they lose all touch with shareholders, others see the handwriting on the wall. Twentieth Century Mutual Funds is thinking about starting a fund marketplace sometime soon. \"I don't know how to avoid it,\" said W. Gordon Snyder, an executive vice president  there. The group has also resolved to have no more than 5 percent of its assets  in Onesource. **********And Fidelity has recently redoubled its efforts to build up its funds marketplace -- with some success.  Some fund families may have been wary of joining a competitor's program, but more than 200 have now hooked up with Fidelity. **********Schwab is also being pursued -- especially by the industry's big guns -- in the small but fast-growing slice of the market occupied by advisers who get paid a fee for their investment counsel. Of the $1.3 trillion in assets controlled by investment advisers who charge either by fee or by commission, as much as a quarter has been captured by the fee-paid ones, according to Mr. Cerulli. **********As with Onesource, Schwab got into this field early and smart, providing back-office and other services for advisers who now number 4,000 and bring in a  third of Schwab's assets. \"Schwab really beat the industry to the punch by offering many services that these advisers like,\" James Gately, a senior vice president at Vanguard, conceded. **********But again, success has spawned wannabes. Fidelity once took advisers for granted, but is now busy wooing them and is making headway. \"We're finally getting some respect,\" said Peggy Ruhlin, whose investment advisory firm in Columbus, Ohio, has about $200 million under management. \"When we used to try to get duplicate statements, they laughed in our faces.\" **********Fidelity acknowledges its new ardor. \"In any company, you can't do everything at once,\" said Roger Servison, a managing director.  \"Now we're turning our attention to the fee-only investment adviser.\" **********Mr. Schwab respects Fidelity's efforts. \"They are probably our best competitor,\" he said, citing the private company's freedom from shareholder pressures. **********But other courtiers are knocking on advisers' doors too, not only because the market will grow but also because the booming use of Schwab by advisers poses for them a particularly grave threat. These firms are huge and they offer stock  research and other capabilities very important to investment advisers. Morgan Stanley, for example, is seriously looking into the business, and while a spokesman for Goldman Sachs refuses to comment, some investment advisers say that brokerage firm has approached them about the same thing. **********Mr. Schwab doesn't think Goldman or Morgan will take the plunge and compete directly with his firm for these advisers. \"I don't know if it's a natural for them,\" he said, noting that it is hard to make money in this area and that the firms have high costs. But the attraction may be too strong to pass up. **********EITHER way, Mr. Schwab is not standing still. To strengthen Schwab's ties to  its advisers and to capture some of their fees, his firm has begun to refer to an adviser any customer with at least $100,000 to invest. **********The strategy is not without risks. By making the referral Schwab is implicitly standing behind the advisers' quality, and for that reason it imposes quality controls: referred advisers must have at least five years' experience, manage at least $10 million in assets and have a clear regulatory record. But Schwab makes no guarantees, and unhappy investors may still blame the firm. **********But retaliation by rivals may be the far bigger threat. Putting Goldman and Morgan Stanley aside, for example, American Express, another traditional investment advisory firm, has taken big swipes at Schwab. For an annual fee of a half-percent to 1.5 percent of assets, American Express advisers will select a portfolio of funds for investors. And the company is slowly expanding its fund offerings to include non-American Express funds, Mr. Lennick, an executive vice  president, said. The company is also beginning to market its services to its card members. **********As with Goldman and Morgan, Mr. Schwab plays down any competitive threat. \"They've awakened a large number of card members to the whole financial-services thing,\" Mr. Schwab said about the American Express moves. \"It expands the market for all of us.\" **********If Mr. Schwab is unwilling to acknowledge the power of the competition, he has at least apparent agreement from John Steffens, an executive vice president  of Merrill Lynch.  \"I frankly don't think we compete with Charles Schwab,\" Mr. Steffens said. But his firm is close to deciding to expand its Asset Power program in a way that sure sounds like a threat to Schwab's advisers: Investors  would pay a flat annual fee, possibly lower than the current 1.5 percent of assets, for advice and an investment menu that will include no-load mutual funds. **********Mr. Schwab's grand plan goes beyond alliances with advisers. He is bringing Schwab more into asset management, too -- and thus far beyond the middleman and  distributor roles that made Schwab a household name. He recently added three asset-allocation funds to the other proprietary funds he introduced five years ago, for example, and may add more mutual funds. He has also considered buying a mutual fund company, including the $5 billion Dimensional Fund Advisors. And he  is thinking about devising a fund of funds, in which Schwab would select a group of high-performing funds available through Onesource and offer them in one fund. **********Such ambitions can strain the loyalty of Schwab's advisers, who use its services precisely because it has no ties to in-house products. \"Then they'd be  like Fidelity, but less attractive, with less of a track record,\" said Jane King, an adviser in Boston. **********But the ambitions also jangle the nerves of fund groups. When Schwab hatches  or buys new funds, or picks a handful of promising ones for a fund of funds, it  is no longer just a middleman. It's a player. And that means greater suspicion and competition from the funds -- including those signed up for Onesource. **********Undeterred by these implications, Schwab also plans a push into the 401(k) market, where it will also compete directly with the fund companies and its affiliated advisers. Having made no headway in the market to serve large companies -- an area Fidelity dominates -- Schwab is aiming at the small outfits with as few as 10 employees -- for now. \"It's going to be a major thrust for the company in 1996 and 1997,\" Mr. Schwab said. The firm has already bought a company that develops recordkeeping software for the 401(k) market, and is interested in making more such acquisitions. **********To top it off, the financial-services industry is converging in many ways, and that means more rivals for Schwab -- whether or not it has grand plans. **********Consider the move by brokerage firms away from paying brokers on commissions. Mr. Steffens of Merrill Lynch, for example, expects that as much as 30 percent of Merrill Lynch's assets will be managed on a fee basis within 10 years, compared with just 6 percent today. That trend softens the distinction between fee-only investment advisers and brokers. **********FOR Schwab's advisers, many of whom have entered the business within the last five years, this is very bad news. After all, Merrill Lynch alone has 12,500 brokers, and Schwab's network of advisers must compete directly with them and others from large institutions. For Schwab it is bad news, too, because these advisers now account for a third of the firm's assets, up from 17 percent four years ago. Add some of Wall Street's other ventures into the advice trade -- Smith Barney plans to market its sizable research department, which already studies 800 money managers, for instance -- and things can look pretty grim. **********But Mr. Schwab never seems to sweat over any of this. \"I was sort of wonderfully surprised that Merrill Lynch recognized the good value on behalf of  its customers of no-load funds,\" he said in a typical remark. \"That will be much more competition for the world.\" **********Some people seem nervous, though, including Mr. Schwab's own troops. \"We can  play it safe and grow 10 to 12 pecent a year. We can't grow 20 percent if we play it safe,\" acknowledged David Pottruck, Schwab's president and chief operating officer. \"I worry sometimes, frankly. Can we, all of us, keep up with  the pace of change? There feels like there's no let-up, there's no end to the campaign.\" **********And there isn't, at least for Mr. Schwab."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/14/business/us-reports-a-rebound-in-retail-sales.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1995-12-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 726, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Reports A Rebound In Retail Sales", "print_headline": "U.S. Reports A Rebound In Retail Sales", "body_text": " **********Retail sales rebounded last month, the Government reported yesterday, but analysts said consumers remained anxious and they continued to predict a brutally competitive Christmas for retailers. **********According to the Commerce Department's early estimates, retail sales rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in November, more than expected, to a seasonally adjusted $197.9 billion. **********But the impact of the increase, the largest monthly gain since June, for the most part was offset by downward revisions for the previous two months. October's figure was revised to four-tenths of 1 percent, and September's to one-tenth of 1 percent. **********Given those revisions, and the volatility inherent in the initial data, analysts warned that the size of the increase reported yesterday might ultimately be pared. **********\"I am very hesitant to cheer,\" said Susan Herring, a senior economist at Salomon Brothers. \"Looking at the average of the past three months, retail sales are slowing, from more than a 4 percent rate of growth in the third quarter to less than 2 percent now.

But analysts said the gain did not signal a revival. **********\"Apparel sales went up because everything is being sold at distressed levels,\" said Sandra Shaber, a senior vice president at the WEFA Group, economic forecasters in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa. \"This is not the start of a new trend.\" **********Elsewhere, the Commerce Department said that car sales rose four-tenths of 1  percent in November after a decline of one-tenth of 1 percent in October.

If it did not set a fixed deadline for the troop withdrawal, it opened itself up to criticism that the United States was getting involved in an  ill-defined, open-ended mission. **********General John Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made that  point to Congress last week. He said it was important to set a target date of one year and then bring the troops home, because \"in the absence of that, you find yourself staying there, and that's how very often mission creep comes in.\" **********But during the two days of marathon hearings before Senate and House committees, lawmakers from both parties charged that Presidential politics was involved in setting a one-year deadline, a charge that the witnesses denied, saying that the one-year deadline was based on purely military considerations. **********Both Democrats and Republicans also asked how the Administration could set a  deadline for a peacekeeping mission when when the warring parties still had fundamental differences over territory, the status of the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo and how Bosnia would function with an enemy \"Serb Republic\" within its  borders. **********In addition, some NATO allies are uneasy with the setting of an artificial deadline for the 60,000-troop mission in the absence of a peace agreement, senior Pentagon and NATO officials have said. **********That line of criticism continued today. Dick Cheney, a former Secretary of Defense, said on CBS, \"To talk about a timetable that we will be out within a year, when you don't know what the objective is, and haven't really developed a  plan for executing that, raises serious questions about the quality of the decision-making process within the Administration.\" **********The first suggestion that the yearlong deadline was not fixed came on Thursday, when President Clinton said that although his commanders believe that  the mission could be completed in a year, he wanted to reserve judgment until a  peace agreement is signed. \"I want to have a very high level of confidence that  I can make that commitment and keep it,\" Mr. Clinton said. He added, \"It looks like we're talking about a commitment in the nature -- in the range of -- a year.\" **********Indeed, during the hearings last week, Mr. Perry acknowledged that despite his recommendation that the United States should stick to a definite timetable,  the decision was ultimately a political one. \"I will not be the final decision maker,\" he said. **********In their television appearances today, both Mr. Perry and Mr. Christopher acknowledged that the United States and its NATO allies had failed to resolve another important element of the peacekeeping operation: finding a formula for Russian participation, given the refusal of Russia's President, Boris N. Yeltsin, to put troops under NATO command. **********Mr. Yeltsin today added another condition, saying in a speech to the United Nations that Russia was ready to provide troops, \"but only under a strict mandate of the U.N. Security Council.\" **********The United States has insisted that Russian troops serve under NATO command or play a non-combat role like building roads and clearing mines. **********Mr. Christopher said today that he did not expect the issue to be resolved when Mr. Clinton meets Mr. Yeltsin in Hyde Park, N.Y., on Monday. During the hearings, Mr. Perry said that the divide is so great that it was \"questionable\"  whether Russian forces would take part."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/21/business/company-news-interco-agrees-to-buy-thomasville-furniture.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1995-11-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 118, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;INTERCO AGREES TO BUY THOMASVILLE FURNITURE", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;INTERCO AGREES TO BUY THOMASVILLE FURNITURE", "body_text": " **********Interco Inc. agreed to buy the Thomasville Furniture Industries unit of Armstrong World Industries for $331 million, the companies said yesterday.

Now there's a figure that commands some respect. That's the amount that those retirement plans with the yawner name -- 401(k) -- will likely claim as their own in just three or four years. Nearly 18.5 million American workers have these tax-advantaged accounts, and many millions more will doubtless soon join them. For the 401(k) has been heralded by economists, politicians and investment advisers alike as a key to a comfortable retirement in the post-pension world. **********But the 401(k) idea has a flaw. No, not just the frequent lament that many eligible workers do not join the plans, or do not invest enough in them, or do not allocate their assets appropriately. This other problem centers not on the worker at all but on the company, not on an ill-informed investor but on a malformed plan. **********This is a story about how some workers who were enrolled in such unsatisfactory plans -- two San Francisco architects, a newspaper editor in Philadelphia, the treasurer of a parking-lot company and a whole set of workers  at a food company in upstate New York -- voiced their concerns and persuaded their companies to make the necessary changes. **********Unfortunately, such reformers are rare, even if the defects that roused them  are not. While companies generally follow Labor Department guidelines on the basic features of a good 401(k) plan, those minimums leave plenty of room for discretion. And, for a host of reasons, the executives who choose 401(k) plans for their companies are simply not the unerring judges that workers may assume. **********For many executives, the 401(k) question often yields to more pressing issues -- like meeting the competition. And even if the 401(k) gets their attention, it may be for naught. \"In many cases,\" said Daniel P. Wiener, publisher of the newsletter Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors, the executive who does the choosing \"doesn't have a clue about investing.\" **********Even the pricing of such plans is not clear-cut. \"Many companies, and even benefits consultants, feel confused on pricing because it's all over the map,\" said Tom Johnson, vice president for marketing for Fed Services in Pittsburgh, which manages $80 billion in 401(k) money. **********And where knowledge is sketchy and prices fuzzy, social connections often become decisive. The choice of a corporate 401(k) plan, Mr. Wiener said, often hinges less on its merits than on \"the relationship between the person at the company who makes the decisions and a sales agent for a mutual fund company.\" Selecting a plan after a round of golf hosted by such agents, he said, \"is no way to design a plan.\" **********The results, the experts say, are plans with too few choices, arbitrarily set contribution limits, hidden fees, and other traits that can at best dampen the great promise of 401(k) plans and, at worst, seriously hobble workers' efforts to prepare for retirement. **********Here are the tales of those workers who have become Norma Rae's of the 401(k). They describe what weak spots they found, how they discovered the problems and what reform strategies they used -- from pushing for less costly changes on the theory the company is more receptive to them, to exploiting the investment savvy of in-house financial officers in mapping a new plan. **********For the rest of the 18.5 million 401(k) investors, the lesson these workers teach is that while your 401(k) may be far from perfect, it may also be far from written in stone. Now may be a particularly good time to explore both those questions, with plan vendors engaged in a fierce competition that means dirt-cheap prices for buyers. Indeed, delay may be dangerous. The tax breaks that make the plans so attractive to workers are also attracting the attention of Congressional budget-balancers. **********Yet assessing one's 401(k) plan is a long-term exercise, too. Just as today's workers must take charge of their own retirement investments, they also must scrutinize the contours of the plans. The stories below teach us to ask the critical, overarching questions: How good is my 401(k)? Are there hidden fees or costly features that serve little purpose? Do its mutual funds perform well, and are there enough of them? Asking these questions -- and pushing for change if the answers are unsatisfactory -- are critical chores for the workers who will be the pioneer retirees of the 21st century. **********Two Puzzled Architects **********In 1993, two young architects in San Francisco, Kevin Kennedy and Steve Jackson, noticed something odd about their 401(k) investments. The plan's no-load mutual funds reported returns in the newspaper that were much better than the returns they reported to the plan. **********Confused and worried, the men approached the owners of their firm, Gordon H.  Chong & Associates. The owners agreed to a 401(k) review, with the firm's 50 architects electing a four-member committee to perform it. **********The committee, which included Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Jackson, was soon poring over the plan documents and unraveling the complexities of the 401(k). But it didn't take long for them to discover why their existing mutual fund options did so much better in the newspaper than on their plan's papers: buried in the pricing of their 401(k) documents was a 5 percent commission on purchases of these \"no load\" mutual funds. **********Naturally, the committee began to look elsewhere. Mr. Jackson, for example, used his personal computer to conduct a detailed performance analysis of various mutual funds over intervals ranging from three years to one month. **********The committee also interviewed mutual fund companies and other vendors of 401(k) plans, and became pretty smart shoppers. \"The really big guys in mutual funds offered very good service -- but you had to buy only their funds and that  put us off a little bit,\" Mr. Kennedy said. **********Given their past experience, they were acutely attuned to hard-to-detect fees. \"We also felt that they had some loads, some costs, that you don't necessarily see upfront,\" he said about some vendors. \"That made us a little leery because there were plenty of pure no-load funds out there.\" **********The committee worked for more than a year, eventually prompting the firm's owners to retain Schwab One, which allows workers to pick from six investment options offered by several different mutual funds and other money managers. And  the new plan reduced, from one year to several months, the waiting period before new employees could enroll. **********A Borrower and a Lender Be **********Jonathan Neumann, enterprise editor at The Philadelphia Inquirer, mentioned  to one of his superiors in 1994 that he was planning to borrow some money. She suggested he take out a loan against his 401(k) savings. To Mr. Neumann, who had put away the maximum allowed since the plan began in 1989, the idea made great sense. He needn't worry about applying for a loan, and instead of paying interest to a bank he would be paying it to himself. **********But when Mr. Neumann asked for loan forms he got a shock. **********\"Much to my surprise,\" he said, \"I learned that the union employees were not  allowed to borrow, but people in management could.\" **********Mr. Neumann went right to the top, asking both the paper's publisher and the  president of his union, Local 10 of the Newspaper Guild, the whys and wherefores of the rule. \"Neither had any answers,\" he said. **********So Mr. Neumann and a colleague called R. Theodore Benna, a benefits consultant in Langhorne, Pa., who is widely credited with popularizing 401(k) plans. Mr. Benna said there was no legal reason such loans could not be made to  union employees, that the paperwork involved would cost less than $1,000 and that all other loan costs could be charged to borrowers. **********\"We went back to the publisher and the union president and they said, 'That's all it takes?' and in about two months it was done and I got my loan,\" Mr. Neumann said. **********Such \"self-lending\" is a big attraction of the 401(k) and its nonprofit cousin, the 403(b). About $17 billion of these assets have been borrowed, with an average loan balance of $6,200, according to Access Research, a market research firm in Windsor, Conn. Under Federal law these loans are limited to half of account balances, up to $50,000. **********Good Stuff Real Cheap **********Doug Bowlus was not too pleased with the performance of the money manager for his 401(k) plan at ABM Industries, a San Francisco company that runs parking lots and janitorial services across the country. **********\"Nobody was particularly happy with our investment manager,\" Mr. Bowlus, ABM's treasurer, said. \"I tracked their performance and came to the conclusion that we could do better.\" **********But Mr. Bowlus knew that he faced some constraints. \"We are not a high-margin company,\" he said, \"and so cost control and avoidance is a serious issue.\" **********So, with some colleagues, Mr. Bowlus focused on cheap ways to make ABM's 401(k) plan better. And he succeeded, ultimately persuading his superiors to switch investment managers, to change administrators to improve 401(k) record-keeping, and to provide additional features, such as two more investment  options. **********\"We got all of these improvements,\" said Mr. Bowlus, \"for virtually no additional cost to the company.\" In fact, he said, the switch to a new administrator should lower administrative costs. **********Equally important are the new plan's improvements in 401(k) communication and education. Employees can now get daily valuations from an 800 number, for instance, and each quarter they also receive reports on how each fund option did compared to all similar funds. **********\"We are also getting much more, and much more professional, educational materials,\" Mr. Bowlus said. \"It will help our employees understand the difference between savings and investment and what different options can mean to their retirement income, and to better understand that investment is a long-term process and not 'What did you do for me this quarter?' \" **********And in securing the new plan, Mr. Bowlus used a strategy that may prove useful to others. As ABM's treasurer, he is financially knowledgeable, and he relied as well on other ABM finance specialists in his efforts. **********Such specialists add needed investment acumen for 401(k) design, said Thomas  Schlossberg, president of Diversified Investment Advisors. While there has recently been a big shift of 401(k) responsibility to financial executives, \"About 60 percent of the time the benefits or human resources people, especially at smaller companies, decide on the 401(k) plan,\" he said. \"Better to get the chief financial officer's people involved, too.\" **********Everybody Into the Act **********At Curtice-Burns Foods in Rochester, N.Y., a battle over corporate ownership last fall had left many employees fretful about their future. To allay concerns  and show its benevolence, the company decided to greatly improve the retirement  plans of its 1,200 salaried workers. **********But first the company, which makes Comstock pie fillings and Nalley's chips,  surveyed its workers to find out their sentiments. What it learned was a surprise -- and led the company to change direction. **********\"We knew we needed to do something in the area of retirement,\" said Lois Warlick-Jarvie, vice president for human resources. \"We were looking at improving the defined benefit plan, but based on what we heard from our employees we decided to work on the defined contribution plan.\" In other words,  while the company was readying a plan to augment its pension, workers were pointing to their 401(k)'s instead. **********And improve them, it did. The company increased the plan's investment options from two to four and, while there was no company match before, Curtice-Burns offered a 50 percent match, up to 3 percent of pay. **********The lesson for workers is twofold: Speak up about changes you desire because  your company may have no clue about your preferences. And when you do speak up,  your company may well say yes. **********Congress first authorized the 401(k) plan in 1980. By the year 2000 -- a mere 20 years later -- the predictions are that 25 million American workers at 350,000 companies will have invested $1.175 trillion in such plans. **********That growth makes it critical for workers to realize that, in the world of the 401(k), intelligent investing means more than just mastering and following the rules of asset allocation, diversification and the like. It also means stepping back, scrutinizing the overall plan as vigorously as they scrutinize investments, and pushing for change if change is needed. For weak plans can make strong portfolios -- and a secure retirement -- impossible to achieve."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/26/world/turkish-premier-resigns-after-losing-election-to-islamic-party.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-12-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 576, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Turkish Premier Resigns After Losing Election to Islamic Party", "print_headline": "Turkish Premier Resigns After Losing Election to Islamic Party", "body_text": " **********Prime Minister Tansu Ciller of Turkey, defeated by an Islamic party in Sunday's general elections, resigned today and made overtures to a conservative  rival to keep the Islamic party out of power. **********A spokesman for President Suleyman Demirel said Mrs. Ciller had resigned, along with her Cabinet, but would stay in office until a new government was formed. **********If necessary, we will not be the ones to stand in the way of a coalition\" with the conservative Motherland Party, she said at a news conference before she resigned. **********The Welfare Party, the Islamic party, was confirmed as the winner of the elections, with 21 percent of the vote, the Government-run television said. It was the first victory in a general election for an Islamic party in Turkey's 72-year history as a secular republic. **********The Welfare Party leader, Necmettin Erbakan, said he expected to be given the mandate to form a new Government. **********\"As a requirement of democracy Demirel will give the right to form a government to the party with the most votes,\" he said. \"And we will go and speak to other parties about a coalition.\" **********But the Welfare Party fell well short of a clear majority and may have trouble finding a coalition partner in the two largest secular parties. **********\"As the situation looks today, it is not possible for us to form a government\" with the Welfare Party, the Motherland Party leader, Mesut Yilmaz, said in remarks carried by the Anatolian News Agency. **********Under Turkey's proportional representation system, the Welfare Party appears  to have won 158 seats in the 550-member Parliament, Mrs. Ciller's True Path Party 135 seats and the Motherland Party 132 seats. **********Mrs. Ciller and the Motherland Party leaders, longtime bitter adversaries, could block the Welfare Party if they formed a coalition sought by business groups to deal with the country's economic problems. These include an 80 percent annual inflation rate and a stumbling privatization plan. **********Such an alliance would still need the support of one of the two social democratic parties, one of which is expected to have about 75 seats and the other about 50 in the new parliament, to command a majority.

Mr. Erbakan also favors pulling Turkey out of NATO and forming an \"Islamic common market.\" **********\"They have talked about a lot of things, but even if Erbakan succeeds in forming a government it will be a coalition so he won't have the power to drastically change things,\" said Sami Kohen, foreign affairs columnist for the newspaper Milliyet. **********The Welfare Party victory was welcomed by Iran. Teheran's Government-run radio said it was likely to shift Turkish policies to a more pro-Islamic stand. **********The Welfare Party was aided by the failure of the Kurdish People's Democracy  Party to win 10 percent of the nationwide vote needed to qualify for Parliament.

For better or for worse, it turned television into the unstoppable financial and cultural force that it is today. **********True nationwide programming began on Nov. 18, 1951, when Edward R. Murrow, during the first broadcast of his \"See It Now\" series, gazed solemnly at a live  split-screen image of the Golden Gate and Brooklyn Bridges and said, \"We are impressed by a medium through which a man sitting in his living room has been able for the first time to look at two oceans at once.\" **********The East and West Coasts had just been linked by coaxial cable -- an unwieldy and inefficient method of long-distance transmission, as anyone who has ever lived too far from his cable company knows. Nevertheless, the final linkup was an event comparable in importance to the driving of the golden spike in the transcontinental railroad. **********Thus it was that in 1951 -- not coincidentally, the same year that a new comedy, \"I Love Lucy,\" became television's first true national hit -- the young  television networks, like their radio forebears (whose coast-to-coast audio signals had traveled comfortably via conventional phone lines) were able to offer the entire country the same programs simultaneously.    TV executives quickly realized that most of its newly served viewers in rural and suburban areas wanted to be soothed and amused rather than challenged or titillated. **********Before 1951, the airwaves were dominated by live shows: New York-based dramas and such raucous, vaudeville-like variety programs as Mr. Berle's \"Texaco Star Theater\" and Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca's \"Admiral Broadway Revue.\" And the so-called golden age of live television drama, fueled by talented refugees from  the legitimate stage, lasted for the next few years. **********But after 1951, milder comedies and adventure shows, most of them produced in Hollywood, held sway. Desi Arnaz and others perfected the three-camera method of filming situation comedies in front of live audiences for later broadcast. It freed television from the tyranny of the stage's proscenium arch and allowed comedies to be \"sweetened\" with prerecorded laughter. The shows could also be quickly filmed and edited and rerun in perpetuity. **********The programs now had to be tailored for Middle American tastes. Milton Berle  and Sid Caesar gradually gave way to the likes of Red Skelton and Dinah Shore; golden-age figures like Paddy Chayevsky moved on to the movies. By taking the middle road, the networks stimulated sales of television sets and delivered huge audiences for advertisers -- charging sponsors princely sums for the privilege. **********Meanwhile, the Hollywood movie studios, whose theater audiences had been cut  in half by television, began to use their empty sets and sound stages to turn out cheap black-and-white westerns and police shows for the small screen. **********Television was one of those seemingly instant socioeconomic breakthroughs that in fact had been a long time coming. The basic technical research that led  to practical methods of sending pictures through the air had been largely completed by the mid-1920's. On July 21, 1931, an NBC-owned station in New York, W2XAB, began the nation's first regularly scheduled television broadcasts. **********Throughout the 1930's a few other quasi-commercial stations sprang up in big  cities. But prewar television sets had tiny, flickering screens -- and the slapdash programs being improvised by techies and true believers at the stations made no dent at all in radio's popularity. **********During World War II the technical kinks were worked out of television and the radio networks were prepared to make a big push into the new medium. The first televised World Series, the 1947 matchup that saw the Yankees beat the Dodgers in seven games, drew an estimated total of 3.9 million viewers -- 3.5 million of whom watched it in bars. **********In 1950, fewer than 10 percent of all households had a television set. By 1953, the figure was 40 percent, on its way to 90 percent by the end of the decade. **********The United States was truly becoming one nation. On Monday night, Jan. 19, 1953, 69 percent of all the sets in use were tuned to the episode of \"I Love Lucy\" in which Lucille Ball's character, Lucy Ricardo, gave birth to a son. **********That same week, Ms. Ball gave birth to her real son, Desi Arnaz Jr. His picture was published shortly afterward in the premiere issue of TV Guide, which would become the best-selling magazine in America."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/18/business/international-briefs-air-new-zealand-moves-into-australian-market.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-11-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 112, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Air New Zealand Moves Into Australian Market", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS;Air New Zealand Moves Into Australian Market", "body_text": " **********Air New Zealand Ltd. has gained a foothold in the Australian aviation market  by buying a 25 percent stake in Ansett Australia Holdings Ltd. from the Australian transportation company TNT Ltd. for $200 million (Australian), or $148 million (United States).

At least 34 people were killed and more than 100 injured, the authorities said. **********At least eight people died in the collapse of the eight-story Costa Real, a beachside hotel in the resort city of Manzanillo, 524 miles west of Mexico City, and navy rescue crews were working with cranes to free others believed trapped under the wreckage. **********Some 50 people, including guests and workers, were in the hotel when it collapsed, and rescuers were listening for cries from the injured. **********\"When we hear any sound we order everybody to be quiet, but unfortunately the hotel is right on the ocean, and the waves are crashing,\" said Adm.

During a day of considerable chaos, officials in the two states at first announced that at least 57 people had died, but hours later revised the death toll downward considerably. **********The Jalisco State government issued a communique anouncing that the Costa Grande, a large tourist hotel in San Patricio Melaque, about 30 miles to the northwest along the coast from Manzanillo, had also collapsed, killing 11 people. Later, however, Juan Maria Naveja, a spokesman for the Jalisco Governor, Alberto Cardenas, said that the report was mistaken. Mr. Naveja said he believed that the hotel had only been damaged and that he knew of no deaths there. **********The tremor rattled buildings and frightened people not only in Colima and Jalisco, but was also felt strongly in Mexico City and nine other Mexican states, stretching from San Luis Potosi in the north to Oaxaca in the south. **********In Mexico City, the 63-story glass and steel headquarters of Petroleos Mexicanos, the state-owned oil monopoly, swayed terrifyingly by a yard or more,  company officials said. **********Electricity and telephone service were briefly interrupted on the west side of Mexico City, and traders on Mexico's stock market halted operations for about 40 minutes. **********Michael Farley, an American who was on his yacht in the Manzanillo harbor, watched the Hotel Costa Real \"crumble right before my eyes,\" he said in an interview over short-wave radio and telephone. He was reached with the help of amateur radio operators at the United Nations headquarters in New York. **********\"Everybody was yelling and pointing at the hotel,\" Mr. Farley said. \"It looked like one of those films on TV, where the guys come in with dynamite and destroy the building. We watched it collapse into a pile of dust.\" **********Mr. Farley said that during the quake the waters of Manzanillo Bay dropped 10 feet and then roared back minutes later in a huge wave. \"It was just like somebody flushed the toilet,\" he said. **********Around the bay in Manzanillo, several floors collapsed at the local headquarters of the Colima State Judicial Police. The Secretary of Defense, Gen. Enrique Cervantes Aguirre, said that eight police officers and clerical workers  died there. **********Mr. Farley said the police headquarters was in the rear of a \"two-story building in an old shopping center, real old shoddy construction.\" Inside the building were a station house and a jail, he said. **********To the north in Jalisco, at least 10 people were killed and some 90 seriously injured, said Mr. Naveja, the Jalisco spokesman. Nine of the deaths came in Cihuatlan, a town about 20 miles northwest of Manzanillo, he said, and another person died in the nearby town of Mascota. Most of the dead were aparently killed by collapsing homes. **********Mr. Naveja estimated that 900 homes collapsed in various towns in Jalisco. **********Landslides blocked the highways between Melaque and Cihuatlan. Two bridges, spanning the Secco and Jualuco Rivers in Jalisco, collapsed, according to radio  reports. **********The quake hit just hours before President Ernesto Zedillo flew to the United  States for a state visit with President Clinton. Before his departure, Mr. Zedillo sent Secretary of Defense Cervantes and the Secretaries of Health and Social Development to Jalisco and Colima to coordinate relief efforts. **********\"This quake, as you know, was of high intensity,\" Mr. Zedillo said at a press conference. \"We have had to lament loss of human life, but fortunately, given the severity, the intensity of the tremor, the damages do not appear to be unmanageable.\" **********At the American Embassy in Mexico City, a spokesman, James Williams, said no  reports of Americans among the dead or injured had been received. **********On Sept. 14, a quake of similar force and duration rattled the state of Guerrero, on the Pacific coast due south of the capital.

The Pentagon has been urging companies to merge and streamline their operations to get costs down. **********Boeing and McDonnell Douglas have held similar talks before without any deals being struck, but the growing pressure on their businesses has brought them together again, the people said. **********McDonnell Douglas is well known for such military aircraft as the F-15 and the FA-18 fighters. It also produces commercial jets like the MD-11 and the MD-80. Boeing is the world's largest maker of such commercial jets as the 747 and the new 777. It is increasingly a subcontractor on military orders, rather than a prime contractor. **********Neither company would comment on the talks, which were first reported today in The Wall Street Journal. The Journal reported that an outright merger of the  two companies was also being contemplated. **********The people with knowledge of the discussions said that a full merger of two of the most famous names in aviation was unlikely, in large part because the Government might determine that such an arrangement would create a powerhouse capable of crushing its competitors. **********But a combination of some sort had vocal support. \"Of all the deals, this one would make the most sense, especially as a merger,\" said Jon B.

It would combine the leading combat-aircraft producer and the leading commercial-aircraft producer. There would be essentially one American producer to compete with the many start-ups in Asia and the existing Airbus consortium in Europe.\" **********He added, however, that he thought the chances of the Government's permitting such a combination were \"less than 10 percent.\" **********Many analysts suspect that a deal may be more likely now because McDonnell Douglas's chief executive is, for the first time, not a member of one of the founding families. He is Harry C. Stonecipher, 59, who was appointed to his job  a year ago. **********Mr. Stonecipher, regarded as a no-nonsense executive, made his mark turning around the Sundstrand Corporation, a maker of aerospace and industrial products, and as head of General Electric's jet-engine division. **********\"These two companies have been in communication on and off for years,\" Mr. Kutler said. \"But now that you have a C.E.O. not named Douglas or McDonnell, he's not going to be as concerned about the nameplate on the company. He's going to be more open to something.\" **********Boeing has more than 60 percent of the world market for commercial aircraft,  while McDonnell Douglas has a little more than 10 percent. The No. 2 manufacturer is Airbus Industrie, the European consortium. **********McDonnell Douglas did win a big order recently for the MD-95, its new 100-seat commercial jet, but it had to cut prices drastically to get the business. Some of its own subcontractors complained that it would be tough to make any money following that strategy. **********\"The price is really crazy,\" Yi Taek Shim, executive vice president of Korean Aerospace, a subcontractor, was quoted as saying in a recent issue of Aviation Week & Space Technology magazine. \"It's hard to see how it will work.\" **********In addition to creating antitrust problems, a combination of the commercial-airline businesses could engender stiff resistance from unions. The machinists' union is currently on strike at Boeing, in part because the company is moving more of its work overseas, something that McDonnell Douglas has been doing as well. **********\"McDonnell has gone much farther down that road, been much more reckless with regard to technology exports,\" said Matt Bates, a union spokesman. \"It was not that long ago that they were offering themselves for sale to the Chinese.\" He was referring to unconfirmed reports that McDonnell Douglas was seeking to sell  an interest to Chinese companies. **********Mr. Goldberg of Deloitte & Touche said helicopter manufacturing was the most  obvious area for a combination. McDonnell Douglas makes the Apache helicopter for the military, while Boeing is one of the contractors on an innovative new tilt-rotor helicopter.

The supply-side war continues.", "body_text": " **********FISCAL conservatism is in: Polls show that most Americans are willing to forgo tax cuts to balance the budget. But supply-side economics, the good-news gospel that equated low tax rates with high tax revenues and rapid growth, is still alive and kicking. And the economists delivering the latest variation on the theme are hardly wild-eyed evangelicals. **********One is Martin S. Feldstein, a Harvard professor and former adviser to President Ronald Reagan who ironically was hounded from the White House by supply-side zealots. The other is Daniel R. Feenberg, a widely respected expert  on tax data. Their study, released by the nonpartisan National Bureau of Economic Research, calculates that raising the taxes of the rich in 1993 collected just one-third of the revenues expected if taxpayers had not changed their economic behavior. **********Are they right? Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers told a meeting of tax specialists in Washington last week that the two men \"have no basis whatsoever for their conclusions.\" And details of the Treasury's rebuttal, provided by Eric Toder, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Tax Analysis, buttress Mr. Summers's contention. But the controversy is a reminder that the war over the efficacy of progressive taxes is far from over. **********The deficit reduction package pushed through Congress in 1993 raised the top  Federal income tax bracket to 36 percent from 31 percent for families with taxable incomes between $150,000 and $250,000, and to 39.6 percent for those with incomes over $250,000. In addition, the ceiling on the Medicare payroll tax was eliminated, effectively raising the marginal tax rate by 2.9 percent for incomes over $135,000. **********By contrast, the levy on the merely affluent did not change. Mr. Feldstein and Mr. Feenberg suggest that this group offers a suitable control for a natural experiment in the effect of higher rates on tax revenue. **********If the adjusted gross income of the rich (here defined as those with adjusted gross incomes exceeding $200,000) had marched in lockstep with that of the upper middle class ($50,000 to $200,000), it would have grown by 2.9 percent. In fact, the taxable income of the $200,000-plus group fell short by $31 billion. So instead of collecting an extra $16 billion in taxes from this group, Uncle Sam received just $5 billion. **********What's more, the higher tax rate widened the gap between what rich people earned and what they kept, supposedly inducing them to work less. Mr. Feldstein  and Mr. Feenberg estimate that the deadweight loss -- the income never earned that was not offset by the estimated value of the gain in leisure -- equaled $17 billion. Put it another way: in adding a dollar to tax revenues, the law reduced national income by $3. **********It is a plausible story, but is it true? One problem, Mr. Toder says, is that the estimate critically depends on the base year. If 1991 (rather than 1992) is  compared with 1993, there is no shortfall in expected income and thus no shortfall in revenue or loss in output. **********Another problem is the possibility of tax-shifting. President Clinton was elected in November 1992. If high income earners anticipated higher tax rates in 1993 as a consequence, they presumably would have tried to realize the income in 1992. And there is evidence they did. **********Joel Slemrod, an economist at the University of Michigan's business school, cites a New York State survey showing that two-thirds of Wall Street's year-end  bonuses were paid in December 1992, in contrast to the one-third typically paid  before the New Year. Mr. Toder adds that a heretofore obscure statistic from the Commerce Department's national income accounts suggests that, all told, $20 billion was shifted. **********By the Treasury's reckoning, then, most of the income that Mr. Feldstein and  Mr. Feenberg argue was effectively destroyed by higher tax rates was realized a  year early. The rest, Mr. Toder estimates, was transformed from ordinary income  to capital gains, which was excluded from the Feldstein-Feenberg calculation because the tax rate did not change. **********Mr. Feldstein is not about to pack up his computer files and abandon the fight. He argues that no one else has an adequate explanation for the interruption in 1993 of the trend toward ever-increasing income concentration. And he says that an another way of pinpointing income-shifting back to 1992 -- tracking changes in fourth-quarter estimated tax payments -- does not confirm the Commerce Department's results. **********Truth is, there is too much room for interpretation in studies of taxpayer behavior to change many minds. The original supply-side Pollyannas were almost certainly wrong: tax revenues never recovered after the cuts in the early 1980's. But economists still do not know what price America pays for sharply progressive income taxes in terms of distorted incentives and slower growth."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/20/world/mexico-said-to-balk-at-border-shooting-inquiry.html": {"writer_name": "Tim Golden", "pub_date": "1995-08-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 505, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mexico Said to Balk at Border Shooting Inquiry", "print_headline": "Mexico Said to Balk at Border Shooting Inquiry", "body_text": " **********The shooting of a United States Border Patrol officer, apparently by local policemen from the Mexican city of Nogales, has brought complaints by some American officials that the Mexican authorities are failing to cooperate in the case. **********United States officials said the wounded American officer, Arthur G.

Land has been degraded in many areas, often because of inefficient or poorly maintained irrigation systems. Nearly three-quarters of the world's fresh water now flows into irrigation, Dr. Serageldin said. **********\"Whether we stabilize the population at 8.5 billion rather than 10 or 12 billion in the next century, the pressures are coming,\" Dr. Serageldin, a development expert from Egypt, said. \"We will have two billion more in the next 20 years no matter what, and 95 percent of them will be in the poorest countries.\" **********Dr. Serageldin said that population, poverty and the environment cannot be considered without including agriculture. He said that environmentalists traditionally thought of agriculture as \"the enemy\" because farmers chopped down forests and added pesticides and fertilizers to earth and water. **********\"They were right,\" he said, but he added that there is no way to protect the environment unless great strides are made in agriculture and farmers are able to grow more on the land they have or can reclaim. **********The World Bank's concern with stagnating or dwindling food production is shared by the independent Worldwatch Institute, based in Washington, which just published its 1995 State of the World report. **********\"In the mid-nineties,\" it said, \"evidence that the world is on an economic path that is environmentally unsustainable can be seen in shrinking fish catches, falling water tables, declining bird populations, record heat waves and dwindling grain stocks, to name just a few.\" **********Among the issues that scientists and public officials will consider at the meeting beginning Thursday in Lucerne, Switzerland will be the decline in aid money for agricultural research and development. In 1980, 20 percent of aid was devoted to agriculture. That dropped to 14 percent by 1990. Development experts said that investment in better farming is always more cost-effective and useful than giveaway food aid or repeated cycles of disaster relief. **********\"Future advances in agriculture require more than a one-time investment in research,\" a report prepared for the meeting says. \"Additional yield gains are more difficult to achieve as research is increasingly pushing against biological and environmental limits. Yield gains are constantly threatened by newly developing, more aggressive pests and plant diseases moving from continent to continent, as well as by environmental degradation, deforestation and loss of natural genetic diversity of crops and farm animals.\" **********According to the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, production of rice, the most important food in developing countries, has stagnated in Asia, dropped sharply in Latin America and increased slowly in Africa, but only to a fraction of total demand. **********Wheat, the second-most important staple, has shown encouraging increases in yields almost everywhere except Africa, the research group says. But it adds that in all regions except Asia countries are supplementing domestic production with imports. Both wheat and maize production have grown rapidly in Asia and the Middle East. **********Advances in crop yield and resistance to pests are being made at a network of research centers around the world established by the Consultative Group. Dr. Serageldin cautioned, however, that while scientific advances are substantial, it takes time to bring new varieties or techniques to village fields."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/16/business/international-briefs-de-beers-earnings-rise.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-08-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 72, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "International Briefs; De Beers Earnings Rise", "print_headline": "International Briefs; De Beers Earnings Rise", "body_text": " **********The South African diamond giant De Beers reported an unexpectedly sharp rise in earnings yesterday, but it warned that sales of rough diamonds in the second half of the year would not match those of the first half.

But hopes for peace were tempered by conflicts over politics and land that have deepened even as the threat of new fighting has waned. **********Although the demands of the rebels range from economic support for poor farmers to the replacement of Mr. Zedillo's administration by a transitional Government, they said in a statement before the talks began that they would focus only on \"measures to defuse the hostile climate and distance the danger of armed clashes between the two armies.\" **********The chief mediator in the dialogue, Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia, said tonight that the two sides had held more than three hours of \"frank, sincere\" and \"intense\" discussions near the rebel capital of Guadalupe Tepeyac. He said the Government's three representatives were led by the Interior Minister, Esteban Moctezuma, while the Zapatista National Liberation Army delegation was headed by the rebel leader known as Subcommander Marcos. **********Bishop Ruiz declined to provide details beyond that, suggesting that the talks were still preliminary and saying the negotiators would report publicly on them on Monday. **********The meeting comes five months after elections that defrauded hopes for an easing of tensions in the state, giving way instead to further polarization. While Zapatistas have backed away recently from their threats to break a cease-fire that has held for the last year, the prospects for a lasting peace have appeared to grow steadily more remote. **********The paradox of Chiapas remains that, while support for the insurgents has waned elsewhere in Mexico, the tensions fed by their rebellion have spread steadily out from the rebels' strongholds in the Lacandon rain forest. **********The principal legacy of the election in August may in fact be that the forces on either side of the political divide are now more organized and militant than ever. Peasant groups and the Democratic Revolutionary Party are on the left, with big landholders and the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party on the right. **********Peasants who have seized tens of thousands of acres of land are digging in on their new holdings and vowing not to give up. In response, the conservative ranchers who have always held sway in the region are setting up new alliances, stockpiling arms, running off some invaders and threatening others. **********The state government that took office last month hoping to find a middle ground in the struggle has increasingly sided with the property owners, further alienating the peasants. A recent pledge by the Government to address the land problem in Chiapas by parceling out some larger holdings has seemed to have had almost no impact. **********Groups loyal to Amado Avendano, the rumpled former newspaper publisher who ran as the left's gubernatorial candidate in August, have seized or tried to seize dozens of town halls around the state. **********The situation has become so complicated that many political analysts say a settlement will be more difficult to fashion now than after the Zapatistas launched their war on Jan. 1, 1994. **********\"People are much more polarized now, and on both sides,\" a Government official said. \"If it was tough before, it is going to be harder now.\" **********The economic crisis set off by the sharp devaluation of the peso last month has done little to diminish the urgency. **********The Government's forced reduction in its dependence on short-term foreign capital should ultimately reduce the economy's vulnerability to political shocks like those produced by the Zapatistas. But Chiapas remains a focus of Mexican and foreign investors, who have come to doubt Mr. Zedillo's leadership. After months in which officials confidently dismissed the possibility that the conflict might spread beyond the state, the country's sudden impoverishment has also prompted at least some of them to think again. **********Shortly after the uprising began, peasants within the Zapatistas' area of influence seized thousands of acres of private land. But last summer the occupations began spreading to areas where the rebels have never been. **********Since August, for example, the ski masks made famous by the insurgents have become a fixture at a sprawling coffee farm called Liquidambar, worn there by members of a radical peasant group that takes its name not from the Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata, but from his northern counterpart, Francisco (Pancho) Villa. **********Peasants from a semi-communal farm nearby suggested that they had simply taken advantage of the breakdown of order to take lands that they had long claimed as their own. \"We have always thought that this land would be ours,\" one of the leaders of the group, Tomas Perez, said through his mask as he sat on the estate's veranda. \"But we gave thanks on that 1st of January.\" **********But it was the Villa group rather than the nearby farmers that organized the occupation, bringing in scores of families from outside to work the farm as a collective. **********Leaders of the occupation claimed they had documents attesting to their rightful ownership of the land, but they did not produce any. Nor did they see any possible solution to their situation in the recent pledge by Mr. Zedillo's Government to begin to apply land-reform laws more forcefully. **********\"This is not our Government; it is the Government of the rich,\" said another leader of the collective, Audelino Chavez, 43. \"What is there to talk about with them?\" **********Ranchers and farmers have begun organizing more vigorously, both to lobby for the return of their properties and, in some instances, to act against the invaders. **********The takeovers of town halls by leftist peasant and political groups have brought on similar confrontations. **********Some of these have appeared almost entirely spontaneous, inspired to some extent by the Zapatistas, but clearly driven by local disputes. In the town of Amatenango del Valle last week, peasants who took over the municipal offices agreed to accept the results of a traditional Mayan Indian plebiscite, in which each side gathers its supporters to be counted one by one. When the vote was held on Friday, the peasants won, 1,095 bodies to 892. **********But the tactic has increasingly been pushed by the self-styled \"Government in Rebellion\" that Mr. Avendano leads. **********The parallel administration has encouraged the takeovers for much the same reasons that the Democratic Revolutionary Party has used them in other states where it claimed to have lost elections by fraud. In pressing for the ouster of the new Governor, Eduardo Robledo Rincon, Mr. Avendano has tried to make Chiapas ungovernable. **********The party ordered at least a temporary end to the takeovers on Thursday, after a clash between peasants and police two days earlier in the town of Chicomuselo, near the border with Guatemala, that left at least six people dead. The episode made it evident, however, that the state's polarization was already well advanced. **********At about midday Thursday the state attorney general, Jorge Enrique Hernandez Aguilar, arrived on the scene by helicopter. Upon failing to persuade the peasants to negotiate, he stormed away in disgust, apparently leaving behind orders to clear the town plaza. Numerous telephone calls requesting comment from him on the incident were not returned. **********Moments later, witnesses said, the local and state police, backed up by heavily armed ranchers, began the violence again. **********Mr. Hernandez blamed the violence squarely on Mr. Avendano, contending that he had ordered the takeover, and Mr. Avendano blamed the attorney general. **********The two men know one another well: Mr. Hernandez, a lawyer and former leader of the state's corn farmers, once helped Mr. Avendano edit one of his rabble-rousing newspapers. When Mr. Hernandez was jailed for two years in the late 1980's for leading protests by the farmers, Mr. Avendano was a spearhead of his defense."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/12/business/mutual-funds-cold-comes-too-late-for-energy.html": {"writer_name": "Timothy Middleton", "pub_date": "1995-02-12", "snippet": "PLAGUED by too many warm winter days, the companies that produce natural gas are getting the cold shoulder from Wall Street.

Oil prices, at $18.50 a barrel currently, will pull up gas, or oil will lose market share to the rival fuel by next winter, he said. When the market catches on, prices of energy-company shares will catch up. **********There are a limited number of mutual funds that invest primarily in energy stocks.  Of the 18 natural resources funds, as classified by Morningstar Inc., Chicago-based fund researchers, only five have the bulk of their assets in energy stocks. **********But while bullish scenarios like Mr. von Metzsch's -- and the fact that Iraq's 1.8 million barrels a day of production remains bottled up -- give investors in those funds comfort, they have repeatedly been confounded by events, most recently the mild weather in Europe as well as the United States. The cold that finally bundled up many areas of this country last week has come too late, experts say, to have much of an impact now. **********Indeed, the strongest segment of the energy sector currently is represented by the giant companies like Exxon and Unocal, and not because energy prices are expected to jump but because the big integrated companies have been cutting back costs. That situation, rather than higher revenues, has increased profits and allowed the giants to pump up their payouts. **********\"They are supported primarily by their high dividend yields,\" noted Steve Pfeifer, oil analyst for C. J. Lawrence/Deutsche Bank Securities. **********In the main, however, the portfolios of energy investors have lost a lot of steam. The average natural resources fund shed 8.4 percent of its value in the 12 months ended Feb. 3, according to Morningstar. **********Most of those with the heaviest concentration in energy did even worse. Three of the five with more than 75 percent of their assets in the sector are down in double digits. The managers of the other two, the Energy and Energy Services portfolios from Fidelity, can't take credit for doing better because each has been in place only a few months. **********The $35 million portfolio run by Daniel Rice of State Street Research Global Energy Fund is down even more than Vanguard's -- more than 16 percent for the A shares in the last 12 months. That is largely because, like Mr. von Metzsch, Mr. Rice foresees higher energy prices and is stressing the purest plays: independent exploration and production companies, as well as oil services companies like those that supply drilling rigs. **********\"We have good demand for oil, and the supply is being constrained,\" he said. \"The rig count is declining, capital budgets are being curtailed and people are shutting-in production.\" **********This is despite the fact that oil prices are $3 a barrel above their level of a year ago and worldwide economic growth promises to keep prices at least at their current level. **********As long as Iraq remains a pariah, Mr. Rice said, demand will quickly outstrip declining production. \"Our model suggests that Iraqi crude is necessary to keep oil prices below $20 a barrel by mid-1996,\" he added. **********One of the strongest arguments against a revival in energy stocks is that the price of oil is one of the targets of the Federal Reserve's interest-rate assault against inflation. It was, of course, the Arab oil embargo of 1973 that precipitated the worst post-war recession in the United States and led to nearly a decade of double-digit increases in consumer prices. **********But Mr. Rice countered: \"The key question is whether the Fed's monetary policy is going to impact demand in the fast-growing countries of the Far East, and I would guess not.\" It is in the Pacific Rim that oil consumption is rising most sharply. **********Natural-gas suppliers, on the other hand, will enter the spring with their inventories bulging, even if the weather now stays cold through the rest of the winter, and it will take six months after that for the surplus to be absorbed, Mr. von Metzsch said. **********\"But in the meantime,\" he added, \"capacity to produce gas in North America is not keeping up.\" So, probably by next winter, he said, the price will top $2 a thousand cubic feet, \"and a lot of people will become interested in the sector again.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/21/world/egypt-opposes-extending-pact-on-spread-of-nuclear-arms.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "1995-04-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 534, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Egypt Opposes Extending Pact On Spread of Nuclear Arms", "print_headline": "Egypt Opposes Extending Pact On Spread of Nuclear Arms", "body_text": " **********Egypt announced formally today that it could not support the indefinite extension of a treaty barring the spread of nuclear weapons because of Israel's refusal to sign the pact, to support the creation of a nuclear-free Middle East or to make any other concessions to its Arab neighbors on the issue. **********The United States had hoped to persuade Egypt to join in voting to make the treaty permanent. **********But the Egyptian Foreign Minister, Amr Moussa, told a conference that will decide the future of the pact, the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, known as N.P.T., that the security of his country could not be guaranteed by an accord that does not include Israel, which is believed to have a nuclear arms program, but has never acknowledged it. **********India and Pakistan, which also have nuclear-weapons programs, have also not signed the treaty.

It would also rank among the two or three largest deals to date in any industry, behind the $30 billion merger of R. J. Reynolds and Nabisco completed in 1989 and neck-and-neck with the $14 billion combination of Time Inc. and Warner Communications in 1990. **********Together, the companies would have $12.2 billion in worldwide sales, and would dominate the treatment of ulcers, AIDS and herpes. Their combined worldwide market share would be 5.3 percent, Glaxo said, compared with 3.9 percent for the current leader, Merck & Company. **********Wellcome, the world's 20th-largest drug company, has long emphasized its desire to remain independent, and said today that it would study the Glaxo offer and consider possible alternatives. **********But Glaxo, already the world's second-largest drug company after Merck, clearly has the upper hand, having made an offer that analysts described as being at the top end of the industry valuations. It also won a commitment from Wellcome's largest shareholder, the Wellcome Trust, an independent charity, to sell its 39.5 percent. **********Indeed, analysts said a Glaxo-Wellcome merger would deal with a hard reality: Every day, it gets more difficult for the companies to stay single.  [ Page D6. ] **********Glaxo said it was offering $:10.25 -- about $16.20 -- for each Wellcome share in cash and Glaxo stock, which is 49 percent higher than the closing price of Wellcome's stock on Friday. **********In London, shares of Wellcome closed today at $:9.61. Shares of Glaxo tumbled 44.5 pence, to $:5.99. The drop reflected the concern among investors about the high price being offered by Glaxo and the possibility that the earnings per share of a combined Glaxo-Wellcome could fall, at least in the short run, as it absorbed the costs of the merger. **********On the New York Stock Exchange, the American depository receipts of Wellcome rose $4.375, to $15.125, while the Glaxo A.D.R.'s fell $1.375, to $19.125. **********Glaxo struck at a time when Wellcome's shares had been pushed down by a decision earlier this month by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Two committees of the agency voted not to recommend approval for over-the-counter versions of Wellcome's biggest-selling drug, Zovirax, a treatment for herpes, which will lose its patent protection in two years. **********Glaxo said it had been developing a strategy to deal with the industry's consolidation for a year, and had evaluated a wide range of possible takeover targets. **********Sir Richard Sykes, chief executive of Glaxo, said Wellcome was attractive because it had relatively few products that overlapped with Glaxo's and because it was as big a company as Glaxo could easily absorb. **********Sir Richard said he believed the combined companies could be more competitive by cutting duplicated costs for administration, sales and research and development. Drug companies are under intense pressure from governments, hospitals, doctors and other health care providers to hold down prices in the United States, Europe and around the world. **********\"We don't want to sit around and be carried along by consolidation,\" Sir Richard said at a news conference here. \"We wish to be leaders in the process.\" **********A Glaxo-Wellcome deal would bring together companies that have strong reputations for scientific research as well as looming business challenges. Glaxo is the maker of the world's best-selling drug, the ulcer treatment Zantac. But it will lose the patent protection on Zantac in the coming years and faces increasing competition from low-cost generic alternatives. **********Wellcome is best known as the producer of the anti-AIDS drug AZT, though Zovirax, its herpes treatment, is far bigger, accounting for a third of the company's sales and nearly half of operating profits. Studies in the last year have suggested that AZT is less effective in the early treatment of AIDS than previously believed, leading to a sharp drop in the drug's sales. **********The companies have been working closely in the development of AIDS treatment based on combinations of drugs. The most promising combinations involve Wellcome's AZT and 3TC, an anti-viral drug licensed by Glaxo from Biochem Pharma. **********Both companies have been trying to expand their over-the-counter, or nonprescription, drug businesses. Both have joint ventures with the Warner-Lambert Company to help them distribute nonprescription versions of their drugs. **********The rumors of Glaxo's interest in Wellcome were widespread on the London Stock Exchange on Friday. But Glaxo still managed to put Wellcome on the defensive by clinching a deal late Sunday with the Wellcome Trust, which had owned 100 percent of Wellcome until it began selling its stake through public offerings in 1986. **********The trust had always been seen as an ally of Wellcome in any hostile takeover situation, despite having no formal links to the company other than the stake it owned. The trust can back out of its deal with Glaxo under certain conditions, including the emergence of a higher offer or failure to win court approval. The trust can also back out before Thursday night if the Wellcome board can convince it to do so. **********It was unclear whether Wellcome knew that the trust had begun negotiating with Glaxo last week. The chief executive of Wellcome, John W. Robb, who learned about the bid in an early-morning telephone call from his counterpart at Glaxo, Sir Richard, immediately conferred with his board.

Boone Pickens. It refused to make more than minor revisions in a plan to fend off takeovers. The so-called poison-pill plan prevents hostile investors from raising their combined stake past 10 percent by giving other shareholders the right to buy more stock at a 50 percent discount when the 10 percent threshold is reached. The board also heard investment bankers describe plans for the company's whole or partial sale. **********The board ignored demands by David Batchelder and another board member who represented the hostile shareholders that the board abandon the takeover defenses and plot the company's future independently of Mr. Pickens. **********As Mr. Batchelder finds himself mired in a Mesa lawsuit and apparently daunted by the poison pill, Mesa is speeding its efforts to revive its stock price and avoid defaulting on debts due next year. In a statement after today's meeting, Mr. Pickens, without mentioning the Batchelder group, stressed his urgency. **********\"We've clearly placed the pursuit of sale, merger and restructuring alternatives on the fast track,\" Mr. Pickens said. **********Mr. Batchelder wants to call a special shareholders meeting to unseat the board, but the poison-pill plan requires him to formally solicit the votes of other shareholders to do so. **********Mr. Batchelder represents Marvin Davis, the Beverly Hills billionaire who owns 3.9 percent of Mesa's stock, and Dennis R. Washington, the Montana investor who owns 5.5 percent. **********Mesa has sued them, accusing them of failing to meet disclosure requirements after they began accumulating shares last year. Fighting the suit has required the Batchelder group to produce piles of documents and prepare to give detailed depositions. In a sign that Mesa has slowed the investors' advance, they recently agreed to extend Mr. Batchelder's profit-sharing arrangement, due to expire at the end of 1995, to the end of 1996. **********As a result, Mesa, which is based in Irving, a Dallas suburb, has apparently secured enough time to sort through its options instead of immediately meeting investors' demands. Its investment bankers, from Lehman Brothers, presented some of those options today, with a list of dozens of national and international oil and natural gas companies that might want to buy the company or some of its properties. **********The board lowered its takeover defenses just a few inches today by deciding that anyone bidding for its shares would have to buy 51 percent, down from 75 percent, to avoid generating the issue of discounted stock. The board also clarified that while a purchaser must line up financing for the company's shares, advance commitments were not necessary to assume Mesa's $1.2 billion in debts.

The previous high was 3.1 percent, recorded in May 1987 during an economic slowdown caused by the sharp appreciation of the yen after the 1985 Plaza Accord. **********Economists said the jobless rate was likely to increase further in the coming months because the recent surge of the yen had once again weakened an economy that a few months ago seemed on the verge of recovering from a three-year slump. **********\"This is the beginning of a new era, of a new cycle,\" said Jesper Koll, chief economist for J. P. Morgan in Tokyo. He predicted unemployment would reach 4.3 percent in about a year. **********To be sure, Japan's jobless rate is minuscule compared with the 5.8 percent recorded in the United States in April and European rates that range from 8 to 12 percent or even higher. And a rise from 3 percent to 4 percent is not likely to tear apart Japan's strong social fabric. **********Still, an increase would be a psychological blow to a country that has prided itself on providing near full employment. Japan's Government and its leading companies have \"sort of been committing ourselves to defending the 3 percent unemployment rate with honor,\" Hiroshi Okuda, an executive vice president of the Toyota Motor Corporation, said recently. **********Rising joblessness could bring added pressure on Japan's already unpopular and fragile coalition Government, which is hobbled by internal fighting and a lack of strong leadership from Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama. **********Economists say Japan's unemployment figures are understated. Anyone who works an hour in the final week of a month is considered fully employed that month. The figures do not count jobless women who return to being housewives rather than looking for new employment. Women, who are often restricted to clerical work and serving tea anyway, are usually not entitled to lifetime employment. **********The jobless situation is hitting young workers the hardest. Among people aged 15 to 24, the unemployment rate is 6.4 percent for men and 6.8 percent among women. **********That is because Japan's lifetime employment system preserves jobs for those who already have them, forcing companies to cut costs by curtailing hiring of graduating students. April is the time when graduating students enter the work force, but this year, about 160,000 could not find jobs. **********Some commentators have suggested that the trouble young people have been having finding jobs might have contributed to the spread of religious cults like Aum Shinrikyo, which the police say is responsible for the poison gas attack in the Tokyo subways in March. **********The fear of spreading unemployment is one factor behind Japan's hard-line stance in automobile trade talks with the United States. Japanese auto companies are reluctant to buy more American parts because that could hurt the already struggling Japanese parts suppliers. (On the other hand, if Washington places 100 percent tariffs on imports of Japanese luxury cars, that too will lead to job losses in Japan.) **********A big question is whether the need for new cost cutting to cope with the strong yen will mean the end of the lifetime employment system, in which major companies go out of their way to avoid dismissing full-time male employees. Some analysts say lifetime employment may fray but will probably not break, in that there will not be huge dismissals of employees. **********\"There has consistently been erosion of lifetime employment,\" said Mineko Sasaki-Smith, senior economist for Morgan Stanley & Company in Tokyo. \"I don't think there will be a big bang and it will suddenly be ended.\" **********The rise in unemployment has been caused by a decline in manufacturing jobs, as the high yen reduces production in Japan or forces Japanese companies to relocate overseas. In April, manufacturing employment was down 3.6 percent, or 550,000 jobs, from a year earlier. **********Until now, the workers who left manufacturing have been finding jobs in the service sector. But the service companies can no longer absorb so many workers, said Robert Alan Feldman, director of Asian economic research for Salomon Brothers in Tokyo. Increased discounting is causing a slimming down of Japan's bloated distribution system. **********Japan's Management and Coordination Agency, which released today's unemployment figures, said that the number of jobless people in April totaled 2.14 million, up 10.3 percent from a year earlier. The number of people with jobs decreased by three-tenths of a percent, to 64.75 million. **********The Labor Ministry said today that there were only 65 jobs for every 100 job seekers in April, down from 66 jobs in March."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/20/world/libyan-girds-for-defiance-of-the-west.html": {"writer_name": "Chris Hedges", "pub_date": "1995-04-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 775, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Libyan Girds For Defiance Of the West", "print_headline": "Libyan Girds For Defiance Of the West", "body_text": " **********Muammar el-Qaddafi, who governs Libya with a love of grandiose state projects and unflinching repression, has reorganized his security forces, purged rivals from his inner circle and set Libya on a course of defiance against the West that will probably endure as long as he remains in power. **********The Libyan leader, who two decades ago was the enfant terrible of the Arab world, has exhausted a variety of tactics, short of turning over the two Libyans wanted in connection with the downing of a Pan Am jetliner, as he has sought to obtain the lifting of the three-year-old sanctions against his country. **********Libyan officials have given the British files on the Irish Republican Army, shut down the camps of radical Palestinian groups and let the United States know that they might turn over the rogue C.I.A. agent Frank E.

The sanctions include an arms, trade and travel embargo. **********Colonel Qaddafi has recently sidelined his regular army units, on which he spent more than $20 billion on mainly Soviet-made armaments over the last 20 years, with new structures he calls \"armed people.\" And longtime associates, like Abdussalam Jalloud, who was his chief lieutenant, have disappeared from public view. **********\"He appears to have neutralized any opposition that might come from within the army,\" the ambassador said. \"His army has little role now, and most the military hardware he bought is rusting in the desert.\" **********When 26-year-old Captain Qaddafi took power in a bloodless coup in 1969, he and his fellow officers promised an Arab renaissance that called for defiance of the West and the liberation of Palestine. He challenged major Western companies over oil pricing and won, inspiring other Arab states to begin the 1973 oil price explosion. **********Libya became a port of call for everyone from the Palestinian terrorist Abu Nidal and guerrilla groups in Africa to leaders of the American Indian movement and Marxist revolutionaries from Central America. Hundreds of millions of dollars were doled out by Libya.  And Libyan intelligence agents were repeatedly linked to terrorist attacks, including the 1989 bombing of a French DC-10 airliner in which 171 people died. **********The oil wealth, which at one point reached $23 billion a year, financed one disastrous scheme after another, from the attempt to create an army of a million people out of a population of five million, to the expenditure of some $20 billion to build a huge irrigation project, still under construction, that few experts expect to work. **********But little more than the frequent calls for holy war and Colonel Qaddafi's self-proclaimed desert socialism remains. **********With the fall of oil prices, income barely covers the country's imports.

At the same time, Mr. Greenspan said nothing to disabuse Wall Street of that notion. In comments that echoed those of other Federal Reserve officials in recent days, he clearly implied that the economy remained too robust to count higher inflation out. **********Tightness in the labor market and other strains on the economy could \"lead to some deterioration in the price picture in the near term,\" Mr. Greenspan said, \"but any such deterioration should be contained if the Federal Reserve remains vigilant.\" **********Still, the financial markets saw glimmers of hope in his testimony that next week's expected increase could be the last for a while. Stock and bond prices rose. **********The Federal Reserve has raised rates six times since last February in its effort to prevent what it views as a runaway economic expansion in excess of 4 percent annual growth from causing prices to accelerate. By gradually raising rates, the central bank hopes to squeeze consumer and business borrowing enough to slow the economy to a more sustainable pace of roughly 2.5 percent. **********But the danger -- which economists at the Chrysler Corporation and other industrial companies are increasingly worried about -- is that the Federal Reserve may be overreacting and could topple the economy into another recession by tightening its monetary grip too much. **********Even though inflation has been running at less than 3 percent for three straight years -- the best record since the early 1960's -- the Federal Reserve is worried that the economy has been too strong recently for its own good. **********\"I see it as crucial that we extend the recent trend of low and, hopefully, declining inflation in the years ahead,\" Mr. Greenspan added. While the prospects are \"fundamentally good,\" there are grounds for \"some concern.\" Mr. Greenspan cited, for example, the fact that the unemployment rate had fallen to 5.4 percent, in contrast to that of the late 1980's \"when wages and prices accelerated appreciably.\" While consumer prices and the prices of goods going out the factory door have barely budged, he said, the costs of parts and supplies at earlier stages of production were starting to accelerate. **********Mr. Greenspan also used the occasion to lecture Congress about the risks of widening the Federal budget gap. With both Republicans and Democrats proposing tax cuts this year, Mr. Greenspan contended in response to questions that the budget deficit was the nation's No. 1 economic problem. He urged lawmakers not to make it worse, insisting that any revenue loss should be minimal and, in any case, should be made up by equal or greater spending cuts. **********\"We're going to have chronic fiscal problems if we don't cut spending,\" Mr. Greenspan said, declaring tax cuts to be of low priority and best accomplished by lowering tax rates. By contrast, the current proposals, from both Republicans and from President Clinton, rely primarily on tax credits that would do nothing to lower rates in ways that might provide greater incentives for work and savings. **********Mr. Greenspan also said he was \"a little chagrined\" that the findings of the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform were not taken more seriously. The 32-member commission, headed by Senators Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska, and John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri, found that spending on Social Security and other Federal benefit programs were rising at unsustainable rates. But the commission disbanded at year's end after failing to agree on a remedy it could recommend to the President. **********Mr. Greenspan said much of the so-called inflation premium in rates on long-term bonds would simply evaporate if action were taken on this front and would result in lower interest rates. **********Returning to a theme he expounded earlier this month, to the delight of Republicans looking to free up money for tax cuts, Mr. Greenspan said that the deficit could be narrowed simply by eliminating the bias in the Consumer Price Index that causes overpayment of entitlement benefits and an excessive inflation adjustment in tax rates. **********Mr. Greenspan, who said the Fed believed the index overstated inflation from 0.5 to 1.5 percentage points, recommended today that Congress specify a commitment to maintain the purchasing power of retirees while eliminating the bias that overpays them. **********Mr. Greenspan also recommended that the retirement age be moved back to reflect changes in life expectancy. **********In commenting on the risks of inflation, Mr. Greenspan pointed out that more companies were buying materials in advance because they thought they might become more expensive or in short supply. Reports of worker shortages have become \"more common,\" he said. These are all signs pointing to the prospect of greater price increases. **********On the other hand, Mr. Greenspan said, \"trends in money and credit expansion have remained subdued\" and have not yet become the financial tinder needed to kindle higher inflation. **********Committee members made little effort to dissuade the Fed from pushing rates up again despite pleas from auto makers and some other industries that the cumulative restraint -- much of which has yet to be fully felt -- could prove too much. **********An exception was Senator Bill Bradley, a New Jersey Democrat, who said that higher rates would make it even harder for Mexico to resolve its financial crisis.

But the Bosnian Serbs, who control 70 percent of Bosnia's land, have rejected it. **********Bosnian officials have repeatedly criticized the contact group for creeping appeasement of the Serbs. They note that the contact group at first said Bosnian Serbs must accept the group's peace plan, but then it said they need only accept it in principle as a point of departure for negotiations in which the Muslims and Serbs might swap some land. **********The best way to reinvigorate the contact group, some diplomats say, would be to have the foreign ministers of the five countries meet regularly, a move that could increase the group's visibility and press members to thrash out their differences."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/21/business/goldman-withdraws-suit.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-10-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 59, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Goldman Withdraws Suit", "print_headline": "Goldman Withdraws Suit", "body_text": " **********Goldman, Sachs & Company has withdrawn a breach-of-contract lawsuit that it had filed two weeks ago against Christopher Whittle, the media entrepreneur, and his company, Whittle Communications.

If so, Government forces may face much greater difficulties in maintaining bases in areas of rebel military predominance, particularly in the Jaffna region, which have relied heavily on resupply by air. **********The naval wing of the rebel force has also shown greater strength and mobility, threatening the Sri Lankan Navy's ability to maintain its dominance off the coast. **********But the military implications were compounded by the sharpening political quandary facing the President, Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, who won two quick elections last year -- an August parliamentary vote and a presidential contest in November -- on a promise to seek peace. **********Fighting stopped soon after the August vote, and a formal cease-fire was declared in January. The truce was abruptly broken 11 days ago by the rebels, formally known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, who began one of their most ambitious offensives of the war. **********Although the truce agreement specified that neither side would go back to war without giving 72 hours' notice, the first attack came less than two hours after the leader of the Tigers, Vellupillai Prabakharan, notified Mrs. Kumaratunga of the rebels' intention to break the truce. **********The sinking of two Government gunboats in Trincomalee harbor by Tiger saboteurs, which killed 12 Sri Lankan sailors and 4 of the attackers, was followed by attacks on Government military bases in contested areas along the northern and eastern coasts that killed more than 120 Government soldiers and rebel fighters. **********With Government losses mounting, Mrs. Kumaratunga has come under growing pressure from within her coalition Government and from right-wing opposition leaders to mount a counteroffensive. Mrs. Kumaratunga, in Paris for a World Bank meeting, left for home immediately after receiving news of the second plane attack today, and went directly to an emergency meeting of her security council. **********On Friday, however, she appeared to oppose any harsh response. \"We only think this is a temporary setback,\" she said. \"We are trying very hard to contain the situation from spilling over into a war, another war.\" **********Mrs. Kumaratunga has proposed that the conflict, which has resulted in more than 30,000 deaths since 1983, be ended by a new power-sharing arrangement under which Tamils, accounting for about a sixth of the population of 18 million people, would gain control of a semiautonomous region covering wide areas of northern Sri Lanka and parts of the eastern coast. **********But the Tiger leadership has refused to discuss a political settlement, insisting on prior military concessions. **********The latest attacks appear to make Government military concessions improbable, particularly the one Mr. Prabakharan cited in breaking the cease-fire: the dismantling of the Pooneryn base that controls sea approaches to the city of Jaffna, which is controlled by the rebels. Mr. Prabakharan appears to be gambling that by inflicting a series of costly losses on Government forces, he can force Mrs. Kumaratunga's hand. **********But growing unease among some of the Sri Lankan leader's senior ministers at the apparent inflexibility of the Tiger leadership may force Mrs. Kumaratunga to take a harder line. **********One step that is said to have been discussed among Sri Lankan military leaders, but resisted by the Government, is an appeal to India, which has the largest military force in the region. **********India could be asked to impose a naval quarantine on the sea approaches to Jaffna in an attempt to cut off military supplies that reach the Tigers across the narrow Palk Strait, which separates Jaffna from the coastline of Tamil Nadu, the Tamil-dominated state in southern India."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/30/business/new-ibm-chip-for-digital-video-images.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-03-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 144, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New I.B.M.

Scott Fitzgerald had it only partly right. The rich are different from you and me. But it's the rich corporate insiders who are the most different of all. **********Any doubters should look at what's going on at a real estate investment trust called MIP Properties. Right now, the company's board is pushing a deal that treats executives who managed MIP into the ground too kindly and allows a former director to purchase company properties at bargain prices. As for the investors? Many of them -- particularly those poor souls who bought shares at the offering 10 years ago -- will be saddled with huge losses. **********To understand the full story, start at the beginning. When MIP -- then known as Mortgage Investments Plus -- came public in 1985, it appeared to have a lot going for it. It had organized a small but diversified portfolio of properties in California that seemed healthy. **********Better still, it had a corporate relationship with the Weyerhaeuser Company, the respected timber products concern in Tacoma, Wash., that was looking to diversify. A number of MIP's directors hailed from Weyerhaeuser, including John W. Creighton Jr., the timber giant's president. That connection proved helpful in selling the deal to small investors in Washington state, who were among the heaviest buyers. **********But all the promise disappeared. After starting to trade at $10 a share, MIP's stock fell as fast as you can say, \"Timber!\" Within a year, it had lost about 25 percent of its value -- quite a feat, since real estate prices were still rising. Apparently, the market believed that, regardless of the quality of the property, it was not being managed effectively. **********The stock fell to as low as 50 cents a share in the early 1990's. A new strategic plan was adopted in 1991; by 12 months ago, MIP's stock were trading at more than a dollar a share. Still, a 90 percent wipe-out for investors was hardly something for management to strut about. So, in April 1994, MIP put itself up for sale. **********After one potential deal fell apart, a bid came across the transom in December from Stephen C. Markoff, a real estate investor who was both a company director and its largest shareholder, with a 15 percent stake. In his bid, Mr. Markoff offered to pay $2.525 a share in cash and notes. **********While that offer was being considered, another arrived: JER Partners, an arm of a Virginia-based real estate concern, proposed an all-cash offer that the company said was close in price to the Markoff proposal, subject to certain conditions. **********The MIP directors selected JER over Mr. Markoff in February, having decided that the all-cash deal from an independent bidder was preferable. The decision left Mr. Markoff unhappy, and he resigned from the board and all its committees. **********Suddenly, the hopes for a sale looked bleak. Under its corporate charter, MIP could only be sold if a sale were approved by 80 percent or more of the outstanding shares. And now, without the support of Mr. Markoff, the company's largest shareholder, JER would have trouble securing the necessary votes. **********Here's where things get dicey: In March and April, MIP Properties continued negotiating the terms of a deal with JER. At the same time, JER began its own separate talks with Mr. Markoff to find out what would make him happy. **********In May, everything came together. The board of MIP approved a deal with JER for $2.475 a share. At almost the same time, Mr. Markoff and JER struck a side deal: He would vote in favor of the sale if JER sold him a number of properties MIP owned. Under the agreement, the sale of the properties would take place immediately after the acquisition of MIP was completed. **********What about a simple real estate purchase was enough to get Mr. Markoff to vote for the JER deal? Big potential profits. JER has agreed to sell the properties for significantly less than their stated value. According to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Markoff will pay about $1.8 million for the properties -- even though MIP says that the net book value of that real estate, as far as its auditors are concerned, is $3.3 million. **********In other words, to keep a former MIP director from blocking the transaction, JER is willing to give him a benefit that isn't being offered to any other shareholder. Meanwhile, the shareholders are seeing their property valued at a price that is arguably far less than they might receive in a totally arms-length transaction. In its filings, MIP contends that the value of those parcels on the company's books might not be equivalent to what they can fetch on the market. But the fact is, no one will ever know. **********\"This is clearly not fair,\" said John Hinson, the president of North Bay Group, a real estate and investment firm that owns about two percent of MIP Properties. \"All of us shareholders who aren't being offered this preferred deal are harmed by virtue of getting a lower price for our shares.\" **********MIP characterizes its deal with JER as a merger, but Mr. Hinson says it is nothing more than a cash tender offer for shares. And, on the face of it, he appears to be right -- investors get no stake in the merged company, but are simply paid to cash in their shares. **********That's important, because a tender offer must follow rules that insure every investor receive the same consideration. Mr. Hinson has argued in a suit filed weeks ago that the transaction with Mr. Markoff has made the JER deal a two-tiered tender offer, with special benefits going to a single shareholder. **********Telephone calls to Carl Gregory, MIP's chairman and chief executive, were not returned. But in a statement on Thursday, MIP said that the company did not believe that Mr. Hinson's lawsuit had any merit. **********Still, making the proposed deal more suspect is the fact that a number of senior managers pushing the deal will do nicely when it's finished. For example, Mr. Gregory will receive a bonus and other cash benefits totalling almost $180,000 when the merger is completed. Directors and executives who had been awarded shares as deferred compensation will be able to cash out. **********So now, the shareholders have to decide whether to approve JER's bid of $2.475 a share at a meeting called for Sept. 27. **********It's a tough dilemma: With nothing else on the table, shareholders may feel they have no choice but to hold their noses and vote for the deal, with the full knowledge that they might have gotten more. Then, they can hope that Mr. Hinson's lawsuit becomes a class action and is successful. **********Of course, there are sure to be shareholders who believe that the MIP directors picked the best possible deal, and will gladly vote their shares in favor. After all, even though Fitzgerald was only partly right, P.T. Barnum hit it right on the head: There's a sucker born every minute."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/23/business/fahnestock-plan-rebuffed.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1995-08-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 86, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fahnestock Plan Rebuffed", "print_headline": "Fahnestock Plan Rebuffed", "body_text": " **********The First Michigan Capital Corporation said today that it had rejected an offer to meet with Fahnestock & Company, which was considering making a bid for the company.

And as Mexico struggles to lure back investors, a movement to back out of the American aid commitment has erupted in Congress. **********Already the cash-starved Mexican Government has used $13 billion of a total $50 billion aid package, including more than $5 billion from the United States Treasury, to pay off billions in debts it ran up in a risky financial strategy that collapsed in December. Most of those investors -- a mix of rich Mexicans, Americans and other foreigners -- have swept up their hefty profits and immediately transferred their money out of the country. **********But for the first time since the peso crisis began on Dec. 20, anecdotal evidence suggests that a tiny trickle of private investment has begun to flow back into the country -- a trickle that both governments acknowledge must turn into a river if the American bailout package stands a chance of working. **********In the last few days senior American and Mexican officials have seized on a modest upturn in the stock market and some signs that the peso is stabilizing to argue that their strategy for restoring confidence is succeeding. Many others say that the small recovery may only mark a brief reprieve before the country begins to pay the price for soaring unemployment, inflation and consumer interest rates that have topped 100 percent. **********\"In the past week we've developed a more positive feel,\" Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, the chief architect of the plan, said in an interview Friday. \"There are no guarantees in life, but the evidence has become more encouraging.\" **********No one has more at stake in making the bailout work than President Clinton. By circumventing Congress and using the Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund to issue the loans -- a highly unusual use of money normally intended to stabilize the dollar -- Mr. Clinton alone will be blamed if the rescue effort falls apart. Already the Senate Majority Leader, Bob Dole, who is seeking the Republican nomination for President, has backpedaled from his early support for the bailout. And if Mexico's economic downturn results in a flood of goods or illegal immigrants into Texas and California, two key states in next year's election, Mr. Clinton will likely pay the price. **********Moreover, Mr. Rubin and other members of the Administration are scrambling to cut off a surprise attack by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, who tied up the Senate for most of Thursday with an amendment that would have prevented the Administration from dispersing anything beyond the $5.2 billion that Washington has already sent. He has promised to take the matter up again on Monday, and perhaps force a vote this week. **********\"Mexico has collapsed already,\" Mr. D'Amato argued in a telephone interview on Friday. \"The rescue plan has failed. And we are just perpetuating a myth if we think we are helping anyone except rich investors, who the United States has saved while everyone else in Mexico starves.\" **********Many in Congress were relieved when President Clinton acted alone two months ago, alleviating them of an unhappy choice between voting for a deeply unpopular plan and letting Mexico descend into financial ruin. As a result, Mr. D'Amato concedes that he probably does not have the votes to kill the aid package, at least this time. But he has successfully revived the continuing argument over whether the Administration's plan can work, and whether the White House erred in designing a bailout package that clearly benefits rich investors, in the optimistic hope that they can be convinced to keep their much-needed capital in the country. **********Moreover, Mr. D'Amato, who is also the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, knows he does not have to pass his bill to seriously wound the Administration's effort. Even a close vote will send a signal to the markets that Mr. Clinton will have to be extraordinarily cautious in committing more American funds to Mexico. **********With considerable political theater, Mr. D'Amato has also been leading an investigation that has come to be called: \"Who lost Mexico?\" For weeks he has been arguing with the Administration over demands for thousands of pages of classified documents on everything from the drug connections of Mexican officials to the Treasury Department's warnings to Mexico last year that financial disaster was looming. An agreement has been reached, but it is a sensitive issue at the White House, because many of the warnings came in the weeks before President Clinton publicly hailed Mexico as a \"model\" for emerging markets around the world. **********On Wednesday, a day before he began his effort to scuttle the aid package, Mr. D'Amato and other Republicans clashed at a closed hearing with Lawrence Summers, the Undersecretary of the Treasury, arguing that the Administration misled Congress and the public last year about the depth of Mexico's troubles and the risks of the bailout plan. For the first time, Mr. Summers provided a detailed account of his contacts with Mexico -- something he has declined to do in public -- and defended the Administration's failure to issue its warnings about Mexico in public. To do so, Mr. Summers has argued, would have touched off exactly the kind of market run on Mexico he was trying to prevent. **********At the same classified briefing, the Central Intelligence Agency also told the committee that Mexico's oil exports, which it put up as the collateral for the $20 billion from Washington, will drop off significantly in the next five years, leaving little to secure the American loans. That runs contrary to assurances given by Mexican officials as recently as two weeks ago. **********Treasury officials decline to discuss the details of the classified assessment, but one senior official said he was convinced that \"there will be sufficient revenue stream\" from Mexico's oil exports to insure that American taxpayers will be paid back if the country defaults. **********Apart from the maneuvering for political advantage, two questions lie at the core of the argument under way in Congress: Is the rescue package achieving its primary goal, which is to bring foreign investment -- and thus stability -- back to the country? Is the austerity plan that the United States insisted on likely to trigger social or political turmoil? **********For the Administration, the answer to the first question is disappointing. Even after the signing of the loan package Feb. 21, foreign investors seemed to be more nervous than before -- in part because of the soaring interest rates that were intended to attract them. Most foreign investors who hold maturing tesobonos -- high-yield, short-term Government bonds that Mexico issued in enormous numbers last year to cover its trade deficit -- simply cash them in and get out of town, taking their money with them. **********But the Mexican Government has already paid off $13 billion of the $29 billion in outstanding tesobonos, and there are indications that some Mexican investors have started to use that money to buy other types of Government debt, including treasury certificates and bonds called \"ajustabonos\" that are adjusted to Mexico's soaring inflation rate. **********\"There's no new money going in,\" said one investment fund manager in New York who did not want to be identified. \"The spigot that was turned off is still off.\" **********But Luis R. Luis, the head of research for emerging market debt at Scudder, Stevens and Clark, an investment manager in Boston, notes that the Mexican stock market fell so low and interest rates on bonds rose so high that \"some of the assets are now attractive.\" With the devalued peso making imports far more expensive than they were in December, Mexico has also begun to run up a trade surplus, largely at the expense of the United States. A massive surplus, which reduces the need to import foreign capital, is a key to the recovery plan. **********The Mexican Government, trying to put the best light on a bad situation, insists that the program is beginning to work. **********But the turnaround is a race against time, with the Government gambling that things will look better before it feels the consequences of homeowners who cannot pay their mortgages and workers who are laid off. \"There is this enormous explosion that everyone is worried about,\" said Robert Hormats, the vice chairman of Goldman Sachs & Company, where Mr. Rubin spent most of his career. **********Unemployment in January was more than twice the level of Government estimates. Inflation is steadily rising and could soar this month, as huge increases in the cost of gasoline and electricity are passed on to consumers. For the year, inflation will likely run above 50 percent. **********Today the Government also increased its national sales tax to 15 percent on a broad range of goods, an increase that hurts the poor more than anyone else. **********Remarkably, there has been no explosion of social unrest, although people are in the street protesting the Government's economic policies. Labor unions have grumbled loudly that the devaluation of the peso has hurt workers, but most have agreed to the salary increases offered by the Government or individual employers -- knowing that the only alternative is layoffs. That is a particular hardship in Mexico where there is no unemployment insurance."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/09/business/company-news-northwest-air-and-airtran-settle-a-long-dispute.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-03-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 103, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NORTHWEST AIR AND AIRTRAN SETTLE A LONG DISPUTE", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; NORTHWEST AIR AND AIRTRAN SETTLE A LONG DISPUTE", "body_text": " **********Northwest Airlines Inc. and the Airtran Corporation tentatively settled an eight-month dispute yesterday that stemmed from Airtran's foray into jet passenger service.

She has no job, and five children under the age of 6. They share an unheated upper room with 10 other people, sleeping on mats spread out on the bare concrete floor. **********At lunchtime the other day, Mrs. Gul had other indignities on her mind. From shortly after dawn, she had been out begging, part of an army of indigent war widows who are a common sight in most villages and towns in Afghanistan. **********Dressed in sky-blue and faded orange burkas, the cloaklike garments that cover many of Afghanistan's conservative Muslim women from head to toe, the widows make wraithlike figures as they move with cupped hands through the bazaars. **********Six years ago, after a decade of Soviet occupation, Afghanistan had sunk close to the bottom of most tables that international relief agencies keep to measure human distress. Since then, the Communist Government has collapsed, giving way to a civil war among the Muslim rebel groups that had fought Soviet troops. **********For many Afghan civilians who thought that the Soviet period was as bad as things could get, the civil war has been misery compounded. Before the Soviet troops left, estimates of the war dead were above one million. This figure has risen sharply. One measure is the number of people admitted to Kabul hospitals during the shelling that destroyed much of the city last year. **********From experience elsewhere, the International Committee of the Red Cross, which sustains many of the Kabul hospitals with medical workers and supplies, estimates that 8,000 to 9,000 died, about one for every three wounded people who were admitted to the hospitals. **********These figures suggest that Kabul suffered about as badly from the shelling in 1994 as Sarajevo did in 1992, the first year of the siege there, when about 10,000 people died. But the 600,000 people who remained in Kabul during the shelling did so without a United Nations peacekeeping force of the kind that buffered Sarajevo's miseries. Instead, all United Nations relief agencies pulled their foreign staff workers out of the Afghan capital when the shelling began, and ended their operations. **********Even before the United Nations shutdown, many of the governments and private fund-raising groups that made Afghanistan a priority at an earlier stage of the war had shifted priorities elsewhere. The United States ended all of its direct aid operations in Afghanistan last fall, in part because of Washington's diminished interest there after the Soviet troop withdrawal in 1989. A United Nations appeal for $106 million last fall -- for food aid, mine clearance, refugee programs and health projects -- has drawn less than $30 million from United Nations members as of this February. **********Private relief agencies have played a major role in the Afghan conflict, but they, too, have been forced to limit operations, partly because of the fighting, more so because of the difficulties of sustaining operations in areas devastated by the war. Journeys that once took a few hours now take days because roads have been reduced to backbreaking washboards and bridges have been blown away. With armed gangs controlling most roads, robbery is common. **********About 120 of the 150 private agencies working in Afghanistan restrict their operations to a thin sliver of territory along the eastern border with Pakistan. Agencies that venture farther bring back tales of a society that barely functions. Because of the war, a generation of young Afghans have missed all their schooling, raising illiteracy levels above 75 percent. **********The Afghan Red Crescent Society, equivalent of the Red Cross, estimates that about one person in every three remaining in the country is a refugee, driven from his or her own area by the war. That would amount to between three million and four million refugees. **********As in Kabul, many beg. Cries of \"Baksheesh? Baksheesh?\" -- meaning \"gift\" -- are heard everywhere. Doctors for the Afghan Red Crescent Society say surveys in some remote areas show that 50 percent of the people are suffering from malnutrition. Even in Kabul, where food supplies have been better than in many areas, small children are brought to clinics with kwashiorkor, the acute form of malnutrition, common in Africa but relatively rare in Asia, that manifests itself in extended bellies. **********Tuberculosis has reached epidemic levels. A Red Crescent survey among 500,000 people in the Samangan region, in northeastern Afghanistan, showed that 80 percent of families had at least one member with the disease. Skin diseases are also rampant. With only one functioning hospital for every 500,000 people in some areas, many sufferers go without treatment. Because of the frequent hijacking of relief convoys, medical supplies are in short supply. **********Attempts to revive normal life in the countryside have been complicated by undiscovered mines, as many as 10 million according to United Nations estimates. **********Although the United Nations and several private agencies have mine-clearing operations, it will be years before most areas are cleared. In the meantime, dozens of new mine victims arrive at Kabul hospitals every week, often with legs blown off. In the capital, men and boys moving on crutches, with stumps and no artificial limbs, are a common sight. **********Mrs. Gul, the war widow who spends her days begging through the bazaars, had nothing to show for her pleas after five hours. **********\"It is because of the war,\" she said, her moist eyes just visible through the mesh gauze set into the face of her burka. \"The war has taken our homes and our husbands and our food.

But they can now, ever since the Piedmont began the 175-mile run between the two cities on May 26. What's more, the Piedmont was bought by the state, which arranged for Amtrak to operate it. **********\"North Carolina realized we can't build highways fast enough to accommodate our growth,\" said Patrick Simmons, director of the rail division of the North Carolina Department of Transportation. \"We need alternates for business and leisure travelers.\" **********When Amtrak did not have enough equipment to start a new service, North Carolina officials bought five used rail cars from the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company for $217,000, then spent an additional $2.2 million to have them refurbished. It bought two refurbished locomotives for $1 million each, then built a turnaround track in Charlotte and a maintenance facility at Raleigh. **********Now the Piedmont's air-conditioned passenger cars and a food service car depart Raleigh at 7:10 each morning and arrive in Charlotte less than four hours later after stops in seven other cities. Each evening the Piedmont departs Charlotte at 5:45 and returns to Raleigh by 9:30. The goal is to trim running time by 30 minutes within two years and to cut it to two hours in five years. **********\"It's true that right now you can drive that corridor faster than the time the train takes,\" Mr. Simmons said. \"But you can't drive it and have someone serve you food, or sit at tables with electrical outlets and phone service so you can get some work done along the way.\" Going Cellular in Europe **********Global Cellular Rental, which leases cellular telephones for use in Europe, has a toll-free number: 800 699-6861.

Because the index found that the 3 percent drop in overall satisfaction with the service sector is almost entirely the result of a 2.7 percent drop in satisfaction with hotels and motels.

Dudayev, have abandoned their last two urban bases -- Gudermes, Chechnya's second-largest city, 25 miles east of the capital, Grozny; and Shali, 15 miles southeast of Grozny, which fell today. **********In both cases, Chechen forces withdrew after heavy artillery and air bombardment from encircling Russian forces. By withdrawing, the Chechens have preserved what remains of their fighting forces, ammunition and other materiel. **********Chechen fighters will now regroup in the Caucasus mountains to the south and try to fight a guerrilla war of harassment and terror against superior Russian forces. **********In the mountains, the Russians will find it harder to maneuver and will be unable to use tanks and other heavily armored vehicles. The mountains, however, provide little ground cover against Russian aircraft, and the Chechens lack antiaircraft weapons. **********Russian commanders say they will seek to control the major towns and the roads and railways between them, while trying to convince Chechen villagers to force out the fighters and submit to Russian authority. **********A Russian First Deputy Prime Minister, Oleg N. Soskovets, said today that \"active combat actions on the territory of the Chechen republic would be over\" after the seizure of Shali. It was difficult to know what Mr. Soskovets meant, since most of the original 15,000 or so Chechen fighters still form a cohesive combat force. **********In an interview last week in the Russian military headquarters at Mozdok, the Russian commander in Chechnya, Gen. Anatoly S. Kulikov, said that he hoped to control two-thirds of the breakaway republic by early summer, and that significant resistance remained around key road and rail points. **********Russian politicians have routinely been overly optimistic about events in Chechnya, and clearly want the the heavy visible fighting finished by May 9, when President Clinton comes to Moscow for a summit meeting with President Boris N. Yeltsin. **********That is the day when -- only a few miles from where Mr. Clinton will stand in Red Square watching a subdued march of veterans -- Russia will celebrate the victory over Nazism with a large military parade, including heavy armor, rockets and troops from Chechnya. **********Moscow is now expected to try to seal off the mountains and prevent Chechen fighters from crossing Russian lines to carry out guerrilla attacks. While still a difficult task, it will mean far fewer casualties and visible warfare than the long effort to take Grozny, which was essentially destroyed by shelling, bombs and finally house-to-house fighting. **********In other places, the Russians have threatened -- and used -- major force if villages and towns did not expel Chechen fighters. **********Argun, another small urban center abandoned last week, is as thoroughly destroyed as Grozny. The fighting there has caused a new flow of 30,000 refugees from villages in the south, according to relief agencies, who complain that Russian forces have hindered their ability to provide food and medical assistance in southern Chechnya. **********The Russians will now work to seize arms larger than private hunting rifles or pistols from towns and villages, and to set up their own militia in Chechnya. They also hope to write a new constitution placing Chechnya firmly inside the Russian Federation, then hold new elections in the next six months to replace Mr. Dudayev's government. **********Many Chechens have no great love for Mr. Dudayev but were pushed to support him by Russia's military intervention, which began Dec. 11, and by the seemingly indiscriminate destruction of Grozny and other towns by the Russian forces. **********General Kulikov admits that the Chechens have fought extremely well, helped by some 30,000 partly trained local militia. But Russian commanders say that after a horrible beginning and over 1,400 Russian combat deaths -- an official figure that some believe is too low and that does not count those still missing in action -- the hardest part of the Chechen war is over. **********The Russian commanders believe, according to Pavel Y. Felgengauer, the defense expert for the newspaper Sevodnya, that the Chechens will have a hard time supporting a modern partisan army in the mountains, at least without aid from abroad. **********This is one reason, Mr. Felgengauer said, that Moscow is eager to help Iran, which \"could help mute support for Muslim guerrillas both in Tajikistan and in Chechnya.\" **********While Mr. Clinton would like Moscow to cancel its planned sale of light-water nuclear reactors to Iran, Mr. Felgengauer suggests that Chechnya is another reason why Moscow will go ahead with the sale.

Yeltsin, who was hospitalized on Tuesday with acute chest pain, said today that he had canceled a trip to Norway and all engagements until Monday, July 24, prompting renewed speculation about the state of his health. **********It was a sharp change from the announcements of the last few days, which said that Mr. Yeltsin's health was improving, and that he was in charge, at work and keeping control of the nuclear button. Depending on the specific diagnosis and the serious of his condition, the doctors may be urging him to rest, and they may be acting cautiously. **********On Thursday, aides said Mr. Yeltsin, who is 64, would probably be discharged on Monday from the Central Clinic in the Kremlin and go as scheduled on Wednesday to Murmansk and Norway. Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the constitutional successor should Mr. Yeltsin die or become incapacitated, spoke with him this morning on the telephone and then left, as planned, for eastern Siberia; he is to return on Saturday. **********Mr. Yeltsin's wife, Naina, who visited him this morning, criticized press speculation about him as \"verbal sadism\" and said he was working at a desk. \"I can calm the Russians,\" she said. \"Boris Yeltsin's health is fine.\" **********And it was announced that Mr. Yeltsin had signed a decree proclaiming Dec. 17 as the date of planned parliamentary elections. **********But this afternoon, Kremlin aides told the official Itar-Tass news agency that the Norway trip was off. Three hours later, they said that the entire week's schedule had been scrapped on doctor's orders and that Mr. Yeltsin would probably remain in the hospital for most of that period, then go to his country home. **********Viktor V. Ilyushin, a Yeltsin confidante who controls his schedule, confirmed the news on national television tonight, but said the President's condition had not worsened since he entered the hospital. **********The presidential spokesman, Sergei K. Medvedev, said in a statement that Mr. Yeltsin's doctors did not want him to fly just yet. **********Mrs. Yeltsin said: \"The doctors demand that the President should finish his treatment, preferably in the hospital. This treatment should not be hurried.\" But few people know what the treatment is. **********According to the Kremlin, Mr. Yeltsin's problem is ischemia, which means the heart muscle is not getting all the oxygen it needs, usually because of a blocked or constricted artery. **********Western doctors say that the condition is common, and that the Kremlin has given little indication of how serious Mr. Yeltsin's condition is. Bad cases can lead to serious heart attacks, or can be treated with drugs, bypass operations or angioplasty, to open up clogged arteries. **********Mr. Yeltsin has had heart problems before. He has high blood pressure and back pain, has been known to drink very heavily and has a high-stress job. When he entered the hospital last December, on the eve of the Russian invasion of Chechnya, the stated reason was a nose operation for a deviated septum, but he remained in the hospital for over a week and in seclusion for another. **********In a country used to dark speculations about the health of its leaders, even the Kremlin's apparent efforts to deal relatively openly and quickly with Mr. Yeltsin's problems were seen as a move to put a brighter spin on bad news. **********Russians are comparing Mr. Yeltsin to former party leaders, Leonid I. Brezhnev and Konstantin U. Chernenko, whose public frailties during their final years in power made a mockery of their office. But today, there is a constitutional succession should Mr. Yeltsin suddenly die, with Prime Minister Chernomyrdin -- 57 and apparently vigorous -- to take over and then to call new presidential elections within three months. **********Mr. Chernomyrdin, who has become a serious public and political figure in his own right in the last few months, is regarded by Western Governments as preferable to most of the other possible presidential candidates. That is the prime reason that Mr. Yeltsin's latest health scare has not yet caused much anxiety among Western diplomats or on financial markets. **********\"In this country of instability, there is a general disbelief in official information,\" Aleksandr Minkin wrote in Moskovsky Komsomolets. \"If he has recuperated so quickly, why hasn't even a single television journalist been able to see the President after his heart trouble -- at least for the sake of the nation's peace of mind?\" **********Mr. Minkin's newspaper infuriated Mrs. Yeltsin by implying that her husband's heart pain was linked to a party the night before for the birthday of an aide. \"The post of the President is a heavy burden,\" Mrs. Yeltsin said. \"It demands much energy and health and it should be treated with understanding.\" **********But the heart problems have already made Mr. Yeltsin seem even more unlikely to run again for the presidency in June 1996, or to win if he runs. **********\"One doesn't have to be a doctor to remember how vigorous Boris Nikolayevich looked four years ago,\" said the weekly Obshchaya Gazeta, \"and to imagine what kind of leader we might see on television sometime in the year 2000.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/30/world/clinton-promises-full-effort-to-account-for-mia-s.html": {"writer_name": "Todd Purdum", "pub_date": "1995-05-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 599, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Clinton Promises Full Effort to Account for M.I.A.'s", "print_headline": "Clinton Promises Full Effort to Account for M.I.A.'s", "body_text": " **********Honoring veterans in Memorial Day ceremonies, President Clinton promised today to \"leave no stone unturned\" in accounting for prisoners of war and troops missing in action in Vietnam, and he praised Hanoi for cooperating in such efforts more \"than ever before.\" **********The President's remarks amounted to some of his most detailed -- and conciliatory -- comments on Vietnam, as his advisers debate whether the United States should establish full diplomatic ties with its former enemy as the next step in accounting for missing troops and pursuing trade and economic opportunities in Southeast Asia. **********\"We have worked hard and made good progress,\" Mr. Clinton told veterans gathered in a tent on the South Lawn of the White House for the unveiling of a new first-class postage stamp honoring P.O.W.'s and those missing in action. \"We have put the issue of M.I.A. cases ahead of all others in our dealings with Vietnam, and today I am proud to say we are receiving more cooperation from Hanoi than ever before.\" **********The President did not mention the issue of recognition of Hanoi, and aides said later that they did not expect any immediate decision. Some of Mr. Clinton's diplomatic and economic advisers are pressing strongly to establish full diplomatic ties, arguing that recent disclosures of documents by Hanoi meet the criteria the Government has laid out during the last four years for normalization. But others are said to be wary, concerned that such a move could hurt Mr. Clinton, whose efforts to avoid service in Vietnam have dogged his political career. **********\"I would not anticipate any decision in the next few days,\" said the national security adviser, Anthony Lake.

If he does attempt to shape those businesses, they asked, how will the strong executives already there respond? **********Or will Mr. Turner now ease back and let others run the empire -- something no one expects him to do? **********Along with the question of possible instability at Warner Brothers, many people here were concerned that the the growing concentration of power could make it harder to produce quirky, unusual or daring films or television programs. It was feared that a huge conglomerate would seek consistency and high-volume, high-return productions rather than gambling on riskier fare. **********For instance, New Line Cinema, run by Bob Shaye, has remained relatively independent since being acquired by Turner.

The yen is still up 2 percent against the dollar this year. **********Against the mark, the dollar was underpinned by speculation that Germany's 14-day securities repurchase rate, the country's key money-market rate, will drop again when the Bundesbank conducts its weekly money-market operations today. **********The German central bank has cut the repo rate to 4.3 percent from 4.5 percent over the last four weeks.

Compared with keeping rice warm in a rice-cooker, this saves about eight cents a meal. **********Mrs. Sakurai also keeps a thermos of iced tea on the counter in the summer, so her children will not keep opening the refrigerator. And when a sale comes, she buys a year's worth of clothing for them **********It's not that Mrs. Sakurai has suddenly become poor, but that she worries she could. Just a few years ago, Japan was a country so dedicated to extravagance that some restaurants even offered meals topped with gold dust, a tribute to corporate expense accounts, and executives were picking up Armani suits and patches of American real estate as if they were stuffing a gift bag with baubles. National spending soared. **********But now, after several years of near-zero growth, many Japanese are increasingly anxious about their future. The response: cut costs and sock away money once again. **********\"I turn off all the lights when I go out,\" Mrs. Sakurai said. \"I also use the leftover bath water for the laundry, pour it into the plants or splash it on the garden.\" **********Frugality is sweeping the society. Magazines compete to offer suggestions for saving, telling readers that microwave cooking is half the cost of gas-burner cooking, or recommending baths rather than showers, or using large cooking pans (boiling water in a 9 1/2-inch pan costs 3.9 cents, compared with 4.5 cents for a 6 1/4-inch pan), or using a smaller television (the cost of electricity for a 14-inch television is half that for a 25-inch one). **********As people save money -- in ways as minimal as reheating rice, as substantial as delaying construction of a new house -- those yen are adding up, reversing a downward trend in savings here. Household savings now total $480 billion a year, about two and a half times the amount that Americans save a year, and household spending is at a 20-year low. **********The eight cents saved by reheating rice does not always end up in the bank account. But such cost-cutting tends to increase savings, and household savings rates are rising in Japan, even though they are still lower than they were decades ago. **********This year, they have climbed to 21 percent of disposable income, from about 18.5 percent four years ago, compared with under 5 percent in the United States. It is a habit of parsimony that will help fortify the Japanese economy in the long run because those billions are recycled into money-making investment projects throughout the international economy. **********Savings also cut domestic consumption and thus help drive the trade surplus, and so the more cash Japanese stash in their accounts, the more persistent the trade surplus is likely to be with America. **********In Japan, women often control the household purse strings, and one sign of the times is the dwindling allowances that wives give their husbands. **********Takashi Nishimura, a 43-year-old stockbroker, saw his salary fall this year, and his wife took drastic measures. She cut his allowance from $520 to $208 a month to help pay the mortgage, and this forced him to curb his lavish ways. **********\"I used to get 50,000 yen a month last year, but now she gives me only 20,000 yen,\" Mr. Nishimura said. \"Instead of eating traditional Japanese meals at Ginza, I eat meat kebabs at cheaper places in Shimbashi.\" **********Such money monopolization in the home often leaves 47-year-old Ishii Tsutomu with hardly any change to spare. As he took his wife and their two daughters shopping at a discount store in Urawa, it was clear who had control. **********Mr. Tsutomu had only 2,000 yen, or about $20 in his wallet. His wife, Sumie, makes him a lunch box every day and gives him about $100 a month to spend, with an extra $1,000 at the end of the year for holiday parties. **********Mrs. Tsutomu also deposits some savings at a local department store which gives her interest in return for her purchasing her children's school uniforms there every year. **********Of course, the sacrifice goes only so far. The Tsutomus leave their air conditioners on at night, and Mrs. Tsutomu still boils her potatoes on a gas stove. **********For 47-year-old Tetsuo Senmyo, a salaryman in the road-building business, saving means spending $350 on a golfing-and-drinking session only once a month, instead of twice. While he still goes on drinking outings with his friends, he has cut down, partly to offset a decline in his overtime income. **********\"I take my allowance only sparingly,\" said Mr. Senmyo, as he eyed a shiny new golf club on sale in a store. \"I hold back because my income is lower, and I give it all to my wife.\" **********Not all men are so generous. Mutako Kikuki, a 55-year-old cafeteria worker, saves by giving her unwanted leftovers to her neighbor, who reciprocates. Mrs. Kikuki's husband, a construction worker, lost his bonus and she can barely meet their daily living expenses on his salary. **********She would like to cut his $300-a-month allowance to zero, but hell would break loose if she did. **********\"It's unthinkable that he would save any of that!\" she said in disgust. \"He has no intention whatsoever to save. I've been working and struggling all my life. My kids are grown up and working, and now, when I think of the future -- well, whatever will be will be.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/13/business/woolworth-ends-dividend-cuts-spending.html": {"writer_name": "Sylvia Nasar", "pub_date": "1995-04-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 283, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Woolworth Ends Dividend, Cuts Spending", "print_headline": "Woolworth Ends Dividend, Cuts Spending", "body_text": " **********The Woolworth Corporation announced after the stock market closed yesterday that it was eliminating its quarterly dividend of 15 cents a share and slashing capital spending. **********The cutbacks are intended to bolster the troubled retailer's cash flow, the chairman and chief executive, Roger N.

It allows the policyholder, for a small cost, to double or triple the benefit if a death occurs by accident. Nearly all deaths not from natural causes are considered accidental, even murders. **********Among the common exceptions to the rule are deaths induced by illicit drugs and those resulting from war. Many policies include clauses that expand the definition of war to include \"warlike\" conditions. That caveat was added to cover the Vietnam War, which was undeclared.

A holder of a State Farm health policy with the supplemental coverage who died or lost limbs in Wednesday's bombing could collect as much as $25,000.

But the office was only a pale reflection of the upheaval into which this tradition-rich state has been thrown by a court decision that many Bavarians consider sacrilegious and hateful. **********Germany's highest court decided this month that the Bavarian law requiring a crucifix to be hung in each of the state's 40,000 classrooms was unconstitutional. **********\"Because attending school is a general obligation, crosses in classrooms mean that the state confronts pupils with this symbol during their lessons, leaving them no alternative to learning 'under the cross,' \" the Constitutional Court ruled in a 5-3 decision. \"As a result, the presence of crosses in classrooms differs from the normal presence of various religious symbols in other areas of daily life.\" **********Many people here, supported by like-minded citizens across Germany, are demanding to know why one of their most cherished symbols is being banished from schools. **********\"When I first heard the news, I was completely confused,\" Mrs. Hummeler said as she juggled phones and set fax machines. \"I didn't think German judges could even consider doing such a thing. The cross is a symbol of the values we love most and want to transmit to our children. It's almost unthinkable that it can be taken away from us like this.\" **********Mrs. Hummeler is helping to organize a protest in Munich at which she hopes 20,000 people will turn out. Senior religious leaders and politicians from the Christian Social Union, the heavily Catholic party that dominates Bavarian politics, are expected to attend. **********The party chairman, Finance Minister Theo Waigel, has already declared himself \"horrified and astonished\" by the decision. Chancellor Helmut Kohl also criticized it. **********\"The crucifix as a symbol of Christian belief harms no one,\" Mr. Kohl said in a statement. \"After this century's bitter experience with anti-Christian ideologies and their awful and inhuman effects, we feel a special obligation to pass these values on to future generations.\" **********Educational policy in Germany, like most domestic policy, is shaped principally by the states. Bavaria, which with 11 million inhabitants is Germany's second most populous state, is the only one that requires religious symbols in classrooms. Other states ban them or leave the decision to local communities. **********Politicians from Germany's left-oriented Social Democratic and Green parties welcomed the court's decision.

Governor Edmund Stoiber said he would not order the removal of crucifixes \"for the time being,\" and asserted that he was under no obligation to remove them in schools where parents unanimously opposed such action. **********Friedrich Cardinal Wetter of Munich, the Bavarian capital, said parents alone should have the power to decide whether crucifixes should hang in classrooms. **********\"We guarantee tolerance for people who think differently from us, and we demand in return that same tolerance,\" Cardinal Wetter told pilgrims in the Bavarian town of Altotting last week.

R. Grace & Company thought they were putting the past behind them when they released a cryptic statement announcing the unexpected resignation of J. P. Bolduc, the chief executive, on March 2, they have had a rude awakening. **********Yesterday, the company was forced to admit that Mr. Bolduc was let go after longstanding allegations of sexual harassment had come to the attention of the board. With that, what was already one of the most bizarre corporate dramas in memory got worse. Grace now must answer questions about its past management practices, its future leadership, its legal liabilities, the candor of its directors and its ability to satisfy the powerful institutional investors who hold the bulk of its stock. **********Shareholders are clearly skittish about the outcome. Grace's stock dropped yesterday to $53.75, down 75 cents a share. **********Beyond the sexual harassment charges, the disputes that have thrown the venerable chemical and health services company into turmoil center on the size of Mr. Bolduc's severance package and the board's handling of his departure. Directors must also prove to both stockholders and regulators that they have fairly handled and fully disclosed the company's dealings with J. Peter Grace Jr., who agreed this month to resign as the company's chairman at its annual meeting in early May. **********The toughest job of all will be recruiting a new chief executive willing to take on these problems. \"It will be a difficult search,\" E. Pendleton James, an executive recruiter, said. \"Talent in that industry is thin, and most players would not want to be associated with Grace.\" **********Indeed, the challenge of finding a new chief executive to put Grace back on track, difficult in ordinary times, may have been aggravated by the board's blunders. Yet directors are working against a tight deadline. A chief executive must be found and many of these issues must be resolved before the board meets shareholders at the May meeting. **********The upheaval comes at a critical time for Grace. Long a lackluster performer, the company's stock climbed from $35.25 in early December to $45.375 in early March, partly thanks to Mr. Bolduc's efforts to focus the company on its core businesses. But while the company fortunes seemed to be improving, a behind-the-scenes dispute had arisen over company-paid perquisites given to Mr. Grace and over company dealings with his son, J. Peter Grace 3d. Although substantial, Grace had not made disclosures about them in company filings. **********Problems began when the elder Mr. Grace, the company and the board all sought legal counsel on the disclosure issue. During heated discussions among lawyers and directors, allegations of sexual harassment against Mr. Bolduc arose in the board room. On Feb. 28, former Federal Judge Harold R. Tyler, who was asked to investigate the charges, told the board privately that \"grounds existed to find that Mr. Bolduc has sexually harassed certain employees of the company.\" The board soon asked for Mr. Bolduc's resignation. **********But Mr. Bolduc's restructuring job was hardly finished. When news of his resignation broke, institutions that knew nothing about the harassment charges rose to his support. Fearing that the restructuring would be derailed, shareholders demanded that Mr. Bolduc be considered again for the job of chief executive. **********Pressure from shareholders also led the elder Mr. Grace and several directors to agree on March 17 to resign, effective at the annual meeting, clearing the way for an overhaul of the board. **********So far, only one person seems to want Mr. Bolduc's old job. Constantine Hampers, head of Grace's National Medical Care division, has thrown his hat in the ring. However, he is unacceptable to some shareholders, who say he is beholden to the Grace family, an allegation he has denied. **********Whoever takes up the Grace challenge faces several potential legal problems. First, there's the problem of the Graces. There was a difference of legal opinion over what the company was required to disclose about its dealings with the Grace family, but Mr. Tyler ultimately advised the board to disclose everything about them. **********Then there is the question of the board's candor. The company first attributed Mr. Bolduc's departure to vague philosophical differences, and then publicly denied that allegations of misconduct were involved. Not until yesterday did the company finally confirm that allegations of sexual harassment had figured in the resignation. **********Giving one explanation to the media and another to the Securities and Exchange Commission may be securities fraud, according to lawyers. While declining to comment on the Grace case in particular, Harvey L. Pitt, a securities lawyer at Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson in Washington, said: \"If you use a different standard for a press release than what you put in a proxy statement, that's a very risky situation. You've got to tell the same story about the same subject to all audiences.\" **********Grace also faces the possibility of litigation by Mr. Bolduc himself, who has vigorously denied any misconduct. Gerald Walpin, a lawyer for the former chief executive, would not rule out a lawsuit. \"All possible avenues and alternatives remain open,\" Mr. Walpin said yesterday. **********And the sexual harassment charges against Mr. Bolduc may expose Grace to additional liability. Nancy Duff Campbell, co-president of the National Women's Law Center in Washington, noted that Mr. Bolduc's vigorous denial of the allegations \"makes it very hard to assess the company's liability.\" But, she added, \"The fact that an outsider, a well-respected former judge, says that this was serious, means that this may be something that could very well produce a complaint against the company.\" **********Shareholders are caught in these crosscurrents. But Claire Sheahan, spokeswoman for College Retirement Equities Fund, the company's second-largest shareholder, said that C.R.E.F. intended to keep up the pressure. \"From the beginning C.R.E.F.'s initiative focused on the need for major corporate governance changes and new leadership at W. R. Grace.

But Colonel Coward said the second shot, which killed the French soldier, was a 5.56-millimeter bullet, whereas the first, which pierced the windshield of his vehicle, appeared to be 7.62 millimeters. **********\"The possibility therefore exists that the second shot may have come from Government positions,\" Colonel Coward said. **********This possibility would of course require that a Serbian sniper fire at the French soldier and then, immediately afterward and presumably without coordination, a Bosnian Government sniper joined in the attack. **********\"It's a very slender thread,\" Colonel Coward conceded, adding that there is no evidence that Muslim-led Government forces use 5.56-millimeter bullets more than the Serbs. **********The United Nations account of the incident, which was in line with a policy that has tended to avoid placing blame on either side for sniping and shelling in Sarajevo, appeared in this instance to defy common sense. **********\"This attempt at an explanation is not only bizarre, it's third-rate,\" said the Bosnian Prime Minister, Haris Silajdzic. **********The French soldier, whose filmed death has caused outrage in France, was killed as he completed work on a new anti-sniping barrier outside the Holiday Inn in central Sarajevo. The area is notorious for Serbian sniping at civilians. **********The confusion was enough, once again, to allow the United Nations to avoid placing blame squarely on any one party, thus avoiding any confrontation that might further complicate its role as a peacekeeper in the midst of a war. An investigation into the killing the previous day of Sgt. Ralph Gunther, another French soldier, has also been inconclusive. **********In the case of Sergeant Gunther, initial evidence appeared to suggest that the shot had come from a Bosnian Government position. But since then, United Nations officials have said he was killed at a place also exposed to a Serbian line of fire. **********The strong whiff of obfuscation surrounding these incidents has underscored the uneasy position of the 24,000 United Nations soldiers in Bosnia. They have become symbols of the growing helplessness of the world before a deepening conflict. **********In France, the killing of two soldiers in two days has produced talk of a withdrawal of United Nations troops. But the comments have appeared contradictory. Francois Leotard, the Defense Minister, suggested that he blamed Bosnian Government forces for the incidents, even as French officers here were saying quite clearly that the second shooting was the work of the Serbs. **********Confusion also reigned at Sarajevo airport, which has been closed for more than a week because of Serbian threats. The United Nations resumed flights today but abruptly barred journalists from the flights. **********Colonel Coward said the decision had been made because flights were resumed on a trial basis and soldiers were better able to face being shot at than journalists. **********But Michael Williams, the departing chief civilian spokesman, said journalists had been barred because the Serbs insisted that only United Nations personnel travel on the flights. **********\"A deal has been cut with the Serbs,\" Mr. Williams said. \"No non-United Nations personnel on the flights, at least for now.\" **********The Serbs have been pressing for such an arrangement mainly to stop Bosnian Government officials from traveling on the flights. But any such accord between the United Nations and the Serbs would amount to the United Nations bending to Serbian pressure under the threat of having its flights fired at. **********\"The United Nations should not even talk to the Serbs about such issues,\" Mr. Silajdzic said. \"When the United Nations talks about arrangements at the airport, I believe it should talk to the legal Government of this country.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/10/world/world-news-briefs-un-team-says-iraq-filed-incomplete-report.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-08-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 146, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "World News Briefs; U.N.

But the Dow continued to fall another 30 points. **********Before yesterday the Dow had risen more than 15 percent -- or 584 points -- this year, and some market-leading stocks like Microsoft had risen more than 40 percent. **********\"A drop like today changes your complacent attitude toward the market,\" said Thomas Gallagher, head of equity trading for Oppenheimer & Company. \"It's a very spooky market when the Dow gets this high.\" **********A few traders cited familiar reasons for the big move, pointing to a report on the rising trade deficit with Japan and fears that a decline in borrowing costs was coming to an end. Indeed, bond prices fell and long-term interest rates rose somewhat. **********But there were also indications that after the nearly seven-month surge of the market, with the Dow hitting six new highs in a row recently, many traders were simply poised to jump out of stocks and take their profits at the first sign of a pullback. **********Adding a large measure of selling pressure is the expiration today of two kinds of stock options, an event known as \"double witching,\" which often leads to a large run-up in trading volume and wide swings in price. **********Technical analysts also say that it is normal for stock prices to rise sharply for a period and then fall as much as one-third to one-half of the advance. Only when prices fall further do market analysts start talking seriously about a bear market. **********\"You have to keep this in statistical perspective,\" said David Holt, vice president of research and strategy for Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles. \"You have to take today's drop of 82 points and compare it to the almost 750-point rise from Nov. 23, when this latest rally started.\" **********Because stock prices have risen so far and so fast, the moves by the component stocks of the Dow tend to be magnified, both up and down. In 1993, for example, a one-point change in a Dow component stock would make the Dow change about two points. Now, a one-point change would move the Dow about 2.8 points. **********Still, the decline yesterday was the biggest fall in blue-chip stock prices since the Dow dropped nearly 47 points on Jan. 19, and almost equaled the fall of more than 91 points last Nov. 22. **********The 82-point drop of the Dow was a decline of 1.85 percent. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 dropped 7.49 points, or 1.42 percent, to 519.58, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 7.87 points, or nine-tenths of 1 percent, to 864.06. **********The Dow is now below 4,400, the level crossed by the market only seven sessions ago, on May 10. It had broken through 4,300 only 19 sessions ago, on April 24. **********Despite the fall, there were some signs of strength in the market, said Alan B. Bond, president of Bond, Procope Capital Management. High-technology stocks like Microsoft, Oracle Systems and Cisco Systems all traded higher than or near their opening prices until the last half-hour, indicating options-related trading. At the close of Nasdaq trading, Microsoft was down 1 3/8, to 84 5/8; Oracle was down 1 1/8, to 33 3/8, and Cisco was down 1 3/8, to 44. **********High-technology stocks have often been the top performers in recent sessions. Even after the decline yesterday, the American Stock Exchange computer technology index was still up more than 30 percent this year. **********\"What we saw today was that the tech stocks' leadership is not faltering,\" Mr. Bond said. **********Moreover, because economic conditions are favorable, with interest rates stable and inflation low, stock prices might rebound as early as this morning, said Edward Laux, senior managing director for equity trading at the Chicago Corporation.  \"The drop in the Dow might scare some weak players,\" he said. \"But given the overall market outlook, we're more likely to have a technical snapback.\" **********The market headed down after the Commerce Department reported that the overall trade deficit narrowed in March, while the deficit with Japan widened. **********The narrowing of the overall deficit might have contributed to the fall in prices because it suggested that the economy was not slowing as much as had been anticipated. That would also suggest that inflation was still a threat, casting doubt that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates in the second half of the year, as a growing number of market analysts have told their clients. **********The volume on the New York Stock Exchange was higher than normal, at 351.9 million shares, about 5 percent higher than the daily average of 335 million shares this year. **********The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 3.72 points, to 279.80, with advancing stocks lagging behind declining stocks by 552 to 1,780.

Modest salary, but substantial power, prestige and perks. Ability to stay awake at long meetings a must. **********The White House thought it had come up with an ideal candidate for the current opening on the Federal Reserve's seven-member board of governors. She is Alicia H. Munnell, the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy, who had earlier worked her way up the through the ranks to become a senior vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. **********But for reasons not entirely clear, torpedoing the appointment is becoming a right-wing cause. The question now is whether President Clinton will actually submit her name. Or he may duck another confirmation fight where, in the words of Herb Stein, an economic adviser to President Richard M. Nixon (and no liberal), \"the opposition is based on irrelevancies\" **********Ms. Munnell is no shrinking violet, but she has not been particularly controversy-prone. After earning a Ph.D. from Harvard in 1973, her public face has largely consisted of scholarly books and articles about retirement policy, tax reform and investment in public works. **********Once in Washington, she dutifully adopted the Treasury's traditional role of prudent parent to the unruly adolescents making waves at Federal agencies with their own special-interest constituencies. She fought environmental hard-liners on Superfund, arguing for streamlined procedures to clean up toxic wastes. She beat back apparatchiks in the Labor Department who wanted private pension funds to make \"socially useful investment.\" Most important in the context of the Fed job, she helped mute White House criticism of the central bank's anti-inflation policy. **********Nonetheless, Paul Craig Roberts, a syndicated columnist who briefly led the \"supply-siders\" in the Reagan Administration, began crusading against her last fall, choosing to make Ms. Munnell the Clinton Administration's poster girl for Big Government. And last week a Wall Street Journal editorial denounced her as \"an economist with ideas on the fiscal fringe.\" **********Since then, 10 Republican Senators, including Phil Gramm, a Presidential contender, wrote to Mr. Clinton. They urged him to give the Fed job to someone with \"a keen eye toward the stability of our currency and the importance of keeping our capital markets free from burdensome regulations, taxes and mandates.\" If there was any doubt what they meant, Senator Connie Mack of Florida sent along a press release alluding to Ms. Munnell's alleged heresies. **********What is going on here? The Wall Street Journal editorial lumped her with liberals who want to tap pension cash for low-income housing and regional development. In fact, her own analysis of social investing -- published in the New England Economic Review -- concluded that this approach to investing was \"alarming\" because pensioners would bear the risk. **********Another beef with Ms. Munnell's views concerns the tax treatment of pensions. She noted in an article in the National Tax Journal that deferral of taxes on employer-sponsored pensions cost the Treasury $51 billion in revenues in 1992. Yet only half the population benefits, with much of the break going to upper-income families. And in Ms. Munnell's reading of the numbers, the net addition to private savings is offset by the negative impact on public savings through the Federal budget. Her suggestion: tax the income accruing in sheltered pension funds. **********That recommendation may be anathema to members of Congress who have never met a tax expenditure they didn't like. But in Mr. Stein's view, it is an \"entirely reasonable point\" to weigh the adverse impact on income distribution against the positive incentives to save. And, while controversial, it is hardly radical economics. **********What, then, is really eating Ms. Munnell's critics? Probably not her attitude toward the Fed's core task of sustaining a healthy, low-inflation economy. For one thing, there is no hint that she disagrees with the semitough approach to monetary policy now in place. For another, her most vociferous critics are supply-siders who think the Fed is already too tough on inflation. **********A more plausible explanation is that the banking industry still quietly blames her for the Boston Fed's study finding racial discrimination in lending. If that is the case, however, the bankers may be directing their ire at the wrong target. Indeed, while the Justice Department is trying to use civil rights laws to force banks to set up branches in poor neighborhoods where blacks are concentrated, the Boston Fed merely called for vigilance and better training for loan officers. **********The very idea that a candidate with Ms. Munnell's credentials is fodder for a fight suggests just how vulnerable President Clinton must appear to Republicans. It may behoove him to fight, if only to demonstrate that appearances deceive."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/10/business/time-warner-seeks-to-sell-stake-in-gangsta-rap-label.html": {"writer_name": "Mark Landler", "pub_date": "1995-08-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 885, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Time Warner Seeks to Sell Stake in Gangsta Rap Label", "print_headline": "Time Warner Seeks to Sell Stake in Gangsta Rap Label", "body_text": " **********Time Warner Inc. is negotiating to sell its 50 percent stake in Interscope Records, the music label whose gangsta rap performers landed the company in a politically charged controversy three months ago. **********Executives at Interscope, which is based in Los Angeles, said they had been in discussions with Michael J. Fuchs, the chairman of the Warner Music Group, for three weeks about buying back the stake. The two companies came close to a deal late last week, the executives said, but the talks have since bogged down. **********Were Time Warner to sever its ties with Interscope, it would represent a major concession to critics who have argued that the company should not distribute gangsta rap music because of its violent and sexually degrading lyrics. **********Time Warner bought its stake in Interscope for $100 million in two installments, one of $20 million in 1992, and the other of $80 million earlier this year. Executives at Interscope said the companies were negotiating how much Time Warner would receive for its stake, plus the working capital it has put into the label. **********\"We don't have a deal yet,\" an executive at Interscope said. \"Could we have a deal later this week? Maybe.\" **********A spokesman for Time Warner declined to comment on the negotiations. But an executive at Warner Music cautioned that the talks would not necessarily result in Time Warner severing its ties. **********The executive, who asked not to be identified, noted that Interscope has been a profitable investment for Time Warner. It is one of the fastest-growing labels in the music industry. And though it is best known for hard-edged gangsta rappers like Snoop Doggy Dogg and Tupac Shakur, it also has mainstream performers like the crooner Tom Jones. **********Still, Time Warner endured weeks of criticism for its association with Interscope from Republican politicians like Senator Bob Dole and William J. Bennett, a former Education Secretary in the Reagan Administration. And the company seemed headed for another showdown with Interscope later this month over a new album by one of its acts, Tha Dogg Pound. **********Tha Dogg Pound has not yet delivered the album, which is called Dogg Food. But based on comments a band member made in a recent article in The Los Angeles Times, executives at Interscope said the album could provoke further criticism from Mr. Bennett and others, including C. DeLores Tucker, the chairwoman of the National Political Congress of Black Women. **********Mr. Fuchs was traveling from Los Angeles to New York last night and could not be reached for comment. Executives said he has conducted his negotiations with Ted Field, the co-head of Interscope. Mr. Field, who is an investor, owns the remaining 50 percent of the label with Jimmy Iovine, a record executive who manages the label on a daily basis. **********Executives familiar with Warner Music said the two companies were simply too far apart in their attitudes toward provocative music. Executives at Interscope said they were obligated to distribute albums like Dogg Food, while those at Time Warner contend the company should have a right to veto material it deemed unsuitable. **********In response to the outcry over gangsta rap, Mr. Fuchs had said he would work with other record companies to develop more stringent standards for labeling music with violent or sexually explicit lyrics. The Recording Industry Association of America, which has been coordinating the industry discussions, said it would deliver recommendations by the end of the summer. **********Mr. Fuchs, who became the chairman of Warner Music in May after a protracted period of turmoil, has moved rapidly to consolidate his control over the division. In June, he dismissed Doug Morris, the chief executive of Warner's domestic record labels. **********Mr. Morris was a strong backer of Time Warner's involvement in gangsta rap, and he pushed Time Warner's investment in Interscope. Mr. Fuchs had accused Mr. Morris of leading a campaign to destabilize Warner Music while it was facing political pressure over rap lyrics. **********Mr. Morris, who recently started a record label backed by MCA, which is owned by the Seagram Company, is suing Time Warner for $50 million, contending breach of contract. **********Last week, Mr. Fuchs dismissed Melvyn R. Lewinter, the president of Warner U.S. and Mr. Morris's former deputy. And executives familiar with the division said Mr. Fuchs was negotiating to settle the contract of another key Morris ally, Ina Meibach, a senior vice president of Warner Music. **********Mr. Fuchs was also negotiating the departure of Danny Goldberg as chairman of Warner Brothers Records, the group's flagship label, according to these executives. Mr. Goldberg was allied with Mr. Morris and was an even more vocal defender of gangsta rap. **********Executives familiar with the talks said Mr. Fuchs wanted Mr. Goldberg out of his job by Labor Day. Mr. Goldberg is in the first year of a five-year contract valued at $20 million. Time Warner had offered Mr. Goldberg $5 million to settle his contract, according to an executive, but lawyers for Mr. Goldberg have been seeking twice that. **********A spokesman for Time Warner declined to comment and Mr. Goldberg did not return a telephone message seeking comment."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/11/business/credit-markets-treasury-securities-prices-retreat-from-recent-highs.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Hurtado", "pub_date": "1995-05-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 694, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Treasury Securities Prices Retreat From Recent Highs", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; Treasury Securities Prices Retreat From Recent Highs", "body_text": " **********Prices of Treasury securities retreated yesterday, but not before testing recent highs. **********Despite the setback, traders and analysts said bonds were still capable of going higher. The market, they said, was weighed down yesterday by a poor response to an auction of 10-year notes and by a Federal Reserve survey of business activity that was not as weak as had been hoped. Market participants were also hesitant to buy ahead of reports on producer prices today and consumer prices tomorrow, they said. **********The price of the 30-year bond fell 22/32, to 107 26/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 7 percent, from 6.94 percent on Tuesday. Still, the yield is at its lowest point in more than a year. **********Yesterday's auction of new 10-year notes \"was one of the worst auctions in 10-year note history,\" said Theodore Ake, government trading manager at Kemper Securities Inc. in Chicago. **********The average yield at the auction was 6.60 percent, down from 7.54 percent in February and the lowest since Feb. 9, 1994, when the yield was 5.92 percent. **********But Mr. Ake cautioned against reading too much into the poor institutional and retail demand for the notes, noting that many dealers did not have customers lined up ahead of the auction. **********\"Prices have changed so rapidly over the past several days; few had bothered to book, or line up, customers for the 10-year auction,\" he said. **********\"The dealers have been fighting this market,\" Mr. Ake added. \"The last thing they want to do is load up the boat and buy a bunch of securities ahead of important numbers,\" he said, referring to the producer prices and consumer prices data as well as today's report on April retail sales. **********Some traders were also concerned that prices might have peaked, a view that was reinforced by a report that showed some pickup amid an otherwise sluggish economy. The Federal Reserve's quarterly survey of regional business activity, known as the beige book, largely confirmed a widespread slowdown although it did find some gains in the Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City and Minneapolis areas. **********Recent data showing that the economy is slowing at a pace that can stifle inflation, which erodes the value of bonds, has driven a powerful rally in the market. On Tuesday, rates fell below 7 percent for the first time in 14 months, and some traders and analysts expect the rally to resume soon. **********\"I don't think we have broken the market's bullish psychology today,\" Mr. Ake of Kemper Securities said. \"There is still a positive spin on the data, so the funademental factors are still in play. **********Some fund managers also noted that the bond rally was also feeding itself as declining interest rates prompted managers of portfolios with mortgage-backed bonds to buy long-term government debt. As a result of lower rates, more homeowners are expected to refinance their mortgages, which means there will be an increase in the number of redemptions of mortgages backing bonds. To offset the redemptions, the portfolio managers are buying Treasury bonds to maintain their presence in long maturities until the mortgage market settles down. **********The market turns its attention today to the April Producer Price Index, which is exepcted to show a rise of three-tenths of 1 percent and a rise of two-tenths of 1 percent in its core rate, which excludes food and energy, according to Kathleen Stephansen, senior economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. **********Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new 10-year notes: **********(000 omitted in dollar figures) Average Price . . . 99.219  Average Yield . . . 6.608%  Low Price . . . 98.702  High Yield . . . 6.680%  High Price . . . 99.449  Low Yield . . . 6.576%  Accepted at low price . . . 92%  Total applied for . . . $20,931,252  Accepted . . . $12,503,227  Noncompetitive . . . $368,000  Interest set at . . . 6 1/2%  The 10-year notes mature on May 15, 2005."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/14/business/when-the-pen-is-truly-mighty.html": {"writer_name": "Sabra Chartrand", "pub_date": "1995-07-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1307, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "When the Pen Is Truly Mighty", "print_headline": "When the Pen Is Truly Mighty", "body_text": " **********Cal Ripken Jr., less than two months from breaking Lou Gehrig's streak of 2,130 consecutive games, is famous for his endurance on the baseball field. For a less celebrated example of his stamina, consider the more than 10,000 autographs he will sign this year. **********The vast majority will not be the old-fashioned face-to-face kind. Rather, Ripken signs balls by the boxload, hundreds at a time, in his hotel room or at home, to be sold at a big profit. A trained observer from the merchandising company makes sure there is a comfortable chair or practical table. He lays out the proper pen. Then, as with all athletes, he hovers, quickly checking every signature to insure that the autograph is in the \"sweet spot\" (where the stitching arcs together), that the ink is clear and even and that it dries properly. **********For each of his autographs Ripken will be paid about $20 (about $7,200 an hour, assuming each takes 10 seconds), much of which he contributes to charity. And he's not the only one to profit. By the time a Ripken fan orders the souvenir out of, say, an upscale catalogue, the $6.50 baseball will sell for as much as $80. **********Ten years ago, mass-autographed merchandise was a rarity. Today, these balls, helmets, jerseys and athletic shoes are a $500 million industry, according to at least two estimates, sold by home-shopping television channels, catalogue companies, sports mail-order houses, sports-memorabilia dealers who sell at trade shows, and independent hobby stores. **********\"Manufactured memorabilia\" is what Joshua Leland Evans, a New York dealer in sports antiques and artifacts, calls autographed paraphernalia \"created for the sole purpose of being sold.\" **********Among the athletes with the biggest business in autographed merchandise are Mickey Mantle, who was reportedly paid $2.75 million to autograph 20,000 baseballs and make personal appearances in 1992. That same year, the baseball star Reggie Jackson earned $1 million for 30,000 autographs and 20 appearances, the basketball star Magic Johnson got $1 million for 12,000 autographs, and the hockey star Wayne Gretzky was paid $500,000 for 12,000 signatures. **********Their signing sessions are, well, efficient. Nolan Ryan, who in his last few years of pitching made more than $1 million from signings, likes to conduct business on a speaker phone while he signs. The football legend Joe Montana once autographed 2,000 pieces of football gear arrayed on 10 tables in a banquet hall, scooting along in a rolling chair and barely touching the equipment. It still took all day. Shaquille O'Neal, the basketball star who earns more than $1 million a year from signings, often signs in the wee hours while watching music videos. **********Many of the deals are brokered by companies like the Score Board Inc. of Cherry Hill, N.J. The merchandiser has 350 athletes under contract, including baseball stars like Ripken, Ken Griffey Jr. and Barry Bonds; football greats like Troy Aikman and Steve Young, and basketball standouts like O'Neal, Patrick Ewing and Hakeem Olajuwon. **********\"We cut contracts with a minimum number of autographs and an option to keep going\" if the merchandise sells well, said Ken Goldin, who founded Score Board with his father in 1988. As an example, he said, a player might get $100,000 for 10,000 autographs ($10 each), and $20,000 for each appearance on a television shopping show or in a shopping mall. **********Once signed, the merchandise is prepared for sale. Take Ripken's autographed ball, which is mounted on a wood stand or in a Plexiglas case. A \"certificate of authenticity\" is added. Then the ensemble is sold to a retailer -- most often a television shopping outlet like QVC and Home Shopping Network. Most of the merchandising deals call for athletes to appear on television or at stores to help sell what they signed. **********The merchandise -- baseballs are the most popular -- is finally sold to people \"who can't afford $10,000 for a mint-condition Babe Ruth baseball, but want something,\" Mr. Evans, the dealer, said. **********For the merchandisers and retailers in on the action, the potential profits are significant. **********A merchandiser that typically pays $20 to a player for a signature and $10 for licensing fees, the ball and other supplies can then sell the ball to a retailer for about $45, making a $15 profit. The retailer can then sell the ball for as much as $80 on television, through an upscale catalogue like Sharper Image or Hammacher Schlemmer, or through a store. **********The markup to $80 includes the catalogue company's overhead, of course, but that still leaves room for plenty of profit all around. **********But for the buyer who might regard such a purchase as a good investment in a collectible that appreciates over time, the potential for profit is much smaller. In the long run, mass-autographed collectibles will probably not command the price that the genuine article will fetch. Dealers like Mr. Evans say they can distinguish between the two because mass-autographed balls are so uniform -- the same pristine ball and the same signature size and placement. **********\"The stuff that's created to be worth something from the beginning is the stuff that will not retain its value,\" Mr. Evans said. \"The stuff that's free is the best deal and ultimately the most coveted. The cardboard sign in a shoe store advertising Shaquille O'Neal wearing Reeboks will be the thing to keep, not the basketball he signed to sell for $300.\" **********Indeed, Mr. Evans divides sports collectibles into two groups. The first he calls \"vintage\" memorabilia. That is anything genuinely used by an athlete or a team, like equipment or uniforms, or anything used in connection with a sport, like advertising, stadium signs, old souvenirs, ticket stubs or sports jewelry. It also includes athletes' autographs snagged free by fans on photos, programs or gear. A decade ago, vintage items made up about 1 percent of the market for sports memorabilia, he said; the rest was sports cards, like baseball cards. Today it has grown to about 10 percent. **********The second group Mr. Evans calls \"created\" memorabilia -- the mass-autographed items -- which accounts for about 15 percent of the sports-memorabilia market. **********Sometimes, that second kind of merchandise can be advertised as more valuable than it really is. For example, in 1993, the baseball star Johnny Bench paid a $5,000 fine to the New York Department of Consumer Affairs for saying on a television shopping show that though baseballs signed by him were worth $129, he was selling them for a mere $50. It turned out that dealers valued his autograph at around $35. **********Counterfeit memorabilia is a continuing problem as well. New York recently passed a law requiring dealers to issue a written certificate of authenticity with each autograph. That certificate would give collectors some proof that the dealer was promising them the real thing should a question of authenticity arise. **********Other athletes and their agents have been investigated for not paying taxes on the cash they were paid for signing autographs at sports and baseball card conventions. **********On the other hand, many players and teams are looking beyond their own personal benefit. Realizing the value of their autographs on merchandise, some are auctioning their own memorabilia to raise money for charity."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/01/business/international-briefs-coles-myer-ge-pact.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-08-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 87, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "International Briefs; Coles Myer-G.E.

It offered to pay $250 million for a 50 percent stake in a new company that would jointly own the mortgage along with the existing shareholders of the current mortgage holder, Rockefeller Center Properties Inc. **********The two offers signaled the start of what may become a battle royal for control of Rockefeller Center, which until Wednesday seemed a cherished but cumbersome pile of bricks and mortar mired in a tepid real estate market. Its owners have argued that its value is far less than the $1.3 billion mortgage implies, but several potential buyers have expressed an interest in the property since its owners filed for bankruptcy protection in May. **********The Tishman Speyer deal takes a two-part approach to gaining control of the property. As head of an investor group that is likely to include the Crown family of Chicago, Tishman Speyer would buy a substantial stake in one of the partnerships that owns substantially all of Rockefeller Center, in essence becoming its partner. And it would pay $975 million to Rockefeller Center Properties Inc. to buy the mortgage and give the trust's shareholders a 21 percent stake in a new company that would be set up to hold the mortgage. **********The deal would be part of a plan to bring the two partnerships that own Rockefeller Center out of bankruptcy protection. **********In Federal bankruptcy court yesterday, where news of the Tishman Speyer proposal emerged, lawyers for the partnerships said they planned to file a reorganization plan by Sept. 12, when their exclusive right to propose a plan is scheduled to expire. **********\"We're coming in to acquire a large interest in the real estate as well as a large interest in the mortgage,\" said Jerry I. Speyer, president of Tishman Speyer Properties Inc., the general partner of Tishman Speyer Properties L.P. \"We're bringing with us, too, the capital with which to carry this property and do the things that have to be done to maintain it as a world-class property.\" **********Tishman Speyer has yet to get binding commitments for financing from other investors, but Mr. Speyer said he was confident that financing would be in place by Sept. 12. He declined to identify other potential investors, but noted that the Crown family had invested in many of Tishman Speyer's American partnerships. **********Stephanie Leggett-Young, spokeswoman for the real estate trust, said the trust's board would review the Tishman Speyer proposal, but added, \"We are moving forward toward a definitive agreement with the Zell investment group.\" **********Mr. Zell, head of Equity Group Investments Inc., said he did not consider the competing offer a threat to his proposal. \"I think the transaction we have entered into is a superior transaction for the shareholders because they will have a better opportunity to share in the upside of their investment,\" he said. **********Mr. Zell's offer threw a lifeline to Rockefeller Center Properties Inc., which has received no payments on the mortgage since the center's owners filed for bankruptcy protection in May. The mortgage is the trust's only source of income, and as a result it is facing its own financial difficulties. **********But Tishman Speyer's alliance with the owners of the property may give it a leg up, analysts said. The owner has one significant advantage, which is that it has the exclusive right to offer a plan of reorganization at least until Sept. 12. **********\"There may be a little more leverage in being on the owner's side,\" said Arnold Kastenbaum, an analyst at M. J. Whitman Inc., an investment firm that specializes in distressed companies. **********Mr. Speyer declined to say how much Tishman Speyer would pay the Rockefeller Group Inc. for a \"substantial\" stake in Rockefeller Center Properties, one of the partnerships that owns Rockefeller Center. The Rockefeller Group Inc., which is owned 80 percent by the Mitsubishi Estate Company and 20 percent by the Rockefeller family trusts, owns both of the bankrupt partnerships. **********Mitsubishi Estate and the Rockefeller family trusts, whose unwillingness to continue covering cash shortages at the property threw the partnerships into bankruptcy protection, would retain a small stake in Rockefeller Center Properties. **********Tishman Speyer values the rest of the deal at $1.235 billion -- consisting of $975 million to buy the mortgage from the real estate trust, a 21 percent stake for the trust's shareholders in the new mortgage holder, and cash that Rockefeller Center Properties can use to pay for operations of the center after bankruptcy. **********But Tishman Speyer refused to place a value on the equity stake it is offering the trust's shareholders or to specify the amount of cash available for financing operations. **********Its unwillingness to lay out those numbers raised questions among some of the trust's big shareholders and creditors, who said the shareholders might get less than current market value for their holdings under the Tishman Speyer proposal. **********Mr. Kastenbaum at M. J. Whitman estimated that under the proposed deal, shareholders would receive $7.38 a share in cash and new equity on a fully diluted basis for each share of Rockefeller Center Properties Inc. they now hold. Yesterday, the shares closed at $7.625. **********Shareholders in the trust would not get a stake in the property itself, meaning that they could not participate in any appreciation in its value, a chance they have under the current terms of the mortgage and would have if the Zell investment group got control of the property through foreclosure. Many real estate experts estimate that Rockefeller Center would be far more more valuable than $1.3 billion if it were broken up and sold in pieces. **********Nonetheless, Mr. Speyer contended that his deal was the best one for the trust's shareholders. \"They're getting cash sans any risk, which is significant,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/22/business/us-widening-inquiry-into-microsoft-s-on-line-plans.html": {"writer_name": "Steve Lohr", "pub_date": "1995-06-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 570, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Widening Inquiry Into Microsoft's On-Line Plans", "print_headline": "U.S. Widening Inquiry Into Microsoft's On-Line Plans", "body_text": " **********The Justice Department has broadened its investigation of the Microsoft Corporation's plans for its new on-line network, issuing subpoenas this week to publishers, broadcasters and others who have signed up to be on it. **********The requests for documents from the information suppliers of the on-line service, Microsoft Network, signal a second step in the investigation. Two weeks ago, the Justice Department issued civil investigative demands -- the equivalent of subpoenas -- to Microsoft's rivals in the on-line business, including America Online Inc., H & R Block's Compuserve and Prodigy Services, the joint venture by I.B.M. and Sears, Roebuck & Company. **********In the new round of requests, the information suppliers for Microsoft Network are being asked for any documents received after July 1993, written by either suppliers or by Microsoft, that relate to estimates of how many people will sign up for Microsoft Network. **********Microsoft intends to place the access software for its on-line service on the company's new operating system, Windows 95, which is scheduled to go on sale in August. The Justice Department is looking into whether this practice, called bundling, gives Microsoft an unfair advantage over rivals in the small but fast-growing market for on-line services. **********The Justice Department seems to seek documents that might show Microsoft plans to use its dominance of the operating-system market -- roughly 85 percent of personal computers run its software -- to dominate the on-line business as well. **********The civilian investigative demand, which one recipient company made available to The New York Times, states that \"because of the urgency of this investigation, the C.I.D. sets a return date for this information of Friday, June 23.\" That is an extremely short timetable to respond to such a request, lawyers said. **********Among other things, the Justice Department demand seeks estimates of how many people will sign up for Microsoft Network for each year from 1995 through 1998 and its expected impact on rival on-line services. **********The on-line business is the third Government investigation of Microsoft. Last year, the company reached a consent agreement with the Government, after conceding to make some changes in how it licenses its software. Last month, Microsoft abandoned an acquisition of Intuit Inc., the leading producer of personal-finance software, after a Justice Department challenge. **********But some antitrust experts suggest the Government may well be reluctant to bring another antitrust case against Microsoft, unless it uncovers quite damaging material. **********\"The Justice Department will have a hard time proving that Microsoft is abusing its dominant power in an area in which it doesn't even have a business yet,\" said Charles F. Rule, a partner at Covington & Burling in Washington. **********Still, the company is moving into the on-line business with a formidable head of steam. It has already signed 150 American and 75 foreign companies to supply content for Microsoft Network. **********The main reason that the Justice Department is trying to gather industry data is to determine whether Microsoft will bring new competition to the on-line field or devastate it. The country's largest on-line service is America Online with an estimated 2.2 million subscribers. **********Industry analysts estimate that Windows 95 may sell 30 million copies in its first four months. Microsoft's critics argue that free distribution of its access software on the Microsoft operating system is a huge and unfair advantage."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/24/business/seeking-joy-and-crowds-in-mudville-inc.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Sandomir", "pub_date": "1995-04-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1473, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Seeking Joy (and Crowds) in Mudville Inc.", "print_headline": "Seeking Joy (and Crowds) in Mudville Inc.", "body_text": " **********After an eight-month absence, major league baseball returns this week, hoping all is forgiven. But just in case it isn't, the 28 teams are offering mea culpas, cut-rate tickets, free yearbooks, snappy slogans, car giveaways and European vacations. **********All this largesse -- a virtual crazy-quilt of promotion -- is intended to win back disgruntled fans and revive ticket sales that have been hammered by the 234-day players' strike, the longest in sports labor history. **********\"I don't think we can do enough,\" said Wayne Long, the vice president for marketing of the Atlanta Braves. **********However baseball reintroduces itself to a wary public, the goal is to increase interest in a season that officially begins tomorrow night when the Los Angeles Dodgers play the Florida Marlins in Miami. On Wednesday there will be a full slate of games, but in contrast to previous seasons, a good number of them will not be sold out. In fact, only the five teams with new ball parks -- Cleveland, Denver, Toronto, Baltimore and Texas -- have been successful in dealing with strike-induced apathy. **********The players' strike virtually halted ticket sales, which usually begin during the winter. Then, when games played by replacements appeared increasingly possible, teams sold cut-rate tickets that went widely unsold. The replacements were sent packing in early April when the players called off their strike, but with barely three weeks to crank up sales, the teams are struggling at the box office. **********Stan Caputo, who bought discount Mets' tickets at Shea Stadium last week, said: \"I don't think I'll go to as many games this year. I gave up my Sunday ticket plan here, but I kept my Yankees' plan.\" **********Mark Bingham, the Mets' vice president of marketing, said: \"It's still too early to say how far off we are in single-ticket sales, but our season-ticket sales are off 10 to 15 percent. We have to get beyond the negatives of the last eight months. People are upset with the sport.\" **********David Sussman, the Yankees' general counsel, said the team's sales perked up with the acquisition of the reliever John Wetteland from the Montreal Expos, and increased a bit more with a cut-rate offer announced Wednesday. **********But thus far, the strike-shortened 144-game season has presented a far-from-normal sales environment in the Bronx. \"We're not expecting a sellout for opening day,\" a feat that the Yankees did achieve last year, Mr. Sussman said. **********The news is no better in San Francisco, where Giant ticket sales are off 30 percent, said Pat Gallagher, a senior vice president. And in Kansas City, the Royals expect no more than 30,000 fans for opening day, nearly 9,000 less than last year. \"Giving up key players like David Cone has turned people off,\" said Steve Sink, a team spokesman. **********One remedy for all this is to find renewed common ground with the fans. And one way to do it is to make gestures that carry an undertone of contrition. **********The Mets have bought full-page newspaper ads with a cartoon fan saying, \"I missed you guys,\" to which the team replies: \"We missed you, too.\" **********The Yankees are apologetic enough to offer 4,500 free bleacher seats for each game during the first week of May. The stubs for those games can be used to buy one ticket and get a second free for any other game during the season. **********The Mets have a more expansive program: all tickets for the April 29 and April 30 games against the St. Louis Cardinals will cost $1. Tickets previously sold at full price for those games can be redeemed for refunds. And throughout May, all food and drink -- except beer -- will be sold at half price. Finally, ticket stubs in May can be redeemed for free reserved seats for any future game, subject to availability. **********The Pittsburgh Pirates are offering half-price tickets for all games through May 11, with 25 percent discounts on parking and concessions. Dodger Stadium opening-day tickets cost the same as they did in 1958 -- $1.50 and $3.50 -- while during the season, Dodgers fans will be eligible to win cars and European trips. **********The Montreal Expos will hold an open practice at Olympic Stadium on May 1 with no charge for admission, then charge half price for general admission to the games on May 6 and 7. The California Angels' opening-day tickets will cost $1, and season-ticket holders will get in free. In Kansas City, there will be 5,000 free seats for each of the first four home games, and free hot dogs and sodas as well. In Milwaukee, where the owner, Bud Selig, is the acting commissioner of baseball, 60 young Brewers fans will line up opposite the players on opening day and receive autographed baseballs from them. **********In Philadelphia, games through May 21 are discounted $3, to $5. \"Even if we lose money on that, we hope it shows people we're thinking of them,\" said Dave Montgomery, the Phillies' executive vice president. **********The Phillies have to hope so. Their season-ticket sales are down to 18,000, from 21,000 last year. Dennis Mannion, the Phillies' vice president of marketing, said: \"At this time last year we were selling 100,000 tickets a week. Now it's 25,000.\" **********The same lament is heard on the other end of Pennsylvania. Last year, with the All-Star Game to serve as a marketing lure, the Pirates saw season-ticket sales rise to 13,000. Now they're down 30 percent and the team is 18,000 seats short of an opening-day sellout. **********\"We're the epitome of what's wrong with baseball,\" said Steve Greenberg, the Pirates' chief marketer. \"We had the best team in baseball from 1990 to 1992, and then we were ripped apart by our financial problems. Now fans see the strike is settled, but there's no agreement. They thought a new collective bargaining agreement would fix our problems. That hasn't happened.\" **********Even a successful team like the Atlanta Braves has seen slow times: fans have renewed only 85 percent of last year's season-ticket sales. **********\"Like any personal relationship, ours with the fans has to be resolved before the love affair can continue,\" said Mr. Long, the team's marking director. **********Still, the suffering isn't universal. In Denver, for instance, season-ticket sales are considered disappointing because they are at 32,800 for brand-new Coors Field, not the 35,000 they were last season at Mile High Stadium. **********\"People have only had baseball for two years and then an eight-month strike,\" said Mike Swanson, a Colorado Rockies spokesman, who sounded low that the team might not sell all 3.6 million seats available during the 72-game season. **********\"Maybe 3.4 million, 3.5 million,\" Mr. Swanson said. **********Like the Rockies, the Baltimore Orioles are not planning any discount ticket promotions for popular Camden Yards, which has essentially been filled to capacity since it opened in 1992. \"Of 3.3 million tickets available, we have commitments for 2.87 million,\" said Joe Foss, the Orioles' vice chairman. Season-ticket sales of 27,500 are \"slightly off,\" but we don't need any specific ticket program to stimulate sales,\" he said. **********But for every Camden Yards, there are two or three Shea Stadiums. And out in Flushing, Queens, last week, fans were taking the Mets up on their offer. \"I was not ready to pay full price for the tickets,\" said Glenn Ackerman of Queens, who was clutching a stack of $1 tickets. \"But for a dollar, it can't be beat. If not for that, I would not be here.\" **********Mark Bingham, the Mets' marketing director, said various price-cutting plans were suggested before the team settled on the \"Baseball for a Buck\" promotion. \"To go to $3 or $4 wouldn't be substantive enough, and we didn't think free made sense,\" he said, \"but at $1 we felt people would use them.\" **********Major League Baseball has no director of marketing -- despite the apparent need for one -- and there is no guarantee that all the clubs will run the \"Welcome to the Show\" commercials on local baseball telecasts. In fact, announcement of the marketing campaign came almost as an afterthought: no news conference, no fanfare, no conference call, just a one-page news release. **********In effect, the teams, and the players, have been left to their own devices in wooing back a discontented public. Which means cheap seats and free food and, in the home of the Padres, the return of the San Diego Chicken. **********\"We're redoubling what we've done in the past,\" said Barry Stockhamer, the Dodgers' vice president of marketing. \"This has been our wake-up call.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/05/business/amylin-plans-to-sell-stock-to-public.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-09-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 154, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Amylin Plans to Sell Stock to Public", "print_headline": "Amylin Plans to Sell Stock to Public", "body_text": " **********Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc. has filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to sell 2.5 million shares to the public and about 1.27 million shares to Johnson & Johnson. **********Amylin, a biotechnology company based here, said on Friday that the proceeds from the sales would be used to finance the last of three human tests of the company's diabetes product, pramlintide. **********After the sale, Amylin will have about 28 million shares outstanding. **********On June 21, Amylin said that Johnson & Johnson had made an equity investment of about $5 million and said it was committed to buying an additional $10 million to develop pramlintide.

Recently, Wilshire Associates Inc. in Santa Monica, Calif., published a study for institutional investors showing that over the past 21 years the very smallest of 2,500 United States stocks it tracks returned an average of 17 percent a year, while the very largest stocks in this universe returned an average of 11.5 percent a year. (The stocks are ranked in size based on market capitalization, which is the price of the stock multiplied by the number of shares outstanding.) **********But now some researchers and money managers are questioning this conventional wisdom. The reason: it costs a lot of money to buy and sell small stocks, and those costs can wipe out small stocks' extra gains versus large stocks. **********Small stocks \"are expensive to trade, and when you look at the return differential, this starts to eat up a lot of it,\" said Donald B. Keim, a professor of finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. **********Mr. Keim and Ananth Madhavan of the University of Southern California have analyzed $85 billion of trades by 21 professional investors, like mutual funds, between January 1991 and March 1993. **********They looked not just at the commissions these investors paid, but also at what is called market impact. Not surprisingly, trying to buy shares can drive their prices up, while trying to sell them can drive the prices down. The bigger the amount you want to buy or sell and the faster you try to do it, the bigger the market impact. **********The professors found that for the very largest trades, buying a large-cap stock costs about 0.16 percent of the total an investor spends, including commissions. But for smaller stocks that trade on the New York Stock Exchange and the American Stock Exchange, the same size trade would cost 2.35 percent. And on Nasdaq, that trade would cost 3.34 percent. **********For the smallest purchases, the effect was far less pronounced; big stocks cost 0.31 percent while small stocks cost 0.39 percent on the exchanges. On Nasdaq, where the majority of the tiny stocks trade, small trades in small stocks remain very expensive, at 1.75 percent. **********Similar results come from the Plexus Group, which tracks trading costs for institutional investors (see chart). **********\"What really makes a difference is just that there are fewer people trading\" in small stocks, said Wayne H. Wagner, a partner at Plexus in Santa Monica, Calif. \"At any point in time, it's hard to find the other side of a trade, so you usually need a dealer.\" And dealers want to get paid for the risks of holding these stocks while they are looking for someone else to buy or sell them. **********Of course, most amateur investors are not trading huge amounts of stocks and moving markets. But that does not mean that their costs are lower than those of institutions, said Theodore R. Aronson, a partner at the money-management firm Aronson & Fogler in Philadelphia. \"What rears its ugly head is higher commissions\" that individual investors pay, he said. So the total costs end up being very similar to those incurred by institutions. **********And many individual investors use mutual funds, which in effect turns amateurs into professionals, at least in terms of costs. **********Savvy investors try to keep trading costs down by avoiding the stocks that are hardest -- and most expensive -- to buy, and by trading carefully in small amounts. **********But there is a risk that by sticking with the stocks that trade the most, you lose the benefits of investing in little stocks, concedes George U. Sauter, who manages index funds for the Vanguard Group. **********Another cost-cutting strategy, which amateur investors can easily use, is to trade as little as possible. Unfortunately, most mutual funds that invest in small stocks tend to do a great deal of trading. And buying and holding small stocks can be risky unless you own a very large variety, since little stocks are more likely than big ones to plunge all the way to zero. **********Because investors need to be compensated for that risk, many analysts still assert, small stocks do return more than their larger counterparts. But once you adjust for risk, any advantage small stocks have may indeed be devoured by higher trading costs, said Derek Sasveld, a consultant with Ibbotson Associates in Chicago. **********\"As an asset class, they are still pretty attractive,\" he said. \"You are just not getting anything extra.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/08/business/into-the-woods-in-asia-myanmar-north-korea-no-sweat-for-hong-kong-firm.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Gargan", "pub_date": "1995-04-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1518, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Into the Woods in Asia; Myanmar?

And the country was overwhelmed by poverty. **********\"Clearly, their economy was a catastrophe,\" Mr. Pike recalled. \"There really was no economic life there.\" **********It was, in short, the sort of place that Peregrine found appealing. For North Korea had one huge asset: opportunity. \"They clearly gave the indication that things were going to change,\" he said. \"I think they're expecting us to be able to bring in capital, companies and clients.\" **********Since that trip, Peregrine has formed a joint banking venture with the Daeson Group, which is controlled by the North Korean Government. And while Peregrine remains the only outside investment firm active in the country, it is also doing business with other countries where many investment banks may tread warily, or not at all. **********It was the first investment bank to move into Myanmar, formerly Burma, ruled by a military dictatorship. It was one of the first to go to Communist-ruled Vietnam. And, when other companies and banks stepped back after the Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing in June 1989, the newly created Peregrine only accelerated its activities in China. **********Such willingness to take gambles, combined with a talent for making friends in high places, has helped Peregrine grow from a start-up with $38 million to spend into a regional powerhouse in a little more than six years. But its willingness to strike alliances with some of Asia's more unsavory regimes, and accusations of unethical behavior ranging from market manipulation to plagiarism, have created a serious image problem for the bank. **********Its ties with the Myanmar Government, which crushed civil unrest in the late 1980's and continues to imprison the leader of the country's democratic opposition, have soured some of its investors, for example. The Quantum Fund N.V., run by the American financier George Soros, recently divested itself of 10,000 shares of Peregrine stock. **********While other Western companies have footholds in China and Vietnam, some human-rights advocates dislike what they regard as Peregrine's unapologetic embrace of dictatorial regimes. \"We're strongly opposed to any business going into a country like North Korea or Burma or even China unless it is willing to press for human rights and a greater respect for the rule of law,\" said Sidney Jones, executive director of Human Rights Watch/Asia in New York. **********The Economist magazine noted recently that while other banks did business in China, \"the difference is that Peregrine does not even affect to hold its nose.\" **********None of this fazes Philip L. Tose, Peregrine's chairman and co-founder, who contends that a dismal political or human-rights record of a regime is no reason to avoid a lucrative market. \"Yes, there had been a very unfortunate incident which had a lot of coverage, shocked a lot of people,\" Mr. Tose said of the Tiananmen Square killings. \"But underneath all that, nothing really had changed in terms of the fundamentals that had made people originally want to invest in those areas. **********\"Our view,\" Mr. Tose said, \"and it's a very controversial view, is that countries develop through economic dialogue. Simply introducing political democracy is not necessarily the first step that should be taken. It is better to increase the standard of living of the people, which in turn will lead over time to social change, political change, etc.\" **********Francis Leung Pak To, Peregrine's managing director and Mr. Tose's partner, said the bank had come to the conclusion \"that these events were just a hiccup.\" **********\"We decided we wanted to take advantage of depressed market conditions at the time,\" he said. Peregrine rapidly bought control of two companies which it used to expand its asset base and to raise capital. **********Mr. Tose also brushes aside ethical lapses by his bank. In 1993, the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong reprimanded Peregrine for engaging in \"trading activity which was, or was likely to be, prejudicial to the interests of the investing public\" by buying back shares that it had previously sold in an effort to disguise the real market for those shares. **********\"It happened at a time we were growing very fast and frankly we didn't have the right systems in place of checks and balances,\" Mr. Tose said. \"We have now. I think a recurrence of something like that would be difficult.\" **********But tripping over the line of the permissible did not end there. Earlier this year, Peregrine published a long research report on the economic prospects of Myanmar. The report was intended to promote the group's own access to the military regime and the country's business community; the problem, however, was that the contents of the report were plagiarized from a report on Myanmar written by a smaller Hong Kong securities firm, Kerry Securities. **********Mr. Leung blamed the Myanmar office for the plagiarism, and said the office was not closely supervised. \"That was an example of growing pains,\" he said. **********Whatever its public image, Peregrine has enjoyed a meteoric rise in Asian banking. It was founded in late 1988 by Mr. Tose, who had previously headed a Citicorp venture in Hong Kong, and by Mr. Leung, one of his rising stars there. The two men cobbled together $38 million (United States) from some of Hong Kong's wealthiest business leaders. Though the founders wanted to call their new firm Falcon, they could not obtain rights to the name, Mr. Tose said, so they chose Peregrine, a breed of the same bird of prey. \"We like it because it's an aggressive bird,\" Mr. Tose said. \"It typifies what we are.\" **********Since then, the capital base of Peregrine has soared to $550 million, which would put it at the lower end of the top 20 investment banks in the United States. It had revenue of $3.74 billion last year, up from $233 million in 1989. And while profit fell last year, to $82.5 million from $112 million in 1993, Mr. Tose said the results were not \"nearly as bad as many of the international investment banking houses.\" Peregrine also managed to tighten its grip on the market for initial public offerings in China and Hong Kong, increasing its share to 75 percent from 60 percent in 1993. **********Analysts attribute much of the success of Peregrine to the founders' brilliant choice of investors. They include Li Ka-shing, one of the world's richest men, who made much of his fortune in Hong Kong's property market; Gordon Wu, a property developer, and Larry Yung, head of the Hong Kong branch of the China International Trust and Investment Corporation, the mainland's principal investment bank. **********Peregrine has also built an impressive list of high-level contacts across Asia, where it has opened 25 offices in 14 countries, both its admirers and competitors say. **********Mr. Li, whose vast business empire includes ports in Hong Kong and China, hotels, telecommunications ventures, satellite services and electric power projects, made no bones about the importance of knowing the right people. And in Asia, he said, that usually means having influence with the right families. **********\"If you were working in Europe or America at the turn of the century, your connections were vital,\" Mr. Li said. \"Without them, you were dead. Asia is to a degree at that stage of development today. It's not quite, because everyone has moved on a little bit. But business, industry, government to a degree, are controlled by families just the way they were in the West at the turn of the century.\" **********Mr. Tose said he would like to reduce Peregrine's reliance on China and Hong Kong to half its business from the current 80 percent. As a result, the bank keeps pushing into other parts of Asia. **********Today, for example, it has 250 employees in the three major cities of South Korea and is the only foreign company with a seat on the Seoul stock exchange. In Myanmar, it has opened Peregrine Capital Myanmar Ltd., which among other things has invested in a shrimp-processing plant. **********For some people, sniping at Peregrine for its supposed cozying up to dictatorships smacks of sour grapes. \"The success of Peregrine is a measure of the failure of competitors to take advantage of market conditions,\" said a Hong Kong banker who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \"The market here needed a local investment bank more in tune with their needs, particularly smaller companies that want to come to the market.\" **********A European banker here, who has watched Peregrine's march through Asia with some admiration, said he had one major concern -- that the expansion had gone too fast. \"The jury is well and truly out,\" the banker said. \"Management there is very thin. For a company that size it is surprising that decisions are made by three or four people. Clearly there is a lot of skepticism about whether they can manage a business of that size.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/18/world/hussein-family-dinner-politics-and-guns.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-08-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 402, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hussein Family Dinner: Politics and Guns", "print_headline": "Hussein Family Dinner: Politics and Guns", "body_text": " **********A quarrel at family dinner that led to gunfire was the crisis that led President Saddam Hussein's daughters and their husbands to flee Iraq, according to Saudi newspaper accounts and reports from Iraqi opposition figures. **********The dinner, on Aug. 7, was called to discuss the worsening economic and security situation of Iraq.

The Northeast, in particular, is seen by analysts as ripe for a wave of mergers because the big New York City banks have been preoccupied with recovering from their bad real estate loans and have not been actively buying smaller banks.  [ Page D4. ] **********The merger announced yesterday \"will change the landscape in the Northeast,\" said Milton Berlinsky, an investment banker with Goldman, Sachs & Company who represented First Fidelity. \"The New York banks will wake up and find a major force with $13 billion in market capitalization on their doorstep.\" **********First Union, the nation's ninth-largest banking company, will be acquiring a banking company that has already been rapidly buying other institutions in the New York market. First Union itself has grown tenfold in the last decade through a marathon of 55 acquisitions. And Edward E. Crutchfield, First Union's chairman, said yesterday that he planned to use First Fidelity as a beachhead to make other acquisitions in the Northeast. **********Mr. Crutchfield said there were 888 banks and savings and loan associations with assets of less than $1 billion in the six states in which First Fidelity does business. And there are 83 larger banks. That represents far more potential fish to catch than are left in the South. **********\"The consolidation game is largely over in the South,\" he said. **********For New Jersey, the deal ends the independence of the state's largest bank. But the impact on First Fidelity employees and bank customers will be moderate. Since the two banks have no overlapping operations, there will be no additional branch closing as a result of the deal. And the banks said they would trim expenses by a modest 5 percent, mainly in computer operations and corporate staff areas. **********After the deal, First Union will be the country's sixth-largest bank, with 2,000 branches -- more than any other bank -- in 13 Eastern and Southern states. It will have assets of $124 billion and serve 10.5 million customers. **********The announcement represents the end of a frenzied month of negotiations in which First Fidelity was close to a merger with the Bank of Boston. That deal was abandoned, and the bank sought an offer from First Union under pressure from Banco Santander, the Spanish bank that owns 30 percent of First Fidelity's stock, investment bankers said. **********Santander preferred selling First Fidelity to First Union because that bank would offer a premium above First Fidelity's market price. In the deal announced yesterday, First Union will exchange 1.35 of its shares, worth $64.29, based on Friday's close, for each First Fidelity share. That represents a 32 percent premium over First Fidelity's close last week of $48.75. **********First Fidelity's stock closed up $10.25 yesterday, to $59, on the New York Stock Exchange. First Union's shares declined $1.75, to $45.875. **********Mr. Crutchfield of First Union said that he had been seeking to buy First Fidelity for three years. In banking there are many growing companies that want to buy other banks. Deals occur when bank executives decide it is time to sell. **********Anthony P. Terracciano, First Fidelity's chairman, was said to prefer the deal with the Bank of Boston because he would become chief executive of the combined institution, investment bankers said. Ira Stepanian, Bank of Boston's chairman, would have kept that title for several years, but would give up the chief executive title. **********Under the deal with First Union, Mr. Terracciano, 56, will become president of First Union. Nationsbank, First Union's rival in Charlotte, expressed interest in First Fidelity, investment bankers said, but it offered less money and did not offer a senior management role for Mr. Terracciano. **********This deal represents the third time that the Bank of Boston has been stood up at the altar in a major merger deal. Earlier this year, it had been negotiating a merger with the Fleet Financial Group, when that Providence-based bank decided instead to buy the Shawmut National Corporation in Hartford. And a few years before that, the Bank of Boston was close to a deal with Shawmut. **********A Bank of Boston spokesman said the bank did not comment on merger negotiations. **********At a news conference in Manhattan yesterday, Mr. Terracciano said that First Fidelity had been in negotiation with several banks, but he declined to identify them. **********A spokesman for Banco Santander declined to comment other than to say it held only 2 of the 28 seats on First Fidelity's board and was obligated to vote with management and the majority of the board. People familiar with the transaction said that the Spanish bank could have found other ways to put pressure on the board to go with First Union. When the deal is consummated at the end of this year, Banco Santander will end up owing 11.4 percent of First Union's stock. **********At the news conference, Mr. Terracciano was upbeat over the prospects of the combined banks. He said that First Union offered investments like mutual funds and investment banking for medium-sized companies that could be offered at First Fidelity branches. **********\"We have worked for almost five years in fixing the franchise we had,\" Mr. Terracciano said. \"What we need to get full value from that is a massive infusion of new products.\" **********Analysts do give credit to Mr. Terracciano, a former top executive of the Mellon Bank Corporation and the Chase Manhattan Corporation, for working through the bank's severe loan problems and substantially cutting its costs. They have criticized him, however, for being so focused on cost control that he did not find ways to increase the bank's revenue. **********At First Union, Mr. Terracciano will remain in Newark and run the merged bank's operations in the North, its future acquisitions and its growing investment banking activities. John R. Georgius, 50, who had been First Union's president, becomes its vice chairman looking after banks in the South and various staff functions. These two executives, along with Mr. Crutchfield, will form an office of the chairman. **********For many bank customers who have only recently found their bank purchased by First Fidelity, the deal means getting used to yet another name on their checks and yet a new set of products and policies. First Fidelity has been actively buying banks in the New York suburbs, acquiring among others Union Trust in Connecticut and the People's Westchester Bank in New York. **********First Union is paying a high price for First Fidelity -- 1.92 times its book value -- especially in light of the fact that there are few opportunities to save money from overlapping operations. **********\"What sets this transaction apart from others is its dependence on their needing to get incremental revenue for it to be a good deal for shareholders,\" said Sandra J.

But there was no guarantee they would meet that target because many details must still be worked out, including arrangements for West Bank troop movements, elections, transfers of civil authority and releases of Palestinians from Israeli jails. **********A senior Palestinian official, Faisal al-Husseini, said the signing ceremony would be held in Washington, an echo of the agreement and handshaking at the White House in September 1993 that capped a mutual recognition by Israel and the P.L.O. **********But there was no formal announcement about Washington, and on both sides other officials declined to discuss the location. A Clinton Administration official said that a White House ceremony was possible but that uncertainties remained. **********If the choice is Washington, it adds credibility to the July 25 date, an important issue in negotiations that have seen many lapsed deadlines, including a July 1 target that had become an important symbol. **********In a statement after two hours of talks today in Gaza City, the two sides said that \"understandings have been reached on main aspects of the interim agreement,\" with details to be worked out over the next three weeks. **********\"We have agreed on the principles, but to write it down takes a long time,\" said Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of Israel, who had met in Gaza with Yasir Arafat, the P.L.O. chairman. **********Mr. Arafat said, \"We hope that we have achieved something concrete in our hand so that we can have, very soon, the agreement and the redeployment and after that the elections.\" **********For the last 14 months, under the 1993 accord, the Palestinians have governed themselves in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank district of Jericho, with an understanding that in short order their authority is to be extended throughout the West Bank. By next May, the parties are supposed to move on to negotiate thorny issues like the future of Jerusalem and Jewish settlements in Gaza and the West Bank, with the territories' so-called final status to be resolved by early May 1999. **********Little has happened in short order, however. **********Under the original timetable, for example, Palestinian elections and Israeli troop redeployments in the West Bank were to have taken place a full year ago. But all schedules were knocked out of kilter by complex security problems in the West Bank created by the intertwining of Israeli settlements and Palestinian towns -- concerns that became more vivid than ever for Israelis after a series of Islamic suicide bombings. **********So, while critical details are still unresolved, the agreement in principle reached by Mr. Arafat and Mr. Peres today was an important breakthrough. It reflects, an Israeli official said, a realization that \"we can't go on like this and need to put an end to it.\" **********The Israelis say they are prepared to pull their forces out of all major Palestinian cities in the West Bank except Hebron, a perennially troubled town and the only one in the territories where Arabs and Jews live directly alongside one another. **********On Monday, Mr. Peres said that withdrawals would also take place in most of the hundreds of Arab villages except those along the West Bank border with Israel and on roads to Jerusalem. The Army, he and other officials said, would retain exclusive control over the 125 or so Israeli settlements in the West Bank and on access roads used primarily by the 135,000 settlers there. **********The main point of contention seems to concern villages and open areas lying between the major Palestinian cities and the settlements -- places where Mr. Arafat's desire for territorial control collides with Israel's insistence on tight security measures. **********Although officials on both sides said little, Israeli television reported tonight that these areas would be governed by a patchwork system. Under it, Palestinians would have full civil authority in some places and limited control in others. Some areas may be patrolled jointly by Israeli and Palestinian forces and others only by the Israeli Army. **********No dates were mentioned for the likely start of Israeli withdrawals or Palestinian elections. **********The key, said Uri Savir, a senior Israeli negotiator, is that any transfer of security responsibilities from Israel to the Palestinians will be gradual. Possibly as early as Wednesday, Mr. Savir is to begin fleshing out the details with his counterpart, Ahmed Khoury, with whom he negotiated the original 1993 agreement. **********\"For us it is important that in the first stage we will control the main part of the territory, which will be under exclusive Army control,\" he said. **********Israel Television quoted Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin as saying that the P.L.O. had committed itself to follow through on a longstanding but unfulfilled promise to eliminate clauses of its charter calling for Israel's destruction. If those changes do not occur a few months after Palestinian elections are held, possibly in the fall, Israel will slow its Army redeployments, Mr. Rabin supposedly said. **********In addition, Israel Television reported that the transfer of security responsibility to the Palestinians in villages and open areas would stretch into mid-1997. **********If true, that is a significant point. It means that it would fall to a new Israeli Government to complete the arrangements since Israel must hold elections by November 1996. And the rightist opposition says that if it wins next year, it will not feel obligated to continue Mr. Rabin's policies on this score. **********Mr. Husseini, the Palestinian official, said the first Army withdrawals would take place in and around Jenin, the northernmost city in the West Bank. Other places targeted for full Palestinian control are Nablus, Tulkarm, Qalqilya, Ramallah and Bethlehem. But Mr. Rabin said on Monday that redeployments in Ramallah and Bethlehem, both near Jerusalem, would be gradual, the pace depending on the construction of bypass roads for settlers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/06/world/us-allies-press-russia-for-chechnya-peace-settlement-kohl-cautions-yeltsin.html": {"writer_name": "Craig Whitney", "pub_date": "1995-01-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 305, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. and Allies to Press Russia for Chechnya Peace Settlement; Kohl Cautions Yeltsin", "print_headline": "U.S. and Allies to Press Russia for Chechnya Peace Settlement; Kohl Cautions Yeltsin", "body_text": " **********Under increasing pressure to take a stronger position against the Russian assault on the secessionist region of Chechnya, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany said today that he had told President Boris N.

You didn't buy McDonald's, whose shares have jumped nearly 40 percent since last summer. And you missed out on Micron Technology, whose stock has more than doubled in six months. And now with the market so toppy, finding stocks with \"oomph\" left just got harder. **********There is hope for last-minute shoppers, especially among the neglected stocks of smaller companies. With the exception of technology stocks, these shares have lagged the market as anxious investors have rushed into the arms of their old favorite consumer growth companies. \"People get too enamored with the consumer names of the 1980's,\" said Charles Mayer, a portfolio manager for the Invesco Industrial Income Fund. \"They're the only growth stocks they know.\" **********But there are plenty of other fast-growing companies that deserve recognition. To find them, we asked Claudia Mott, an analyst who tracks small and medium-sized companies for Prudential Securities, to comb a data base of public companies for bargains. The analysis focused on 859 medium-sized companies, those with market values of $750 million to $4 billion, because they offer much of the stability of large companies, their shares usually trade on the New York Stock Exchange and they are often ignored by Wall Street. \"The values really are in the smaller stocks,\" said David Klaskin, president of Oak Ridge Investments, a Chicago money management firm. **********By choosing only companies with consistent profit growth, a cheap price, and safe levels of debt, a final list of 10 potential picks emerged. To get there, companies had to average annual earnings growth of at least 20 percent in each of the last three quarters. Companies with down quarters or slowing earnings in the last nine months were eliminated, along with companies with annual losses during the last three years. **********But because a company's future is more important than its past, the analysis also tried to find company's where the good times would continue to roll. Only companies whose annual earnings are expected by analysts to grow in the double digits during the next few years were included. **********To make sure these stocks had not already run up in price, the list was restricted to underachievers that had not recently visited their 52-week highs. Any stock that was trading at an excessive multiple over current earnings or over its projected growth rate was dismissed. **********FOR example, Solectron, a circuit board maker that fell off the list, trades at about 18 times what analysts think it will earn this year, compared with the 13 times that companies its size average. **********Not that all the companies that made the list are screaming buys. Take International Game Technology. Once a darling of investors, because its earnings per share have risen more than 60 percent three times from one quarter to the next, the company has run into slowing demand for its gaming machines.  First-quarter earnings were down 16 percent, compared with the previous quarter, and Wall Street has punished it: The stock has plummeted from a high of $33.25 to $13.50 recently. \"There's a lot of questions surrounding their earnings,\" said Mr. Klaskin of Oak Ridge. He sold his shares on concerns about the company's prospects. **********That's not to say there aren't other down-and-outers among the list to consider, including EMC of Hopkinton, Mass., a maker of storage devices for large computers. Investors fled because they were afraid that the company, which has only $1.4 billion in sales, would be squashed by the much larger International Business Machines. Insiders have also been selling. **********\"I think they're going to pull through and that there's no evidence that those fears are being materialized,\" said Rodney Linafelter, a portfolio manager for the Berger Funds. And the company has managed to wrest away market share from I.B.M. and has more than 25 percent of the data-storage market, according to Value Line. At its current price of $16.75, the stock is selling at a multiple of 11 -- less than half its expected long-term growth rate of 25 percent. **********There are also plenty of stocks in businesses that Wall Street shuns, whether it is selling women's apparel, like Nordstrom, or making anti-lock braking systems for General Motors and Ford, like Varity. **********Nordstrom, the retailer in Seattle, \"is an out-of-favor stock in an out-of-favor group,\" said Richard Lazarchic, a portfolio manager for the IDS Funds. While consumers seem to be dressing down, some managers say it is only a matter of time before people replace the tired stuff in their closets. People have already bought cars and redecorated their houses.  Profits are already improving and analysts say earnings should grow 14 percent in the coming years. **********And if you think people will continue to feather their nests, there are some other stocks on the list worth noting: Leggett & Platt, which makes the springs for mattresses and upholstered sofas, and Helig-Meyers, a purveyor of furniture and appliances.

What they did not do was make the conceptual leap toward transforming the International Monetary Fund from a rich (and occasionally wise) uncle for the developing world into a global bankruptcy judge for nations in trouble. **********What a pity. **********Jeffrey Sachs, the director of the Harvard Institute for International Development and a sometime consultant to governments from Bolivia to Russia, was among the first to propose the idea. But among the big power leaders only the Canadians were enthusiastic, and all the Group of Seven agreed to do was study the proposition. No surprise there: radical change rarely occurs without a catalyst. But this is one area where the Group of Seven, if it were prepared to move faster, would find that a little advance planning goes a long way toward delivering a big payoff. **********The Mexican debacle was a warning that sovereign borrowers live on a knife edge. For while the Mexican Government lacked the cash to redeem its debts, almost everyone agreed that it was not insolvent. Mexico had plenty of income from export earnings to service the interest on its dollar-denominated debt, but nonetheless lost the confidence of private lenders. **********In the end the Clinton Administration scrounged the $50 billion that Mexico needed to roll over the debt and halt the flight of capital, but it was a near thing. Old-line Democrats in Congress turned their backs on the President, while the new Republican majority took the occasion to reaffirm that politics does not stop at the water's edge. **********This explains the White House's support for the much more modest Halifax plan, which would help take the United States off the hook but not go as far as the bankruptcy approach. That idea is to give the I.M.F. greater authority to act as a lender-of-last-resort. And best of all, from the White House viewpoint, would be if Saudi Arabia, Scandinavia and other deep foreign pockets ponied up the cash for the new operation. But none of them are very enthusiastic, which is one reason, among others, why creating a kind of bankruptcy judge for the global economy could be a much better alternative. **********Consider some basics. Chapter 11 bankruptcy, American-style, accomplishes three things for a corporation lacking the cash to pay its creditors. **********First, the law creates a time-out during which creditors cannot force the debtors to liquidate assets at a fire sale. Second, it allows a bankrupt company to borrow funds on a priority basis to keep the business going. Third, it empowers the judge to impose a settlement when the business is healthy enough to operate but lacks the assets to pay the creditors 100 cents on the dollar. **********Sovereign governments aren't corporations, Mr. Sachs acknowledges, but a distressed government shares many of the problems of a distressed corporation. Suppose the I.M.F. had the authority to suspend a country's obligations to service foreign debt. That would prevent, say, a creditor in New York from seizing the aircraft of its national airline, just as bankruptcy protection prevents a disorderly liquidation of corporate assets. **********By the same token, if the I.M.F. had the authority to put new creditors at the head of the line, it would allow countries to borrow in private capital markets to meet vital needs. That alone would probably have ended Mexico's financial crisis. **********After all, that's essentially what the Clinton Administration did, in an ad hoc fashion. The $50 billion line of credit is collateralized by Mexico's revenues from oil exports -- a claim that effectively supersedes the claims of Mexico's other creditors. **********So why not formalize it? **********Where governments are insolvent in the sense that they cannot realistically be asked to repay all their old debts, the I.M.F. could force creditors to settle. This would prevent the sort of debt gridlock that left much of the third world and its private creditors in limbo for much of the 1980's. **********There are problems, of course. John Makin, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, is skeptical of the bankruptcy approach. \"It would transform the I.M.F. into a legal institution,\" he says. Such a transformation might fit its charter, but that doesn't mean it would be easily accepted by private creditors with political muscle in their home countries. And with the I.M.F. caught between creditors and debtors, he expects it would only be able to force settlements if it also brought along money to \"sweeten the pot.\" **********Mr. Sachs acknowledges the I.M.F. would remain a creature of international politics that could not rule without collective consent. But he is convinced that a formal bankruptcy mechanism would be so superior to informal rescue operations that once in place it would win the needed support. **********Turning the I.M.F. into a bankruptcy court \"would take an act of imagination,\" Mr. Sachs argues. And like most big changes, he suggests, \"it seems impossible until you try it.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/30/business/spending-it-here-s-a-course-in-personal-finance-101-the-hard-way.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Bryce", "pub_date": "1995-04-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1648, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Here's a Course in Personal Finance 101, the Hard Way", "print_headline": "SPENDING IT; Here's a Course in Personal Finance 101, the Hard Way", "body_text": " **********NICOLE WALTERS, a 20-year-old junior at the University of Texas, carries two Visa cards, two Mastercards, two department store credit cards -- and two part-time jobs to dig herself out of debt. **********\"I was buying things here and there and all of a sudden, $4,000 later, those little things added up,\" Ms. Walters said. She recalls buying a $600 car stereo, some clothes and gas for her car, but nothing else major. **********Just a few hours on the university campus here turned up nearly a dozen students with similar tales of woe: a 19-year-old freshman with five cards said he owed $2,200, a 22-year-old senior acknowledged running up $8,000 on eight cards and a 26-year-old senior described $9,000 in bills on eight cards. The spending sprees weren't for school-related essentials, but for personal items and luxuries. For the card holders who graduate with thousands of dollars in student loans, too, managing the debt may amount to a crash course in personal finance. **********Credit counselors in college towns across the country say students with large card debts are increasingly common. \"Five years ago, we weren't seeing anybody still in college with as much debt as we are seeing now,\" said Candace Acevedo of the San Francisco office of the Consumer Credit Counseling Service, a nonprofit group providing financial education and debt advice.  Five percent of the clients in her debt management program are students with at least $5,000 in credit card debt, she said. And the group's other offices in big college towns like Austin, Raleigh, N.C., and Columbia, Mo., report similar figures. **********Although some students reach out to credit counseling agencies for help when their card bills become overwhelming, many resort to the most reliable creditors of all: Mom and Dad. Thus, parents paying for books, tuition and housing may also wind up paying their son's or daughter's Visa and American Express bills. If they don't pick it up before, parents may be tempted to pay off card debt at college graduation so their children can embark on their working lives without a burden. **********\"I think it's the parents who really take the brunt of this,\" said Irene Leech, a credit counselor and assistant professor of consumer studies at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Va. \"Parents want their child to have the best, so they do all they can to help their children deal with these debts.\" **********For a student, a credit card is as readily available as a class syllabus. Card applications are found in bookstores, campus publications and student mailboxes. To attract students, card issuers offer free concerts, plane tickets, T-shirts, even candy. According to Roper College Track, a research division of Roper Starch Worldwide, more than half of the 5.1 million full-time undergraduate students at four-year universities in the United States now have at least one major credit card. Mastercard International estimates that 80 percent of all college students carry a credit card by their senior year. **********In 1994, Americans used more than 350 million major credit cards -- Visa, Discover, Mastercard and American Express -- to purchase more than half a trillion dollars of goods and services. With that much plastic money coursing through the system, why are issuers bothering with relatively poor college students? **********For one, they want to build loyal customers at an early age. A study several years ago by Marketing Week magazine showed that 75 percent of college students keep their first card for 15 years, and 60 percent keep that card for life. Furthermore, college students are not entirely without money. Roper says the average student has an annual income of $4,000. **********But if a student owes $2,000 on a credit card, repaying the debt can take years, especially when interest rates rise. The recent increase in rates caught Kevin LeBlanc by surprise. Mr. LeBlanc, a senior at the University of Texas, has two major credit cards with $500 credit lines, both of which are at their limit. \"I just got a letter that said, 'We are changing your interest rate from 14.9 percent to 18.9 percent' and you can't do anything about it,\" he said. **********Before the rate increase, Mr. LeBlanc said, his minimum payment \"used to pay off a little bit of the balance.\" Now, he said, \"all it does is pay my interest.\" **********Overall delinquency rates on credit cards have been declining since 1989, when nearly 5 percent of card holders were behind in their payments. Last year, the delinquent portion fell to about 3 percent, but it has risen recently. **********Although no statistics are available on late card payments by students, who now account for less than 3 percent of the domestic credit card business, counselors suggest that the group may be having more trouble than other borrowers. \"I think it's a much bigger problem than is being recognized,\" said Allen Clary, a credit counselor in Raleigh, who figures that the average student in his program has $10,000 in card debt. **********If students were falling hopelessly behind on their debts and refusing to pay, card issuers would undoubtedly stop lending to them. James Daly, editor of Credit Card News, a newsletter published in Chicago, says the parental safety net may keep that from happening. As credit risks, college students look no worse than the rest of the population, he said. But he added, \"My impression is that a lot of them are getting help from their parents.\" **********Critics say the card issuers have courted collegians too aggressively. Last year, Representative Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, the Massachusetts Democrat, threatened to introduce legislation that would limit the ability of issuers to provide credit cards to students. Mr. Kennedy also conducted a hearing of the House Banking subcommittee on consumer credit and insurance to hear complaints from students and parents about the industry. **********RUTH E. SUSSWEIN, executive director of the Bankcard Holders of America, a consumer advocacy group based in Salem, Va., testified at the hearing. In a recent interview, she said students \"are being encouraged to put all these things on plastic\" -- things like vacations. **********Rus Maxham, a sophomore engineering student from Dallas, owes $2,200 on his credit cards, mostly because of a skiing trip to Lake Tahoe for spring break. Are credit cards too easy to get? \"Yes,\" Mr. Maxham said. \"A Visa card came in the mail, and I didn't even ask for it. It said, 'Just call this number to activate it.' It's like they're saying, 'Here's some rope, kid. Go hang yourself.' \" **********For several years, Ms. Susswein has been pushing credit card companies to help educate their young clients. The issuers have responded. American Express has distributed 10,000 personal finance education packets to high school teachers across the country. In 1991, Visa developed a personal finance program that is now used in 10,000 high schools, said Susan Murdy, a spokeswoman for Visa. In 1993, Mastercard created a video program on personal finance, which it has distributed for free to 18,000 high schools. **********In general, high schools spend little time teaching students about budgeting and banking. \"I think schools are doing a better job on sex education than they are on financial education,\" said Steve Apesos, a spokesman for Mastercard. \"In a survey we did two years ago of 400 high school students, 96 percent of them said they don't get any personal finance education in school.\" **********Some students have gotten the message, whether from their parents or their teachers, and use their credit cards strictly for convenience, fastidiously paying off the balances every month. **********Larry Sacks, a senior at the University of Texas majoring in history, carries a Visa and a Mastercard but says he stopped short of taking an American Express card. He says he does not overdo the card purchases. \"Who can afford to charge the maximum on them?\" asked Mr. Sacks, who comes from St. Louis. \"I think they are a dangerous thing, so I pay mine off every month.\" **********What's a student to do if he flunks the credit card test the first time? **********Consolidating the bills into student loans at interest rates of 7 to 9 percent may be a less painful way to pay off the cards, most of which charge interest rates of 15 to 20 percent. **********Eva Hensley, director of the credit counseling office in Columbia, considers that preferable to a parental rescue. \"It doesn't teach the students any responsibility if every time they get into a difficult situation they have their parents bail them out,\" she said, noting that 26 percent of the clients of her office are students and that their average card debt is $7,500. **********Ms. Walters, the University of Texas junior, has not hidden her problem from her parents. During the school year, she has been working about 30 hours a week, on weekend days as a sales clerk and on weekend nights as a restaurant hostess. While she is making progress, she plans to \"work a whole lot\" this summer to get her debt firmly under control. She has decided not to get any more cards, even though the applications keep rolling in, and she has cut up the ones she had. **********\"We pay all of her college expenses and insurance for her car, so her only expenses are for clothes and makeup,\" said Nicole's mother, Anita Walters. Although she and her husband, Bill, a sales manager for a large electronics concern, could easily pay off Nicole's bills, she said they had decided against it. \"She has to learn in this day and age that you can't do that,\" Mrs. Walters said. \"Mom and Dad aren't going to be here forever.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/04/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-a-bozell-office-gets-new-owners.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1995-10-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 140, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Bozell Office Gets New Owners", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; A Bozell Office Gets New Owners", "body_text": " **********Two top executives of the Washington office of Bozell Worldwide along with an executive of Pitney Bowes Inc. have acquired that Bozell office and renamed it Laughlin, Marinaccio & Owens.

The buying was bolstered as short-sellers scrambled to cover their positions. **********The price of the 30-year Treasury bond gained 110/32 , to 1026/32 . In afternoon trading, the bond reached what has recently been seen as a significant price level, 11124/32 . But trading was thin, so all price moves were exaggerated. **********The price rise pushed the yield of the 30-year bond to 6.70 percent from 6.81 percent on Thursday. It was the lowest yield since July 17, when it was 6.67 percent. **********The rally came despite a report that sales of existing homes were stronger than expected. **********The National Association of Realtors reported that existing-home sales rose 5 percent in July. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg Business News had anticipated a rise of only 1.6 percent. **********One would expect a jump like that to raise concern about a growing economy and cause a drop in bond prices. But traders and investors have been aware of strength in the housing business for months, analysts said. **********The early surge in prices prompted short-sellers to buy to limit their losses. Short-sellers borrow securities and sell them, hoping to buy them later at a lower price. If prices rise, they face a loss. Yesterday's buying by the short-sellers was heightened by speculation that a big buyer was in the market for long-maturity notes and bonds. **********\"The sudden arrival of a large buyer forced those who bet on falling prices with borrowed securities to start buying back securities,\" said Matthew F.

Federal and state legislators and city mayors also vowed that they would leave the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party if Mr. Madrazo was forced to step down. **********\"We are demanding that the will of the majority be respected in Tabasco,\" a federal congressman from Tabasco, Cesar Raul Ojeda, said in an interview. \"This new democracy does not mean that we are going to concede our legitimate victories.\" **********The tumultuous protests marked one of the most serious breaks ever between the federal Government and rank-and-file members of the long-governing party known by its Spanish initials as the PRI. **********The rebellion began almost immediately after a political accord signed with great ceremony on Tuesday night by Mr. Zedillo, the national President of the PRI, and leaders of the main opposition parties, casting a shadow over their plan for negotiations to make the country's elections fully democratic. **********It also highlighted a potentially wider conflict between Mr. Zedillo's promises of fair play to the opposition and his repeated vows to give up the control that Mexican leaders have traditionally exercised over their long-dominant political party. **********\"There has never been a situation like the one we have today,\" a leading political scientist, Luis Rubio, said by telephone from Mexico City. \"This time the Government is not only portraying itself as independent of the PRI but as the guarantor of the law above all parties.\" **********The parties' agreement with the Government on Tuesday called only for the \"immediate resolution\" of conflicts in several states around the country where the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party has protested fraud in recent elections won by the PRI. **********But Government and opposition officials said privately that they had agreed in principle to hold new balloting under new laws in Tabasco and the neighboring state of Chiapas within the next 18 months. It remained to be determined, several of the officials said, who would govern until the new elections were held and whether Mr. Madrazo or his leftist rival would be allowed to run in them. **********Independent election observers in both states cited widespread irregularities in the votes, including contradictory figures from state election officials. Neither the observers nor the leftist opposition, however, presented proof of fraud so widespread that it might have been decisive in the outcomes. **********In Tabasco, a Gulf Coast state that has been hard-hit economically by the downsizing of the Government oil monopoly, Petroleos Mexicanos, Mr. Madrazo defeated his Democratic Revolutionary Party challenger, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, by 56 percent of the vote to 37 percent, an official margin of about 97,000 votes. **********Since then, Mr. Lopez Obrador has waged a strong campaign to make the state ungovernable for Mr. Madrazo, and the state's two other main opposition parties have also called for a new vote. **********Supporters of the leftist party, known as the P.R.D., have marched through city streets, held sit-ins at Government offices and blockaded oil installations of the oil company, known as Pemex. In a protest demonstration on Sunday, the P.R.D. drew an estimated 30,000 people in Villahermosa, the state capital; supporters called it the biggest political rally in Tabasco history. **********After repeated trips to Mexico City to confer with presidential aides and leaders of his party, Mr. Madrazo offered the opposition \"new electoral rules,\" but vowed to stay in office. Since Tuesday, he has appeared only briefly in public and declined to comment on his future. **********In an interview this morning in Mexico City, where he was said to be meeting with his party's national leadership, Mr. Lopez Obrador asserted that the turmoil in Tabasco was the product of corrupt politicians and businessmen who were unwilling to put their lucrative relationships at risk in a fair vote. **********\"More than a rebellion against the central Government, this is a rebellion against democratic change,\" Mr. Lopez Obrador, a defector from the governing party, said. \"What is really at the heart of this is that they do not want things to change.\" **********The PRI support network in the state is one of the governing party's most militant. Its unions and businesses are strong, and many politicians from the state have held important posts in the federal Government. The state also has a rich history of political corruption, and Mr. Zedillo's predecessor, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, threw out a former Tabasco Governor after leftist protests that he was mismanaging government funds. **********Today, in response to calls from state business leaders, hundreds of banks, shops and other businesses shut their doors. Hundreds of trucks carrying supplies to the capital were paralyzed on the outskirts by roadblocks set up by PRI supporters. Clashes between the two sides were reported in the capital, where PRI supporters drove P.R.D. members out of the central square, and in the nearby city of Cardenas. **********On what became a sort of PRI telethon on the state television station, viewers got a round of harangues against the left, including the strange sight of middle-class housewives shaking their fists and chanting a traditional slogan of the Latin American political left: \"The people! United! Will never be defeated!\" **********In a statement this afternoon, the federal Interior Ministry denied \"rumors and speculation\" about negotiations between the Government, the PRI and the P.R.D., and called on the two parties to begin talks to resolve their differences, an appeal that they accepted tonight."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/16/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-fallon-awarded-ameritech-account.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1995-06-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 104, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fallon Awarded Ameritech Account", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Fallon Awarded Ameritech Account", "body_text": " **********The long-distance services unit of the Ameritech Corporation said yesterday that it had selected Fallon McElligott in Minneapolis as the first agency to handle its account.

He had walked through the mountains for seven days without food, he said, before being rescued and taken to a hospital where he was treated for a bullet wound in the arm. **********Lying in a tent dressed in a pair of bright surfer trunks, Mr. Alic said that he had seen regular Yugoslav Army soldiers during the fighting. \"That's the army that attacked us,\" he said. **********Asked how he knew that they were Yugoslav soldiers rather than Bosnian Serbs, he said he could tell because of their accents, because they were wearing regular army uniforms, and because they were young and clean-shaven. **********Though this would not prove positively that they were Yugoslav Serbs, and not Bosnian Serbs, a United Nations military officer here said that the Bosnian Serb Army tended to be \"scruffy and older.\" **********United Nations officials said that other indications of participation by Yugoslavian Serbs in the taking of Srebrenica came from the Dutch peacekeepers.

Yeltsin has signed a series of decrees intended to increase fiscal discipline and reduce widespread corruption, Russian officials said today. **********The monetary fund is in the last stage of negotiating a $6.2 billion standby loan that is contingent on Moscow's commitment to stabilize its economy and keep its budget deficit within agreed limits in an effort to cut inflation here. **********Because Russia's 1995 budget hinges on the loan, the fund and economic reformers within the Government have unusual leverage over policy. Even once the loan is granted the fund will insist on disbursing the money in installments -- the first of which could arrive in April -- and tying them to Moscow's performance, Western diplomats said. **********The decrees give Mr. Yeltsin unprecedented control over Government spending and tax exemptions, suggesting a new commitment to self-discipline by the President, who in the past has signed budget-busting decrees favoring special interests. **********Now much will depend on the degree of compliance with Mr. Yeltsin's decrees, on the ability of Government reformers to influence Mr. Yeltsin over time, and on Mr. Yeltsin's own ability to say no to powerful friends and lobbies. **********The decrees are intended to help Russia keep its budget deficit to less than 8 percent of its gross domestic product. The swelling of the deficit in 1994, when the Government broke its promises to restrain spending, produced inflation this January alone of 17.8 percent. **********Reduced spending in the last months of 1994 has led to an estimated inflation rate in February of 13 percent, First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly B. Chubais, the Government's senior reformer, said today. Inflation is expected to drop again in March and April, but to remain far above the 3 percent a month goal that the Government had promised to reach by the end of 1994. **********The decrees, as announced today by Mr. Chubais and Aleksandr Y. Livshits, a presidential adviser, affect all spending not mandated in the 1995 budget passed by Parliament. In effect, the decrees will allow Mr. Yeltsin and a credit commission that includes Mr. Chubais to oversee spending decisions made by other parts of the Government like the Security Council -- expenditures that often come as unpleasant surprises to the Finance Ministry. **********The decrees should also help undercut, though by no means eliminate, the rampant favoritism, corruption and heavy lobbying by interest groups that have distorted governance here. One decree restricts to Mr. Yeltsin's control widespread special tax and customs exemptions, which have been a major source of corruption. **********An earlier presidential decree, for instance, had exempted the National Sports Fund from paying customs duties, excise taxes and value-added tax on all goods that helped athletes participate internationally. The sports fund used that exemption to import alcohol and tobacco products, which normally face the highest duties, concluding deals that Izvestia reported were worth $3.3 billion. **********In another sign of new resolve, the decrees give Mr. Chubais and the Government two weeks to propose which existing presidential decrees and Government decisions on spending and tax exemptions ought to be canceled. **********The decrees also order the Government to further reduce the number of prices regulated by the state, a source of easy corruption. Mr. Chubais said the amount of gross domestic product subject to state prices should drop from the current 24 percent to about 16 percent. The idea is to regulate those prices set mostly by state monopolies, to prevent them from making unjustified price rises. **********Taken together, the decrees go some distance to reassuring the monetary fund that this time Russia will keep its spending promises. The fund has argued that no loan will be enough if Moscow does not get its economy in order and begin to pull in a bigger share of potential revenues."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/06/business/scandal-besets-chinese-markets.html": {"writer_name": "Seth Faison", "pub_date": "1995-03-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1149, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Scandal Besets Chinese Markets", "print_headline": "Scandal Besets Chinese Markets", "body_text": " **********China's emerging securities markets are mired in their worst financial scandal since the Communists reopened a stock market here in 1990, weakening the markets at a time when the country badly needs them to raise capital. **********In a trading disaster that bears some eerie similarities to the collapse of the British investment bank Barings P.L.C., China's biggest and most prestigious securities firm made a huge gamble in the bond market late last month and lost. It pushed the firm, Shanghai International Securities, to the brink of bankruptcy in a single day. **********But traders at Shanghai International apparently took its misadventure one step further and tried to manipulate the market by orchestrating a mass of sell orders 10 minutes before closing. That led the authorities to suspend all trading last week in bond futures, the only lively market in China in recent months, while they investigate Shanghai International's actions. **********The clampdown has drawn attention to how fragile the markets are here, surviving under a Government that is still uncomfortable with letting a market decide who makes money. It has also pointed to how weak supervision is, with several securities firms flagrantly violating trading limits, and the Shanghai Stock Exchange unable to do anything about it. **********And for Western companies, several of which have discussed joint-venture possibilities with Shanghai International, the whole affair is a sharp reminder of the uncertainty of doing business in China. **********As with Barings, Shanghai International bet on a large number of high-risk futures contracts, expecting prices in the bond-futures market to fall. When they rose sharply instead, the firm, with just $120 million in registered capital, was hit with losses that outsiders estimated at $80 million to $150 million. **********To make matters even more complicated, Shanghai International -- which likes to compare itself not with Barings but with Merrill Lynch -- is accusing another firm of profiting by using inside information to trade on large accounts. **********The bond market crisis has followed a familiar pattern in China's financial markets: a new avenue for raising capital is created, initial indifference gives way to active trading and eventually to a frenzy of speculation, and finally the authorities intervene with strong measures that stop excesses as well as any active trading. **********\"The central Government is afraid of crisis,\" said Yan Yunlong, deputy general manager at Guotai Securities, a competitor of Shanghai International. \"They'd rather see a far smaller trading volume than a crisis. We think stricter management is needed, but we're concerned that they may be overreacting.\" **********Mr. Yan and others expect the bond futures market to reopen within weeks, but with a tough new set of regulations, including a margin requirement of 10 percent instead of the current range of 1 to 2.5 percent. And that is likely to limit enthusiasm among the 250 institutions and the few thousand individuals with enough cash to trade bond futures. **********Many of those individuals are now upset. One of them is Zhang Yanfa, who goes to Guotai Securities each day to sit in a secluded room with half a dozen sofas and computer screens where he and 10 other \"da hu\" -- big customers -- monitor the markets while sipping tea, gossiping and giving buy or sell orders to a woman who sits by a phone. **********Mr. Zhang, a former banker, is angry that trading in his favorite holdings, bond futures that skyrocketed in value last month, has been halted. \"It's completely unfair,\" he said, his voice rising with indignation. \"They'll close the market to protect a big company, but they never think about us.\" **********His disgruntlement bodes ill for the Government's efforts to spread the market gospel among the masses to help finance the country's enormous economic growth. China relies heavily on Government bonds to finance its deficits and try to control inflation, which hit 24 percent in 1994. **********The bond market in Shanghai came alive only in October, when the Government started adding a premium to interest rates on bonds to make them attractive. The premium was linked to inflation, currently about 24 percent, and speculation over the size of the premium fueled futures trading. **********Daily volume surged from $1 billion a year ago to $6 billion in January. Then on Feb. 23, when a newspaper reported that a new premium would be higher than expected, trading exploded to $102 billion, more than four times the previous high. **********That is when Shanghai International made its ill-fated bet that prices would fall. Instead, they rose, sharply and relentlessly. But in the final minutes of trading, they suddenly dropped like a stone, when a blizzard of sell orders hit the market.

Last Monday, it formally suspended futures trading, and on Tuesday it instructed anyone with a remaining contract to settle it privately or be forced to accept a lower price ordered by the exchange. **********David Wei, a senior executive at Shanghai International, conceded that \"some traders\" might have violated exchange rules by knowingly exceeding the number of futures contracts the firm was allowed to trade. He would not discuss the estimated losses or the number of traders involved. The Shanghai Stock Exchange refused to answer any questions. **********Mr. Wei described Shanghai International as a victim, and took the highly unusual step of accusing another firm of insider trading. Because of its close ties to a ministry in Beijing, Mr. Wei said, the firm apparently had early information on a plan to raise the premium on bonds. **********Zhong Ming, a senior executive at the accused firm, the China Economic Trust and Investment Development Corporation, responded: \"Some company violated trading regulations. Why are they accusing us of breaking the rules?\" **********An executive at another firm said that China Economic was the biggest winner in the bond futures frenzy, while Shanghai International was the biggest loser. Noting that every securities firm in China is onwed by some government, and essentially trading government money, the trader said that one firm was backed by the Ministry of Finance in Beijing, while the other was supported by the Shanghai municipal government. **********\"In the end, there are two organizations discussing how they are going to divide up government money,\" said the executive, Chang Yongtao. **********Huan Guocang, chief economist at J.

Levy, 77, who was an enlisted man in one of the war's Flying Tiger units of American fighter planes that darted about like musketeers in defense of the Chinese, fiercely inspired by the doughty Mrs. Chiang. **********She survives in fact at the age of 98 -- or thereabouts -- and is returning from the deeper shadows of history to preside at a reception on Wednesday at the Capitol, a place she took by storm 52 years ago when she addressed the House and Senate separately with poignant pleas for help for China in the war against Japan. **********That was before her husband, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, lost the Chinese civil war to the Communists, retreated to the island of Taiwan and was renounced by the Truman Administration as a corrupt martinet. **********In this was the origin of the passionate American political dispute about the \"two China\" policy and eventual recognition of the Communist Government in Beijing. It was a staple of partisan American politics that lately, like Mrs. Chiang, has shown signs of revisiting the scene to intrigue a new generation of politicians. **********Newt Gingrich, the House Speaker, recently endorsed the idea of recognizing Taiwan, but soon retreated as friends reminded him of the larger realpolitik importance of the People's Republic of China. **********Senator Bob Dole, majority leader and Republican candidate for President, has done no such controversial thing. But still he is co-sponsoring the reception for Mrs. Chiang at the invitation of Senator Paul Simon, Democrat of Illinois, a history buff who originated the event as a worthy piece in this year's commemorative war tableaux. **********So old a survivor is Mrs. Chiang and so sharp and singular was her persona on the world stage that the simple reception has a Norma Desmond aura of expectation about it, a celebrity visit from a silent era. Large poster photos of the younger, world-traveling Mrs. Chiang -- known popularly then as Madame Chiang -- will embellish her return. **********\"We're trying to low-key the political side of this, so far with some success,\" said Senator Simon, who politely informed the White House of the invitation in May without asking for approval. \"She is the only major figure left from World War II, and this is a touch of history plus a gesture of friendship to the Chinese people.\" **********Senator Dole's office carefully echoed this, saying no large policy initiatives should be ferreted out of the ceremony, in which the two Senators and Mrs. Chiang will say a few words. **********Mrs. Chiang, the daughter of a Chinese stowaway to America, has a fine command of English that she does not hesitate to put to blunt and splendid effect before politicians. Long suspect in her devotion to democracy, she once summarized American politics as an affair of \"clodhopping boorishness and uncivilized geste.\" **********Smart, stylish and above all resolved, Mrs. Chiang used a Wellesley College education brilliantly to become a principal in the war, serving as her husband's adviser, confidante, ambassador and English translator. After his death in 1975, she fed the fervor of the Nationalist Party, which was defeated on the mainland but vowed to rise up one day from Taiwan. **********\"It was an up-and-down thing, and I'm not trying to rewrite history,\" said Senator Simon of Generalissimo Chiang's rule, marked by terror and corruption. \"I'm simply recognizing here was some woman who played a very prominent role in the victory of World War II.\" **********The Senator, the son of American missionaries who served in China, met the Chiangs in 1959 when he was a freelance journalist visiting Taiwan. **********\"Partially to their credit,\" he said, \"the country of Taiwan has moved in the direction that pleases us: multiparty system, a free press, freely held elections.\" He noted that he had long been a two-China man -- \"a position that has never been very acceptable to either China.\" **********Mrs. Chiang, who left Taiwan after her husband died and has been living on Long Island, is now frail and hard of hearing but reportedly still articulate and opinionated. **********\"I can ask the American people for nothing more,\" she declared bitterly 45 years ago when a second mission of appeal to the United States for help against the Communists ended in failure and she receded into history. \"It is either in your hearts to love us, or your hearts have been turned from us.\" **********As Mrs. Chiang comes forth once more for Senator Simon's gentle curtain call, Mr. Levy and several other Flying Tigers will be at the reception to escort and toast her."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/25/business/oil-giants-register-big-first-quarter-profit-gains.html": {"writer_name": "Agis Salpukas", "pub_date": "1995-04-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 763, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Oil Giants Register Big First-Quarter Profit Gains", "print_headline": "Oil Giants Register Big First-Quarter Profit Gains", "body_text": " **********The nation's largest oil companies, buoyed by rising oil prices and big upturns in their chemical businesses, surprised analysts and delighted Wall Street yesterday by reporting higher-than-expected profits. **********Exxon, Mobil, Texaco, Amoco and ARCO all registered upturns in their first-quarter earnings. **********\"What this means is that analysts will be upgrading their forecasts for the year,\" said Adam Sieminski, an oil analyst for NatWest Securities. \"It certainly paints an attractive picture.\" **********He said that the biggest surprise for the first quarter was the sharp jump in the foreign exploration and production end of the business, which benefited from a rise of more than $3 a barrel in crude oil prices in the quarter. **********But that was not the whole explanation, he said.

Marathon said that its profit fell to $77 million, or 26 cents a share, from $110 million, or 38 cents a share. **********The company said that its results were depressed by the mild winter which caused lower natural gas prices, and that its gasoline sales were affected by the introduction of reformulated gasoline in markets where the company's business is concentrated. **********Revenue was up 21 percent, to $3.34 billion from $2.75 billion. **********Some analysts said that the favorable trends of high demand for chemicals and higher oil prices would continue into the second quarter which could also be helped by a recovery of prices for natural gas. **********Most oil stocks gained yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange.

Perry, who was traveling in the region. **********Mr. Perry told reporters that the size of Iran's military deployment on three disputed islands at the mouth of the gulf was \"far beyond any reasonable defense requirements that Iran has.\" He said it \"can only be regarded, I believe, as a potential threat to shipping\" in the Strait of Hormuz, a waterway that handles 20 percent of the world's oil production. **********Senior military officials said last month that Iran had placed Hawk anti-aircraft missiles on one of the three islands, and that a buildup that began last fall also included SA-6 surface-to-air missiles, 155-millimeter artillery and 4,000 troops. But Administration officials said today that since then they had seen evidence of a substantial further troop increase and that intelligence analysts had concluded that the arsenal included chemical weapons. **********Iran has made no threats against shipping or its neighbors. The islands being fortified are Abu Musa and the Tumb islands, which the United Arab Emirates also claims, and one possible explanation for the buildup is that it is intended to dissuade any attack. **********But Administration officials say the buildup on the islands is out of proportion to any threat. They say they believe that Iran is intent on exerting greater influence and the the size of the deployment have added to the Pentagon's concerns. **********In issuing the strong warning today, Secretary Perry said that \"if Iran uses those weapons to interfere with shipping then it becomes not just a matter of the U.A.E. but it becomes a regional and indeed a world problem.\" **********Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman, said later that the Administration did not have any evidence that the Iranian deployment was anything but defensive. But Mr. McCurry said at his daily briefing that there was \"a high degree of concern\" within the Administration about Iran's intentions. **********A senior Administration official said Mr. Perry's decision to call renewed attention to the Iranian buildup was driven in part by his gulf agenda. The Defense Secretary is trying to persuade the United Arab Emirates and its neighbors to devote more money to military spending and to allow the United States to preposition more equipment. **********Teheran is also in the midst of a campaign to acquire not only conventional military equipment, like three Russian-made diesel submarines, but also long-range missiles and nuclear reactors, a quest worrying the American Administration. **********When they first noticed the Iranian buildup on the three Persian Gulf islands last October, Administration officials concluded that it was probably a response to the American deployment of thousands of troops in Kuwait to check an Iraqi advance. **********But the fact that it has continued has caused American analysts to question that judgment. Together with Chinese-made Seersucker antiship missiles and two other Iranian islands, they say it has given Iran the ability to cut off oil shipping in the strategic waterway. **********A senior Administration official said the chemical weapons had been moved to the island of Abu Musa, but the official would not say if they were artillery shells or whatever."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/12/world/opening-vietnam-overview-us-grants-vietnam-full-ties-time-for-healing-clinton.html": {"writer_name": "Alison Mitchell", "pub_date": "1995-07-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1407, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. GRANTS VIETNAM FULL TIES; TIME FOR HEALING, CLINTON SAYS", "print_headline": "OPENING TO VIETNAM: THE OVERVIEW; U.S. GRANTS VIETNAM FULL TIES; TIME FOR HEALING, CLINTON SAYS", "body_text": " **********Saying the time was at hand to \"bind up our own wounds,\" President Clinton today extended full diplomatic recognition to Vietnam 22 years after the American withdrawal from a bitterly divisive war that still scars the national psyche. **********Mr. Clinton, the one-time student protester who avoided serving in a war he once said he \"opposed and despised,\" announced the normalization of relations in a brief ceremony in the East Room attended by military figures, the families of those still missing in action and members of Congress who were veterans of the war and prisoners of the Vietnamese. **********\"This moment offers us the opportunity to bind up our own wounds,\" the President said, evoking words used by Lincoln at the end of the Civil War. \"They have resisted time for too long. We can now move onto common ground.\" **********\"Let this moment,\" he said, \"in the words of the Scripture, be a time to heal and a time to build.\"  [ Excerpts, page A9. ] **********But the decision drew criticism as well as support from legislators, veterans' groups and families of missing servicemen. **********Mr. Clinton said the United States would continue to press Vietnam for a full accounting for the 2,202 United States service personnel officially listed as missing in Southeast Asia. He said that in the months since he lifted the United States trade embargo on Vietnam in February 1994, the remains of 29 more missing Americans had been identified and Hanoi had turned over hundreds of pages of documents. **********\"We will keep working until we get all the answers we can,\" Mr. Clinton said. \"Our strategy is working.\" **********Vietnam's Prime Minister, Vo Van Kiet, responded positively to Mr. Clinton's decision in a statement broadcast Wednesday morning, Hanoi time. He pledged to continue Vietnam's cooperation in helping to account for missing Americans. **********Mr. Clinton's announcement of full diplomatic relations completed a process begun by the Bush Administration in 1991 when Washington and Hanoi agreed on a detailed series of steps that would lead to recognition. Recognition was sought as eagerly by American business groups as it was bitterly opposed by the American Legion and some relatives of Americans missing in the war. **********But the move was particularly risky for a President whose efforts as a young man to avoid military service in Vietnam became a campaign issue in 1992, and who faces an electorate still sharply divided over the unpopular war that took 58,000 American lives. **********The often loquacious Mr. Clinton spoke somberly for just under 10 minutes, ending with \"God bless America.\" Several Congressional veterans of the war stood by his side as he made his announcement; Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who spent more than five years as a Vietnamese prisoner of war, was closest. Afterward, Mr. McCain praised Mr. Clinton for an \"act that required some courage.\" **********Yet 20 years after the last helicopter rising from the roof of the United States Embassy in Saigon became an indelible image of American defeat, Congress was as bitterly divided over Mr. Clinton's move as it once was over the war itself. **********Senator Bob Dole, a veteran of World War II whose right arm remains withered from his wounds, denounced Mr. Clinton's decision from the Senate floor, saying the President had not addressed the \"central question\" of whether Vietnam is continuing to withhold information and remains that could be easily provided. **********\"The President ignored this question in announcing his decision for the very good reason that all signs point to Vietnam willfully withholding information which could resolve the fate of many Americans lost in the war,\" said Mr. Dole, the Senate majority leader and the leading contender for the Republican Presidential nomination. **********Mr. Dole said the lawmakers would monitor the progress of relations with Vietnam, and he warned that Congress must approve funds for any diplomatic operations in Vietnam and that the Senate must confirm any ambassador. **********Senator Trent Lott, the majority whip from Mississippi, said he would support efforts to amend appropriations legislation to stop the opening of a United States Embassy in Vietnam. \"What's the reason for doing this?\" he asked. \"How do you justify recognizing Vietnam and not recognizing Taiwan?\" **********But Senator Bob Kerrey, a Nebraska Democrat who attended the White House ceremony, vowed to fight efforts to block embassy funding. \"It's a total mistake,\" he said. \"It's wallowing in the past.\" Mr. Kerrey, who lost part of one leg and won the Medal of Honor in Vietnam, added that if Mr. Dole or others tried to make political gain by blocking embassy funding, they would \"face people like me who say, 'Shame on you.\"' **********Veterans were also divided. John Sommer, the executive director of the more than 3 million member American Legion -- the nation's largest veterans group -- condemned the move, saying that normalization of relations left the Administration with little leverage to extract more information about the missing. But a group calling itself the Vietnam Veterans for Reconciliation handed out leaflets supporting the President on the White House lawn after the ceremony. **********Mr. Clinton's decision to recognize Vietnam had been endorsed by all of his senior advisers, according to Anthony Lake, the national security adviser. Mr. Lake said Gen. John Shalikashvili had polled the Joint Chiefs of Staff over the weekend and had found unanimous support. **********Aides said the President's decision stemmed, in part, from a desire to act now, before the 1996 campaign moves into full gear. It was also partly dictated by Secretary of State Warren M. Christopher's trip to Asia at the end of this month to meet with foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian nations. **********The President announced that Mr. Christopher will now visit Vietnam early next month, which will make him the first Secretary of State to visit the country since the American-backed Government in Saigon fell to Communist forces in 1975. **********While in Hanoi, Mr. Christopher will negotiate the details of the restoration of diplomatic relations. **********Resumed ties to Vietnam could give the Administration an important Asian ally at a time when relations with China have become more tense, although officials denied today that the policy change was in any way related to China. **********In Beijing, a Chinese Government spokesman welcomed the news. \"The Chinese Government has always stood for improvement of relations between the United States and Vietnam,\" said a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Shen Guofang. **********In his broadcast statement, Mr. Kiet said Vietnam would negotiate with the United States \"to set up a new framework for the relationship between the two countries on the basis of respect, independence, and mutual benefit of the two countries in harmony with the rule of international law.\" **********The Administration was silent today on who would become the ambassador to Vietnam, an appointment that could be fraught with symbolism. Officials said the Administration wanted a distinguished appointee, perhaps a veteran, who would face no trouble in a confirmation hearing. Among names under discussion are Under Secretary of State Peter Tarnoff; Frank G. Wisner, the Ambassador to India, or Mr. Lake himself. All three made their names in Vietnam. **********Administration officials said they had now set up interagency groups to examine such questions as trade, investment and tax treaties, all of which are of interest to American companies that were allowed to begin doing business in Vietnam in February 1994, when the President lifted the trade embargo. **********By some estimates, Vietnam will spend $7 billion during the next seven years on roads, ports and a modern telecommunications system. **********Willard A. Workman, vice president of the international division of the United States Chamber of Commerce, said businesses hoped that the announcement would clear the way for crucial United States agencies, including the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, to help American companies in Vietnam. **********Businesses are also eager for Vietnam to receive most favored nation trade status, which would drastically reduce tariffs between the two nations. Such status must be negotiated and approved by Congress. In addition, in order to normalize trade with Vietnam fully President Clinton must issue a finding that Vietnam allows free and open emigration or issue a waiver of that requirement."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/13/world/christopher-confers-with-saudi-king-on-aid-and-arms.html": {"writer_name": "Elaine Sciolino", "pub_date": "1995-03-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 280, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Christopher Confers With Saudi King On Aid and Arms", "print_headline": "Christopher Confers With Saudi King On Aid and Arms", "body_text": " **********King Fahd was polite but noncommittal tonight when Secretary of State Warren Christopher asked the Saudi ruler to support a proposed development bank for the Middle East, earmark some of his country's aid to the Palestinians for their day-to-day operations and support the indefinite extension of the treaty against the spread of nuclear weapons. **********The King did not say yes and he did not say no. **********\"It may just be the King's style,\" a senior State Department official told reporters. \"I wouldn't read too much into it.\" **********Aides to Mr. Christopher also tried not to read too much into the fact that the King kept his guest waiting for more than six hours before receiving him shortly before 10 P.M.

Others are taking deposits but restricting withdrawals. And nearly all Argentine banks are restricting or eliminating borrower credit. **********The crisis threatens to undo what President Carlos Saul Menem has called \"the Argentine miracle,\" which has brought economic stability to the country's 33.5 million people after years of the special uncertainty that hyperinflation brings. **********Since taking office in 1989, Mr. Menem and his economic team have instituted changes, including selling state-run businesses and linking the Argentine peso to the dollar, that have opened the economy to foreign investment and international competition. The results have been striking: inflation has declined to less than 4 percent annually from more than 5,000 percent in 1989, and economic growth of roughly 7 percent a year for the last four years has been one of the highest in the world. **********The banking crisis developed when foreign investors and local depositors, fearing that Argentina would follow Mexico and devalue its currency, began pulling their money out of banks and stashing it in Uruguay, long considered a haven for Argentine money because of the country's banking-secrecy laws, and safe-deposit boxes at home or under the mattress. Many Argentines, remembering too well that the Government had frozen bank accounts in an earlier crisis, grabbed their money, worried that the Government might not hesitate to do it again. **********As deposits shrank lending was curtailed, leaving big companies without the money needed for production or expansion. Now, many of these companies are asking customers to pay more quickly and they are delaying payments to their suppliers while trying to raise cash. **********Some small and medium-sized businesses have told employees times are so hard that they cannot afford to pay wages now because the available funds are being used to keep the company afloat. **********\"A lot of small firms will not be able to survive this crisis,\" said Juan Luis Bour, chief economist at the Latin American Economic Research Foundation here. \"What we are starting to see are the long-term effects of the Mexico crisis in Argentina. It's not over yet.\" **********Economic and financial experts predict that unemployment, now at a record 12.2 percent, will increase this year as more small businesses go bankrupt, and that tax revenue, already declining, will drop further. These experts also said there would be an overall reduction in wages, as workers accepted lower salaries rather than no jobs at all. **********The Government maintains that the crisis will resolve itself in a few weeks, largely because of a deposit-insurance program that went into effect last week. **********There is also hope that the recent rebound of Argentine stocks, which had dropped nearly 40 percent after the Mexican devaluation on Dec. 20, bodes well for an eventual return of investors to the banking sector. **********The benchmark Merval stock index here is down almost 15 percent so far this year, though it recouped 2.5 percentage points in April.

But there are still a lot of problems in the banking system and a lot of fear that will continue to have a negative impact on the economy and the financial markets.\" **********Before the Mexican crisis foreign investors held about one-third of Argentine stocks, market officials said. \"We know through conversations with brokers and agents that we are starting to receive more foreign orders,\" said Francisco Susmel, vice chairman of the Argentine stock market, \"and in absolute terms the number of foreign investors investing in capital instruments has not changed since the Mexican crisis. Very few investors did away with all their Argentine holdings.\" **********Yet Argentine bankers, though they have gone to great lengths to convince Wall Street money managers that their country will not follow Mexico into a severe recession, are not making commercial and personal loans. There is uncertainty, even a measure of panic, in this country. **********Many large businesses that used to extend credit to customers by allowing them to pay their bills within 90 days now require payment in 30 days. Other large companies have notified their small suppliers that they will need credit extensions because they cannot pay them on time. **********Some big businesses have taken extraordinary steps like demanding cash on delivery and refusing to accept checks written on accounts at banks rumored to be weak. **********Executives at 3M S.A., the Argentine subsidiary of Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, said the credit crisis had forced them to crack down on its 3,000 customers, many of whom are in financial distress and have not been paying their bills on time. **********Guillermo D'Andrea, a professor at the Institute of Higher Business Studies and a consultant to industry, said: \"The entire business cycle is feeling the heat of this liquidity crisis, which effects everyone from the corporation president to the assembly worker. Companies are afraid of giving credit to their buyers because you just don't know who's going to be around a month from now.\" **********Economists and financial analysts say that as a consequence of the liquidity crisis, Argentina is headed for a recession and will record no economic growth this year. Indeed, more than 30,000 Argentine businesses closed in the first three months of the year, and commercial sales dropped 35 percent, according to an industry group representing mercantile companies. **********Intersoft S.A., a Buenos Aires-based computer-software maker, grew so rapidly in 1994 -- 80 percent -- that its bank had said it would triple the company's credit line to allow it to buy equipment and open a new office floor. But with the Mexican crisis, the bank told Intersoft that its credit line would in fact be reduced. **********That forced Intersoft to delay its expansion plans and to press its customers to settle accounts, many of which were six months' overdue. **********\"Do you think they paid us? No, they haven't, and in this business you can't just cut off customers who you have a relationship with. Too much time and effort has been invested,\" said Emilio Lopez Cabeitas, an Intersoft vice president. **********Mr. Lopez said that to make ends meet, Intersoft has laid off 7 of its 200 employees and sharply cut costs. He added that the company expected a drop in its domestic revenue in the first half of the year, but that it hoped its growing foreign operations would make up for some of that. **********Economists and bankers said the Government had acted quickly and responsibly to shore up the banking system and avert a bank run, which many economists think would force Argentina to abandon its convertibility plan. Under that, every peso in circulation is backed by a United States dollar on deposit in the nation's central bank. **********The week before last, the Government announced a system of deposit guarantees aimed at rebuilding confidence in Argentina's financial system. Argentine banks will be levied a charge ranging from 0.03 percent to 0.06 percent of their deposits to set up a $2 billion fund that would cover deposits up to $10,000, or $20,000 for those held longer than 90 days. Under a separate trustee fund, the central bank will transfer the assets of troubled institutions, including accounts and deposits, to healthier banks. **********The Argentine central bank recently suspended five banks, giving them 30 days to regain liquidity or face closing. But Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo said there were no more banks facing suspension. Although some banks are having problems repaying investors, Mr. Cavallo said he thought that they would be able to solve their problems with the help of the new guarantee funds. **********Economists and Argentine finance officials said the credit crisis had uncovered the inefficiencies in the Argentine banking system, which they said was surely headed for a major consolidation in which the larger, old-line institutions gobbled up smaller, weaker newcomers. Among big banks expected to benefit in the consolidation are Banco de Galicia y Buenos Aires, Banco Frances del Rio de la Plata, Banco Rio de la Plata and Banco del Sud. **********\"Some banks have been severely weakened by this crisis and will not survive alone: they will have to merge or disappear,\" said Manuel Sacerdote, president of the Bank of Boston subsidiary here. \"What we are waiting for is a wide-scale return of depositors to the system, and I am confident that will happen.\" **********Many Argentine banking executives and financial analysts are optimistic that the Government's latest moves will entice investors and depositors back into the financial system, but they do not expect to see large amounts of capital coming in until after the elections."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/17/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-bank-picks-agency-as-does-blockbuster.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1995-07-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 175, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bank Picks Agency, As Does Blockbuster", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Bank Picks Agency, As Does Blockbuster", "body_text": " **********Two marketers have changed agencies on their accounts. **********Blockbuster Entertainment in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., a unit of Viacom Inc., named Foote, Cone & Belding in Chicago to handle the account of its Blockbuster Music retail chain, which had been handled by D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles in St. Louis for the last two years as part of the overall Blockbuster account.

That factory is closed now and wildflowers grow through crevices in the concrete that surrounds the shuttered buildings. The new heart of Lockheed's operations beats most strongly today here in Georgia, where the company makes its military planes with lower-cost labor. **********The nation's manufacturers of military hardware, an industry that still employs nearly 1.5 million people, are migrating. Like Lockheed, they are transferring operations to Georgia, Colorado, Louisiana, Florida, Mississippi and other low-cost states. In doing so, they are joining the rest of corporate America in its itinerant search for cheaper wages, fewer unions, less regulation and easier tax policies. And gradually the South and the Rocky Mountains are becoming the new centers for military spending, edging aside the Northeast and the Pacific Coast. **********\"As we consolidate and become more efficient, we do think of things we never would have thought of in the past, like states where we can be more competitive,\" said Daniel M. Tellep, chairman of the Lockheed Martin Corporation, the recently created amalgam of Lockheed and the Martin Marietta Corporation that forms the nation's largest military contractor. \"In many cases that means going to the South and the Rocky Mountain states.\" **********The Pentagon may be spending less to develop and manufacture weapons and equipment -- $70 billion in the 1994 fiscal year versus an inflation-adjusted $137 billion in 1985 -- but the South and the Rocky Mountains are getting an ever bigger share of the declining outlay. **********The shift is even more striking compared with 1976, before the Reagan arms buildup, when the outlay for weapons and research was not very different from today, adjusted for inflation. But the shares going to the Southeast and the Rocky Mountain regions have doubled compared with 1976, while the Northeast and the Pacific Coast regions have lost 15 percent or more. **********\"To be a bigger share of a shrinking pie is not the best position to be in, but it is better than being a shrinking share of a shrinking pie,\" said Donald Ratajczak, director of economic forecasting at Georgia State University in Atlanta. \"Because of the shifting, the defense cutback has not been a blow to the economies of the South.\" **********That cannot be said of Long Island, where the Grumman Corporation, now Northrop Grumman, was once the biggest employer. It stopped making any planes at all there last year, shifting what was left to Florida, Georgia and Louisiana. Nor is it true for the vast region in and around Los Angeles. Hughes Electronics, for example, recently transferred missile operations from Southern California to Arizona and Colorado, shifting hundreds of jobs in the process. **********In Massachusetts, the Raytheon Company, still the state's largest employer, is threatening to transfer missile work to Tennessee -- if the state does not grant the sort of concessions that Tennessee offers. **********\"We may end up being forced to go elsewhere, if we can't get $600 million out of our cost base in Massachusetts,\" said Elizabeth Allen, Raytheon's chief spokeswoman, happy to use the news media to pressure for concessions. **********All this represents a striking turnabout. Until the late 1980's, military contractors stayed pretty much in place, serving as a bulwark in high-cost regions that lost other manufacturers. The Pentagon's generous contracts shielded them from the intense competition that drove so many other industries to cost-cutting and migration. But with the cold war's end, the Defense Department urged the contractors to slash costs so that it could buy as much as possible with a shrinking budget. **********\"Ten years ago, there was a lot of money spread around in defense and you did not have to look for ways to cut costs,\" said Al Hansen, a Lockheed vice president. \"Now we meet weekly to do this.\" **********The corporate response is making the Federal Government an increasingly visible participant in a movement that contributes to wage stagnation in the United States. \"The cold war is over and the Pentagon should get the most bang for its declining budget,\" said Frank Levy, a labor economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"But on the other hand, the President keeps pushing for higher wages, and this strategy works against that.\" **********There are other consequences. The movement exacerbates the already intense bidding war among the states to attract companies and jobs by offering tax concessions and outright gifts. It is a competition that some economists label a giveaway of public goods: schools, roads, municipal airports, public transportation and the like. The huge Lockheed plant here is soon to receive such a gift from the Cobb County government. The county will pay for a multimillion-dollar rail underpass so that traffic will not be held up when trains cross the factory's property on a line now at ground level. **********Pentagon officials, however, say this largess serves the needs of national defense. They say they must find ways to buy enough weaponry despite their shrinking budget, and if competition among the states helps, so be it. The Pentagon, in fact, has given Lockheed, Hughes and other contractors tens of millions of dollars to help cover the costs of moving and consolidating. **********\"It makes economic sense to consider sharing the short-term costs to realize the long-term savings,\" Joshua Gotbaum, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Economic Security, said at a recent Congressional hearing. **********Nothing illustrates the post-cold-war migration and its impact more clearly than the decision by Lockheed to shift its principal aeronautic operations from Burbank to Marietta. This Atlanta suburb has boomed in recent years with the construction of federally financed interstate highways -- five and six lanes in either direction -- that tie Cobb County to Atlanta and the rest of Georgia. Lining the interstates are mile after mile of shopping centers, gallerias, hotels, office buildings and one-story factories. Although Sherman fought here en route to Atlanta, the landscape has been so transformed that Cobb County seems to lack almost any history before the 1970's. **********\"We have roads going everywhere,\" said Timothy Mescon, dean of the new business school at Kennesaw State College, itself a young and rapidly growing university just off Interstate 75. **********The Lockheed plant, a square half-mile of floor space next to Dobbins Air Force Base, dates from the dark ages before interstates. That is typical of the major military contractors, who are not building new plants as much as they are consolidating into what were once satellite operations. Lockheed Martin still has a big presence in California, including a top-secret advance design operation in Palmdale. But the center of its aeronautical operations has shifted to the South and the Mid-Atlantic. **********The plant here, which Lockheed acquired in 1955, first to make C-130 propeller-driven transports for the Air Force and then giant C-5 jet transports, took on new life in the 1990's with the arrival of the P-3, a propeller plane designed to hunt submarines. It had been built in Burbank for years. Not long after, Lockheed transferred a host of administrators to Georgia and then its research teams, bringing a thousand engineering jobs here. \"We de-staffed California in engineering, and staffed Georgia,\" said Mr. Hansen, the Lockheed vice president. **********The engineers, many of them newly hired Georgians earning on average 10 percent less than the California scale, are now developing Lockheed Martin's next weapon, the F-22, a 21st-century supersonic stealth fighter for the Air Force. If the Pentagon gives the go-ahead, the planes are to be assembled here, rather than Burbank, where the prototypes were made. In anticipation, bright yellow tape sets off an acre of empty floor space reserved for the F-22. **********Just having the F-22 in Georgia might persuade Congress and the Pentagon to pay for it. \"Southerners have traditionally been more pro-defense than people in other parts of the country,\" said William B. Bullock, a Lockheed vice president. **********Fitting this mold, House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who represents Cobb County in Congress, campaigns for the Pentagon to buy Lockheed's planes: the F-22, more P-3's, C-5's and the C-130J, an updated version of the C-130. **********Aides to Mr. Gingrich consult regularly with Lockheed officials, according to Allan Lipsett, the Speaker's Georgia press secretary. \"I think Mr. Gingrich considers it a good idea for defense contractors to come to the South,\" he said. **********Lockheed's payroll here has remained at 11,000 since 1989, or 3,000 more than would have been the case without the exodus from California, Mr. Bullock estimates. Still, Martha Mossman, who works on the C-130 line, is nervous. In 15 years at the plant, neither she nor her husband, Donald, has ever been laid off from Lockheed. But he recently received a \"warning\" that this could happen to him in June, costing him a union job that pays $18 an hour, far more than he could earn elsewhere in Georgia. **********Without new funds, work is winding down. Only four partly assembled P-3's remain on the line, their unpainted fuselages covered in steel scaffolding, and the C-130 line is also slowing. \"We have been doing a lot of traveling,\" said Mrs. Mossman, ticking off recent tourist excursions to Hawaii and Mexico. \"But this year we aren't going anywhere.\" **********Lockheed is Cobb County's largest employer, representing nearly 6 percent of the work force. With so many new companies arriving here, Lockheed's impact on the economy is gradually declining. Still, any cutback would hurt if only because for every Lockheed job, three more exist at subcontractors and suppliers within 100 miles of the plant, Mr. Bullock estimates. **********That, too, whittles away at labor costs. The Aidcorp, for example, a machine shop in rural Clayton, Ga., less than two hours away on the new highways, has doubled its employment since 1990 -- to 35 workers -- on the strength of the parts Georgia's military contractors farm out, particularly Lockheed. Its best-paid workers earn only $13 an hour, with nothing for sick days. **********For all the growing concentration of military work here, however, the question remains: Will it stay? After all, Lockheed Martin also makes F-16 fighters in Fort Worth, having recently acquired that similarly huge and underused plant from General Dynamics. **********\"If we don't get orders for the C-130J and the other planes we make here, then we would move to Fort Worth in a wink,\" Mr. Bullock said. \"And if the opposite happens, we could close Fort Worth and move the F-16 here.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/10/world/world-news-briefs-conservatives-defeat-socialists-in-ontario.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-06-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 184, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "World News Briefs; Conservatives Defeat Socialists in Ontario", "print_headline": "World News Briefs; Conservatives Defeat Socialists in Ontario", "body_text": " **********The Progressive Conservative Party, promising tax and spending cuts and radical changes in social policy, have swept out the socialist New Democrats to take control of the provincial government in Ontario. **********The comfortable majority for the Progressive Conservative leader, Mike Harris, in the election on Thursday wrenches Canada's richest and most populous province sharply to the right. **********By capturing 82 of the 130 seats in the Ontario assembly and 45 percent of the popular vote, the Progressive Conservatives have also given new hope to the national Conservative party after its collapse in federal elections in October 1993. **********\"We'd have to be blind not to say that we're very much ahead because of this,\" said Jean Charest, the national leader, who holds one of just two Tory seats in the Commons. **********Premier Jean Chretien had been counting on a victory for his fellow Liberal, Lyn McLeod, to solidify support for his expected re-election bid in two to three years. **********The change in political winds was a reaction to budget deficits and a very rapid rise in taxes."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/15/business/takeover-bids-made-for-two-big-utilities.html": {"writer_name": "John Holusha", "pub_date": "1995-08-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1152, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Takeover Bids Made for Two Big Utilities", "print_headline": "Takeover Bids Made for Two Big Utilities", "body_text": " **********Two big power-company takeovers -- one hostile, one friendly -- were proposed yesterday, providing an early sign that the coming free market for electric power will lead to a major consolidation among utilities amid a struggle to cut costs. **********In an attempt to unite the two companies that serve eastern Pennsylvania, Peco Energy Company, the parent of the Philadelphia Electric Company, made a hostile offer of $3.8 billion, or $24 a share in stock, for PP&L Resources Inc., the parent of the Pennsylvania Power and Light Company, which serves a number of cities outside the Philadelphia area. **********At the same time, the Union Electric Company of St. Louis and Cipsco Inc., a power company in central Illinois, agreed to merge in a stock deal valued at $1.2 billion. The companies said they expected to generate cost savings of $570 million over the next 10 years by eliminating duplicate jobs and combining other overlapping operations. **********After decades of operating as government-regulated monopolies with total control over their designated service areas, electric utilities are being driven to become larger and more flexible as big industrial customers have developed the ability to generate their own power at lower cost or to go outside their local areas to buy electricity from cheaper suppliers. In response, the Federal Government and several states have moved to deregulate the industry. **********\"Each of these mergers is different, but the general theme is that utilities have to cut costs to become more competitive,\" said Barry M. Abramson of Prudential Securities Research. \"Most of these companies have done a lot of cost-cutting and are as lean as they are likely to be, so a merger gives them the opportunity to cut costs again.\" **********One of the big issues that has emerged from the various deregulation proposals is whether the benefits of a freer market in electric power will flow mostly to big industrial users at the expense of small business and residential users, who may be asked to shoulder additional costs for maintaining the vast distribution networks needed to deliver electricity. **********State regulators, who must also deal with the question of who pays for investments in existing power plants that may no longer be competitive, are being forced into a difficult balancing act. **********\"Regulators will try hard to see that small customers will suffer no increase in costs,\" Mr. Abramson said, \"although most of the savings will be passed on to large customers.\" He noted that transmission systems would remain local monopolies subject to regulation, even as competition spreads in the business of generating electricity. **********Earlier this year, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved a proposal that would force electric utilities to open their transmission systems to power generated by competitors. That will allow big industrial customers to negotiate for lower rates by threatening or actually importing power from lower-cost generators in other areas. **********The proposal would also give low-cost independent power companies access to the distribution grids owned by integrated utilities and allow them to compete with those utilities for desirable big customers. **********Given the new rules of the road, utilities are being forced to seek combinations with neighboring systems to gain strength with their big customers and achieve economies of scale, said Robert Guberman, a vice president of A. T. Kearney, a consultancy. \"The industry is not burying its head in the sand,\" he said. \"This is the beginning of a flurry of actions -- some agreeable, some not agreeable.\" **********The two utility proposals yesterday followed on the heels of a planned merger between the Northern States Power Company and Wisconsin Energy Corporation, two big Midwestern utilities. On May 1, they announced the intention to merge into a company to be called the Primergy Corporation, based in Minneapolis. The companies provide power to 1.3 million customers in the upper Midwest and gas to 350,000 customers. All the pending deals are subject to approval by shareholders and state regulators. **********In making its hostile bid for PP&L yesterday, officials of Peco said they were doing so because months of discussions had not produced an agreement. **********Joseph Paquette Jr., the chairman of Peco, in a letter to his counterpart at PP&L, said the stalemate \"makes clear the need to present a specific proposal now so you and your board can fully evaluate the potential benefits a combination provides to PP&L Resources and shareholders and customers.\" **********Mr. Paquette said the companies had adjacent service areas and would be a \"natural fit.\" He predicted that the combined companies would be able to lower rates for electricity and save $2 billion over 10 years, with the benefits divided between shareholders and customers. **********PP&L, which had been informally discussing a merger with Peco since November, expressed reservations, although it promised to \"fully evaluate\" the offer. **********In a letter to Mr. Paquette, William F. Hecht, PP&L's chairman, said his company was concerned about Peco's \"high cost structure\" and whether the combined company could recover Peco's \"considerable past investment costs.\" Moody's Investors Service recently estimated those costs above $4.86 billion, Mr. Hecht said, adding that Peco's rates were 55 percent higher than PP&L's. **********In an interview, Mr. Paquette noted that the $24-a-share offer was 27 percent above PP&L's previous price and said the combination was \"too good to ignore and too good to delay.\" **********The price of PP&L's shares rose yesterday in response to the offer, closing at $21.50, up $2.625. Peco's shares declined $1, to $26.75. **********If the merger is completed, the combined company would be one of the largest utilities in the nation, covering most of eastern Pennsylvania. Peco provides electricity to the city of Philadelphia and its suburbs, and supplies natural gas to the suburbs. PP&L provides both services as far west as Williamsport. The deal includes nuclear power plants, but not the Three Mile Island plant near Harrisburg, which is owned by General Public Utilities. **********Union Electric and Cipsco have adjacent service areas on the Missouri and Illinois sides of the Mississippi River. \"We have contiguous territories and are similar in the way we treat costs, so we will have a seamless transition,\" said Clifford L. Greenwalt, Cipsco's chief executive. **********Part of the savings generated by a merger would be returned to customers under legislation adopted in Missouri and pending in Illinois, executives for the companies said in telephone interviews. Some of those savings will come from the elimination of 300 jobs through attrition rather than layoffs. **********Under the terms of the merger, neither company would retain its current form. Instead, a new holding company would be formed, with shareholders of Union Electric getting one new share for each one held and Cipsco shareholders receiving 1.03 shares.

The three ministers are Mate Granic of Croatia, Muhamed Sacirbey of Bosnia and Milan Milutinovic of Yugoslavia, who is representing the Bosnian Serbs in the talks. **********Mr. Christopher's face-to-face meeting, on the fringes of the opening of the United Nations General Assembly, was portrayed by his aides as a diplomatic reward that elevated the talks among the three governments to a higher level with Mr. Christopher's own imprimatur. **********The meeting also represents the first time in the Clinton Administration that Mr. Christopher has met with such a high-ranking official of the Government in Belgrade, underscoring the American determination to transform President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia from a pariah who could be indicted for war crimes into a serious negotiating partner. **********Even as Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia move in fits and starts toward peace, the mistrust and hatred among the parties was underscored today by remarks made in Paris by Croatia's President, Franjo Tudjman, about the Muslim-dominated Bosnian Government, his Government's federation partner. **********Mr. Tudjman said that the ideal solution would have been to create three Bosnian states, composed of Muslims, Croats and Serbs. **********\"The problem of how Muslims and Croats will live together there remains open -- a problem we shouldn't underestimate even though cohabitation is desirable and possible,\" Mr. Tudjman said. \"Even if the Bosnian Muslims say they belong to Europe, there have been and still are fundamentalist tendencies.\" **********Under the current peace plan, the federation of the Bosnian Government and the Croats is to receive 51 percent of the territory, while Bosnian Serbs are to receive 49 percent. **********Sharp disagreements remain between the United States and Russia on the shape international enforcement will take in the event of a peace settlement in Bosnia. **********In Moscow today, Russia's Defense Minister, Gen. Pavel S. Grachev, said that Russia would propose a peace force under rotating NATO and Russian command. **********To the disappointment of Washington, General Grachev ruled out Russian troops' serving under a NATO command. The United States has agreed to commit up to 25,000 ground troops, but only under NATO operational command and control. **********Until now, Mr. Christopher has chosen to stay on the sidelines, letting Mr. Holbrooke take the lead in striking a deal earlier this month to win Bosnian Government assent to the principle of a Serbian republic within Bosnia. **********Administration officials denied that Mr. Christopher was trying to seize the negotiations -- or the spotlight -- from his subordinate, and said that the real negotiations would resume under Mr. Holbrooke's authority on Tuesday. **********American officials today blamed disputes in the Bosnian Government as the main obstacle to agreement on the shape of the new Government. **********In its simplest terms, the battle pits President Alija Izetbegovic, and his Foreign Minister, Mr. Sacirbey, who favor a small, unified Bosnian state even if it means loose political links with the Serbian part of the country, against Haris Silajdzic, the Prime Minister, who favors a strong central Government to help preserve Bosnia's multi-ethnic nature. **********\"The Bosnian Government, confronted for the first time with the opportunity to create a viable state, has become virtually paralyzed because of international battles between the President and the Prime Minister,\" a senior Administration official said. **********For its part, the Bosnian Government claims that the United States, in its rush to make peace, is making too many concessions to the Serbs, particularly on the role of the Presidency, and whether it is the President who has responsibility for monetary policy, foreign policy, customs and taxation and immigration and refugee issues. **********The Bosnians are also concerned about the absence of any firm assurance that the Serbian Republic cannot secede from Bosnia and align itself someday with Serbia, a point Mr. Sacirbey raised today. **********In response, Mr. Christopher said the position of the United States is \"to oppose any effort to provide a right of secession.\" **********The Bosnians were so distressed by what they called bad faith and demands by Serbia that on Sunday, Mr. Izetbegovic announced that his Government would boycott Tuesday's meeting. It took a furious diplomatic push by the United States to change his mind. **********Part of the American negotiating team immediately flew back to Sarajevo last night to ease the Bosnians' fears; Mr. Christopher spoke by telephone to Mr. Izetbegovic and Mr. Sacirbey on Monday morning, while Mr. Holbrooke tried to coax Mr. Milosevic of Serbia to give a little. Finally, Mr. Izetbegovic backed down. **********To keep the process going, Mr. Christopher said that Mr. Holbrooke would restart his shuttle diplomacy later this week."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/26/business/international-briefs-manweb-says-it-has-a-foreign-suitor.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-09-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 114, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Manweb Says It Has A Foreign Suitor", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS; Manweb Says It Has A Foreign Suitor", "body_text": " **********The regional electric company Manweb P.L.C. repeated its opposition yesterday to a revised bid by Scottish Power P.L.C., saying the bid undervalued the company.

That's pretty far, for Mr. Allen was a Microsoft co-founder -- he went to high school with Bill Gates -- and left as a billionaire in 1983. Since then, he has indulged all manner of passions -- from buying a basketball team to financing a Jimi Hendrix museum in Seattle. Now he's made his biggest investment yet, putting $500 million -- even for him, a hefty bet -- into that ultimate entertainment dream team, Dreamworks SKG (Spielberg, Katzenberg and Geffen, that is). That sum gives him an 18.3 percent stake, with the three founders retaining two-thirds. Mr. Gates later got in on the act, too (does he have a finger in everything?), with Microsoft forming a multimedia joint venture with Dreamworks. **********HISTORY  A Lot of Water Over the Dam  William Clark's grandfather, it seems, worked for Morrison Knudsen when it built Hoover Dam in the 30's, and that link to the past brings vividly to life the contrast between the company's glory days and its current sad state. One possible cause for the problems has emerged: the directors who for so long backed William Agee's actions as chairman, even as warning signs flared, also had close ties to a charity run by Mr. Agee's wife, Mary -- ties so close that one expert on such matters said, \"I have never seen a situation like this.\" And last week, in the latest blows, Mr. Clark resigned as acting chairman, even as Morrison disclosed losses even worse than expected. To top it off, the next day Zbigniew Brzezinski also resigned from the board. Hoover Dam is intact. COLA WARS  D.C.U.'s? XL to the Rescue  Don't look now, but there's a vast, confused group taking shape across the land -- \"dual-cola users\" is what Pepsi calls them, with that poetic solemnity special to marketing. And those fickle souls just won't stick with either regular or diet cola, so -- yes -- they switch back and forth. Now this is heavy stuff. Sodas are a $50 billion business, and $30 billion of that's in colas; the cola wars are BIG. Just last week, to try to nab those D.C.U.'s (as marketers no doubt call them), Pepsi introduced a low-sugar concoction called Pepsi XL in a few Florida cities. The company had some convoluted explanation for that \"XL\" -- it mixes sugar with artificial sweetener -- but what it surely comes down to is that Pepsi wanted it to sound like a car. Slurp. Vrrooom. Help. EXECUTIVE SUITE  At Sony, Software Is In  In consumer electronics, there's \"hardware\" and \"software\" -- the machines and the stuff they play, like movies or CDs. For half a century, Sony has been the master innovator of hardware -- just look at the Walkman and its billions of descendants. In software it's been a rougher ride -- look at its billions in Hollywood losses. But it's a new era at Sony -- its visionary co-founder Akio Morita just stepped down as chairman, Norio Ohga moved up to that job from president, and all eyes were on his successor. And the choice, last week, was a shock: Nobuyuki Idei, who leapfrogged over at least 10 higher-ranking executives. But the appointment sent a crystal-clear message: with Mr. Idei, a movie buff with the \"software spirit,\" running things, software is definitely in.  THE PRESIDENT  And Think of His Aching Wrist  In the spirit of the latest times, here's a stock tip: invest in companies that make pens. In the House version of the line-item veto, the President could strike offending budget items. But in the Senate version, passed last week, he would accept or reject each budget morsel separately -- by one estimate, perhaps 10,000 separate bills. That's a lot of Presidential autographs -- and a lot of pens. But why do (Republican) legislators want to give the (Democratic) White House such power? Maybe they figure it's the only way they can get out the pork (which they, of course, put in). Or maybe it's because they have this idea that Bill Clinton will be back in Arkansas come 1997. Another point: Is a line-item veto even constitutional? Probably not, said Pat Moynihan.  POLITICS Snippets of Discontent  Yes, old-style liberalism may be dying, gunned down by Republican assault rifles, but it's not going quietly. All last week, protests rippled across the land against Federal and local budget-slashing. In the House welfare debate, several lawmakers, including Sam Gibbons, showed a commitment to children by wearing ties or scarves designed for Save the Children. And hundreds of children, with the message \"Pick on someone your own size,\" rallied on the Capitol steps to protest school lunch cuts. Later, more students converged on the Capitol -- one, in a towel, bearing a sign reading \"We Are Being Stripped\" -- to protest cuts in school aid. Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson led a march to Albany to battle Governor Pataki's proposed cuts to Medicaid, education and programs for the homeless. And New York City's hospitals chief quit abruptly, saying he couldn't back deep Medicaid cuts.  CYBERSPACE  alt.ban.internet.sex.but.how  There they are on the Internet listings, news groups like \"alt.sex.beastiality\" and \"alt.sex.masterbation.\" Such spelling, apparently, causes no outrage, but the content does. Everything from Playboy photos to the crudest of language is available at a click, no matter how young the wielder of the mouse, and many people want it stopped. But how? Cyberspace is the Wild West of the 90's, untamed and, for now, untamable. Stuff can come as easily from across the street as from across the globe. Trying to control it would be like spitting digits into the wind. But the Senate Commerce Committee is trying anyway. Last week it approved a ban on cyberporn, vowing $100,000 fines and two-year prison terms. Senator Jim Exon, who wrote the bill, admitted that it was probably futile, but he said he had to try.  THE MARKETS  A Slowdown, and Stocks Soar  The stock market loved Friday's economic news -- an 0.8 percent drop in orders for durable goods (stuff that's supposed to last longer than bananas or most electronic gadgets). By the market's current upside-down thinking, any slowing means less chance that the Fed will raise interest rates this week. And such a strong negative number was especially positive, as the Dow jumped 50, to 4,138.

They are hungry, they call out, and they are angry because the Government is forcing them to pay for getting the nation's economy back on track. **********The difference between what is said in the palace and what is shouted on the plaza underscores an inescapable conclusion about Mexico almost seven months after the peso was disastrously devalued: the economy here now has two faces. One is reflected in steadily improving macroeconomic indicators; the other reveals the deepening misery of Mexico's 91 million people. **********The extent to which Mexico can draw those two economies together in the coming months will determine not only how well it recovers from this latest crisis, but also whether it will be able to overcome some of the fundamental problems that have for so long created appalling gaps between the rich and poor in Mexico. **********Should it fail to draw the economies closer, many fear a period of deepening political and social unrest in a country that has already been shaken for more than a year by a peasant uprising and a string of assassinations. **********The outcome is of critical importance to the United States, which is still waiting for the promised benefits from the North American Free Trade Agreement and is fearful of a new wave of illegal immigration if conditions worsen. **********And while the Mexican Government trumpets the latest positive numbers, it is far from declaring victory. **********\"We are very careful not to claim that because we have made progress in returning to the market that the crisis is over,\" said Mexico's Finance Minister, Guillermo Ortiz. \"We will say the crisis is over when we get some real growth going and employment increasing.\" **********Still, the palace version of the economy is positive indeed. With surprising speed, the Mexican stock exchange has bounced back to pre-devaluation levels. Inflation rates are still high, around 3 percent a month, but declining broadly after peaking at 8 percent in April. Although the peso is now allowed to float freely, it has remained at around the same level -- between 6 and 6.3 to the dollar -- for weeks. **********What's more, Mexico had a $165 million trade surplus in the first quarter and the Government last week successfully placed $1 billion in commercial notes, a startlingly swift recovery considering that after the last financial crisis here, in 1982, it took seven years to regain access to international capital. **********From the plaza, however, the Government's recovery program looks more like a virus than a cure. **********Fearing hyperinflation, the Government essentially shut down the economy here, raising prices on basic items like electricity, gasoline and even tortillas. Interest rates on consumer loans reached 100 percent and, though dropping, still exceed a punishing 45 percent. Banks have repossessed houses and cars in record numbers. Inflation far outstrips wage increases. And perhaps worst of all, in a country with no unemployment insurance, as many as a million people may have lost jobs since January. **********As the Government's March 9 recovery plan of budget cuts, tax increases, price hikes and a tight money supply continues to take hold, the gap between the palace and the plaza economies appears to grow wider. That is hard for President Ernesto Zedillo to accept because he campaigned on a promise of personal well-being and prosperity for Mexican families. But even he concedes that the hardships are likely to get worse before a real turnaround begins. **********The Government hopes that as investor confidence slowly returns in the second half of the year, and exports remain strong, companies will begin to buy equipment and expand, providing jobs that will lead to some positive growth by the end of the year. Government spending will also increase throughout the rest of this year, while the national development banks will start to make more credit available. **********But until then, as savings run out and the recession hits harder, more jobs will be lost and more pockets will go empty. **********\"There's a big difference between what the Government says and what we the people feel,\" said Maria Ortega, a 28-year-old nurse from Puebla, a colonial city about 50 miles southeast of Mexico City. Like other civil servants, she received a 13 percent wage increase this year, \"but that's not enough to cover my bus fare,\" she complained. **********It's not just having to pull their belts tighter that bothers many Mexicans like Ms. Ortega. They remember how just a little more than a year ago the Mexican economy was widely praised, with a booming stock market and the ability to attract billions of dollars in foreign investment. They believed the Government's promises that by entering the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mexico was entering the first world. **********ALL that collapsed last December when Mexico jolted world markets with the devaluation, which caught the United States and others by surprise and set off a chain reaction that sent investors and their dollars fleeing. **********Faced with a spreading disaster, the Government appealed for help from the international community and dedicated itself to a major restructuring that would eliminate the $30 billion in volatile short-term foreign capital on which it had been financing much of its expansion. Squeezing out that $30 billion meant putting the economy into a straitjacket. **********It was a classic response to a recurring problem. The economies of eastern Europe and many countries elsewhere in Latin America have adopted the same rigid therapy to rehabilitate their economies, with the same painful results. **********The United States brokered a rescue plan for Mexico last February that includes $20 billion in loans and loan guarantees from Washington and about $30 billion in loans from the International Monetary Fund and other organizations. When they lobbied for the package last January, American officials said the help was needed to prevent the short-term crisis \"from escalating into a prolonged and severe economic downturn, which would put at risk important U.S. interests,\" in particular 700,000 export-related jobs. **********Already, what had been a positive trade balance with Mexico has turned into another deficit for the United States. Without some relief for the Mexicans who cannot now afford American imports, jobs north of the border could be lost, too. **********Some members of Congress, led by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, are still opposed to assisting Mexico financially. Senator D'Amato held a hearing in Washington on Friday in which he rapped the Mexican Government for its management of the economy and for the pace with which it has been tapping the loan package. It has already made use of $12.5 billion in United States credits and another $9.8 billion from the I.M.F. **********Such criticism is causing the Mexican Government to fight a battle on two fronts, trying to show American officials that the international rescue has worked while also attempting to show its own people that it is not unaware of the gap between the macroeconomic indicators and everyday life. **********Mr. Ortiz said the Government knew that making a huge economic adjustment would be painful, but believed it was unavoidable. \"If we hadn't got the macroeconomics right,\" he said, \"it would be much more difficult to make progress on the real side of the economy.\" **********The Government clearly has been getting the macroeconomics right. On almost every issue that had become a concern to international investors, Mexico has scored at least a temporary success. **********The stability of the peso is one of the most surprising. Before the recovery plan was announced in March, the peso had dropped to 7.45 to the dollar, a decline of 54 percent since the devaluation. **********But steps taken by the central bank have helped bring the peso back to around 6 to the dollar. Peso futures are now traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Mexico's central bank reveals the level of international reserves and the money supply every week so investors know where the country is heading. Before the devaluation, reserves were officially announced just three times a year. **********The last time the reserves were announced before the crisis was in October, when they stood at about $17 billion. Within a month after the crisis began in December, the reserves stood at only slightly above $2 billion. Since then, they have bounced back to $14.35 billion, mostly with the help of the United States aid package. **********AT the heart of the crisis were doubts about Mexico's ability to pay its debts. As 1994 ended, Mexico had $29 billion worth of outstanding tesobonos -- short-term Government bonds denominated in pesos yet payable in dollars. As the peso lost value, and tesobono holders demanded to be paid in dollars, Mexico faced a liquidity problem. **********But Mexico was able to use the aid package to cover its obligations. Now, only $8.9 billion of tesobonos are outstanding. Of that amount, about $6.6 billion come due the rest of this month and in August. Given the current reserves of Mexico, only a few analysts are worried about its ability to make the payments. **********As the peso lost value earlier in the year, so did Mexican stocks. First-quarter profits were depressed but not as badly as some had feared. As interest rates started to drop during the second quarter, the picture improved. A rate cut by the United States Federal Reserve on July 6 gave additional help to the leading index of the stock exchange here. On Friday, the index closed at 2,531.49, more than a thousand points above its post-devaluation low of 1,447.52, which was set on Feb. 27. The stock market's recovery, however, is not all that it seems because in dollar terms, the exchange is still down more than 18 percent. **********In some cases, the devaluation of the peso has been both a boon and a burden for the same Mexican industry. Auto exports are soaring while domestic sales are slumping badly. For example, exports of the Ford Motor Company of Mexico have increased 50 percent since January. The company recently announced $450 million worth of direct investment, mostly in plants dedicated to producing exports. **********At same time, however, few Mexicans can afford a new car and Ford's domestic sales have plummeted. In the first five months of the year, Ford sold 10,999 cars and trucks, a drop of 20,579 from the same period in 1994. **********Chrysler's domestic sales are down 75 percent; General Motors 40 percent. Volkswagen, which still produces the Beetle in Mexico, has also been hit hard. It sold 503 Beetles in May, compared with 6,283 in May 1994. **********THOSE harsh domestic realities have many investors nervous, notwithstanding the bullish macroeconomic indicators. **********\"They've really got a recession going on,\" said Scott Kalb, manager of the Smith Barney International Asset Management Fund. \"They are going to have some very poor earnings results come out for the second quarter. They've got a tough political situation and plenty of potential for political problems, labor problems and social unrest.\" **********Mexico's plaza economy is better reflected in the eyes of the weary than in Government figures, but statistics give a sense of the difficulty facing most families. **********Of all the bad signs, unemployment is the worst. Mexico's national statistics institute estimates that more than two million people are unemployed, double the number of last December. That comes to an unemployment rate of 6.3 percent, the highest since figures started to be collected 12 years ago. **********But those official figures are unreliable because virtually anyone who earns anything is counted as employed, even someone who sells gum at a traffic light. President Zedillo's own Labor Secretary, Santiago Onate Laborde, doubts the figures, saying at a news conference recently that the number of unemployed workers was closer to six million. **********The only thing that seems certain is that unemployment will get worse as the recession continues. Few new jobs are being created, but this year nearly two million Mexicans will enter the work force. **********Government officials expect the numbers for the second quarter of this year to show the economy contracting by as much as 5 percent, and they forecast no growth at all until the end of the year at best. The leaders of several of Mexico's most important business groups told President Zedillo last week that if the economy did not start to improve soon, there would be more unemployment, more business closings and more social unrest. **********Life is hard even for those who have jobs. The minimum wage has gone up twice since December, 7 percent the first time and 12 percent the second, but still stands at no more than $3 a day. Contract wage settlements have averaged around 12 percent, with 8 percent more in fringe benefits. But inflation for the first six months of 1995 reached a compounded rate of 33 percent and even under the best of estimates will come close to 50 percent for the year. **********The price of gasoline, produced only by the state oil monopoly Pemex, will have increased 48.5 percent by the end of the year, pushing up prices for everything that moves by truck. Even the price of tortillas, the flat corn pancakes that are a daily staple, has risen twice since the crisis began. **********As part of its plan to avoid hyperinflation, raise revenues and suppress demand, the Government increased the national value-added tax to 15 percent, from 10 percent, on April 1. **********THAT in itself produced a spike in inflation for the month of April to a post-devaluation high of 8 percent, but the shock was great enough to stop demand short, theoretically limiting a spiral of price increases. **********To survive the falloff in retail sales -- down at least 40 percent in the first four months of the year -- many store owners are opening earlier and closing later. And like the Mexico City pizza shop that now serves breakfast or the Chrysler dealer who turned his showroom into a car wash, they are willing to try anything. **********Even the rich have been hurt. The number of billionaires in Mexico declined this year to 10, from 24, but there is no need to feel sorry for them. The net worth of Mexico's richest man, Carlos Slim Helu, whose holdings include the Mexican telephone company, was cut in half but still totals $3.7 billion. **********Mr. Slim has said in interviews that he has no doubt Mexico will bounce back from the crisis, and perhaps be even stronger than before. **********For their part, international investors and analysts say they are fairly confident that the harsh medicine that Mexico's leaders have administered will be enough to revive the economy. **********But they are still uncertain whether, after all the pain and hardship caused by this latest crisis, Mexico will make the long-term changes necessary to correct fundamental problems in its economy. **********They are still looking for some clearly defined Government policy to create the millions of new jobs needed each year to account for Mexico's high birth rate. They are hoping to see a plan for building on the export advantage offered by the devaluation, which is rapidly being eaten away by inflation. **********And they are waiting to see how Mexico intends to increase productivity and efficiency to compete with other Latin American countries as they shake off the effects of the Mexican crisis. **********Out in the plaza, plenty of angry people are also waiting. For them, it will take more than a continuing stream of good news from the palace to keep the anger from boiling over."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/07/business/insider-trading-case-is-settled-in-luxottica-deal.html": {"writer_name": "Stephanie Strom", "pub_date": "1995-09-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 392, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Insider Trading Case Is Settled in Luxottica Deal", "print_headline": "Insider Trading Case Is Settled in Luxottica Deal", "body_text": " **********The Securities and Exchange Commission said yesterday that it had settled an insider trading case arising from Luxottica Group S.p.A.'s acquisition of the United States Shoe Corporation earlier this year. **********Giovanni Malavasi, secretary to the board of Luxottica, an Italian eyewear company, agreed to pay $100,000 for 12,500 shares of U.S. Shoe on Feb. 14, more than two weeks before Luxottica's bid was announced, the commission said.

The board approved a tender offer for the American retailing company on Jan. 31, and on Feb. 14, Mr. Malavasi directed Credit Artigiano, a Milanese bank, to buy 10,500 shares of U.S. Shoe for his account and a further 2,000 shares to be held in the name of his son, Angelo. **********On March 2, the day before Luxottica started its bid, U.S. Shoe shares closed at $18.75.

But to the watchdogs at the S.E.C., there is no legal distinction. **********\"Maybe people on Main Street need a little cautioning,\" said Thomas C. Newkirk, associate director of the S.E.C.'s enforcement division in Washington. \"I don't think this is a problem of people not knowing that it is wrong. It is more a case of them not realizing how much trouble they can get into as a result of doing it.\" **********The commission is using more than harsh words to make its point. In the last year, it has successfully concluded five civil lawsuits against people accused of using family ties to obtain secret corporate information and then profiting from that information in the stock market. **********\"The message we're trying to get out to middle America is the importance of safeguarding material, nonpublic information in family situations,\" Mr. Newkirk said. \"We are seeing more cases in which such information is passed on or misappropriated in family situations.\" **********Such family cases represented more than 10 percent of all the insider trading cases filed by the commission last year, a larger share than in recent years, he added. **********According to regulators, family members trading on inside information are among the transgressors easiest to spot. Unlike the Wall Street professionals involved in the elaborate insider-trading rings of the 1980's, individuals tend not to be active in the markets, so their transactions are more likely to jump out at regulators, who regularly review stock trades leading up to a company's acquisition or merger. **********Of course, the Federal Justice Department, whose power exceeds that of the S.E.C., may seek criminal sanctions against a professional insider-trading ring, while criminal charges are rare in family cases because of the smaller amounts of money involved. **********The S.E.C.'s recent crackdown has produced civil insider-trading complaints against the husband of a GTE Corporation administrative assistant; a Washington lobbyist for Kansas City Southern Industries, who reportedly shared merger details with friends and family; a Cray Computer Corporation employee and her husband; a father-son team at the FNB Rochester Corporation, a bank holding company, and the son of an executive at Tele-Communications Inc., the giant cable television company. **********As in most S.E.C. regulatory cases, each of the defendants settled the charges out of court without admitting or denying any wrongdoing. Their fines and penalties varied, depending on the amount of profits; their out-of-pocket expenses included substantial legal bills, and they were probably exposed to public scorn and embarrassment as well. **********Some of the cases involved accusations of misappropriation, a gentle form of theft, by which a relative wrongfully obtains sensitive information from a family member and then uses it for trading purposes. For example, a husband was accused of repeatedly misappropriating information from his wife, who was a confidential aide to GTE's chief executive. According to the S.E.C. complaint, the husband garnered profits of $13,810 by trading on tips he obtained between April and July 1990, when GTE was considering a merger with the Contel Corporation. To settle the case, he agreed to return his trading profits and to pay a matching sum in civil penalties. **********In the Tele-Communications case, the executive was asked in July 1993 to work on an acquisition from his home to insure the confidentiality of the talks. According to the S.E.C., his son learned of the deal, and purchased options to buy the stock of the target company. The settlement called for him to pay $76,894 in forgone profits and penalties. **********One securities lawyer recalled an earlier case in which an investment banker's brother-in-law secretly rifled the banker's briefcase at a family gathering and obtained information that he used to trade stock in advance of a takeover. **********Cases like these show how important it is for people who have confidential information either to withhold it from family members or to insure that family members do not trade on the news until it becomes public. Indeed, many large corporations have guidelines on when and whether family members may trade in corporate securities; smaller concerns may lack such formal policies, but usually have lawyers available to advise executives about family trading in company stock. **********At times, however, the S.E.C. has concluded that the person who transmitted the valuable information was more than indiscreet. In the Cray Computer case, which was settled last July, both the employee and her husband were cited by the commission, although the husband actually carried out all the disputed trades. The settlement called for the couple to turn over $24,545 in trading profits and $20,672 more in penalties. **********As this case shows, the opportunity to take advantage of inside information may be fleeting, but the penalty could resonate for some time."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/14/business/company-news-potash-stock-surges-on-export-pact-with-china.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-10-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 112, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "POTASH STOCK SURGES ON EXPORT PACT WITH CHINA", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; POTASH STOCK SURGES ON EXPORT PACT WITH CHINA", "body_text": " **********The shares of the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan rose yesterday after the company announced a new export contract with China.

Then he walked to the center of Grozny, where he met 60 other Russian veterans of the war being remembered today. **********During World War II, Stalin ordered mass deportations of the local Chechen population to Kazakhstan and western Siberia. After the war, thousands of Russians settled in Grozny, taking administrative jobs in running the region. **********Today, the veterans stood for a while on the shattered pavement outside the provisional government building here, waiting for orders. Then the administrators who have been sent from Moscow to run this haunted city told them to get on a bus. They drove past the ruins of apartment buildings that for some had once been home, past factories blasted practically to sand, past parks that are now only graveyards. **********\"My God!\" said Mr. Dmitriyev, his nose pressed against the glass of the bus like a boy on an eerie school trip. \"What have they done?\" **********It was a question he had promised himself he would not ask today, because he wanted to celebrate a victory that changed the world. **********\"I am so proud that I fought,\" he said, fighting tears from his clear gray eyes as the bus approached the heavily fortified Grozny airport. \"I am so proud that we won.\" **********There could hardly have been been a gloomier place to spend Victory Day than at Grozny airport, a dusty, remote area chosen only for security. The Russian authorities could not possibly have risked a parade on the cratered streets of the city without constant fear of sniper fire or mortar attacks from Chechen separatist fighters. **********But at the airport, thousands of Russian troops narrowed the likelihood of an attack. There was a parade and speeches, and lots of flowers were distributed -- men were given tulips and women received roses or lilacs. Because there were no medals to hand out, the military command awarded Russian soldiers fighting the rebels surplus army wristwatches. **********The Russian military commander, here, Gen. Mikhail Yegorev, also promised peace. \"I am sincerely telling you we have come here to establish peace,\" he said. But he added that first the Chechen rebels who have been fighting a war for independence since December would \"have to stop their aggression.\" **********The speech received no applause. As the general spoke, the veterans, sitting in seats of honor, mostly looked at their thick-soled shoes. **********\"I am standing here in agony,\" said Anastasia Parlona, 72, who was a communications officer in Ukraine and the Baltic during World War II. \"I lived through the great horror of our times. This is the place where we should remember the sacrifices, not in Moscow. Here the pain is easy to remember.\" **********Too easy, many would argue. It is written on practically every building on every street. Nobody seemed to want to talk about strategic alliances or aid for development. Many said they wanted to get the water and electricity back into service. **********After the ceremonies, the veterans were served lunch inside the perimeter of the 205th Army's military command base here. **********The city itself was silent and relatively safe during the day. Night has become the time for snipers and gun battles. The day is the time for pretending that the war does not exist. **********Russian soldiers have taken to standing in front of Grozny's most famous and ghastly building -- the ruins of the nine-story presidential palace. Young boys are always there with Polaroid cameras to photograph the victors as they stride through the rubble. **********Not everyone was gloomy about Grozny's future today. Vladimir Y. Zorin, who runs the Russian administration here, was full of hope. Asked if he saw anything ironic in honoring the remaining veterans today when so many of their colleagues and family members had died in the last five months, Mr. Zorin looked surprised. \"This is a day for looking forward,\" he said. \"It is a day to honor understanding and friendship between people. **********\"For those who are suffering we offer help.

She emerged impassive after 30 minutes and said she would make no comment. **********In an unusual joint statement, the French Interior Ministry and Foreign Ministry said that the French Government had never intended the affair to become public. But they said the American Embassy had been asked to withdraw the diplomats for activities incompatible with their status here. **********The statement did not say how many diplomats were involved, and some French reports said there may have been as many as six. **********In Washington, the State Department described the allegations as unjustified and said it was reviewing the incident. It spoke only of the accusations in the French press. **********\"We regard allegations in the French press, citing French Government sources, concerning purported official U.S. activities, as being unwarranted,\" a department spokeswoman, Christine Shelly, said. **********\"The handling of this matter in France is inconsistent with the approach that allies have taken to resolve sensitive matters in the past,\" she said. \"There is no reason for expelling any Americans, nor is the French Government calling for it.\" **********Other State Department officials, saying that the French planned no expulsions, added privately that the American officials would be moved out of France according to their regular rotations. **********A spokeswoman at the American Embassy in Paris, asked how many of the four embassy diplomats were still in France, said only, \"All of them are working or have worked at the embassy.\" She gave no further elaboration. **********Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Balladur tried to treat the matter lightly. \"The French people are friends of the American people and the French Government is a friend of the American Government,\" he said. \"Events like that occur regularly on both sides of the Atlantic.\" **********But seldom, if ever, have there been such spectacular sparks between allies, according to old C.I.A. hands and diplomats. Many said they could not recall anything to match the incident since the height of the cold war, when Moscow and Washington periodically cleaned out each other's spy networks. This time, the protagonists were officials who presumably dealt with each other regularly on such common threats as international terrorism and organized crime. **********A senior Administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said tonight that the French Government had fed the spying story to the news media in a background briefing. He speculated that the main aim was to move the spotlight away from a wiretapping scandal that has embarrassed the French Government. **********The French Interior Minister, Charles Pasqua, has been under fire this week for authorizing secret wiretaps, and the stir has set back Prime Minister Balladur's campaign to succeed President Francois Mitterrand in elections this spring. **********\"We're not speculating, but the issue may be related to Pasqua's political fortunes,\" the senior Administration official said. \"In France, the speculation is exactly that, in relation to the timing and the handling of the incident.\" **********The official said the French Government's background briefing with the news media about the accused spies was \"totally unprecedented.\" **********\"We're declining to get into the substance of the allegations except to say they're vastly overblown,\" the official added. **********Le Monde also speculated that Mr. Pasqua, who is in charge of the counterespionage service, would not be displeased by a report that distracted attention from the wiretapping scandal. **********That friendly countries also spy on each other's economic and business secrets these days is taken for granted. It is also assumed that friendly diplomats occasionally have privately been asked to leave after getting into mischief. **********Two years ago, French officials themselves were embarrassed by the disclosure of a 21-page Government document that targeted 21 American aerospace companies for industrial espionage. Yet a scandal of this dimension between allies has few, if any, recent parallels. **********The French struck back this time, according to official accounts cited by Le Monde, because the Americans broke the rules of the game -- offering bribes, in 500-franc (equivalent to $100) bills, to at least three high-ranking officials since 1992. **********\"The clandestine research detected concentrated essentially on French domestic politics as well as on the broad economic and commercial policies of our country, in particular in the audiovisual domain and in telecommunications,\" according to a counterespionage report quoted by the newspaper. **********Among the pieces of evidence gathered by the counterspies, the newspaper reported, were photographs of clandestine meetings between the C.I.A. agents and their French contacts, hotel registration papers and credit card imprints proving the use of false identities by American agents, and the serial numbers of 500-franc bills paid to one of the French officials. **********The newspaper's report detailed three approaches made by the Americans. In the first, a woman \"acting for the C.I.A. in Paris,\" approached an unnamed conservative Member of Parliament close to Mr. Balladur's Government. **********He informed counterespionage officials of the approach and was told to go along with it to try to trap the Americans, the report said. He was later approached seven times \"by a known C.I.A. officer coming from Brussels and operating under false identity,\" according to the report, and was offered bribes to disclose the French negotiating position on the global trade talks in 1992 and 1993. **********France compromised in response to Washington's demands to lower agricultural subsidies worldwide, but only at the last minute, at the end of 1993. The United States agreed to drop its insistence that Europeans stop trying to keep American movies and television programs from flooding their markets, but it demanded on quotas and subsidies for European-produced entertainment. **********The second approach, Le Monde said, was to an unnamed high official in the Ministry of Communications who was in charge of audiovisual policy. He, too, was offered bribes, the report said, for information about French strategy on audiovisual policy and on telecommunications. He, too, pretended to cooperate until very recently, the report said. **********The third person allegedly recruited by the C.I.A., according to the report, was a technician, also not named, for the international network of France Telecom, the country's telecommunications network. **********Until last Jan. 27, the report said, the technician pretended to work with the C.I.A., turning over \"documents and technical details on the structures and international networks of France Telecom, in exchange for remuneration and valuable technical materials.\" **********The previous day, Jan. 26, Mrs. Harriman was summoned by the Interior Minister, Mr. Pasqua, to his office. Mr. Pasqua told the American Ambassador what the counterespionage service had discovered, Le Monde said, and asked her to see to it that the five accused Americans left the country immediately. **********Mr. Pasqua repeated this demand in a letter sent to Mrs. Harriman on Feb. 1, Le Monde said. **********On Feb. 3, according to the newspaper, she replied to Mr. Pasqua that she would report the accusations to Washington. The Interior Minister summoned her again on Feb. 10, according to Le Monde, again asking her to get the accused diplomats out of the country soon. **********Mr. Pasqua informed President Mitterrand of the affair on Feb. 18, Le Monde said.

The problem has become particularly acute in the most recent phase of the scandals, which, by focusing on tax evasion and kickbacks to tax inspectors, cuts deep in a society that has long operated on the notion that only fools pay the Government what it says they owe. **********\"Of the 56 million inhabitants of the country, who knows how many would stay out of jail if you were to jail everyone who paid off tax inspectors,\" said Mr. Feltri. \"If you cut off the right hand of everyone who has paid the Guardia di Finanza, you'd have a country of left handed people.\" **********Like reformers in other countries that have been convulsed by political changes, Italy's judges also get hit with an historical judgment that paints them as avenging angels with no concern for the destruction they leave in their wake. **********\"The problem is that we have the same level of corruption, but we have destroyed a political class,\" said Lucio Caracciolo, editor of Limes, an Italian political review.  \"The result is loss. We have lost prestige, efficiency, and in some sense an attachment to democracy. Now we need a more rational approach to problems, and we have to admit that Tangentopoli was a bluff.\" **********In the Palace of Justice here, which remains the citadel of the nationwide corruption probe given Milan's role as Italy's financial and business center, prosecutors, dismissing arguments that they have overstepped any constitutional line, talk instead about getting on with their job. **********\"I don't think that it is pleasant for anyone that the continuous emergence of crimes exists,\" said Gherardo Colombo, a top member of the prosecuting team. \"It would be wonderful if we could say that all the crimes in this area have been discovered, but that hasn't been the case.\" **********\"We feel as though we are crabs,\" said Mr. Colombo. \"With the passage of time, the more we go forward, the more we move back; the more we discover, the more we have to work.\" **********In the Milan magistrate's office alone, 3,000 people have been investigated by the team since the first bribery case was brought in February 1992. Of these, Mr. Colombo said half have been charged, and are awaiting initial judgment on whether they will go to trial. Another 900 are awaiting trial, and 600 have actually been brought to court, he said. Of the 300-odd sentences handed down, only one -- involving a cemetery inspector from Milan -- has resulted in a jail sentence. **********Most agree that the magistrates' crusade has had some effect. \"For the first time, dirty laundry was washed in the piazza,\" said Mr. Feltri. \"Before, corruption was habitual, and society was convinced it was normal. Now people are more careful, they are more afraid of getting caught.\" **********But Italy -- deadlocked by the political confusion that followed the collapse of the old political system -- has still not managed to tackle some of the key sources of corruption. Public administration still functions on a buddy-system, while conflict of interest remains a dimly-understood notion for many Italians, including Mr. Berlusconi who has seen no problem in being both a Prime Minister and owner of a vast business empire -- including three television stations. **********Mr. Berlusconi remains the prosecutors' most vociferous opponent, and for obvious reasons. In the last month, he has been charged twice -- once as head of his giant Fininvest business empire, which is accused of having paid bribes to tax inspectors, and the second time for evading taxes on the purchase of property utside Milan. In a separate case against Publitalia -- the advertising arm of Fininvest that stands accused of sponsoring sports events as a way of concealing slush funds, prosecutors put its chief executive in jail for two weeks and for the first time, threatened to put the privately held company under public trusteeship. **********Mr. Berlusconi's campaign against the Milan prosecutors -- he calls them \"judges in red robes,\" in an allusion to their alleged leftist bias -- has been a running theme in Italy's recent political drama. But it has also clouded a serious look at the prosecutors' far-ranging powers, which even Mr. Berlusconi's critics agree is overdue. **********Sergio Romano, a respected political commentator, calls the current situation \"a constitutional skirmish between branches of government,\" in which the magistrates have assumed powers that \"hang like a sword of Damocles over the entire political class, continually conditioning their movements.\" **********\"They have come to identify themselves with their public mission and in the process, have become prisoners of a self-feeding process,\" said Mr. Romano in an interview. \"It is a typical police syndrome, which is constantly seeking results.\" **********Mr. Colombo marvels at the resistance he still finds to the idea that corruption is bad. As an example, he cited the recent case of a public official who sought a bribe from the wife of a businessman who was in jail on corruption charges. **********\"We have to measure our success in years because it will take years for the relationship between public administration and business to become correct,\" he said. \"And that change cannot happen as a result of the magistrature but through a change of the Italian culture. We must begin to believe that it is more convenient for a society to be clean rather than corrupt.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/03/business/outlook-1995-the-economy-california-starts-to-chase-the-blues.html": {"writer_name": "Sallie Hofmeister", "pub_date": "1995-01-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 702, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "California Starts To Chase the Blues", "print_headline": "OUTLOOK 1995: THE ECONOMY; California Starts To Chase the Blues", "body_text": " **********Across America, the economy of the 1990's is shaping up as the mirror image of the 1980's. **********A decade ago, California and the East Coast were booming; today, they lag behind the rest of the country. The Midwest, then known as the Rust Belt, buckled. Now an industrial revival is restoring much of the original finish to the region. **********Through much of the 1980's, blue-collar workers suffered as manufacturing underwent a painful restructuring to meet tougher world competition. In the 1990's, white-collar employees were lashed by a similar make-over of office-centered services. **********Remember the cold war? The nation's huge military buildup of the 1980's is now being matched by an equally rapid shrinkage of the military industry. **********The computer hardware surge of the last decade, symbolized by I.B.M. and Apple Computer Inc., has been supplanted by the software and networking revolution led by the Microsoft Corporation and Novell Inc. **********Wall Street remains on a roller coaster. Financial services slumped after the stock market crash in 1987. After a revival of the industry in the early 1990's, new traumas were created in 1994 by rising interest rates, the collapse of the bond market, the comeuppance of the hedge funds and the bankruptcy of Orange County, Calif. **********And through the decades, people and jobs continued to be drawn to suburbia and to regions, like the South and the Rocky Mountain states, with a reputation for livable comfort. **********The University of California at Los Angeles may have been overstating California's recovery when it chose \"Happy Days Are Here Again\" as a theme song for its annual business forecasting conference in December. **********\"I wouldn't say we're out of the woods,\" said Joe Mattey, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank in San Francisco. \"After an extended period of decline, conditions here have stabilized. But we're not back to pre-recession rates in terms of unemployment, housing sales and the other economic indicators.\" **********Still, California, lagging behind the national economy by about two years, is definitely crawling out of the trenches after having hit bottom in mid-1993. Though rising interest rates have slowed the housing recovery here in recent months, economists say holiday retail sales in 1994 were far ahead of the previous year. Moreover, construction, business services, tourism, a booming entertainment business and the export trade, bolstered by the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada, are all contributing to the recovery. **********Meanwhile, most of the rest of the West has been enjoying a strong boom, driven in part by migration from California and in part by the attractiveness of the mountain and desert states as locations for high-tech industries. **********U.C.L.A. predicts that nonfarm payrolls in California will rise 1.8 percent this year, below the national average of 2.6 percent, but will beat the nation next year with a 3.6 percent gain -- a forecast that some economists are calling overly optimistic. **********Military cutbacks continue to ravage the state, though job losses are not as great as they were earlier in the decade. They are also starting to be offset by growth in other areas, economists say. One study, by Joel Kotkin at the Center for the New West, found that entertainment and tourism have surpassed military-related industries and aerospace in employment in Southern California for the first time. **********Jack Kyser, chief economist for the independent nonprofit Economic Development Corporation, contends that the streamlining of the state environmental process and changes in workers' compensation laws in late 1993 are finally helping to lure employers to the state, although he had only anecdotal evidence. **********Some economists say the migration out of California, which has helped bolster the economies of surrounding states, has also slowed. As California grappled with the aftershocks of the recession, riots, an earthquake, military cutbacks, a construction downturn and a state fiscal crisis, neighboring states like Utah, Arizona, Nevada, Idaho and Oregon enjoyed some of the strongest growth in the country. **********Utah has used its low wages, a central location in the region and hard-working reputation to build a hub around Novell Inc. in software development and production. And, like Nevada and Arizona, it has also benefited as corporations have consolidated their computer back offices in low-cost states. **********Growth has slowed in Washington, meanwhile, because of layoffs at the Boeing Company.

Sir Patrick and Mr. Spring confirmed after their three-hour meeting that a disarmament commission had been discussed, but they did not elaborate on that or other aspects of the plan. Asked to assess the prospects for the peace effort, Sir Patrick said, \"There are sensible grounds for being hopeful.\" **********Officials familiar with the plan said it had three parts. First, the disarmament of the I.R.A. would be referred to a commission of international arms experts. Disarmament, called decommissioning by all sides and involving the destruction or impoundment of weapons at a neutral site, has been one of the chief blocks to the advancement of the peace effort. **********The Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, has insisted that decommissioning can only be done as part of full-fledged peace talks, not as a condition to their start. A senior British official, Michael Ancram, said over the weekend that Sinn Fein would not be invited to all-party talks \"unless we see the beginning of a credible process\" of disarmament. **********The possible ground for compromise, officials and analysts say, is in simultaneous announcement of the establishment of a disarmament commission and the convening of all-party talks, possibly this year, that would include Sinn Fein. Such a development would allow both sides to save face, telling their supporters that they had not weakened their positions. **********The second part of the plan envisions inclusive talks, but in two groupings, one including the British and Irish Governments, Sinn Fein, the predominantly Catholic Social Democratic Labor Party and the Alliance party, a 60-40 mix of Protestants and Catholics. The other group would involve the British and Irish Governments meeting with the Protestant Unionist parties. **********Officials acknowledged that there was no guarantee that Sinn Fein or the unionists would accept such arrangements, and that considerable negotiating and fine-tuning of precise terms of the plan would be needed. Until now, unionists have refused to sit at a table with Sinn Fein until the I.R.A. has totally disarmed. **********But it was the mainstream Ulster Unionist Party that first proposed a disarmament commission earlier this year. And Mr. Adams has never rejected the idea of a commission. Some analysts said Sinn Fein might agree to a commission that would take a year or two to study the issue, while full-fledged pace talks progressed. **********The third part of the plan involves the prisoner issue. Sinn Fein has demanded the early release of some of the 600 I.R.A. guerrillas now in British jails. Early release is also sought by political parties representing the 400 Protestant paramilitaries in jail. The plan of the two governments would be to release some of them once they have served half their terms. **********As Mr. Spring and Sir Patrick met today, a delegation of influential Irish-Americans visited leaders on all sides in Belfast and Dublin. The head of the delegation, former Representative Bruce Morrison of Connecticut, said that after meeting the leaders, including Mr. Adams and Mr. Bruton, \"the exact shape of the table\" for the peace talks had not been decided, but that \"things are happening that we consider helpful and hopeful.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/25/business/us-companies-evaluate-outlook-in-kobe-quake-area.html": {"writer_name": "Sheryl Wudunn", "pub_date": "1995-01-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 731, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Companies Evaluate Outlook in Kobe Quake Area", "print_headline": "U.S. Companies Evaluate Outlook in Kobe Quake Area", "body_text": " **********Thirty seconds after his alarm went off at 5:45 A.M. last Tuesday, Glenn Spargo, general manager of Sea-Land Service, had the jolt of his life. **********The earthquake that struck Kobe, where Mr. Spargo was living with his family, knocked out the electricity and made it impossible to conduct normal business. But Mr. Spargo convinced a friend to lend him a tugboat and he went to inspect the pier. There he got some bad news: His four cranes were damaged and the asphalt by the berths had sunk four to five feet. **********The terminals will take about six months to repair fully, and in the meantime he has been trucking his container loads to Osaka. But in the long term, he said, Sea-Land would remain in the area. **********\"Absolutely we'll remain in Kobe,\" Mr. Spargo said in a phone interview from the stricken city. \"We have a commitment to Kobe.\" **********Having checked on their families and employees and assessed the damage to their plants and offices, managers at American companies are only beginning to evaluate the prospects this year for business in the Kansai region, as the Osaka-Kobe-Kyoto area is known. For the most part, many say that earthquakes are a \"risk of doing business\" in Japan and have no plans to scale down, but with the recession here and the high cost of doing business in Japan, some are raising more fundamental questions. **********\"The Kansai politicians, economists and business organizations had such high hopes for this year, with the new airport and all, and it was going to be the year of Kansai,\" said Ron Siani, the administrator for the Kansai regional office of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan. \"Now, this is going to be destroyed. **********\"With China such a player in the world market, is it necessary to have a presence in Japan? Companies are looking to Singapore or another country to establish an Asian presence. It's a wild card, but what would happen if Tokyo was hit with an earthquake?

But the plant's opening will probably be delayed until around May, according to Jean-Pierre Millon, the subsidiary's general manager. In the meantime, Eli Lilly will ship products to its clients from the United States. **********\"The risk of earthquakes is there all throughout Japan,\" said Mr. Millon, who has spent the last week shuttling in his car among his damaged plant, his temporary and damaged offices and his Osaka hotel room. \"We have no plans to leave the area.\" **********Eli Lilly, which had its distribution interrupted for only one day, is planning to donate insulin and antibiotics to people living in shelters in Kobe, Mr. Million said. **********As a result of the earthquake, Shin Caterpillar Mitsubishi Ltd. might have an expanded market for hydraulic excavators that it makes in a plant in the western part of Kobe. Dorwin R. Larsen, general manager of the hydraulic excavator development center at Shin Caterpillar, said there was some damage to the office building and equipment in the design office and there would be some delays at the plant, which makes 10,000 excavators a year at one of Caterpillar's largest plants. **********\"There are already plenty of excavators around for that,\" Mr. Larsen said in a telephone interview, referring to the post-quake rebuilding that is getting under way in Kobe. **********\"I suppose they're going to need a lot of construction equipment for rebuilding,\" he said, but acknowledged he had not thought about it. \"I've been dealing with our people's immediate problems.

Now he fears that he will lose his rented home as she and her investment partner prepare to sell off parts of the town, about 50 miles northeast of Atlanta, which they purchased with big development plans in mind. A neighbor, Terry Kitchens, is worried about the same thing. \"If they say, 'Move out,' I get 30 days to load up,\" Mr. Kitchens said. **********Meanwhile, in California, the owner of Golden State Landscape Irrigation and Maintenance, Mark Booth, is still waiting to collect $8,100 for yard work at Ms. Basinger's home in the Woodland Hills section of Los Angeles. **********These are some of the not-so-glamorous people caught up in a multimillion-dollar contract battle-cum-bankruptcy brawl between the decidedly glamorous Ms. Basinger, star of \"Batman\" and wife of the actor Alec Baldwin, and Main Line Pictures Inc. **********The Basinger case is hardly a typical bankruptcy. But in its extremes, it highlights some of the ironies of the bankruptcy system, which has been flooded with cases in recent years as the stigma of \"going under\" has lessened. **********For openers, the case is one of those in which the \"bankrupt\" person manages to keep on living a life of luxury while creditors are forced to wait patiently to collect a fraction, if anything, of what they are owed. For Ms. Basinger, that means living in three homes on both coasts and spending $31,000 a month on clothes, pets and an ex-husband, among other things. **********The case is noteworthy as well because of the way the bankruptcy court's shield can be used as a sword. Some companies involved in labor disputes have invoked the shield to void union contracts. In Ms. Basinger's case, bankruptcy protection has allowed her to appeal a big jury verdict in the dispute with Main Line without having to post an expensive, perhaps unobtainable, $12 million bond guaranteeing payment if she loses, as required by state law. **********That has left small creditors like Mr. Booth in limbo, as Ms. Basinger and Main Line lurch slowly toward a final ruling on the questions of whether she was legally bound to appear in the 1993 movie \"Boxing Helena\" and hurt Main Line when she bowed out. **********For Mr. Brown, Mr. Kitchens and others in Braselton, a town with a hardscrabble history, the bankruptcy has been a rude awakening from a Hollywood dream. Instead of becoming a tourist attraction tied tightly to Ms. Basinger's name, Braselton is now just another asset in her bankruptcy -- and one with an uncertain future. **********As the case drags on, and the lawyers' bills mount (the litigants have already spent more than $3 million chasing each other through the courts), those holding the bag can only guess what they may get. **********Creditors desperate for their money have been known to go bankrupt themselves -- though not in this case, said John Reitman, the lawyer for the bankruptcy trustee handling Ms. Basinger's case. But, he said, small creditors cannot afford to force quicker action. **********Most creditors fall into this category, said Charles Normandin, who teaches bankruptcy law at Harvard Law School. Bankruptcy's little guys may wind up getting only 10 to 15 cents for each dollar they are owed, he said, but all they can do is wait. \"If I had a client come into my office and say, 'I've got $20,000 in an unsecured claim,' I'd say, 'File a proof of claim in the bankruptcy court and forget it,' \" he said. **********Unsecured creditors are at the end of the line in a personal bankruptcy case. And those lines have multiplied since the 1978 rewriting of the country's bankruptcy law, which generally made it easier for the financially swamped to walk away from most or all of their debts. **********Almost 4.4 million corporate and personal bankruptcy petitions were filed in the 1980's -- more than double the number filed in the 70's, according to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. Slightly more than that record number have already been filed this decade, though filings have declined slightly since the 1992 peak as the economy has improved. **********At the same time, Mr. Normandin said, legal costs have grown, with lawyers pocketing more of the money that could have gone to creditors. That happened largely because bankrupt corporations began hiring more expensive lawyers and their cases started raising complicated issues like pension rights and environmental liability. **********Bankruptcies filed by individuals have changed less, Mr. Normandin said. But flashy cases like Ms. Basinger's can annoy those who see so much money flushed through the courts while creditors wait years to collect a few thousand dollars.The Verdict **********The troubles for Ms. Basinger's creditors began in May 1993, when a jury in Los Angeles decided that Ms. Basinger had indeed agreed to appear in \"Boxing Helena,\" a film about a doctor who cut off his lover's arms and legs, and then reneged. Sherilyn Fenn got the vacant role and \"Boxing Helena\" opened to strong reviews but a weak box office in the late summer of 1993. **********Main Line won an $8.1 million award. To file an appeal, a bond of $12 million was required, to take account of interest and expenses that might pile up while the case continued. To get the bond, Ms. Basinger would have had to pledge $12 million in assets and pay perhaps $1 million or more. Five days after the verdict, Ms. Basinger instead filed for bankruptcy protection in Los Angeles. She claimed about $5 million in assets and $11 million in liabilities, including the Main Line award. (Ms. Basinger did not respond to requests for an interview for this article.) **********Last September, the California Court of Appeal reversed Main Line's victory because of the way the jury's decision was worded. The court said it could not tell whether the jury wanted the actress or her solely-owned professional service company to pay. If her corporation is liable, her assets and income might be outside Main Line's reach. A new trial, then more appeals, will probably take years unless the sides settle. **********While the wheels of justice creak and moan, Ms. Basinger's small creditors --those who arranged her travel plans or repaired her home -- go unpaid. And the folks of Braselton, population 450, learn that getting too involved with an actress can be dangerous. **********\"If I move, I'll have to move, I reckon,\" said Mr. Brown, who came here 52 years ago to pick cotton for the Braselton clan, which ran Braselton much like a company town, owning most of the land and buildings. The Braseltons sold 1,691 acres to Ms. Basinger and her backers in 1989. Mr. Brown now rents his unpainted, three-bedroom home from the Braselton/Basinger Limited Partnership for $60 a month, but suspects it will be torn down when it is sold to a new owner. He doesn't know where he will live then. **********Nearby, Mr. Kitchens runs Terry's Auto Center out of a building owned by the partnership. He and his wife and five children live in one of the partnership's rental properties as well. Mr. Kitchens, though still a Basinger fan, recently removed her signed publicity photo from the most honored position on his office wall, filling the space with a poster of supermodel Cindy Crawford. **********Even 29-year-old Anne Elisabeth Braselton Miller, a great-granddaughter of the Braseltons who settled here in 1876, might have to vacate the Braselton Furniture and Appliance store she runs near the town's lone stoplight. **********Ms. Basinger's life style stands in sharp contrast to that of people affected in Braselton, Los Angeles and elsewhere by her bankruptcy and failure as a developer. **********Bankruptcy documents refer to her Woodland Hills house, valued at $600,000, as well as to the apartment in Manhattan and house in Amagansett, L.I., owned by Mr. Baldwin. His properties are not part of the case. **********A July 1993 filing outlines Ms. Basinger's expenses, then running at a rate of $43,000 a month. The actress spent $6,100 a month for clothes and $4,000 for \"recreation, clubs and entertainment, newspapers, magazines, etc.\" Another $7,000 went to \"pet care and other personal expenses.\" Her ex-husband, Ron Britton, received $9,000 in alimony. **********A later filing trumpeted that Ms. Basinger had slashed her monthly expenses to $31,000 even though her \"life style has never been extravagant or lavish.\" In one filing, though, she reported $592,000 in furniture and clothing and $192,000 of jewelry. **********Main Line argued that Ms. Basinger was not entitled to the protection of Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization because she could pay all her debts in full -- if not out of current assets, then through future earnings. Agents for the actress, who commanded $3 million fees for films like \"The Real McCoy\" and \"Final Analysis,\" could \"pick up the telephone and engage Ms. Basinger's services\" in contracts worth more than enough to pay off the judgment, Main Line's president argued in a motion to dismiss the Chapter 11 petition. Chapter 11 allows a debtor to keep control of assets while proposing a plan to pay off creditors. **********Ms. Basinger, now 41 and starring in the just-released \"Ready to Wear,\" has countered that her high earning years are behind her. \"Actresses over 40 years of age are much less marketable than younger actresses,\" Ms. Basinger's lawyers said in one filing. Paying the Main Line claim plus her other debts, with interest, would have been impossible even if she turned over all her after-tax income for the rest of her life, they said. Instead, her payback proposal under Chapter 11 would have combined the sale of some assets with some future earnings. **********Last January, with the bankruptcy court seemingly unsympathetic to her efforts to reorganize, Ms. Basinger converted her bankruptcy to a Chapter 7 liquidation. That meant most of her assets -- including her interest in Braselton -- would have to be sold. Under Chapter 7, Ms. Basinger might get to keep $75,000 or so of her jewelry, furniture and clothing, a $300,000-plus I.R.A. and $50,000 of home equity but perhaps little else. No future earnings, however, would be thrown into the pot under Chapter 7.Current Status: Chaos **********The September Court of Appeal decision leaves everything in chaos. With the Main Line judgment reversed, Ms. Basinger could win a new trial and not have to pay the movie company anything, said one of her lawyers, Leslie A. Cohen. In that situation, the bankruptcy case might even be dismissed if her assets once more exceeded liabilities. **********Ms. Cohen, of the Los Angeles firm of Levene & Eisenberg, said Main Line never had an \"actual agreement\" with Ms. Basinger to star in its movie and therefore she should not have to pay the company anything. Even so, Ms. Cohen said, her client tried to settle. **********\"Instead of trying to work with us, Main Line chose to reject everything and just fight and fight and fight,\" Ms. Cohen said, adding that creditors \"should direct their complaints, if any, toward Main Line.\" **********Not so, said Eric Landau, a lawyer for the company. Main Line \"was simply trying to recover the damage caused by Ms. Basinger,\" he said. \"Main Line has never rejected a reasonable settlement proposal.\" **********Braselton folks seem weary of talk of the actress and her financial turmoil. Newspapers and TV programs from as far away as Australia covered her \"purchase\" of the town. **********Despite all the fuss, people here know that the movie star's role in the purchase never lived up to its billing. Virtually all the $20 million used to buy a chunk of the town came from the pension fund of the Ameritech Corporation, the Baby Bell based in Chicago. Money Ms. Basinger contributed was either lent to her by Ameritech or essentially given as a kind of finder's fee. **********Ameritech's pension fund bought in because of the development potential of the property, located along Interstate 85. Fund executives teamed with Ms. Basinger because the actress, who grew up in nearby Athens, Ga., was the person the Braseltons wanted to deal with. The executives also thought the actress could give the project \"a certain aura,\" said a person involved in the deal. Moreover, because most of the stock of the town bank was put in her name, Ameritech did not have to become a bank holding company. **********Ameritech now is less enamored of its investment and has put the partnership's property back on the block, not only because of Ms. Basinger's troubles but also because of the drop in land values in the area and a change in investment strategy. **********Ms. Basinger's bank stock brought $1.5 million in a bankruptcy auction. The partnership's land is listed with an Atlanta broker for $8.5 million, about half what Ameritech paid. Ms. Basinger's creditors are not likely to see anything from the land sale because the actress can share in the proceeds only if Ameritech recoups its original investment. **********Braselton residents were excited when Ms. Basinger announced that she was buying their town. There was talk of restoring the turn-of-the-century stores and houses, of making Braselton an historic theme park, of installing a movie studio in the old bank and dry goods building. **********Instead, little of note has happened other than the tearing down of some rickety buildings. **********In October Congress passed a law setting up a nine-member commission to study the bankruptcy system and report back by mid-1997 with suggestions for improvement. **********Mr. Normandin, the Harvard bankruptcy expert, expects little to change. Americans have long been more understanding than their European ancestors toward deadbeats. \"This country was founded by debtors and to some extent you've always had a pro-debtor bankruptcy law,\" Mr. Normandin said. **********Just listen to Mr. Kitchens, the mechanic. \"I was feeling more for her than for myself,\" he said, when asked his reaction to the bankruptcy and sale of some of Braselton. \"If I had my way, I would have done something to help her.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/02/business/the-media-business-broad-deregulation-sought-in-cable-and-phone-services.html": {"writer_name": "Edmund Andrews", "pub_date": "1995-02-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 842, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Broad Deregulation Sought In Cable and Phone Services", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Broad Deregulation Sought In Cable and Phone Services", "body_text": " **********In a sweeping bid to deregulate the telecommunications industry, Senate Republicans proposed legislation yesterday that would end all price controls for cable television after one year and let the regional Bell companies enter the $ 60 billion long-distance market after three years. **********The proposal, which would also eliminate longstanding restrictions on the number of television and radio stations a company can own, drew criticism from consumer advocates and complaints from telephone companies, which say the proposal would hinder their efforts to compete in the cable business. **********But Senator Larry Pressler, the South Dakota Republican who introduced the proposal, said in a statement yesterday, \"Competition, not regulation, is the best way to spur innovation and the development of new services.\" **********Senator Pressler, who is chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, said yesterday that he would circulate the draft bill among Democrats and Republicans and seek a bipartisan consensus before introducing a formal piece of legislation. As a result, the bill is certain to be modified considerably in the coming weeks. **********The bill would slash regulations much more sharply than a similar measure proposed last year by Democratic lawmakers. **********The most confrontational proposal would repeal cable television rate controls, which were passed in 1992. During the last two years, Federal regulators have ordered the cable television operators to cut their prices by about 17 percent, generating furious opposition from the industry. **********The bill would also give cable television companies a brief respite from competition by the telephone companies. A separate provision would block the Federal Communications Commission for one year from approving any applications by telephone companies to provide \"video dialtone\" service, a regulatory term that basically means cable television programming. **********If adopted, the provision would set back plans by most of the Bell companies, several of which have already received approval to start video services and would be blocked retroactively from constructing the new networks. **********The bill would also make it easier for telephone and cable operators in the same market to merge. Such mergers are permitted in rural areas, whose definition would be changed by the proposal to mean areas with fewer than 100,000 people from the current threshold of 10,000 people. Telephone executives said the new bill would permit mergers in about half the communities in the United States. **********\"For cable consumers, it's a bad thing,\" said Brad Stillman, legislative counsel for the Consumer Federation of America, which lobbied strongly for cable television rate regulation, \"because it's going to cost them 3 billion bucks because the companies are going to raise prices as high as they can.\" **********Like the bill that almost passed Congress last year, the new plan is intended to promote open competition between the segments of the communications industry that have been divided into separate, protected realms by current regulation. It would allow cable television and local telephone companies to enter each other's markets, force telephone companies to adopt changes that make it easy for rivals to interconnect and would lift restrictions that prevent the Bell companies from offering long-distance service or manufacturing equipment. **********But neither the Bell companies nor long-distance carriers were entirely happy with the plan outlined yesterday. The AT&T Corporation, the nation's biggest long-distance company, said it \"strongly disagreed\" with any provision that would automatically allow the Bell companies into their market on a particular date. **********Lobbyists for the regional Bell companies said they were not happy either, complaining that the bill would force them to open their local telephone markets entirely, while slowing their entry into cable television and long-distance. **********Bell company executives said they were particularly incensed at the one-year restriction on providing cable television, mainly because most of them had persuaded Federal courts to overturn a provision of existing law that kept them out of that market. But they also complained about provisions that would block them for a year from offering \"incidental\" long-distance service in conjunction with cellular telephone service or from manufacturing equipment. Such provisions would be more restrictive than those in last year's Democratic bill. **********Senator Pressler and other Republican lawmakers argue that most of current regulations, which were adopted amid a concern that telephone and cable companies could use their traditional monopolies to stifle new competitors, have become outdated by new competition. Cable television operators argue, for example, that they now face competition from direct-broadcast satellites and will soon have to defend themselves against the phone companies. **********But Democratic lawmakers have been much more cautious about deregulation. The Clinton Administration has made it clear that it opposes legislation that would simply let the Bell companies enter the long-distance business on a certain date."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/26/business/wall-street-a-fertility-drug-grows-scarce.html": {"writer_name": "Andrea Adelson", "pub_date": "1995-02-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 911, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Wall Street; A Fertility Drug Grows Scarce", "print_headline": "Wall Street; A Fertility Drug Grows Scarce", "body_text": " **********MARIE M. DUENAS learned last week that her mail order pharmacy had been cleaned out of her drug. \"I feel like an addict,\" she says, explaining her anxiety. Ms. Duenas counts herself among the fortunate, however. She has enough Pergonal -- one of the most widely prescribed fertility-boosting drugs in the United States -- left over from previous failed attempts at fertilization to try again. In her efforts to become pregnant the 28-year-old Bostonian quit a public relations job three years ago. **********Women like Ms. Duenas and many doctors prescribing Pergonal are baffled and angry at the severe shortage of the drug. Pergonal and Metrodin are the two best-selling fertility drugs made by Ares-Serono S.A. of Switzerland. Infertility affects more than 2.5 million American couples and Zev Rosenwaks, director of the Center for Reproductive Medicine at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, faults Ares-Serono for failing to stockpile a contingency supply of Pergonal as the company began a changeover to a purer version of Metrodin. \"It has created needless anxiety for many patients,\" he says. **********Two years ago, Ares-Serono introduced a new Metrodin whose production has contributed to the shortage of Pergonal. Both Pergonal and Metrodin are made from the urine of postmenopausal women. Urine is collected twice-a-day from 100,000 donors, whose health must be monitored constantly. But making the new Metrodin requires 25 percent more urine and in the process destroys a hormone that helps regulate menstrual cycles and is an essential component in Pergonal. **********Ares-Serono is also planning to have both Pergonal and Metrodin genetically engineered. And because it expects to receive regulatory approval to start marketing synthetic or recombinant versions of the drugs within the year, says Gina Cella, a spokeswoman for the American arm of the company in Norwell, Mass., Ares-Serono is unwilling to increase the number of urine donors or build more processing capacity in order to make more Pergonal. **********Some fertility specialists are threatening to boycott Ares-Serono's drugs once the shortage ebbs, which is expected after a rival drug, Humegon, comes on the market in April. Others are unconvinced that the new drugs will be suitable substitutes -- or even necessary. **********Dr. Mark L. Jutras, a specialist is reproductive medicine in Orlando, contends Ares-Serono is making Pergonal scarce out of greed. \"The new drug is no more effective than the old, but is more costly to produce,\" he says. Since price setting typically occurs when a drug is introduced, Ares-Serono stands to profit more from a new product than an old one, he reasons. **********Some Wall Street analysts estimate that Ares-Serono derived roughly $153 million, or 24 percent of its 1994 total revenues of $637 million, from Pergonal sales and is already suffering from the worldwide shortage. According to Edmund A. Debler, a biotechnology analyst for Mehta & Isaly, a brokerage firm, a continuing shortage of Pergonal and a developing shortfall of Metrodin will also hurt the company's first half earnings. **********Mr. Debler and other analysts forecast per share earnings of between $15.50 and $20.40 this year, but they predict better profits and even a vibrant 20 percent increase in sales in 1996. **********Ares-Serono's revenues and earnings peaked in 1992 and have been in decline primarily because of reductions in price and Government reimbursements in Italy, its largest market. Despite a 60 percent increase in sales of Metrodin worldwide last year, the company was unable to make up for an estimated $170 million shortfall in revenue from Italy, says Mr. Debler. **********The potential profits from Ares-Serono's drugs -- and its plan to have most of its eight-drug line genetically engineered by 1996 -- keep its shares trading at a multiple of 40 times estimated 1995 earnings, similar to biotechnology stocks like Genentech. The stock, which is traded on the Zurich and Geneva exchanges, ended last week at 755 Swiss francs. The price has dropped 13 percent from a high of 865 in December 1993, hurt mostly by bad news from Italy but unmoved by the Pergonal shortage, says Sam Islay, of Mehta & Islay. \"Despite sharply lower earnings, investors have looked beyond to the long-term attractions.\" **********The new Metrodin has yet to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration for sale in the United States. According to Ares-Serono, this drug is preferable to Pergonal because it can be self-injected into an arm or thigh instead of the buttocks. **********In the meantime, Ares-Serono is creating ill-will. Even though the company's fertility drugs have no patent protection, until now it has had a de facto monopoly. The in vitro fertilization program at the University of Southern California has not received Pergonal since November, says Nanette Bahl, the office manager. She says her clinic intends to switch to Humegon, made by Akzo Nobel N.V. of the Netherlands. **********Last month, Organon, the New Jersey subsidiary of Akzo, received F.D.A. approval to begin selling Humegon, a urine-derived fertility drug that has been sold overseas for 20 years. \"What Serono has succeeded in doing is driving everyone to Organon,\" says Ms. Bahl. **********This development could add perhaps 5 percent to the parent company's profits, says Mr. Islay. Akzo, a conglomerate, is traded as American Depository Receipts on Nasdaq at $58.25. **********The company has been swamped with phone calls from women awaiting treatment, says Craig A. Rothenberg, an Organon spokesman. \"These are incredibly stressed patients.\" The company intends to start marketing the drug even before an adequate backlog of inventory is in place.  \"We know full well our stocks will be depleted instantly.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/18/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-programmers-form-latin-group.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1995-10-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 121, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Programmers Form Latin Group", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Programmers Form Latin Group", "body_text": " **********Twelve television networks and programming services are forming the Television Association of Programmers -- Latin America, to be known as T.A.P.

Dyna smiles on the cover of Hallmark greeting cards. Tens of millions of Nestle Crunch chocolate bars feature Dyna's face. As readers peruse this column over the breakfast table, they may even see Dyna on the front of their boxes of Cheerios cereal. **********And who is Dyna Taylor? Ms. Taylor is a young California woman who contends she is the face of Pocahontas. **********\"Pocahontas,\" of course, is the animated Walt Disney feature about the legendary American Indian princess. The movie has grossed more than $75 million since it opened less than two weeks ago. **********Ms. Taylor, on the other hand, was paid $200 in modeling fees by Disney. She received no screen credit and she is disappointed. **********\"Without a face, Pocahontas is not much of a person, even if she is a cartoon character,\" said Ms. Taylor, a student majoring in graphic design for advertising and product packaging. **********For its part, Disney says Ms. Taylor was not the sole or even a major influence for the look of the Pocahontas character. Glen Keane, the supervising animator for \"Pocahontas\" at Walt Disney Pictures in Burbank, Calif., said in an interview that if the producers had asked him whether Ms. Taylor deserved a film credit for \"Pocahontas,\" he would have said no. **********\"Actually, I would have had to draw up a list of maybe 15 people for that,\" Mr. Keane said, including a young black woman and an American Indian woman. Ms. Taylor is of Filipino descent. **********Still, Mr. Keane thought enough of Ms. Taylor's modeling efforts to autograph a picture of Pocahontas for her that reads, \"To Dyna, with gratitude for the inspiration you gave us.\" **********Granted, Disney's Pocahontas has waist-length hair and Ms. Taylor has shorter, curlier hair. And Pocahontas's figure is more voluptuous than what Ms. Taylor describes as her \"pretty good\" figure. But many elements of Ms. Taylor's face, especially her jaw line, are similar. **********Ms. Taylor says she is unsure about whether to sue Disney but has consulted a lawyer, who has advised against a lawsuit. **********Cases like Ms. Taylor's, while rare, reflect the often hazy provenance of animated features, where a variety of human performers can be claimed as influences in the illustration of characters. **********A Disney spokesman said he was not aware of any lawsuit by a model or other performer for screen credit or other compensation for work in the studio's animated features, which include top-grossing movies like \"Beauty and the Beast\" and \"The Little Mermaid.\" **********Nor is Disney likely to be successfully sued, lawyers say, because animation does not carry the certitude of photographs or films with live actors. **********When Ms. Taylor first modeled for Disney almost three years ago, she was an 18-year-old student at the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, which was founded by Disney and which regularly uses students to help in its productions. At the time, Ms. Taylor was flattered to be part of the film-making process. **********The performers in the speaking and singing roles of Pocahontas received screen credit and have even appeared in promotional tours for the movie. But Ms. Taylor has only been indirectly recognized in a scattering of newspaper and magazine articles, including a brief reference in Entertainment Weekly and a television appearance on \"Entertainment Tonight.\" **********Konrad Trope, the Beverly Hills entertainment lawyer whom Ms. Taylor consulted, said Disney could marshal the best lawyers in the business against Ms. Taylor and also privately ostracize her from modeling work. He added that he had no affiliation with Disney but lectures on legal matters at the California Institute of the Arts, where Ms. Taylor is currently in her senior year. **********\"The problem Dyna Taylor has is that she just went in and did it and she was flattered to do it,\" Mr. Trope said. \"She's over 18 so she can't claim she's a minor. And as many Cal Arts students do, they give away their services for bubkes. After all, look where she is in the food chain of Hollywood. They can always get somebody else.\" **********Ms. Taylor's run-in with \"Pocahontas\" began in September 1992, when a graduate of California Institute of the Arts now working for Disney asked Ms. Taylor to send the studio two rolls of black-and-white film showing her face. **********What followed were four modeling sessions held intermittently over three years, during which she was extensively sketched and videotaped. At one point, 15 animators surrounded her and sketched her face from a variety of angles. **********Mr. Keane, the film's supervising animator, acknowledged that Ms. Taylor was one of the first faces that inspired the animated character. But, he said, \"I find inspiration where I can.\" **********Mr. Keane said many other young women had inspired Pocahontas, including Jamie Pillow from the Pasadena Art Center; Natalie Belcon, a black woman whom Mr. Keane's son met at a martial arts class, and Charmaine Craig, an American Indian actress who appeared in the film \"White Fang 2.\" **********Mr. Keane acknowledged that these other women had been used for \"live-action reference\" -- in other words, for Pocahontas's body when she was shown running, jumping and walking -- and only partly for the character's face. **********Despite her disappointment over the lack of recognition, Ms. Taylor, who works as a cashier in a clothing store in a local mall near her college, gets a kick out of seeing so much Pocahontas paraphernalia around Southern California. **********She is even considering buying a T-shirt with a big Pocahontas face on it, but not just yet. \"Maybe when I'm in a really goofy mood,\" she said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/18/business/time-warner-gets-preview-of-cnn-s-future.html": {"writer_name": "Mark Landler", "pub_date": "1995-09-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1176, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Time Warner Gets Preview Of CNN's Future", "print_headline": "Time Warner Gets Preview Of CNN's Future", "body_text": " **********Last Wednesday, in the midst of his protracted negotiations with Ted Turner, Gerald M. Levin took time out for a tour of Cable News Network's sprawling newsroom in Atlanta. Mr. Levin, the chairman of Time Warner Inc., greeted some of CNN's senior news producers and lingered at a presentation of the network's fledgling interactive ventures. **********With Time Warner seemingly on the verge of clinching a deal to acquire CNN's parent company, Turner Broadcasting System Inc., for about $8 billion, Mr. Levin's visit to the CNN newsroom was fraught with meaning. **********Executives at Time Warner and Turner said Mr. Levin was determined to give the 24-hour news network a central role in what would be the world's largest entertainment company. **********Editors at CNN and Time Inc., a unit of Time Warner, held a series of meetings last week to begin hatching ideas for editorial services that bridge print and electronic media: TV shows based on magazines like Time and People; on-line services that use CNN's news feed; even a sports cable network drawing on the resources of Sports Illustrated. **********\"When you add the editorial clout of Time and Fortune to the worldwide distribution of CNN, you've got a substantial powerhouse,\" said Porter Bibb, a media-industry banker at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company. **********But CNN and Time reporters would do well to ask some follow-up questions: How will Turner's scrappy news operation fit with Time Warner's more stolid magazines? Will CNN be able to turbocharge Time's halting efforts to break into electronic media? Will Time bring some editorial sophistication to CNN's rip-and-read style? **********The editor in chief of Time Inc., Norman Pearlstine, and the president of CNN, Tom Johnson, both declined to comment on any plans before a deal is announced. But Mr. Pearlstine and two other Time Inc. executives, Walter Isaacson and Paul Sagan, met with Mr. Johnson in Atlanta a week ago to discuss potential synergies. **********At this point in the talks, Mr. Turner, chairman and president of Turner Broadcasting, would continue to run CNN and the network would remain in Atlanta. But longer term, said people inside the companies, Mr. Turner and Mr. Levin may merge the news operations. At a minimum, the news bureaus of CNN and Time Inc. would share office space. **********Turner Broadcasting does not stand to gain huge savings by merging CNN with Time Inc., as it would if it merged the network with CBS News or NBC News. But one senior Turner executive said there could be \"very substantive cooperation\" between CNN and Time Inc. **********Still, no company has ever tried to integrate print and TV news organizations of this size. CNN has 2,500 editorial employees, 30 news bureaus around the world and $600 million in annual revenue. Time Inc. publishes 24 magazines and has $3.4 billion in revenue. **********Even on a smaller scale, some media experts said, print and electronic news operations do not easily mesh. Reese Schonfeld, a veteran cable-television executive who was the first president of CNN, said the network might be able to draw on Time's magazines for help in soft news areas like fashion. But Mr. Schonfeld predicted that the collaboration would not go beyond that. **********\"There's just too much competition,\" said Mr. Schonfeld, who began his career in the 1940's at United Press when the wire service was trying unsuccessfully to break into electronic media through a venture with Movietone, the newsreel producer owned by 20th Century Fox. **********One area where Time Inc. and CNN plan to cooperate is in financial news. CNN is starting a business news channel, CNN Financial News, or CNNFN, next January. And executives at CNN said Fortune and Money magazines would be tremendous resources for the fledgling network: Through Fortune, CNNFN would gain access to top corporate executives; drawing on Money, it would be able to offer personal finance news to compete with NBC's business cable network, CNBC. **********Multimedia is another area of potential collaboration. CNN is already testing an interactive service on Time Warner's full-service cable network in Orlando, Fla. The network will probably also have a presence on Pathfinder, Time Warner's site on the World Wide Web, an area of the Internet where text, graphics, sound and video are blended. **********CNN has its own on-line service and a venture with the Intel Corporation to deliver news programming to desktop computers. But some media experts said that the venture had a slow start. If a deal is reached, the service, CNN at Work, could add material from Fortune. **********Conversely, some executives said CNN could help Time Inc. expand its magazines into television formats -- an area where the company has met with scant success. Although Time Warner's cable division started a successful 24-hour news service, New York One, the magazine division has had a surprisingly low profile on the channel. **********\"They have such a strong editorial core that it's almost shocking that Time has not elevated them into electronic media,\" Mr. Bibb said. **********But if Time Inc. has been slow to break into television journalism, its magazines have mastered the craft of analytical and investigative journalism. Some media experts said CNN could use that expertise. **********\"We still do primarily breaking news,\" said a Turner executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \"I think that has been a valid criticism of CNN, in comparison to newspapers and magazines.\" **********Mr. Bibb also said CNN could benefit from editorial executives like Mr. Pearlstine, a former executive editor of The Wall Street Journal, and Mr. Isaacson, a former senior editor of Time magazine who now heads the new-media efforts of the magazine division. **********\"Lou Dobbs and Ed Turner are running that shop themselves,\" said Mr. Bibb, referring to Mr. Dobbs, an executive vice president of CNN and anchor of its daily business news program, and Mr. Turner, an executive vice president and news director of the network. **********Indeed, some CNN executives said they were worried that Time Inc. would end up dominating the network. Mr. Pearlstine has close ties to Mr. Levin. Before joining Time Warner, he briefly ran a venture firm that experimented with delivering print media in new ways. **********Time is not about to move CNN to New York. \"It would be nuts to take a low-cost, efficient news operation and move it into the Time-Life Building,\" said a senior Time Inc. executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity. **********Yet some media experts said CNN could use an injection of new editorial blood, even if its center of gravity shifts to New York. Mr. Schonberg said CNN would thrive as part of a broader media empire because the network had grown far beyond its Atlanta roots. **********\"To the extent that the focus shifts from Atlanta to New York, that's for the good,\" Mr. Schonfeld said. \"You wouldn't publish the International Herald Tribune in Lyons; you'd publish it in Paris.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/05/world/rival-claims-to-island-chain-bring-edginess-to-asia-s-rim.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Shenon", "pub_date": "1995-04-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 618, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rival Claims to Island Chain Bring Edginess to Asia's Rim", "print_headline": "Rival Claims to Island Chain Bring Edginess to Asia's Rim", "body_text": " **********China and its Southeast Asian neighbors say they are eager to avoid a military clash over a chain of potentially oil-rich islands in the South China Sea, but their recent actions suggest that they may be girding for a fight. **********The dispute over the Spratly Islands grew more serious last week when the Philippines announced that it had torn down or blown up Chinese territorial markers on several of the islands and seized four Chinese trawlers. Vietnam accused Taiwan of firing on Vietnamese transport ships that came near the largest of the Spratlys. **********Six nations -- China, the Philippines, Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei -- claim all or part of the Spratlys, a chain of hundreds of islands reefs, atolls and sandbanks across 40,000 square miles of the South China Sea.

But after the Americans left their base in Subic Bay in the Philippines in 1992, the American security umbrella has mostly disappeared. **********Southeast Asian leaders have long worried that China would someday use the Spratlys as a means to assert control over the entire South China Sea -- turning it, as Asian diplomats often say, into a \"Chinese lake.\" **********Those worries turned into alarm in February, when the Philippines announced that the Chinese had built a military-style structure atop a reef in the Spratlys also claimed by the Philippines.

If Istiayaak came back now, he would be ostracized by a considerable portion of the community.\" **********Part of the solidarity to which South African Muslims cling is a widespread hostility to the United States, based on its support for Israel and its war against Iraq. This conviction that America is anti-Islam was the one factor friends could think of that might have attracted an otherwise unpolitical young man like Mr. Parker to the company of an Islamic militant like the man accused of masterminding the bombing, Ramzi Ahmed Yousef. **********\"The C.I.A. does not have a very good reputation here,\" said Akhmed Davids, a historian prominent among Cape Town Muslims. \"They can get away with their viciousness, so people say why shouldn't others get away with viciousness perpetrated against them?\" **********After Mr. Davids expressed his opinion of Mr. Parker to the local newspaper -- \"I called him a rat,\" he said today -- a relative of Mr. Parker phoned to explain that the news was all wrong.

His father, who died a few years ago, owned a small grocery store. One uncle runs a printing shop. A brother is a butcher. (Law-enforcement officials and others have provided various spellings of Mr. Parker's given name, but family members here spelled it Istiayaak.) **********As a teen-ager, Mr. Parker decided he would be a Muslim clergyman, an imam. He attended an Islamic seminary in South Africa, and then went to the Islamic University in Islamabad. He was five months from completing his degree, after which relatives said he hoped to become imam of a mosque in South Africa. **********\"He explains the whole world in terms of the Koran,\" his uncle said. **********He was described by friends and family as devoutly religious, but not politically involved. \"A bit docile,\" said a South African who studied with him for two years in Islamabad. Another schoolmate described Mr. Parker as, \"not a fundamentalist or a modernist. I would call him liberal orthodox, very religious but very flexible.\" **********The two schoolmates graduated and returned to South Africa more than a year ago, and they said they had not kept in close touch with Mr. Parker. His last visit home was about eight months ago, and no one recalls detecting any new political leanings at the time. **********His uncle said the student phoned his mother last week after being taken into custody. He did not disclose where he was phoning from, but told her not to worry and promised to call at the end of Ramadan, the Muslim holiday that concludes at the end of February. **********The family first heard on the radio Monday that Mr. Parker had led authorities to Mr. Yousef, and that United States officials said he was motivated by the $2 million reward. **********\"We were shocked, and we felt the story could not be right, that he would betray someone, and for money,\" said a sister, who like most other family members and friends insisted her name not be published for fear of inviting the wrath of Islamic militants. \"We sit around trying different ways to make the story work.

Travelers plans to merge the Aetna businesses with its own property and liability insurance units and create a new company which will sell stock to the public next year. **********Travelers executives expect to eliminate about $300 million of costs and about 3,300 jobs from the combined divisions in the next two years. **********The deal is a milestone for the Hartford-based companies, which started the 1980's as two of the country's best known and strongest insurers. But bad real estate investments, a surge in environmental cleanup claims from corporate customers and chronic problems in controlling expenses led the companies to look outside themselves for help. **********Travelers, which had more severe financial problems than Aetna did, turned to Sanford I. Weill, the Wall Street entrepreneur. Mr. Weill bought the company in  1993 for about $3.5 billion in stock of the Primerica Corporation and subsequently changed the combined company's name to Travelers. **********Aetna, after years of mixed success from shrinking its property and liability businesses and trying to cut costs, turned earlier this year to Richard Huber, a former banker, to develop and execute a strategic plan. **********The new company will operate initially under both the Aetna and Travelers names, Mr. Weill, the Travelers chief executive, said, and could earn $1 billion after taxes in three years. This year, the Travelers property and liability businesses are expected to earn about $400 million, while those of Aetna are expected to lose $120 million. The loss is mostly attributable to a $750 million increase in Aetna's reserves to cover claims from corporate policy-holders now calling on those policies to pay for environmental clean-ups. **********Because the purchase does not require issuing any new Travelers shares, and because Travelers executives have a strong record in merging operations, the company won the approval of traders yesterday. Travelers shares rose $3.75, to $58.875, an all-time high close. **********Aetna's stock, though, fell $3.875 a share, to $72, amid concerns that Aetna's per-share earnings would decline because of the sale. Investors were also uncertain about when and how effectively Aetna would spend its cash hoard to buy companies in its remaining businesses of health care and life insurance. **********\"There is already a lot of speculation about what other managed health care companies Aetna might want,\" Margo Vignola, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company, said. She noted that Pacificare Health Systems of Cypress, Calif., United States Healthcare Inc. of Blue Bell, Pa., and Humana Inc. of Louisville,  Ky., had been mentioned as possible targets, because they are \"good-sized, growing and have a major presence in their regional markets.\" **********Ronald Compton, Aetna's chairman, said the $4 billion would be used to acquire companies with proven management, with a capacity to grow faster than they have been and with strength in markets where Aetna is relatively weak. \"We  are a growth stock now,\" he said. **********Travelers will pay Aetna from a variety of sources, including sales of preferred stock, bonds and, eventually, a public stock offering in the new company. Travelers will also contribute $1.1 billion of capital to the new company, roughly covering an increase of more than $1 billion in reserves needed to pay asbestos and other claims. **********Earlier this year, Travelers collected $830 million from the sale of its health care business. Travelers is also close to selling its RCM Capital subsidiary, a San Francisco money management firm with $25 billion of assets, to Dresdner Bank. **********Travelers plans to sell about 18 percent of the new company to outside investors -- including Aetna, which promised to buy $200 million of stock. But Mr. Weill took exception to speculation that Travelers would leave the business  once the deal was completed and it could sell at a high price. **********\"We are buying Aetna to enter the business, not to leave it,\" Mr. Weill said. He added that the merging of the two businesses might not be as daunting as it sounded, since both companies had plans to reduce expenses in 1996, and the $300 million of expense cuts amount to only 15 percent of their combined $2 billion of fixed expenses. About half the job cuts are expected in Hartford, where the new company will be based. **********Sean Mooney, chief economist at the Insurance Information Institute, a group  financed by insurers, said that mergers of competing companies might be the most attractive way to expand, \"since this is an industry that grows only at about the same rate as the economy.\" **********With too many companies chasing too few customers, Mr. Mooney said, property  and liability insurers have had difficulty raising prices and their profits have tended to be lower than other companies their size. **********Even so, he noted that the industry attracted financiers who envisioned big,  Warren Buffett-style profits from managing the companies' stock and bond investments. **********Maintaining income from premiums is a chronic problem for insurers, since whenever their premiums get high enough to produce large profits, they often lose large corporate customers that opt to insure themselves. Often, high insurance premiums also attract new specialized companies created to service niche markets -- as with catastrophe insurance after Hurricane Andrew in 1994. **********\"This should be a fabulous investment for Travelers,\" said Robert A. Spass, managing partner of Insurance Partners, an investment group in New York. \"There  will basically be one less competitor,\" he said. Weaker companies like Aetna; Continental Insurance, which merged earlier this year with the CNA Financial Corporation, and Home Insurance, which was bought by the Zurich Insurance Company, he noted, had been criticized for keeping prices low just to hold customers. **********Mr. Spass said the industry was likely to see more mergers or acquisitions. The Talegen insurance unit of the Xerox Corporation has been for sale for two years, he noted, and the Cigna Corporation's plan to divide its property and liability businesses into two parts -- one selling new policies and the other devoted only to paying claims of old policies -- was a prelude to a sale or merger."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/29/business/how-to-succeed-go-to-wellesley.html": {"writer_name": "Judith Dobrzynski", "pub_date": "1995-10-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1747, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "How to Succeed?

It's hard to think of one without the other. Here's a new link in the business landscape. Henceforth, when you hear Wellesley, Mass., the home of Wellesley College, think of top-level executive women. **********More than any other college -- large or small -- Wellesley has groomed women  who shatter the glass ceiling. Wellesley women take up far more seats in executive suites and corporate boardrooms than their numbers suggest they should have. They are overrepresented, too, at places like the Harvard business school, a fountainhead for occupants of the nation's corner offices. **********To cite just a few of Wellesley's major achievers, there's Lois D. Juliber,  '71, president of Colgate North America; Ellen R. Marram, '68, president of the  Seagram Beverage Group; Shirley Young, '55, a vice president of General Motors,  and Marion O. Sandler, '52, co-chief executive of Golden West Financial, a large savings and loan association. **********Influencing business policy, there is Alicia Munnell, '64, a top Treasury Department official recently nominated to the Council of Economic Advisers. And  of course there's Hillary Rodham Clinton, '69, the once and future corporate lawyer and director. **********Just how does Wellesley, a school of only 2,200 students, do it? **********This good fortune certainly wasn't planned, college officials said. Wellesley's outstanding record stems from -- in addition to bright students -- a strong, popular economics department; a dynamic professor, Carolyn Shaw Bell, who taught at the college from 1950 to 1989; and programs that encourage networking among alumnae and between alumnae and students, people said. Wellesley, in fact, could be an inspiration to other colleges that want to help  their graduates go where few women have gone before, into the business world's upper echelons. **********Evidence for the Wellesley edge abounds, starting with the number of companies that look to Wellesley for executive women. In 1994, 75 companies recruited at its leafy campus west of Boston, far exceeding the number at similar-sized elite colleges like Smith and Amherst. **********Some executive recruiters say they sense that Wellesley women know how to really succeed in business. \"I have always felt this was true, and I've always said I want my two daughters to go to Wellesley,\" said Julie Daum of Spencer Stuart, a big search firm. **********Several studies lend credence to a \"Wellesley factor.\" When Business Week magazine named the \"50 Top Women in Business\" in 1992, four went to the school.  Only one other college claimed more than one spot on the roster -- the University of Wisconsin, which matched Wellesley's four but which also has six and a half times as many women students. **********Of the 390 women who serve as directors of the Fortune 500 companies, at least 17 went to Wellesley -- more than any other college -- according to Catalyst, a women's advocacy group (headed, it happens, by a Wellesley graduate, Sheila Wellington). **********And Carol A. Scott found evidence in her 1992 survey of America's senior executive women. Asked by The New York Times to look at the colleges attended by those women, she found 8 Wellesley graduates among the 439 respondents. That is  64 times Wellesley's share of the female college population and more than any other college except the University of California at Berkeley (with 9, but also  five times as many women students). **********\"I thought you were out of your mind when you called, but I see that there's  something to it,\" said Ms. Scott, a professor at the University of California at Los Angeles's Graduate School of Management. **********And don't forget Wellesley's position as a dominant supplier of women to the  Harvard business school. In 1975, for example, Wellesley sent more women to the  Harvard business school than any other college. Twenty years later, Wellesley graduates still made up the biggest contingent from any women's college, though  by then Harvard and Dartmouth were sending a few more proportionately. **********Success, of course, breeds success. \"There's a self-reinforcing mechanism at  work in terms of student selection and faculty recruitment,\" explained Victor Fuchs, an economist at Stanford University who wrote \"Women's Quest for Economic Equality.\" **********Indeed, many Wellesley women are now feeding into the pipeline that leads up  to the executive office. All told, about a third of Wellesley's graduates go into the business world, more than any other career. **********As an all-female school, Wellesley starts with an edge. Numerous studies show that graduates of women's colleges, compared with women graduates of coeducational institutions, develop higher levels of self-esteem and do better in their careers. **********But when it comes to business, Wellesley still outdoes its rivals -- a thought that raises hackles among some of them. \"When you look around at the Seven Sisters, I think you'll find similar results,\" said Barbara Reinhold, director of the career development office at Smith. **********True, of those elite traditionally women's colleges, Vassar can claim Geraldine Laybourne, president of the Nickelodeon network, while Smith can boast of Rochelle B. Lazarus, president of Ogilvy & Mather North America, and Laura D'Andrea Tyson, director of the White House's National Economic Council. Columbia's Barnard College has Phyllis Grann, chief executive of the Putnam Publishing Group. And Radcliffe College at Harvard has Joan T. Bok, chairman of  the New England Electric System, and Lisa Henson, president of Columbia Pictures. **********YET none of these colleges -- nor any other college or university -- has produced proportionately as many corporate women in high positions as Wellesley. Neither Smith nor Barnard nor Radcliffe produced a list that matched Wellesley's. **********Vassar conceded the point. \"Recruiters do say that Wellesley students are very business-oriented,\" said Clare D. Graham, director of career development. \"Our alums have tended to have a focus in communications and the arts.\" **********Wellesley's president, Diana Walsh, cannot explain precisely how Wellesley came to produce graduates who ascend to jobs like senior vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (Margaret Yeo, '64) and executive vice president of Bloomingdale's (Christine Miller, '66). **********Ms. Walsh cited the school's past as the key ingredient. \"Wellesley has a history of women's rights, a culture of women struggling to succeed in a man's world,\" she said. **********Many graduates agreed that Wellesley's culture influenced them mightily. Many also credited the grounding they got at Wellesley's economics department, which  was recently ranked No. 2 (according to the traditional standard, published citations of its members' academic work), behind Williams, among the liberal arts colleges in a study by Michael Robinson of Mount Holyoke College. Ms. Bell  has retired, but the department still has widely respected teachers like Marshall Goldman. **********Uncommonly for a women's school, economics is usually Wellesley's most popular major, or at least second. And that is a longstanding phenomenon, not a  product of the go-go 1980's, which lured many bright students into business. **********More important, \"Wellesley has Carolyn Bell, who within the school set a model,\" said Margaret Hennig, dean of the Simmons Graduate School of Business. \"She made it legitimate even during the antibusiness period, the hippie period,  for Wellesley women to get involved with economics and business. She obviously influenced enormous numbers of women.\" **********And they agree. Ms. Marram, of Seagram, remembered the first meeting, in 1989, of Wellesley's Business Leadership Council, a group of 93 high-powered alumnae. \"A bunch of us sat around after dinner, and soon we were all talking about Carolyn Bell,\" she said. \"She was a fierce promoter of Wellesley economics graduates. She used to tell us that we should brag, that we should let people know what we can do.\" **********To that, Ms. Bell, a graduate of Mount Holyoke who at 75 still writes a monthly column for The Boston Globe, pleads guilty. But she says she \"never pushed any particular field for people.\" **********\"It was a personal value that any woman should be able to support herself and her children, whether or not she has to,\" Ms. Bell said. \"Wellesley produced women who were responsible for themselves, and that may have helped.\" **********Whatever it was, it worked. Marsha Williams, for example, was majoring in archeology until she ran into Ms. Bell. \"She made economics come alive,\" said Ms. Williams, now treasurer of the Amoco Corporation. \"It made me not be afraid  of being unable to hold my own in a business setting.\" **********Wellesley also tries to expose students to the business world. Ten years ago, it started a program called \"Wall Street Warm-Up.\" It takes 20 to 30 students a  year to Manhattan, stationing each with a Wellesley graduate in a brokerage or investment bank. **********Whether it is for their first job or years later, Wellesley graduates use these contacts. Some networking is formal, through the Business Leadership Council, which began as a forum for busy graduates to help the school, but quickly became a place where members compared notes about work. **********BUT much more of this power-networking is informal, a matter of keeping in touch by women like Adele Morrissette, '77, a director at Cowen & Company, a Manhattan investment bank. She is not a member of the leadership council. Nor did she go to Wellesley with a business career in mind. By the time she was a junior or senior, however, \"I knew there were a lot of Wellesley women in business and that they were breaking barriers,\" she said. **********When it came time to look for a job, Ms. Morrissette met Donna Ecton, '69, now chief executive of Business Mail Express Inc., who was recruiting for the Chemical Bank. \"She really championed me,\" said Ms. Morrissette, who took the job, then got an M.B.A. \"I would not be a Wall Street investment banker, were it not for her.\" **********Ms. Morrissette keeps up with several Wellesley women, calling on a former client, Robin Smith, '61, the president of Publishers Clearing House, as a mentor; trading information with an alumna employed by a venture capital firm, and steering Cowen to a search firm run by Patricia Morrill, a Wellesley graduate. **********This kind of mutual support happens all the time. Ms. Juliber, for example, joined the board of the State Street Boston Corporation after Nannerl O. Keohane, a former Wellesley president who is now president of Duke University and a member of both the leadership council and State Street's board, recommended her. **********No wonder, then, that Wellesley graduates keep turning up in corporate circles. And because few colleges have picked up on Wellesley's bottom-line success -- only a couple, like Simmons College, have started groups for alumnae  in business -- Wellesley may well remain a mother lode of executive women for a  while to come."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/27/world/world-news-briefs-us-signal-to-haiti-election-must-be-held.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-11-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 108, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WORLD NEWS BRIEFS;U.S. Signal to Haiti: Election Must Be Held", "print_headline": "WORLD NEWS BRIEFS;U.S. Signal to Haiti: Election Must Be Held", "body_text": " **********The Clinton Administration signaled strongly today that it expects Haiti to hold presidential elections as scheduled next month and President Jean-Bertrand  Aristide to step down in February. **********\"We expect him to leave,\" the White House national security adviser, Anthony  Lake, said today after President Aristide suggested last week that he would consider the requests of his followers to stay in power for another term. **********Mr. Lake, appearing on ABC's \"This Week With David Brinkley,\" said President Aristide \"is in a difficult position here because clearly he is still the most popular politician in Haiti and a lot of Haitians don't want him to leave.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/24/world/buenos-aires-journal-in-argentine-nightmare-the-discos-die-at-4-am.html": {"writer_name": "Calvin Sims", "pub_date": "1995-10-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 967, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Buenos Aires Journal;In Argentine Nightmare, the Discos Die at 4 A.M.", "print_headline": "Buenos Aires Journal;In Argentine Nightmare, the Discos Die at 4 A.M.", "body_text": " **********The night, by local standards, was young. **********At 3 A.M. on Saturday, the Aleandro family of six, including three small children and a grandmother, arrived at Los Anos Locos steakhouse for dinner on the riverfront. **********At 3:30 A.M., a few blocks away, Ana Ruiz and Lucy Torres, both clad in tight jeans and lace, stood outside El Cielo disco debating whether it was too early to go inside. **********At 4 A.M., across town, Celia Mendoz and Carlos Martini shared an ice-cream cone under a large ficus tree in crowded San Martin Plaza as boisterous teen-agers played soccer on the green below. **********And at 4:15 A.M., a line of fast-food-craving Argentines stretched onto the sidewalk outside the Burger King on Santa Fe Avenue. **********While most major cities boast of thriving night lifes, few can compare with that of Argentina's capital, where many residents do not eat dinner until well after midnight and discos do not open until 2 A.M. and close after the sun rises. **********But the night life for which Buenos Aires has become famous in recent years has come under attack by local politicians, who say the endless night has led to an increase in public drunkenness, fatal car accidents and drug abuse and to the deterioration of the family. **********On average, 30 people are killed and 36 injured each day in car accidents in  Argentina, according to a recent study by the Vial Security Institute here. About 33 percent of the accidents occur at the weekend when people return home from discos, the study found. Since the beginning of the year, 7,406 people have died in traffic accidents. **********Eduardo Duhalde, Governor of Buenos Aires Province, recently announced that he intends to sign a decree requiring discos, bars and cafes to close at 4 A.M.  The Governor said that the measure was intended to create \"a certain order that  society needs\" and to \"encourage families to spend more time together.\" **********Mr. Duhalde, an old-line Peronist who is a considered a possible successor to President Carlos Saul Menem, is well known for his aggressive stance against drug abuse and juvenile delinquency. He has said that the measure is necessary to reduce the large number of minors who roam the streets and frequent bars and  discos in the early morning. **********\"We should have done this a long time ago,\" he told local reporters recently. \"We are behind the times. In no country of the first world does this type of activity exist.\" **********But the proposed crackdown has generated a storm of protest, especially from  entertainers, disco and restaurant owners, and opposition political leaders, who have assailed it as a political ploy and a violation of freedom. **********\"This is just Duhalde's way of positioning himself for the next elections --  he has political interests in mind,\" said Federico Bergalli, a manager at El Cielo disco. \"In fact, he doesn't give a hoot about the whole thing. It's only demagogy.\" **********Three of Argentina's best-known musicians, Charly Garcia, Claudio Gabis and Alejandro Medina, recently joined politicians from the center-left Frepaso party at The Roxy disco to protest the proposed restriction. **********\"It is not a function of the state to impose a paternalistic and abusive mode of living,\" the group said in a statement. \"We will fight this false paternalism with vigilant opposition throughout the city.\" **********Protesting may do little good. Mr. Duhalde can issue the decree without the approval of the provincial legislature. It would apply to all cities in the province except the capital, which is controlled by a municipal legislature. But Mayor Jorge Dominguez has publicly assured Mr. Duhalde that he will work to persuade the municipal legislature to go along with the early closings. **********Ruben Miguel Citara, the province's Minister of Government and Mr. Duhalde's  chief lieutenant, said in an interview that his government hoped to have a uniform closing time for all cities in the province, including the capital, within six months. In addition, Mr. Citara said that the provincial government would propose a law under which establishments that serve alcohol to minors could be fined $50,000 or shut down. The legal drinking age is 18, but violators are seldom punished. **********\"We are not trying to limit people's right to enjoy the night,\" Mr. Citara said. \"We are trying to protect minors and reduce abuses. People need a lot of stimulants like drugs and alcohol to maintain this type of life style.\" **********In the early morning, minors and adults can be found drinking and abusing drugs in many discos throughout the city and province, even though many dance clubs have held special non-alcohol sessions for minors between 10 P.M. and midnight. **********The Argentine custom of going out for the night at 2 or 3 A.M. began only about 15 years ago with the decline of the military dictatorship and advent of disco culture. In fact, the military Government imposed a 4 A.M. closing for discos and restaurants in the capital in 1980, but it has not been enforced for  more than a decade. **********Jorge Arlan, 30, a taxi driver who kicked up his heels at El Living disco, called Mr. Duhalde a \"fascist\" and said that the early closing of discos would be difficult to enforce. **********Mr. Citara said that the province planned to compile a list of \"late night\" establishments that would be given to the federal police, who have promised to enforce the decree. **********While some parents agreed that it was time to bring control to the night, others criticized the proposal, saying it would restrict their own freedom to go out when they please. **********\"I think the real issue is that parents have to be responsible for their own  children,\" said Juanita Avila, 47, a nurse. \"You cannot legislate family values.

The plane, on a flight from Miami, hit a mountain during a nighttime approach through a valley to the southern Colombian city of Cali on Dec. 20. **********In an unusually swift and frank admission, American Airlines issued this statement from its chief pilot, Capt. C. D. Ewell: **********\"We've always taken great pride in the vigor of our training and the excellence of our flight disciplines, and we are saddened that human error on the part of our people may have contributed to the accident.\" **********\"The accident reminds us that aviation, while not inherently dangerous, is terribly unforgiving of any inattention to detail.\" **********While Colombian and American officials were guarded in their official comments, the information they released today and unofficial comments by some people familiar with the case left little doubt that investigators believe that  the pilots had made a series of fatally careless mistakes as they approached Cali on a clear night with a planeload of people flying home for Christmas. **********In Washington, a Transportation Department official said the initial findings pointed \"almost without a doubt\" to pilot error. The official, interviewed by telephone on condition that he not be identified, said Transportation Secretary  Federico Pena had expressed \"deep concern\" over the findings. **********A statement issued by the Colombian authorities described some of the apparent navigational errors, based on recordings of cockpit conversations and of readings from navigational instruments from the final 30 minutes of the flight. The recordings show that the crew was asked to report to the airport's traffic controllers as they crossed over a locational beacon about 40 miles north of the airport. **********But, the statement said, the pilots mistakenly passed beyond that spot when they programmed their navigational computers to fly toward it. **********Apparently confused, the pilots steered the plane to the left, toward the mountains, and then to the right, but too late to avoid disaster. **********The recordings showed that warning alarms sounded in the cabin nine seconds before the crash. An electronic voice warning \"pull up\" could be heard on the cockpit recorder. The pilots were pulling up the plane's nose and adding power when the plane hit the mountain. **********\"The data indicate that the crew began a recovery maneuver to avoid ground impact with increased engine potency two seconds after the alarm was activated,\" Capt. Rodrigo Barrera, the chief investigator for the Colombian Civil Aviation Administration, said at a news conference in Bogota today. **********The plane missed clearing the mountaintop by about 200 feet. **********\"We do not have the official cause of the accident,\" Captain Barrera said. \"This is a preliminary reading of information that was analyzed in Washington.\" **********The airline said that the pilot was Nicholas Tafuri, 57, of Marco Island, Fla., and that the co-pilot was Don Williams, 39, of New Smyrna Beach, Fla. Both pilots had thousands of hours of flying time and clean records, the airline said. **********Officials believe that 164 people were on board, including the crew, but the  complete list of passengers has not yet been established. Some passengers who were scheduled to board the plane did not do so, while others got on the flight  at the last minute. Four people survived the crash. **********Many of those on board were naturalized Americans living in the New York area and were planning to spend Christmas with their Colombian families. **********The data comes from a flight data recorder, which provides a record of changes in navigation and power settings, and the cabin voice recorder, which details the conversations in the cockpit and with air control officials on the ground. Both systems were scrutinized over the weekend. **********Aviation officials here and in Washington said the preliminary findings were  in no way conclusive. But several said the information analyzed suggested that the crash was a result of an operational error. \"This could mean either a human  error, a mistake in the navigational procedures or a mistake in airline procedures,\" said Col. Jorge Parga, deputy technical director of the Civil Aviation Administration. **********Captain Barrera said there was no indication that the two pilots on the plane had conducted an \"approach briefing.\" Colonel Parga explained that before every  landing, the captain is required to hand out instructions to the co-pilot. Airlines typically train pilots to call out lists of procedures well before every landing. **********\"For example,\" Colonel Parga said, \"the plane's speed would have to be discussed, they would have to go over the route they are going to take for landing, how they will position the plane and configurate it, at what time to begin communication with the air control tower, what to do when the runway is visible, and what to do if any problems arise. This is a mandatory procedure.\" **********But it is also possible that the crew went through the required briefings before the 30-minute period analyzed in the tapes. **********According to Captain Barrera, the Cali air control tower had authorized the American Airlines flight to land at the designated runway with \"calm winds.\" The crew responded by repeating the same information the tower had given them. The tower then gave the plane instructions to report in when it crossed over a navigational beacon on the ground.  The crew, again, read back the same instructions. **********A United States official, speaking by telephone on condition that his name not be used, said those findings indicated incorrect cockpit procedures in preparation for landing. \"It is uncommon for a pilot not to follow these procedures,\" he said. **********The official added that the fact that the plane swerved twice meant that it could not find the ground-based navigational beacon at Tulua, at which point the pilots were supposed to radio the control tower. The crew was clearly lost, the  official said. **********American air safety experts noted that about 80 percent of plane accidents are caused by human error. **********The official added that F.A.A. officials were currently involved in discussions with American Airlines and the Allied Pilots Association to determine what measures should be taken to prevent such an accident in the future. **********Bill Schulz, a spokesman for the United States Transportation Department said in a telephone interview from Washington that \"the report raises some serious questions about actions that occurred.\" **********American and Colombian investigators said identifying some passengers had been difficult. Some bodies were strewn about in the crash sites in parts that may belong to those, including three United States citizens, who remain unaccounted for or to some bodies that were identified by their families. \"It is a great confusion,\" an official said. **********The remains of one passenger, Rebecca Taylor, an American citizen who lived in Arkansas and was coming to Colombia to be married, were identified yesterday  by family members."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/26/world/giuliani-he-wouldn-t-get-castro-s-vote.html": {"writer_name": "Lizette Alvarez", "pub_date": "1995-10-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 739, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Giuliani?

He wore his recently disclosed wardrobe of international diplomacy -- a starched white shirt, gold cuff links, a red tie and comfortable  shoes. **********The suit and tie, however, were no more than superficial accouterments. As the 69-year-old Mr. Castro tackled the tough questions first, then the more lighthearted, he showed no signs of bending his political will to suit others, defending his rule in Cuba as a form of democracy that enjoys deep public support. **********Replying to a question about Cuba's longstanding policy of imprisoning dissidents, Mr. Castro agreed with estimates by Amnesty International that some  600 Cubans are in prison for political reasons. **********But he quickly defended the policy, saying he was not alone in jailing those  who fight against the state. Mexico does the same, he said, as do Argentina, France, China and a host of other countries. **********Showing a keen knowledge of the United States political landscape, he spoke about Ross Perot and Gen. Colin L. Powell, the retired Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but saved his most admiring words for President John F. Kennedy.

He said he ordered 46 translators to transcribe the general's recently published autobiography into Spanish, for reading by himself and by senior Cuban officials. His hectic schedule, however, has kept him from any bedtime reading. **********On the economic front, Mr. Castro said Cuba was beginning to make headway, citing an increase in foreign investment and the large number of tourists and foreign entrepreneurs visiting the island. This openness, he said, poses a security risk, but one he is willing to take. **********Emphasizing a recurring theme of his visit, Mr. Castro said he refused to abandon his principles and Cuba's sovereignty by moving toward democracy just to meet conditions set by the United States for lifting its economic embargo. **********\"This is not a business deal,\" he said. \"This is not about bargaining.\" **********Mr. Castro called his trip, his first to New York since 1979, successful, saying he tried to accommodate many of the 200 invitations he received to different functions. He went to a church in Harlem, a banquet hall in the South  Bronx, a media executive's Fifth Avenue apartment and the homes of millionaire business executives. **********He ended the day by meeting for two hours with about 100 religious leaders, overwhelmingly Protestant, at Cuba's United Nations Mission. **********Mr. Castro joked about a trick he played in 1957 on a determined Times reporter, Herbert L. Matthews, in the Sierra Maestra, when his small band of guerrillas had been all but written off by the outside world. \"We tried to give  Matthews the impression that there were more of us,\" Mr. Castro said, recounting how he ordered the same troop of weary soldiers to parade past the reporter again and again. **********Two years after Mr. Matthews interviewed Mr. Castro, his revolutionary movement had grown, and in January 1959 his forces swept into Havana.

Israel agreed  to move up the withdrawal date. **********Security for thousands of expected tourists and even more Palestinian visitors is now in the hands of the Palestinian Authority, which is eager to prove it can run the celebrations smoothly and safely. **********\"In Bethlehem we will provide security for all people,\" Hajj Ismail Jaber, the Palestinian police chief in the West Bank, said shortly after his forces took control of the town, which has 40,000 residents. **********Bethlehem has become a predominantly Muslim city in recent decades as Christian Palestinians have left in growing numbers, driven away by unrest, economic hardship and tensions with Muslim neighbors. Some local Christians acknowledged tonight that they were concerned about possible discrimination by the Muslim majority under Palestinian rule. **********But these worries were set aside tonight as thousands of Palestinians packed  Manger Square to celebrate their freedom from Israeli occupation. Bethlehem is the fifth Palestinian town to be handed over by Israel under an agreement in September to expand Arab rule. **********Palestinian officers waved to the crowd from the police station as young men  raised a Palestinian flag and tore down a 12-foot fence put up by the Israelis around the building to block stone-throwing. Cheers went up as sections of the metal barrier crashed to the ground and were stomped on by jubilant teen-agers. **********\"When I saw the fence come down, I thought: the occupation is gone and the Palestinian state is on the way,\" said Maha Andoni, who came to the square with  her daughter. \"We waited 28 years for this. There's nothing sweeter.\" **********Issa abu Kamel, a quarry worker who arrived with his family, said he had wept as he watched the scene. \"I can't express what I feel inside,\" he said. \"That fence was like a prison for the Palestinian people, and now Bethlehem is free.\" **********As loudspeakers boomed out nationalist music set to a deafening drum-beat, men danced and women clapped. Palestinian officers stood on a truck moving slowly around the square, silhouetted against hundreds of bright Christmas lights. **********Pennants showing a grinning Mr. Arafat flapped next to banners of the Virgin  Mary and the infant Jesus. With his smiling visage on posters everywhere, Mr. Arafat seemed to take on the aura of a kind of Father Christmas, competing with  Santa Claus on Bethlehem's festive streets. **********\"We're breathing fresh air for the first time in 30 years,\" said Kamal Kamel, owner of a macaroni factory, who came to the square with his wife. \"We feel security, peace of mind for the Palestinians.\" **********Security is, in fact, a formidable first challenge facing Palestinian officials, who not only have to protect the expected throngs of Christmas pilgrims but must also secure the visit of Mr. Arafat. **********The Deputy Mayor, Hanna Nasser, said the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin on Nov. 4 had made necessary security measures like metal detectors and searches of visitors to Manger Square. **********During the years of Israeli rule, such checks and the presence of armed soldiers had drawn bitter complaints from Palestinians. Now both sides are consulting on holiday arrangements and will maintain a joint command center. **********For Jewish settlers near Bethlehem, the hand-over of the city to armed Palestinians is cause for a different set of concerns. Shunted by the army to a  newly built bypass road around the town, they complain that the road is unsafe,  and worry that they might be attacked if they use the main highway to Jerusalem, which runs through Bethlehem. **********They find small consolation in the continued presence of Israeli police officers at Rachel's Tomb, a Jewish shrine near Bethlehem that remains under Israeli protection. **********Benjamin Netanyahu, the leader of the opposition Likud party, warned today that the hand-over of Bethlehem had put Jerusalem in a \"stranglehold.\" But the Mayor, Elias Freij, who is also Minister of Tourism in the Palestinian Authority, said the withdrawal opens a new chapter. **********\"What is past is past,\" he said in an interview. \"We have to look to the future and build peaceful relations with Israel on the basis of mutual interests and recognition of national rights of each other.\" **********Something of the new spirit was evident today in the Israeli departure from Bethlehem. As the last jeeps rolled out of the police station, Israelis and Palestinians smiled and shook hands. Members of Mr. Arafat's Fatah movement protected the retreating troops, holding back crowds who pressed toward the jeeps. **********Shortly before the Israelis left, Nihad Jaraysa handed her 2-year-old son, Yusef, to an Israeli border policeman for one last picture. **********For the first time, she said, she wasn't afraid of the Israelis, because they were leaving. \"We're taking a break from them, and they're getting a rest from us,\" she said. \"It's only natural.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/26/business/daiwa-affair-turns-up-heat-on-japan-s-finance-ministry.html": {"writer_name": "Sheryl Wudunn", "pub_date": "1995-10-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1031, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Daiwa Affair Turns Up Heat on Japan's Finance Ministry", "print_headline": "Daiwa Affair Turns Up Heat on Japan's Finance Ministry", "body_text": " **********In the volatile world of finance, where billions of dollars can cross the ocean in seconds, one pillar of strength has been the Japanese Ministry of Finance. This cluster of elite bureaucrats controls billions of dollars and can  have a major influence on exchange rates. **********But that pillar has been battered this year. The Japanese banking sector is  in turmoil, and several financial institutions have failed. The Vice Minister of Finance stepped down in May, ahead of schedule, under pressure from the ruling party. And Euromoney magazine has named pana's Masayoshi Takemura as the year's  worst Finance Minister. **********Now the scandal at Dalwa Bank Ltd. has come into play. A former executive of the bank suggested in a newspaper of the bank suggested in a newspaper interview this week that the ministry may have played a role in hiding from American authorities the $1.1 billion in losses that the bank incurred from bond trading  in the United States. **********The uncertainty about the role of the ministry, which denies any wrongdoing, has added to worries about the management of Japan's banking system, which is struggling under the weight of at least $500 billion in bad real estate loans. Moreover, it ahs raised questions about the prospect for greater trust in coordination between Wasdhington and Tokyo on a wide variety of financial matters, ranging from currency rates to international money markets to global liquidity. **********Even if the Finance Ministry had no role in covering up Daiwa's trading loss, some analysts suggest that it did not manage the affair properly. In particular, they not, Japanese authorities did not think it necessary to pass on information immediately about the loss. **********\"They didn't believe this was a big deal and that's the problem,\" said Elizabeth L. Daniels, a banking analyst at Morgan Stanley Japan Inc. \"It's a disconnect.\" **********\"They think they were doing everybody a big favor,\" she added, because by trying to handle the problem quietly, the ministry might have thought it could avert a crisis. \"It's the Big Daddy approach. In the U.S., what you don't know may hurt you. In Japan, what you don't know won't hurt you.\" **********A decade ago, Japanese banks were the envy of the world. They were able to obtain funds at the lowest cost and were admired because they ignored short-term profits and focused on long-term market share. **********Now the banks are the focus of concern. **********The Finance Ministry is increasingly viewed as having mishandled the nation's banking troubles, much of whic had arisen from the bad real estate loans. And after Daiwa disclosed that it ahd told the ministry on Aug. 8 about a possible big loss - six weeks before the bank notified American authorities - foreign bankers became concerned by the ministry's decision not to pass on the information to American regulators. **********Then, earlier this week, the big Japanese newspaper Asahi Shinbun carried an interview with Hiroyuki Yamaji, a former Daiwa Bank executive who participated in the August meeting with Yoshimasda Nishimura, Japan's top banking official. When told that a rogue bond trader in New York had racked up $1.1 billion in losses during an 11-year period, Mr. Nishimura replied, \"It's bad timing for this affair to surface,\" Mr. Yamaji said in the Asahi interview. **********At the time, Japan had just experienced its first bank run in decades, which culminated int he failure of the Cosmo Credit Union, one of the nation's largest credit institutions. The ministry was also sounding out the unpopular idea of using public funds to help rescue the nation's ailing financial institutions. **********In September, two more financial institutions failed. **********The ministry has denied that Mr. Nishimura made any comment about bad timing. Mr. Yamaji has resigned from Daiwa, and his telephone has apparently been disconnected. He could not be reached for comment. **********In the Asahi interview, Mr. Yamaji said Mr. Nishimura gave no \"specific instructions\" to report more details of the scandal or to report the loss to the Federal Reserve in the United States. Mr. Nishimura seemed to react negatively to the idea of Daiwa's announcing its loss immediately, Mr. Yamaji said. **********Kazuhito Ikeo, a professor finance at Kelo University said: \"Because the ministry and financial institutions are on close terms, the ministry has a tendency to protect its financial institutions against the outside, or to cover  up the ugly aspects to the outside. There are potentially problems that have not been disclosed yet.\" **********That appears to be the worry these days in financial markets, which dealt another blow to Japanese banks this week when some lending institutions raised the premium charged on loans to Japanese banks. **********Earlier this week, for instance, the Bank of Tokyo - one of the nation's most creditworthy institutions - was being charged an interest rate of 6 13/22 percent for a three-month loan in the Eurodollar market. Citibank, by contrast,  was being charged only 5 15/16 perent. Last week, when Citibank was being charged the same rate, the Bank of Tokyo had to pay 6 1/4 percent. Other Japanese financial institutions are paying a bigger premium. **********An increase in the rate that a bank must pay for its funds is an indication  that the international market is losing confidence in the banks' ability to repay what it has borrowed. **********While individual depositors in Japan are partly insured against losses, there is no system to protect banks that make loans to financial institutions that then fall. And in Daiwa's case, its troubles have caused nation's Pension Fund Association, which ash placed $35 billion in funds with the bank, to say this week that it will no longer let Daiwa manage any more funds, amounting to about $60 million in a month. **********Last week, the ministry sent a message to the market that could make foreign lenders even more jittery: It said that foreign holders of debentures in Hyogo Bank, a Kobebased institution that failed in September, should expect to accept  a 40 percent drop in the value of their principal as their share of the burden of the bank's loses. **********\"I'm still puzzled by the ministry coming out with such an astonishing action,\" said Yshiro Ikuyo, a senior financial analyst at Smith Barney International. \"That will have a very serious implication for the market.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/24/business/investing-it-as-choices-rise-advice-business-takes-off.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Wyatt", "pub_date": "1995-12-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 655, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INVESTING IT;As Choices Rise, Advice Business Takes Off", "print_headline": "INVESTING IT;As Choices Rise, Advice Business Takes Off", "body_text": " **********BEWILDERED by the dizzying array of mutual funds on the market, people are turning in droves to financial advisers for help in buying funds that could easily be bought directly. **********While it might be good news for financial advisers that individual investors  are ever more willing to pay for such advice, it could spell trouble for mutual fund companies that are not linked to big distributors like Charles Schwab & Company. **********In the last year, the amount of investor money overseen by fee-based financial advisers, who get a percentage of the assets they manage, grew 41 percent, to $282 billion -- twice the growth rate of mutual fund assets. The data come from a report published recently by Cerulli Associates, a consulting firm in Boston, and Lipper Analytical Services, a fund tracking firm in Summit,  N.J. **********Much of the money under advisers' care is going directly into mutual funds through no-fee sales programs like those of Schwab, Jack White and Fidelity Investments. Though individuals can deal directly with these brokerage companies, the rapid rise of the financial adviser indicates that investors find advice as important as convenience in such programs. **********In addition, the demand for this advice is growing far faster than the number of companies. The Cerulli-Lipper report states that the number of independent fee-based adviser firms, which primarily serve individuals, grew to 12,500 recently from 11,000 in 1992. Over the same stretch, the assets managed by those firms grew sixfold. **********\"The proliferation of mutual funds has obviously become overwhelming,\" said Mary McAvity, a consultant at Cerulli. **********The report also shows that the bulk of the advice is to invest in mutual funds. Advisers with less than $25 million in assets under management put about  70 percent of that money into mutual funds, while financial advisers with more money are far more likely to recommend individual stocks or other investments. **********According to the report, advisers with $25 million to $50 million under management put about 50 percent of those assets into mutual funds, while advisers with more than $100 million put less than 10 percent, on average, into  funds. **********Financial advisers are increasingly turning to no-fee brokerage services as a means of selecting funds for customers. While that might provide fund companies  with a new way to distribute their products, the Cerulli-Lipper report says the  trend might also be costing fund companies some customer loyalty. The portion of assets managed by advisers that is invested directly with mutual fund companies  has fallen to less than 30 percent from 57 percent three years ago. **********One reason for that shift, the report says, is that advisers using brokerage  firms can offer clients a single statement of all their holdings, rather than separate statements from each fund company. The trend spells trouble for medium-sized fund companies in particular, because they may shun the brokerage programs but may not have the marketing power to attract investors. **********The hidden benefit for investors, however, may be that advisers will focus more on expenses and other fees in deciding where to put their assets. About one-fifth of financial advisory firms now refuse to put clients in mutual funds  that charge shareholders an additional amount, known as a 12b-1 fee, for distribution expenses. **********The financial advisers' own fees may also be under pressure. Most of the advisers surveyed by Cerulli and Lipper charge customers about 1 percent of assets annually for their advice, but Ms. McAvity said there was new competition from products like brokerage firms' wrap accounts. In these accounts, brokers are not paid commissions, but instead receive a percentage of assets under management. **********Another factor contributing to the popularity of advisers is the bull market. \"When we get into a down market, that's when the value of financial advisers will really be tested,\" Ms. McAvity said. \"The unsophisticated financial adviser who buys a PC, buys a portfolio optimization program and signs up with Schwab will then have a hard time retaining those relationships.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/23/business/exxon-in-belgian-deal.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1995-11-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 41, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Exxon in Belgian Deal", "print_headline": "Exxon in Belgian Deal", "body_text": " **********The Exxon Corporation's Exxon Chemical unit will acquire the 35 percent stake in a Belgium ethylene and polypropylene complex held by the Danish petrochemical company Borealis A.S., the Belgian oil and gas company Petrofina S.A. said today."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/21/world/world-news-briefs-us-may-return-some-okinawa-bases.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-12-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 106, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "World News Briefs;U.S. May Return Some Okinawa Bases", "print_headline": "World News Briefs;U.S. May Return Some Okinawa Bases", "body_text": " **********The United States has agreed in principle to return some of its military bases in Okinawa to Japanese landowners within three years, Japan's Defense Agency said today. **********The 10 sites make up only 4.2 percent of the 58,000 acres occupied by United  States bases on Okinawa in southern Japan.

Still, it also reflects the desire of politicians to win the public's favor by promising to deliver lower electric power rates to their constituents. **********The Lilco situation has its roots in the mid-1980's, when the New York State Public Service Commission awarded Lilco large rate increases for construction of the ill-fated Shoreham nuclear power plant, which has ended up in mothballs. **********Today, Lilco charges an average 16.8 cents a kilowatt-hour, nearly twice the national average of 8.8 cents and well above even the rates charged by other utilities in the high-cost New York metropolitan area. **********Recently, the Long Island Power Authority, the state agency empowered to acquire all or part of Lilco, put out a request for proposals from utilities, investment banks and others. The deadline for responses is Oct. 20. **********The authority said its goal was to acquire Lilco and restructure it so that there could be a substantial reduction in rates. The principal advantage of a state takeover revolves around the agency's ability to issue debt with interest payments that are exempt from Federal and state income taxes. **********Gov. George E. Pataki, who originally opposed a takeover, called last month for the authority to develop a plan that would reduce electric rates by at least 10 percent, encourage competition, avoid higher property taxes and lead to the \"dissolution\" of the utility. **********The chairman of Lilco, William J. Catacosinos, said the company would cooperate in any plan that protected its employees, shareholders and customers, but questioned Mr. Pataki's use of the word \"dissolution\" and warned customers that they would miss the company if it ceased to exist. **********Politicians and business groups on Long Island regard the region's high electric rates as a competitive disadvantage and a costly burden on the 2.7 million residents, who also pay among the highest sales and property taxes in the country. Lilco notes that 21 cents of each dollar it collects on utility bills goes to taxes. **********In 1989, a $7.45 billion offer for Lilco by the Long Island Power Authority was rejected by the company and its shareholders. In October 1994, Mario M. Cuomo, then the Governor, proposed a $9 billion takeover. The plan lapsed after Mr. Cuomo was defeated. **********In June, Richard M.

Araskog, said in a telephone interview yesterday. **********Mr. Araskog said the split would give each company better access to capital at a lower cost. Also, the three concerns could adopt strategies and policies based on their own particular business characteristics and devise employee incentives that were tied more directly to the specific performance of each unit. **********Analysts said each of the companies was strong and well-positioned to compete within its industry. The Hartford insurance group was the country's fastest-growing life, health and casualty insurer last year. The ITT automotive unit is the largest global supplier of four-wheel, anti-lock brake systems, and the entertainment group includes the New York Knicks basketball team, half of Madison Square Garden, the Sheraton hotel chain and Caesars World casinos. **********\"Fluid technology is not a glamourous business like hotels and casinos, so the press tends to ignore it,\" said Jay Cohen, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, referring to one of the ITT businesses. \"But it's a real solid performer, as are the other businesses.\" **********Analysts and investors also speculated privately that a breakup would allow Mr. Araskog, who is 63, to extend his tenure beyond the \"normal retirement age,\" described in the company's proxy statement as 65. Mr. Araskog, who has been one of the nation's highest-paid and most socially prominent executives, will become chairman and chief executive of the new ITT Corporation, which will operate the entertainment properties. **********\"I expect that I could be going on at ITT with the approval of the board as long as I wanted to and thought I could do a good job,\" Mr. Araskog said. **********The split had been widely anticipated, propelling the company's stock up by 25 percent from the first of the year and generating a spate of news reports during the last six months speculating about an ITT breakup. **********During the last two years, the company, which is based in New York and once comprised more than 250 concerns, has pursued a radical makeover. It has shed assets that did not complement its three lines of business and bought companies that did. **********Still, the news yesterday lifted shares of ITT by $5.625, to $114.875, on the New York Stock Exchange. Some analysts predicted that ITT's stock would continue to rise as investors pulled apart the three pieces and valued them on a stand-alone basis. **********Conglomerates have fallen out of favor as investors increasingly have placed their bets on focused companies, which has resulted in the dismemberment of Sears, Roebuck & Company, Kodak and Tenneco, to name a few. Analysts say that a so-called market basket of companies is hard to assess because valuation methods differ from industry to industry. Hotels and casinos, for instance, are measured by cash flow, while insurance companies are valued as a multiple of their cash flow. **********\"You're not creating value here, you're unhiding it,\" said R. Jackson Blackstock, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. **********Many analysts said they saw few obstacles to the spinoff, though it needed the approval of shareholders, Federal regulators and state insurance and gaming authorities. **********Mr. Cohen of Salomon Brothers said the credit rating agencies might place the company on credit watch while they assessed the impact of the spinoff on the insurance business in particular. In March the Standard & Poor's Corporation downgraded the ratings of the Hartford group, which generates roughly half the ITT profits. **********\"Frankly, I would expect it,\" Mr. Araskog agreed, \"until all this has settled down.\" **********The spinoffs also resolve issues of succession, which had begun to haunt the company and seemed likely to end in a struggle between Robert A. Bowman, an executive vice president and chief financial officer of ITT, and D. Travis Engen, an executive vice president. **********Mr. Bowman, who is widely credited with ITT's push into the entertainment business, will serve as president and chief operating officer under Mr. Araskog. **********Mr. Engen, who was regarded as the executive most likely to run ITT after Mr. Araskog's departure, will become chairman, president and chief executive of ITT Industries, which will operate the largest manufacturer of anti-lock brakes, a military electronics unit and the third-largest pump company in the world. **********Donald R. Frahm, currently chairman and chief executive of the ITT Hartford Group, will become chairman and chief executive of ITT Hartford. **********Two decades ago ITT became something of a phenomenon under the leadership of Harold S. Geneen, perhaps the most acquisitive chief executive in history. With the help of Andre Meyer of Lazard Freres & Company, Mr. Geneen was a pioneer of the hostile takeover, buying companies at the rate of one a week at one point until ITT comprised more than 250 companies. **********Breaking up ITT also resolves another problem for Mr. Araskog -- establishing a consistent pattern of earnings to meet the company's own hurdles for return on equity. **********From 1979 to 1991 shares of ITT trailed the S.& P. 500 index by 36 percent, which caused a shareholders' revolt, led by the California Public Employees Retirement System, the activist public pension fund. The revolt prodded the ITT board to tie Mr. Araskog's compensation to the company's achieving a return on equity of 16.4 percent. Last year ITT just made it over that hurdle, helped by a stock buyback program. **********Last year the company earned $1.02 billion, an increase of 11.9 percent from the previous year, on revenues of $23.6 billion."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/07/world/jerusalem-journal-in-a-museum-of-hell-qualms-about-decorum.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Haberman", "pub_date": "1995-03-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 969, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Jerusalem Journal; In a Museum of Hell, Qualms About Decorum", "print_headline": "Jerusalem Journal; In a Museum of Hell, Qualms About Decorum", "body_text": " **********What many cannot forget are her eyes. **********She stands slightly hunched on the far left of the grainy photo, huddling in fear with two other women as Nazi soldiers hover with rifles. On this dark day in 1941 in Liepaja, Latvia, these unidentified Jewish women are about to die. **********They have been stripped of their clothes, and they are trying desperately to cover their nakedness. But what transfixes many viewers is not the nudity in this picture taken by the Nazis. It is the eyes of the woman on the left. **********They are large dark circles of terror and bewilderment. **********The photo, near another one showing naked men also about to be shot, has been hanging for 23 years on the walls of Yad Vashem, the Israeli museum and memorial to victims of the Holocaust. Now, the photo has fallen victim itself, to a painful dispute among Jews over whether it is proper for Yad Vashem to hang even a few pictures showing the dead and the near-dead without clothes. **********The questions are stark, and they have swirled here for several weeks, with Holocaust survivors on either side of the issue invoking their own terrible memories. **********Are the victims degraded yet again by being shown in their nakedness? **********Yes, some say, especially political leaders of black-frocked Orthodox Jews known here as haredim, who are in the forefront of a campaign to take the photos down. Haredi rabbis, whose influence over disciples is almost total in their circumscribed world, also call the photos an offense to the living because it is sinful to look at naked bodies. **********\"In July 1943, my parents were marching to their death at Sobibor,\" Yeshayau Shafir of Tel Aviv said the other day in a letter to the newspaper Haaretz. \"If my mother's picture would be hanging on the walls of a museum -- naked, shamed and frightened the moment before her death -- I would do anything, and I underline 'anything,' to get her off the wall.\" **********Or is the issue instead as others frame it, observant Jews among them. Would it be sanitizing Nazi atrocities to remove those graphic images? Some holding this view warn that it might even play into the hands of Holocaust-deniers, who could say once the pictures came down: Look, even the Jews had doubts. **********Eva Lux-Braun of Jerusalem wrote to The Jerusalem Post that she had been forced to strip at the Auschwitz death camp, and would have wanted photos displayed had they existed. \"Are the pictures indecent, immodest, demeaning, humiliating?\" she said. \"The facts are, not the pictures. We couldn't cover our nakedness then. Don't cover it up now.\" **********Yad Vashem has formally rejected the protests against nudity, insisting that the photos will stay on its walls. \"We have no reason, and I don't have the authority, to cover up the terrible truth or to beautify it,\" said Avner Shalev, the memorial's chairman. **********But that did not end the dispute. **********Deputy Mayor Chaim Miller of Jerusalem, a haredi official who first raised the issue, says he will continue to press for change, by urging fellow haredim to write protest letters and to boycott the museum, and, he suggests, by asking Orthodox donors to freeze out Yad Vashem. **********\"If they will turn this into a matter between religious and secular,\" he said bluntly, \"I have the means to affect them financially.\" **********Why the issue has arisen after all these years is not clear. One reason may be general Holocaust consciousness on the 50th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi camps. Another may be that haredim seem to be visiting Yad Vashem in growing numbers. Now, they want a say in how it is run instead of leaving it, as before, to secular and modern religious Zionists. **********A few haredi leaders even talk about setting up their own museum -- to memorialize the victims \"properly and objectively,\" in the words of Rabbi Moshe Zeev Feldman, head of the Agudat Yisrael political party. **********Many haredim feel that the collective Holocaust memory here has been dominated too long by secular Zionists -- whom some in the haredi world blame for the Nazi horror in the first place, by not having waited for the Messiah before seeking to create a Jewish state and thus going against God's will. In their view, Yad Vashem devotes too little space to religious Jewish life in pre-Nazi Europe and to how some Jews clung to their faith in the camps. **********But to other Israelis, the call for Holocaust separatism is another attempt by haredim to seal themselves off from the rest of Israel -- by creating an institution parallel to an existing one, much as they have done with schools and social services. It is a dangerous gambit, some warn. **********\"There's a feeling that the religious are trying to take away the one unifying force we have,\" said Tom Segev, an Israeli historian of the Holocaust. **********Other specialists warn of haredi revisionism, what they regard as an attempt to gloss over how some rabbis in Europe counseled loyal followers -- disastrously -- to stay put while the Nazis were on the march, and in some instances fled while others died. **********Disputes aside, there is pain because half a century later Jews are tearing at one another over whose Holocaust it was. **********\"You would think that on this one thing there would be a willingness to stand silently together,\" said Efraim Zuroff, Israel director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center. \"Do you think the Nazis distinguished between Jews when they killed them?\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/06/business/the-media-business-entertainment-weekly-defies-critics.html": {"writer_name": "Deirdre Carmody", "pub_date": "1995-03-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 991, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Entertainment Weekly Defies Critics", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Entertainment Weekly Defies Critics", "body_text": " **********Five years after the much-publicized start-up of Entertainment Weekly -- and the widespread predictions of its imminent demise that quickly followed -- the magazine has become a smart, confident publication known for its tough and timely reporting on the entertainment industry. **********Advertising pages were up 28 percent in 1994 from the previous year.  Circulation passed the million mark two years ago; newsstand sales in 1994 were up 30 percent. **********Michael J. Klingensmith, who has been publisher since the beginning, said he expected Entertainment Weekly to make money by the end of 1996, a year behind schedule. **********The success of Entertainment Weekly comes as Premiere, a leading rival in coverage of the movie industry, has gone on the auction block for a reported asking price of $20 million to $30 million. **********Officials at the K-III Communications Corporation, the parent of Premiere, say the magazine no longer fits in with the company's growing roster of publications. K-III recently acquired a number of technical and trade magazines. **********While Premiere's bread and butter is coverage of the film industry, Entertainment Weekly, which is owned by Time Inc., has a much wider agenda. Describing itself as the entertainment equivalent of another Time publication, Sports Illustrated, Entertainment Weekly is the only weekly magazine that covers television, music, books, multimedia and videos, as well as movies. Time has just started to put the magazine's contents on line every week on America Online. **********\"It's a service magazine in terms of making choices about what to see, what to buy,\" said James W. Seymore Jr., who replaced Jeff A. Jarvis as managing editor four months after the start-up. **********\"This magazine keeps people pop- culturally literate,\" Mr. Klingen smith said. **********Unlike many entertainment magazines that have become known mostly as cheerleaders for the industry, Entertainment Weekly has managed to retain its critical edge. **********An article in September, for instance, dealt with what Hollywood considers its greatest plums: movies that gross more than $100 million. Eschewing the reverential tone normally used by publications when referring to blockbusters, Entertainment Weekly briskly spelled out the techniques used by studios to lift films beyond the magic number of $100 million. **********The magazine described, for example, how some studios put the films into discount theaters, which charge $2 or $3 a ticket, while others simply keep the movies in regular theaters for 10 weeks or more -- at no small expense -- just to be able to attain the magic number. **********The article also quoted a box-office analyst by name who questioned the accuracy of the weekly estimated movie grosses that are listed in hundreds of newspapers and magazines. He said the figures submitted for publication were usually about 2.5 percent higher than the actual box-office numbers. **********While no one at Time Inc. will say how much of an investment has gone into Entertainment Weekly, people in the industry estimate the amount to be $60 million to $70 million. **********\"It is no longer perceived as a hot, exciting book in the communications community,\" said Martin S. Walker, chairman of Walker Communications, a consultant for the magazine industry, \"but that doesn't mean it is not very solid and doing very well.\" **********An executive at another publication covering the entertainment industry, who insisted on anonymity, described Entertainment Weekly as \"mind-bendingly aggressive\" about marketing itself. **********\"People tend to pick it up and look at it pretty religiously,\" the executive added, \"but it is designed for people who don't want to read anything more than two paragraphs.\" **********The young staff of Entertainment Weekly tends to reflect the magazine's readers, who have an average age of 32 and are almost equally divided between men and women. **********Mr. Klingensmith said the magazine's young readership had helped attract advertising from consumer electronics, automotive, liquor, television and apparel companies. **********Inevitably, the magazine has been dogged by the question of whether it gives favorable treatment to the music, films, videos and music of its Time Warner siblings, Warner Brothers and Warner Music Group. Mr. Seymore insists the magazine is editorially independent and says Entertainment Weekly shows no favoritism toward Warner products. **********The process of reviewing and rating movies, television shows, books and music on a scale of A+ to D- is a complicated -- and finally a subjective -- enterprise, one that does not always endear the magazine to all of its readers. With a circulation of 1.1 million, Entertainment Weekly is a magazine for the masses -- and the masses often cannot fathom the critics' tastes. **********For instance, Entertainment Weekly critics panned \"Pretty Woman\" and \"Forrest Gump,\" two of the most popular -- and some might say schmaltziest -- movies of recent years. **********The magazine's chief movie critic, Owen Gleiberman, found \"Forrest Gump\" to be \"dishonest,\" saying it \"reduces the tumult of the last few decades to a virtual-reality theme park; a baby-boomer version of Disney's America.\" He gave the film a grade of C. **********When a critic gives a biting review to what will probably turn out to be a popular movie, the magazine nonetheless runs a feature article on the movie. The review and the article, however, do not usually appear in the same issue. And sometimes the magazine just goofs. **********\"We didn't see 'Gump' coming, and we didn't anticipate what a phenomenon it was going to be,\" Mr. Seymore said. \"Consequently, we never had a cover devoted to the biggest movie of the year.\" **********Mr. Seymore said the magazine's willingness to be tough had \"definitely cost us access\" to some stars who were not willing to cooperate with a magazine that had panned them on other projects. **********\"But we don't live or die by our access to the stars,\" he said. \"If we were to shade our reviews to curry favor, I think we would be doomed.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/04/business/international-briefs-abb-posts-40-jump-for-first-quarter-profit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-05-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 113, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "International Briefs; ABB Posts 40% Jump For First-Quarter Profit", "print_headline": "International Briefs; ABB Posts 40% Jump For First-Quarter Profit", "body_text": " **********The electrical engineering company ABB Asea Brown Boveri A.G. reported yesterday that it had a 40 percent surge in profit in the first quarter of 1995 and confirmed its earlier forecasts of higher earnings for the full year.

The equity was wiped out by the firm's collapse. **********Mr. Jacobs said the only other claims ING would not pay would be any that had not been filed by the time the deal became final and was formally signed today. **********Among the liabilities that ING assumed and would honor in full in meeting the $1.39 billion loss were payments to the Singapore International Monetary Exchange and the Osaka Stock Exchange in Japan, where Mr. Leeson had dealt in $7 billion worth of Japanese stock-index futures and nearly $22 billion of Japanese Government bond futures. **********Mr. Jacobs said ING would also pay off a group of Japanese banks that had lent heavily to Barings, apparently to help meet growing margin calls on Mr. Leeson's position. **********He said the payments included $:160 million (about $259 million) to the Singapore exchange, $:90 million ($145 million) to the Osaka exchange and $:610 million (about $988 million) to institutions in Tokyo including the bank creditors. **********The loss of $:860 million ($1.39 billion) was nearly twice the Barings capital of $:440 million ($713 million) Mr. Jacobs said. But ING's injection of $:660 million ($1.07 billion) leaves Barings with a capital base now of $:240 million ($389 million), a level he said would be sufficient for the firm to recommence its own trading immediately. **********Mr. Leeson had bet heavily that Japanese stock prices and interest rates would rise. But he lost both gambles, wiping out the Barings capital and plunging the bank into bankruptcy last week after 233 years in business. **********Mr. Leeson is in jail in Frankfurt and is fighting an attempt to extradite him to Singapore. **********Mr. Jacobs said that Mr. Baring and five other executive directors of Barings had volunteered to forgo their bonuses for 1994. But he said the rest of the 4,000 Barings employees would be paid their bonuses, although senior executives would be paid in installments rather than in a lump sum. Barings executives said many key personnel would have left had they not received their bonuses, which are often several times their base salaries. **********For ING, the deal promises a chance to greatly expand its international presence.

Last year some Libyan religious pilgrims took a camel train through Egypt for the hajj to protest the sanctions. **********A religious obligation that must be fulfilled at least once by every Muslim, the pilgrimage to Mecca involves millions of people each year, usually beginning in May. **********The Libyan threat to ignore the ban on flights to and from Libya is a delicate issue for Egypt, the Sudan and Saudi Arabia, which abide by the sanctions but are sensitive to Muslim concerns. Egyptian diplomats said they did not know what Cairo's reaction would be if Libyan planes appeared in Egyptian airspace. **********In his customary style of mixing threats and accusations, Colonel Qaddafi asserted in the interview that the C.I.A. carried out the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 as part of a smear campaign against Libya. **********The Libyan leader also lashed out at the United Nations, saying it had become an instrument of the French, British and American Governments. He said Libya was considering withdrawing from the organization and joining Taiwan, Switzerland, the Vatican and the Pacific island of Nauru as nonmember states. **********\"Unfortunately, the usefulness of the United Nations is over,\" said Colonel Qaddafi, who dressed in brown slacks, a brown shirt and brown boots for the interview. \"We are calling on the small nations of the world to withdraw and form another international body. **********\"It seemed that for a while the smaller nations had a voice, but the U.N. is now used as a sword against us,\" he said. \"It is controlled by the big powers.\" **********Frustrated by Libya's refusal to hand over the suspects in the bombing of th Pan Am flight, the United Nations Security Council expanded the sanctions in December 1993 by freezing Libyan assets around the world and denying the country access to a range of oil equipment. **********The tightened sanctions were also a response to Libya's refusal to cooperate with an inquiry into the 1989 bombing of a French airliner over Niger in which 171 people were killed. France has issued arrest warrants for four Libyans, including Colonel Qaddafi's brother-in-law, in connection with that blast. **********Colonel Qaddafi said today that he was putting some military equipment, including 100 planes, up for sale \"to anyone -- even individuals we know nothing about or gangs\" because sanctions had prevented his country from getting spare parts. **********As he spoke, the Libyan leader sat under the canopy of a green Bedouin tent in the sprawling Bab al-Azizya army barracks in Tripoli, not far from the site of the American bombing raid in 1986. The United States bombed Tripoli and Benghazi in retaliation for what it said was Libya's role in the bombing of a Berlin nightclub used by American servicemen. **********Colonel Qaddafi touched frequently on the 1986 bombing raids, calling former President Ronald Reagan and former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain \"war criminals who must be brought before Libyan courts.\" The air attacks reportedly killed 37 Libyans. **********\"Reagan and Thatcher are killers,\" he said as two aides stood against the tent walls. \"They killed scores of innocent Libyan children. The U.N. Security Council had better resolve this 1986 massacre before it tries to resolve the Lockerbie issue. I call it Lockerbie A and Lockerbie B. When we fix Lockerbie A, then we can deal with Lockerbie B.\" **********Despite his anger toward the United States, the Libyan leader had kind words for President Clinton. **********Colonel Qaddafi, who proposed that his son marry the Clintons' daughter, Chelsea, a few months ago to help smooth over differences between the countries, said the C.I.A. was using the President. **********\"President Clinton has nothing against us and we have nothing against him,\" he said. \"He inherited this policy. The C.I.A. has caused a lot of damage in the world, and if it is not stopped, it will destroy the United States.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/27/world/ira-leader-conciliatory-on-pace-of-talks.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-02-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 237, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "I.R.A.

The same thing men want, they seem to be saying: sex, plenty of it and the tackier the better. **********Publications that used to attract readers with recipes for lemon meringue pie now reel them in with exposed flesh -- the same time-worn tabloid tactic that used to be the province of men's magazines. After a flirtation with articles aimed at women with broader interests, magazines like Marie Claire, More! and Company have been reaching new highs in circulation by publishing just about any article with the word sex in it. **********As a result, cover lines featuring the \"s\" word scream out in fluorescent colors from London newsstands: \"The Secrets of Women who Adore Sex,\" \"Future Sex and Shopping,\" \"Sex and the Psycho Girl\" and \"Suburban Porn Stars.\" That last one, in the January issue of Company, came complete with graphic photographs under the headline \"Suburban Sex Scandal: Group Sex With Strangers, Masturbation, Whipping; It Could Be All Happening Next Door to You.\" **********That article may have gone too far. After all, Company is published by the National Magazine Company, a subsidiary of the Hearst Corporation that puts out the British versions of Cosmopolitan and Good Housekeeping, as well as the upscale Harpers and Queen magazine. **********When Company was introduced in 1978 as a kind of younger sister to Cosmopolitan, it focused on the concerns of 18- to 25-year-old women: relationships, straightforward sexual advice and women's health issues. **********But in the last year the popular monthly has shown a preference for sensationalistic articles. One issue ran a sealed inner section showing rows of close-up pictures of men's sexual organs. The point, according to the article, was to educate women about male anatomy. Educational claims were also made for January's suburban sex article, which photographed and described in vivid detail -- employing an impressive variety of four-letter words -- scenes of group sex and sadomasochism being filmed for a pornographic movie. **********Many readers were outraged. So were retailers who received angry complaints from customers. Supermarkets removed the offending issue from their stands, as did W. H. Smith and John Menzies, two of the largest news agents in Britain. **********\"Young girls browse around the newsstands, and we didn't want them to be exposed to these things,\" said a spokeswoman for Safeway Supermarkets, which also removed the January issue of More! because of a suggestive cover photograph. **********The moves were just a warning shot, however. The February issues of both magazines are back on the stands. \"Hopefully, they got the message,\" the Safeway spokeswoman said. **********Clearly they did. Mandi Norwood, the editor of Company, refused to answer questions about the January issue. The managing director of National Magazine, Terry Mansfield, released a statement that said, in part: \"The translation of such a controversial theme into the magazine medium presented challenges which, on reflection, could have been met more appropriately. We accept that the photographs used in the feature are not in good taste and regret that they may offend some people.\" **********The February issue of Company published a box asking readers whether subjects \"that may sometimes be unsavory but, nevertheless, like abortion, rape or abuse, are part of today's world,\" belonged in the pages of women's magazines. Mr. Mansfield said the magazine received about 200 letters in response, most of which supported coverage of such subjects. **********Mr. Mansfield, who said the company periodically conducted market surveys to determine which subjects were of interest to the magazine's readers, asserted that there was widespread interest in stories about sex in the context of relationships. He also cited research showing that young women were less informed about sex than commonly assumed. \"We find that it's through magazines that young women seek this information,\" Mr. Mansfield said. **********Critics of what The Daily Telegraph calls the \"sex-made\" trend among women's magazines contend that the goal is increasing circulation, not education. \"It's about selling magazines,\" said Jane Proctor, editor of Tatler, another women's monthly, which for the most part has steered clear of the trend. \"It's about editors trying to outdo each other. The recession has hit everybody.\" **********Linda Kelsey, editor of She, the British equivalent of Redbook, agreed, saying there was a lot of pressure on editors to increase circulation revenue as advertising income drops for British magazines. **********Stories on sex appear to be working like magic. The circulation of Company has grown by 18,000 in the last year, to 268,022 from 250,343 in 1993. Marie Claire, which used to be aimed at women with more intellectual interests, was amply rewarded for its decision about a year ago to include sexier stories: its circulation rose from 313,866 in 1993 to 398,019 last year, a jump of 85,000. **********\"A lot of editors have noted that sex pretty rapidly puts on sales,\" Ms. Kelsey said. \"But it's not the only thing that sells magazines. One of the most phenomenal success stories is Good Housekeeping, which sells very traditional values but in a kind of bright, up-to-date way.\" **********As for the other magazines, Ms. Kelsey said: \"I think that in nearly every case, what some call sensationalist has been explicit but acceptable. I would say, 'Why not?' \" **********An article in The Daily Telegraph said why not -- \"The result is degrading to women and ironically deserves all the old charges of exploitation that used to be leveled at girlie magazines for men.\" **********Ms. Kelsey, while admitting that the Company article in January \"overstepped the mark,\" maintained that the magazines were simply treating sex less reverently. \"I don't believe that women are titillated in the way men are by these overt, sexy articles,\" she said. **********Ms. Norwood of Company says it is the readers who decide what is acceptable. \"I think there is such a thing as bad taste,\" she said. \"But I find it hard to define. If it will offend the reader, it's bad taste.\" **********The trend toward sexually oriented subject matter in magazines parallels the recent growth of mainstream female erotic literature in Britain. Little Brown recently introduced a new imprint here -- but not in the United States -- called X Libris, which includes four slim bright pink volumes with titles like \"Arousing Anna.\" They are all written by, and for, women. **********\"We have to wake up to the fact that sex is here and people are talking about it,\" Ms. Norwood said, \"and thank God they are.\" **********\"I don't think there's anything wrong with a little voyeurism,\" she added. \"In small amounts.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/13/world/conflict-balkans-us-policy-us-took-calculated-risk-not-curbing-croat-attack.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Engelberg", "pub_date": "1995-08-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1895, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Took a Calculated Risk In Not Curbing Croat Attack", "print_headline": "CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS: U.S. POLICY; U.S. Took a Calculated Risk In Not Curbing Croat Attack", "body_text": " **********In the days before Croatia attacked rebel Croatian Serbs on Aug. 4, Bill Clinton met repeatedly with his national security aides almost every morning to weigh a crucial question: How far should he go in pressuring the Croats to call off their offensive? **********Anthony Lake, the national security adviser, and Madeleine K. Albright, the United States representative to the United Nations, were arguing that a Croatian attack probably could not be stopped, and might bring some benefits. **********It could save Bihac, the besieged United Nations safe haven in northwestern Bosnia, which NATO had promised to defend with air power without being sure it could do so. It could deal a crushing blow to the Serbs. And it might just open new opportunities for peace talks. **********Pentagon officials were a bit more circumspect. Defense Secretary William J. Perry told Mr. Clinton the Croatian Army's timetable for victory in four to eight days was overly optimistic. Many officials feared that if the Croats didn't prevail quickly, President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia would come under powerful pressure to help his fellow Serbs. **********Even if it did work, the operation could produce yet another vast stream of refugees. Were the gains worth the risks? Or was it too late for anything to stop a Croatian onslaught? **********Mr. Clinton eventually approved what one official termed the \"yellow-light approach\" and another characterized as \"an amber light tinted green.\" The Croats say they took it as tacit encouragement. **********Under the policy, Washington warned Zagreb of the risks of launching an attack, but said that it would not threaten sanctions, as it had done in March to prevent Croatia from ousting United Nations peacekeeping forces. Instead of dispatching Vice President Al Gore to meet President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, as happened in March when the United States leaned hard on Croatia to forestall a similar operation, the message was to be delivered by the American Ambassador in Zagreb. **********The consensus among most officials was that nothing the United States could do or say would dissuade Mr. Tudjman from attacking. **********\"Rather than a feckless effort to say don't do what we know you're going to do, we used our influence to steer them towards limited objectives,\" said one senior official. \"We were cautioning restraint. We were not saying this is a great idea.\" U.S. Feared Serbian Response **********The chief worry was that the Croats might broaden their attack to include the Serbian-held territories in eastern Croatia on the border with Serbia, a move that American intelligence officials believed would provoke Mr. Milosevic to retaliate. The American messages to Croatia in the hours leading up to the attack stressed the importance of avoiding civilian casualties and \"ethnic cleansing,\" officials said. **********On Aug. 4, the Croatian forces attacked. Within days they had reclaimed the land seized by rebel Serbs when Yugoslavia dissolved in 1991, shocking Pentagon officials with the ease of their victory and the collapse of the Serbs. Just as quickly, more than a 100,000 Serbs fled the country, a result Croatian officials insist they did not anticipate or encourage. **********The Croatian attack on the Krajina Serbs illustrates how the calculus of American power has changed in the post-cold-war world. The United States' influence in the Balkans has waned as the Clinton Administration's primary goal has become avoiding sending American troops to the region. While the Croats dearly want warm relations with the United States, they have other allies. In this instance, American officials said, Germany's decision not to strongly oppose the operation curtailed the American leverage. **********It is not yet clear how the Croatian victory will reshuffle the deck in the Balkans, and whether the American approach will ultimately pay dividends. Mr. Lake has been presenting the European allies with an American peace plan that promises all sides incentives for signing on and punishments for continuing the war. On Sunday, he is to discuss the plan with the Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev. **********There was at least one high-profile skeptic about the Administration's approach. Peter W. Galbraith, the United States Ambassador to Croatia, had earlier been instructed to try to avoid the war through diplomacy. He began a furious round of last-minute peace talks that won substantial concessions from the rebel Serbs. **********At the last moment, as senior officials in Washington were concluding that his effort could not succeed, Mr. Galbraith urged the Administration to change course and press Mr. Tudjman to accept the deal he had worked out. Senior officials turned down his request. Several believed the Serbs would never honor their promises, and that the time for a diplomatic solution had passed. Two days later, the attack began. **********\"It was too late to stop us,\" said Mario Nobilo, Croatia's representative to the United Nations. \"We thought we knew best how weak they are and how quick this could be.\" **********But Mr. Nobilo also acknowledged that the plan envisioned a \"minimal\" and a \"maximal\" option for the invasion, depending on both the international reaction and the stiffness of the Serbs' resistance. Croatia Builds Modern Army **********When Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, the Serbs living on its fringes seceded. With the help of the Serb-dominated Yugoslav Army, they seized about one third of the country, and said they hoped to join a \"Greater Serbia\" that included Serbia and the Bosnian Serbs. **********The fighting in Croatia subsided by January 1992, and the United Nations sent peacekeeping troops to monitor an agreement under which the Serb regions would eventually rejoin Croatia. It never happened. **********Over the next three years, Croatia bitterly complained that the United Nations was failing to fulfill its mandate, fearing the partition of their country would become permanent. Quietly, it began building a modern army that could win back the territory occupied by the Serbs, which the rebels called Krajina. **********In its early days, the Croatian Army was scarcely more organized than a local militia, its soldiers often seen on the battlefields in sneakers. **********Three years later, after hundreds of millions of dollars in purchases in Eastern Europe's arms bazaars, the picture had changed. Although Croatia is covered by the same United Nations embargo that forbids the Bosnians from buying weapons, the Croats, helped by a long coastline that is ideal for smuggling, have had far more success, tapping suppliers throughout the former eastern bloc, particularly Russia and the Ukraine. **********Bihac, a predominantly Muslim enclave just over the border in Bosnia, was one of the key flash points for the Croatian military. The rail line from Serbian-held Bosnian territory to the heart of Krajina wound its way through Bihac. As long as the town was in Muslim hands, the Serbian rebels would not be able to deliver provisions or move troops by train to much of Krajina. **********The rough terrain around Bihac favors the defenders. But the Krajina Serbs joined rebel Serbs from Bosnia in attacks on the town several times. **********Last November, Croatian officials saw a serious threat that Bihac might fall. Gojko Susak, the Defense Minister, summoned Mr. Galbraith to his office and said his Government was thinking about opening a corridor to the town through Serbian-held territory. Would the United States impose sanctions? The American reply was emphatically against such an operation, though no specific sanctions were mentioned. **********In January, Mr. Tudjman announced that he was fed up with the United Nations, and that he would refuse to renew the peacekeeping troops' mandate after March 31. This provoked alarm among some American officials. **********They worried that Mr. Tudjman was planning to attack the Krajina Serbs, which could in turn prompt Serbia to declare war on Croatia. At the time, a shaky cease-fire was holding in Bosnia. **********Richard Holbrooke, the Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs, flew to Zagreb in early March and warned Mr. Tudjman of dire consequences if he did not relent. Germany told Croatia it could not expect to join the European Union if it threw out the United Nations peacekeepers. A few days later, Vice President Gore and Ms. Albright met Mr. Tudjman in Denmark with a similarly tough message. **********The pressure worked. Mr. Tudjman changed his mind in exchange for a United Nations promise to begin monitoring the international border between Croatia and Bosnia. Bosnia Events Alter Strategy **********The cease-fire in Bosnia expired May 1. That day, more than 10,000 Croatian troops stormed into Western Slavonia, the smallest of the four Serbian-occupied areas of the country, retaking it in a lightning strike. **********After that triumph, Mr. Nobilo said, Croatia's plan was to maintain peace through the summer tourist season, and pressure the Krajina Serbs with an ultimatum in the fall. **********Events in Bosnia changed that plan. **********The Bosnian Serbs went on the offensive after NATO's raid on ammunition dumps in the Serbian stronghold of Pale, overrunning the so-called safe areas of Srebrenica and Zepa. When Western nations warned the Bosnian Serbs not to attack Gorazde, one of four remaining safe areas, the Serbian forces from Bosnian and Krajina renewed their attacks on Bihac. **********That worried Croatian officials. Once again, the Muslim defenders were giving ground. Once again, they faced the prospects that Krajina Serbs would finally secure their rail link to Serbia. **********Among Pentagon officials, there was a debate about how much could be done to save Bihac. Eventually, the allies' ultimatum was extended to all the safe areas, allowing NATO to bomb the attacking Serbian forces. Bihac, however, was being assaulted by rebel Muslims, Krajina Serbs and Bosnian Serbs. That made it difficult to use air power. Some American officials thought that the only way to save Bihac was to launch a bombing campaign across Bosnia, an idea France opposed. **********On July 22, Mr. Tudjman and Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian President, met in Croatia to discuss closer military cooperation. The subject of the meeting was Bihac, and Mr. Galbraith, the American Ambassador, attended. According to a Croatian official, Mr. Tudjman promised to send Croatian troops into Bosnia to seize towns just across the border from the Krajina Serb capital of Knin. This, it was hoped, would relieve the pressure on Bihac. **********American officials supported this idea, but warned Mr. Tudjman against attacking Krajina. **********The military assessment had shifted a bit. American intelligence officials were no longer certain Mr. Milosevic would intervene to prevent an attack on the Krajina Serb regions in central Croatia, a view the Croats shared. The threat of a wider war seemed to recede. Still, Pentagon officials were warning that a Croatian attack was a \"a high-risk deal,\" as one put it. **********By Aug. 1, the Croats had taken Bosansko Grahovo, cutting off Knin. The ease of that victory, as well as the Serbs' continued attacks on Bihac, Croatian officials said, encouraged them to push on. In Washington, there was little hope of restraining them. **********\"The issue was, they seem determined to go, and we can't stop them, unless we go to the mat,\" one senior official said. \"The top levels of our Government are fed up with the Serbs. There's no reason to threaten termination of our relations, and it probably won't work anyway.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/18/business/company-news-shares-of-applied-materials-soar-on-strong-earnings.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-05-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 107, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SHARES OF APPLIED MATERIALS SOAR ON STRONG EARNINGS", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; SHARES OF APPLIED MATERIALS SOAR ON STRONG EARNINGS", "body_text": " **********Shares of Applied Materials Inc. and other makers of semiconductor manufacturing equipment rallied yesterday, after the company reported second-quarter results that were better than expected.

And \"the Greatest Show on Earth\" is introducing the first national advertising campaign in its history. **********Ringling \"is the greatest brand on earth,\" said Allen J. Bloom, the circus's marketing and sales director, sounding very much like P. T. Barnum, a predecessor in the job. **********\"Our research has shown us that our name recognition is up there with Coca-Cola and Chevrolet,\" he added, \"and we're older than both. We think it's time to extend our brand.\" **********The new show will arrive next Thursday at Madison Square Garden, Ringling's traditional opening-night venue, with maximum publicity. But marketing has always been very much an internal story in the privately held company. It has never disclosed revenue or income. **********Those with knowledge of the company's operations, however, said that Ringling would buy about $20 million worth of newspaper, radio, television and outdoor advertisements this year in the cities where it tours. That amount is to be supplemented by another $5 million for the new national campaign. **********Mr. Bloom's forerunners, the legendary circus advance men, would be astonished at such princely sums. For generations, before the advent of radio and television, Ringling's advertising focused on the spectacle of the circus itself, which was both attention-getting and cheap. A visiting show's parades, elephant walks and even the raising of the circus tent were all calculated elements in Ringling's pied-piper strategy to draw the citizenry into the tent. **********This year, Ringling \"wanted to take a more global view of who we are, what we are and what our value is,\" said Susannah G. Smith, the company's vice president for corporate communications. \"We play to more people than any other live show -- 11 million people a year -- and our circus appears within 100 miles of 87 percent of the United States population.\" **********Ringling's 125th anniversary year has its own national sponsor: Sears, Roebuck & Company. And Ringling, said Rodney A. Huey, its vice president for public relations, \"wanted to shift from selling the specific attributes of the show to how we benefit the consumer nationally. Circus is a cultural imperative for children and parents in this country.\" **********Marketing experts are not surprised by the campaign. \"Ringling has an awesome advertising machine, and no one knows as much as they do about local marketing,\" said Thomas J. Crangle, an independent event-marketing consultant based in Los Angeles. \"A national campaign is the next logical step.\" **********Why hadn't there been one before? \"It made no sense to have national ads due to the nature of the circus tour,\" Ms. Smith said, because each of Ringling's two touring units travels to more than 90 cities during a two-year run. **********For example, a national campaign trumpeting the performance of Gunther Gebel-Williams, the circus's tiger trainer, at next week's opening in the Garden would be forgotten when the show reaches San Francisco in September. **********But making advertising buys in each market has become increasingly difficult. \"Twenty years ago you could buy spots on three television stations and saturate any local market,\" Ms. Smith said. \"Now you could buy 20 stations and still not saturate, thanks to the segmentation of the audience.\" **********To solve this puzzle, Ringling is relying increasingly on direct marketing: sending ticket brochures to customers in its mailing-list data base of those who have purchased tickets within the last four years. **********Those efforts are then enhanced by local television and newspaper advertising and promotions in supermarkets, department stores, mass merchants and other retailers. **********Ringling is coordinating the new national campaign, Mr. Bloom said. Circus footage was shot by the New York director Steve Horn, a longtime industry favorite who has worked for such clients as Nike, Liz Claiborne and Mitsubishi, and the Seiniger Advertising Group in Beverly Hills, Calif., used it for a test television campaign that ran last month in the New York and Baltimore-Washington markets. Goldberg Fossa Seid Advertising in New York is creating more spots. **********The television message, Mr. Bloom said, is: \"There is no better time to spend with your family than at Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus.\" **********Beyond the image-building, the campaign is \"paving the way for the expanded use of the Ringling brand in the years to come,\" Mr. Bloom said, adding that the company plans to restructure its management to help affix its brand on everything from video games and television programs to movies, snack foods and baby products. **********Can such grandiose plans work? \"The recognition level of the Ringling brand is astounding,\" Mr. Crangle said, \"so cross-pollinating the brand could work if they find people out there in their niche who are favorably disposed to circus. They shouldn't try to sell ice cubes to Eskimos.\" **********Yes, but wouldn't P. T.

It turned the main shopping thoroughfare, Church Street, into a pedestrian mall, and attracted a gleaming new shopping center. **********While the area had long suffered from shoplifting, prostitution, assaults and other crimes, stepped-up police patrols had already driven crime down by 25 percent over the last few years. **********The $600,000 surveillance program, concentrated on or near a half-mile stretch of Church Street, has provided 24-hour surveillance through cameras perched atop 20-foot poles placed at intervals of several hundred yards along the bustling street. The program is the result of a joint effort by the local government and businesses, using Government grants and donations. **********While many cities and businesses in the United States have limited video security systems, no other country has embraced the technology as Britain has. The national Government announced late last year that it was making $3.1 million in matching grants available for new projects this year. The program drew more than 200 applications. **********About 200 programs are already in operation in cities like Birmingham, Newcastle, Glasgow and Sunderland. The picturesque town of King's Lynn in northeastern England has 60 cameras. **********In Liverpool, the police can monitor the cameras through a screen of their own in a local station house, and are alerted to potential problems by the private security guards operating the system. **********\"It's been very helpful in making arrests, and perhaps more important, in helping us to allocate our resources to where they're most necessary,\" said Superintendent Howard Parry of the Merseyside Police, which patrols Liverpool. **********Mr. Parry said the police had no evidence yet that the system, installed last summer, has cut crime rates, although there are fewer panhandlers, illegal street vendors and professional shoplifters. **********But he said that in the face of videotaped evidence, a higher percentage of those charged with crimes in the central business district are pleading guilty. Local residents, asked on downtown streets, said they felt safer downtown, even at night. **********They also agreed with Mr. Parry that the cameras had not raised any civil rights concerns. There have been scattered objections around the country from critics worried that the system could have a chilling effect on public demonstrations, for instance. **********But for the most part there has been little public debate, in part because the legal system here tends more than in the United States to favor law enforcement over the rights of the accused. **********\"It was quite surprising,\" said Chris Sarno, a researcher at Southbank University's School of Land Management and Urban Policy in London who has sampled public opinion about the video systems. \"There were a few people who were sort of worried about what would happen to the tapes and where were they stored and the like. But in general -- no, there was very little concern about civil rights.\" **********In the Liverpool control center on a recent afternoon, the main concern of the guards on duty, who spoke on condition of anonymity, was tracking the movements of known or suspected shoplifters, prostitutes and muggers. **********For 20 minutes the cameras followed the four young men. Several times, one of the men would enter a store, while the others stood outside as if standing watch. The guards in the control room watched carefully for any sign of stealing. **********The guards in the control room on that afternoon radioed the police.  Then, as the young men rounded a corner, they ran into a waiting police officer. He took down their names and asked by radio if arrest warrants were outstanding on any of them. **********He seemed to give them a bit of a chewing out, and then sent them on their way. They trudged away from the downtown area, out of sight of the cameras, a bit less swagger in their step."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/28/business/funds-watch.html": {"writer_name": "Carole Gould", "pub_date": "1995-05-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1011, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FUNDS WATCH", "print_headline": "FUNDS WATCH", "body_text": " **********Tech Alternatives **********Just as there seems to be a movement afoot to put a personal computer on every desk, the mutual fund industry seems on its way to putting a computer stock in every portfolio. **********Technology and computer stocks now account for 16 percent of the holdings of diversified equity funds. That's nearly twice the weighting of such stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 index. Among the 40 top-selling mutual funds, technology stocks now account for 20 percent of the portfolios, according to Morningstar Inc., the fund researcher in Chicago. **********As long as investors are comfortable with such a large stake in a volatile sector, jumping ship is unnecessary. But many investors may not be aware how much of their fund portfolios are riding on the performance of the technology sector, which has been leading the stock market rally this year. Should technology stocks dive, as market cycles suggest will eventually happen, investors may get a rude awakening. **********One way for investors to pare exposure is to make sure some of their funds shun technology issues. Morningstar recently listed five diversified equity funds that have kept their technology holdings below 5 percent in recent years: Longleaf Partners, Scudder Growth and Income, T. Rowe Price Growth and Income, Capital Income Builder and Franklin Equity-Income. No-Loads Gain **********A look at buying habits shows that mutual fund investors are increasingly independent. The percentage of sales through stock brokers is shrinking, while sales directly by fund companies are on the rise. And that trend is likely to continue, said Guy Moszkowski, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. **********Sales forces, including brokers, bankers and insurers, accounted for 55 percent of the fund industry's sales last year, down from 69 percent in 1988, according to the Investment Company Institute. **********Mr. Moszkowski says investors feel less need for advice and have become more price sensitive. The booming stock market has helped as well, since stock funds tend to be a strong suit for companies that sell funds directly to the public. The market share lost by stock brokers has been picked up by financial planners and to a smaller extent, by banks. But only a handful of banks are selling funds profitably, Mr. Moszkowski said, and there are already some signs that banks are losing momentum in the fund business. Questions on Ads **********Think mutual fund ads tell only part of the story? You're in good company. **********The advertising regulation department of the National Association of Securities Dealers is concerned that funds are increasingly using incomplete and misleading performance charts in their sales material. So the N.A.S.D., a self-regulatory body, is advising fund companies to clean up their act. **********One problem involves funds that don't show their own performance, but use an index as a proxy. Some ads stress the performance of the S.& P. 500, for example, while playing down the fund's actual performance or even omitting it. **********The N.A.S.D. is telling funds that they should include their own performances prominently in such materials. Furthermore, the sales material should include important caveats. For example, a chart that shows small-company stocks outperforming other investments over a specified period should also note that these stock prices are usually volatile and that government securities offer a fixed rate of return if held to maturity, while stocks do not. Investor Protection **********Should a brokerage firm fail, the investors' last resort is the Securities Investor Protection Corporation. The S.I.P.C. insures up to $500,000 in securities and $100,000 in cash in an investor's account. Not all brokers, though, are covered by the fund. The Securities and Exchange Commission will soon force brokerage firms to make it clear if they lack such protection. Starting on Oct. 2, brokers who are not S.I.P.C. members will have to say so on customer confirmations. Manager Changes **********The Invesco Funds Group has shuffled the managers of five funds. Invesco Emerging Growth passes from Doug Pratt to John Schroer, who continues to co-manage Strategic Health Sciences. Strategic Environmental goes to Jeff Morris from John Schroer. Tom Samuelson, who came from Swiss Bank Capital Markets, picks up Strategic Energy from Dan Leonard. Al Grossi, formerly of the Westinghouse Pension Investments Corporation, takes over Worldwide Capital Goods. Doug Pratt will co-manage the Invesco Growth with Dalton Sim, and continue running Strategic Financial Services. **********Bruno Bertocci, formerly with Rockefeller & Company, joined Stein Roe & Farnham as manager of Stein Roe International. **********John F.

Jason Windawi, an analyst with Morningstar, the mutual funds tracking service in Chicago. **********Unlike health care, environmental and Latin American funds, which are fads based on industries or regions peripheral to the world economy, funds devoted to real estate allow investors to participate in one of the world's biggest classes of assets, commercial real estate, he said.

But the move by Sumitomo, the third-largest bank in the world, was also praised by analysts as a bold attempt -- at least for the normally conservative Japanese banks -- to bite the bullet and resolve problems quickly. **********\"It's a gutsy move,\" said Alicia Ogawa, an analyst with Salomon Brothers in Tokyo. \"It's completely unprecedented. It will make other banks answer the question of why they are not doing that.\" **********Many major banks in the United States have had losses from writing off bad debts. Investors often regard these moves as positive for the long run because they speed the cleanup of the balance sheet. **********But in Japan, analysts said, the all-powerful Ministry of Finance has restrained banks from reporting losses for fear of undermining public confidence in the banking system. **********As a result, banks have been disposing of their bad loans bit by bit, and selling stock in companies they own to compensate for the write-offs. \"If every bank did not take equity gains, every bank would have a net loss,\" said Elizabeth Daniels, banking analyst with Morgan Stanley & Company in Tokyo. **********The slow disposal of bad debts, however, has been delaying Japan's recovery from a three-year-long recession, because banks weighed down with bad loans have been reluctant to lend new money. **********Analysts said Sumitomo's action might be emulated by some other banks, but not by many. Most banks do not have the financial strength that Sumitomo has to withstand a big loss. And the Finance Ministry, which approved Sumitomo's move, might be reluctant to see the practice spread too widely. **********\"To suddenly start having a half-dozen or a dozen banks taking a loss, that might cause some worries,\" said J. Brian Waterhouse, an analyst with James Capel in Tokyo. He and other analysts said they saw little risk to Japan's banking system from Sumitomo's action. **********Sumitomo, part of the huge Sumitomo Group based in Osaka, is considered one of the most prestigious, aggressive and profit-oriented banks in Japan. It owns 12.5 percent of Goldman, Sachs & Company, the Wall Street firm. **********But Sumitomo ran into trouble because of billions of dollars of loans it made to the Itoman Corporation, a scandal-tainted trading company. Itoman invested wildly in real estate and bought Picassos, Chagalls and other works of art as a way to launder money, resulting in the arrests of several executives. Itoman was rescued by Sumitomo Bank and absorbed into another company in the Sumitomo Group in 1993. **********Sumitomo Bank said today that it had been planning to write off 500 billion yen, or about $5 billion, worth of loans in the second half of the fiscal year, but has now increased that to 800 billion yen, or about $8 billion. This includes all the Itoman loans still on Sumitomo's books. **********While the bank will sell some of its stock holdings to partly compensate, it predicted it would still end up with a net loss to its parent company of 280 billion yen, or $2.8 billion, in the fiscal year that ends March 31. Until today the bank had been forecasting a net profit of 35 billion yen. **********At a news conference today, Yoshifumi Nishikawa, a senior managing director, said the bank made a \"strategic choice\" that would improve its financial condition in the medium and long term. He said the loss would be for this year only. **********Sumitomo, which had 1.2 trillion yen, or $12 billion, of nonperforming loans on its books in September, said it had a strong capital position and could withstand the loss. **********Sumitomo's announcement came after the close of trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The bank's shares had ended the day at 1,610 yen, a loss of 20 yen. **********Most Japanese banks made unwise loans during the late 1980's, when Japanese land and stock prices were soaring wildly. But in the early 1990's, the \"bubble\" collapsed and Japan plunged into a recession. **********Japan's 21 major banks reported 13.3 trillion yen, or about $133 billion, of bad loans in September, but that excludes restructured loans on which the banks receive little or no interest. Ms. Daniels of Morgan Stanley estimates that bad loans actually total 40 trillion yen, or $400 billion. **********In October, the Nippon Trust Bank essentially collapsed and predicted a loss of $1.6 billion this fiscal year.

It was the first major carrier to announce results in what is expected to be a record second quarter for the industry. **********But a couple of sour notes could be heard in the fanfare, for good news for the airlines can also be bad news. One problem is that the airlines are trying to persuade Congress to extend a tax exemption of 4.3 cents a gallon on fuel beyond Oct. 1, which would be worth more than $500 million to the industry. With strong earnings, though, politicians are not likely to give the airlines a break. **********\"The exemption for aviation fuel is unwarranted and would be unfair to other sectors of the transportation industry.\" said Cynthia G. Beerbower, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy for the Treasury Department, before the Senate Finance Committee yesterday. **********Second, airlines have long pleaded poverty to their unions, contending that they need wage or productivity concessions to compete against low-cost and low-fare carriers. **********With many carriers still in labor contract talks, they are likely to find that union members are not swayed by the argument that record earnings at present are little more than a drop in the bucket compared with their losses of $13 billion over the last five years. **********Airline unions have long complained that they have pitched in to help in the lean years and have not been invited to the feast in fat years. **********At Continental, pilot representatives are sending a proposal to the union's board this Friday for a vote. Bob Wilson, president of the Independent Association of Continental Pilots, declined to predict how the vote will go. He whistled aloud, however, when told yesterday morning of Continental's profit. \"That is significantly more than we expected,\" he said. **********Other airlines are also negotiating with labor groups that will be closely following quarterly earnings. Delta Air Lines hopes to wrest $340 million in annual savings from its pilots to help fulfill its broader cost-cutting goals. American Airlines, a unit of AMR, is talking with nearly all its labor groups. And USAir is hoping that its three main unions -- pilots, mechanics and flight attendants -- will contribute $500 million in annual savings to its goal of cutting costs by $1 billion a year. **********\"That's going to be a hard sell,\" said Randolph Babbitt, president of the Air Line Pilots Association. He added that pilots were typically willing to entertain proposals, if there was sufficient potential to share in future gains, through stock ownership, for example. **********Paul Karos, an airline analyst at CS First Boston, said that most investors were not counting on significant labor concessions in their earnings estimates. But if the fuel tax exemption is not extended, he said, \"that would be incremental new bad news.\" **********Over all, the airline industry has seen more good news than bad recently. Low-fare competition has declined, in part because Continental has scrapped its Continental Lite experiment. In addition, airlines have been trying to raise fares, and they have been relatively successful because of the infrequency and shallowness of fare wars. **********As a result, many airline stocks have jumped sharply in recent months. Continental's B-class shares, for example, have risen from a low of $6.50 a share in mid-January to $26.625, up 87.5 cents, yesterday. **********The important question, of course, is whether these long-term trends will continue.

But by announcing that American companies were passed over in a high-profile competition, China is highlighting the potential consequences of diplomatic trouble without actually losing a beneficial deal. **********For all the concern that Beijing is looking for ways to punish American businesses, executives at more than a dozen companies here said they expected the tensions to have little effect on their businesses, especially those involving large investments. **********\"At this point, we don't see any real reason for concern,\" said James J. Paulsen, Ford's chief representative in China. \"I think, based on the rocky relations we've seen between the U.S. and China in the past, that decisions are still based on economic reasons.\" **********Among the large deals for which American companies are competing this year, two are in Shanghai: a $1 billion venture to build passenger cars, where General Motors is considered a front-runner over Ford and Toyota, and two subway projects worth a total of $500 million, a toss-up between a German group and an American consortium that includes General Railway Signal of Rochester and Cubic Automated Revenue Collection of San Diego. **********In each case, executives said, commercial factors are likely to outweigh the nationality of a partner. **********Jeffrey E. Garten, the Under Secretary of Commerce, said in a telephone interview from Paris that his department was carefully tracking a dozen pending projects worth more than $100 million that involve American companies bidding against foreign competitors in the power, transportation and telecommunications fields. \"We have no indication that any have been affected\" by the disputes, Mr. Garten said. **********Besides, Chinese organizations do not want to lose the money and technology that American partners bring, and would likely object if Beijing made any kind of unilaterally anti-American business decisions. **********\"They don't just send out central directives saying, 'Don't do business with Americans,' \" said Anne Stevenson-Yang, director of the U.S.-China Business Council in Beijing. \"People seem to think there are five guys sitting around making all the decisions. That's not the way it works.\" **********To be sure, politics does intrude on foreign business operations in China. Several executives said their meetings with Chinese officials on ordinary issues like operating regulations and taxes had become more stern in recent weeks, sometimes interrupted with questions about why the United States Government was interfering in China's affairs. **********In politically sensitive areas like publishing and information services, executives said, it is not a good time to approach the Chinese. Business-related exchanges have been canceled, including a visit by Reed E. Hundt, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, to talk to Chinese officials about the advantages of regulation. **********\"When tensions are high,\" said Jim Bercaw, executive vice president of AT&T China, \"no one in the Chinese Government wants to be accused of making a decision\" that looks pro-American. **********Unless, that is, the decision is made at the top. Senior Chinese leaders, in times of strained relations with the United States, sometimes like to reward American companies they regard as particularly friendly -- in the hope that the companies will reciprocate by putting pressure on Washington to ease its stance. **********Last week, senior leaders told the American International Group that it would be allowed to start selling both life and general insurance in the big southern center of Guangzhou, making it the first foreign insurer allowed to operate outside Shanghai, where A.I.G. has been selling insurance since 1992. The timing of the permission surprised even A.I.G., said Michael I. D. Morrison, the company's general manager here. **********Maurice R. Greenberg, the big insurer's chief executive, has been working on his relationships with Chinese leaders for more than 20 years. During a visit to Beijing last week with another \"old friend\" of China, former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, Mr. Greenberg was named special economic adviser to the Beijing municipal government, a position created for him. **********Germany, known for granting generous low-interest loans to finance projects in China involving German companies, appeared to reap a pile of benefits during President Jiang Zemin's visit to Bonn. More than $3 billion of contracts and letters of intent were announced. **********In addition to the mini-van deal, Mercedes, a unit of Daimler-Benz A.G., was chosen as a partner in a $50 million venture to make tour buses and bus chassis in Yangzhou, President Jiang's hometown in Jiangsu Province. **********Yet among the dozens of other projects announced, reporters noticed, many were the same ones disclosed last year when Prime Minister Li Peng visited Germany. **********For Mercedes-Benz, auto executives noted, being selected as a partner for a Chinese venture is still some distance from actually signing a contract, to be negotiated only after a feasibility study is completed, which may take more than a year. **********The mini-van project invited attention last year when it seemed to turn into a hot race between Chrysler, the mini-van leader in the United States, and Mercedes-Benz, a company with high name recognition in China but one that has never before made a mini-van. **********Late last year, however, Chrysler executives became frustrated by their negotiations, including what they saw as China's unwillingness to protect Chrysler technology from being illegally copied. Chrysler is particularly sensitive to the issue, in part because the Jeep Cherokees it makes with a Chinese partner in Beijing have been imitated by pirate factories. **********One auto executive who is not with Chrysler, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Chrysler was driven away by the \"botched negotiating\" of the Chinese at the Ministry of Machine-Building Industry. **********Executives at Ford, once considered a leading contender for the Shanghai sedan-making venture, said they were surprised early this year when they were asked to submit a bid for the mini-van venture. **********Although Mercedes-Benz was clearly the favorite, Ford executives duly prepared and submitted a proposal. Since they did not really expect to win the deal, Ford executives have stressed their determination to make cars in China in the future. **********\"We do not expect it to be easy, because the logistics and bureaucracy are so complex,\" a Ford executive said of working in China. \"But over the long term, we feel we have to be assembling vehicles here.\" **********Not that doing business in China has ever been easy or predictable. **********\"We knew this wasn't going to be a smooth ride when we got on the bus,\" Mr. Bercaw of AT&T said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/05/world/china-is-said-to-sell-executed-inmates-organs.html": {"writer_name": "Catherine Manegold", "pub_date": "1995-05-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 596, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "China Is Said to Sell Executed Inmates' Organs", "print_headline": "China Is Said to Sell Executed Inmates' Organs", "body_text": " **********Two Chinese refugees -- one a former political prisoner and one a former police official -- testified in Senate hearings today that the Chinese Government removes organs from executed prisoners and sells them for use in medical transplants in state-owned hospitals. **********The recipients of the organs, they said, are usually top Chinese officials or foreigners from Hong Kong, Japan, Britain and the United States who need either kidney or cornea transplants and can afford to pay for the operations in foreign currency. **********\"Basically, they look at the prisoner's body as whatever they want it to be,\" said Gao Pei Qi, a former member of China's Public Security Bureau who now lives in exile in London. \"They would take the prisoner's skin, if necessary.\" **********Mr. Gao, who testified through an interpreter, described a prison system so entwined with China's hospitals that executions are scheduled and sometimes ordered in concert with transplant demands. Another witness, Harry Wu, a former political prisoner who now runs a human rights foundation and is a research fellow at the Hoover Institute at Stanford University, described the transplant system as an \"open secret\" that the Chinese Government does not want exposed abroad for fear of political retribution and pressure to end what has become a lucrative trade. **********Today's testimony, at a hearing conducted by Senator Jesse Helms but attended only by Senator Charles S. Robb, Democrat of Virginia, portrayed a hidden world in which the ethical checks and balances of American medical practices do not apply. **********Several witnesses said the testimony showed that the United States should take a harder stance against China. A year ago President Clinton severed the relationship between China's trade status with the United States and its human rights record. **********Mr. Gao, describing the public executions, said death row prisoners were made to kneel before being shot in the head or heart before their corpses were rushed into waiting vans where surgeons removed organs while the bodies were in transit to local crematories. Prisoners whose corneas are to be used are shot through the heart, he said, though other details of the executions vary from one region to the next. When the vans deliver the corpses at their destinations, he said, the removed organs are transferred to waiting vehicles and escorted to local hospitals by the police. **********Many of the transplants occur within 10 hours of a prisoner's death, several witnesses said. **********One ward at the Huzxi University of Medical Sciences in Sichuan Province performed 10 kidney transplants in one day, said Mr. Wu. Another hospital in Hubei Province simultaneously provided five patients with new kidneys, he added. **********While the organ removals are done in secret, Mr. Wu said, the executions are public, with citizens called together to observe them. At times, as many as 15,000 people may gather in a sports arena or other large auditorium for the event, witnesses said. \"It's a big show,\" Mr. Wu said. **********There are no firm figures on the number of organ transplants obtained from prisoners each year, witnesses said. But estimates ranged from 2,000 to 10,000, with most operations involving the replacement of kidneys and corneas, they said. **********Mr. Wu described one incident in which he said an ailing Chinese Air Force pilot was matched with a female prisoner on death row. \"The female prisoner was already sentenced to death,\" said Mr. Wu said. \"But there was no timing for the execution.

They gave much of the credit for the dollar's recovery to Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, who in recent months has frequently used skills honed on Wall Street to catch speculators off balance -- often during their summer vacations -- making them increasingly wary of placing billion-dollar wagers that the dollar would resume its decline. **********\"Betting against the U.S. Treasury looks like a riskier proposition than it seemed a few months ago,\" an American monetary official said today. Some economists agreed. \"The execution of this strategy could only be called brilliant,\" said Allen Sinai, the global economist at Lehman Brothers, \"in part because it was done so quietly, in part because the Administration has let actions speak louder than words.\" **********After a fall of roughly 20 percent earlier this year, the dollar has regained its lost ground, closing today in New York at 101.16 yen, up from 99.96 yen on Monday.  [ The dollar continued its surge in Tokyo on Wednesday, trading above 102 yen for the first time since June 21, 1994. ] **********There is some risk, of course, that the dollar could reverse direction again. But for now, several senior Administration officials said privately that they were astounded by the speed of the dollar's rebound. **********Back in April, when the dollar touched a record low of 79.75 yen, almost no one in the White House or the Treasury believed that the changing alignment of political and economic forces with Japan and Germany, among other nations, would bring the dollar back so strongly. Most doubted it would recover before the 1996 election. **********Against major European currencies, the dollar showed little change.  The dollar closed in New York at 1.4737 German marks, down slightly from 1.4739 on Monday. The British pound also gained slightly on the dollar, closing at $1.5548, compared with $1.5482 on Monday. **********Economic policy is never far from electoral politics these days, and there is a growing hope in the White House that the stronger dollar -- along with the low inflation that a buoyant currency helps sustain -- will make it far easier to keep interest rates from rising as the election approaches. **********Mr. Rubin took pains today not to declare victory, saying during a telephone conversation that \"markets always make you regret doing that sort of thing.\" He attributed much of the dollar's rebound to a declaration of the Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers in Washington on April 25 that stated that \"Recent movements have gone beyond the levels justified by underlying economic conditions in the major countries.\" **********At the time, the statement and a vaguely worded expression of resolve to cooperate in reversing the trend were dismissed by many traders and commentators as jawboning. **********\"People were skeptical and that was wrong,\" Mr. Rubin said. \"What we said would happen is what in fact occurred.\" **********While President Clinton is one of the big winners from the strengthening of the dollar against the yen, the Japanese may have won even more. The soaring yen had only compounded the troubles crippling the Japanese economy -- turning many of the country's key export industries into money-losers -- and it worsened the precarious condition of the country's banks. The stronger dollar also eases some of the pain of Japan's bad investments in the United States: in yen terms, the Mitsubishi Estate Company's nearly $2 billion fiasco over Rockefeller Center would have looked worse in April than it does today. **********It took some time, however, and that says much about how political fortunes changed. Japan's banking crisis and its deflation worsened, finally scaring its financial authorities into taking steps to pump more money into the economy. Germany's growth slowed, prompting it to lower interest rates and seek a stronger dollar as well. **********And there was good luck: inflation in the United States has stayed low, and the American stock market's rise continued to attract foreign investors. The standoff between the White House and Congress has probably helped as well, convincing investors that a real reduction in the national deficit was on the way. **********In part the dollar has come back because the Bank of Japan, after months of vacillation, has regularly stepped in to spend hundreds of millions of dollars a day to prop the dollar up. Combined with Mr. Rubin's surprise interventions, Japan's determination to buoy the dollar has suddenly made it risky for speculators to be caught holding yen. **********The end of the bitter trade dispute between Washington and Tokyo over automobiles was probably the final factor, economists and some Government officials say, in helping to reverse the psychology that dominated currency markets until recently. While most outside experts were unimpressed with the details of the agreement, it may have cleared the way for Mr. Rubin to press the Japanese to act more decisively in stimulating their economy and dealing with the banking crisis. **********Mr. Rubin communicated frequently with his Japanese counterpart, Masayoshi Takemura, in recent months to nudge Japanese authorities along, but today he declined to give the details of those conversations or speculate about how influential they might have been. **********\"The important point,\" Mr. Rubin said, \"is that we have seen the Japanese Government taking measures to deal with the realities of their economy -- slow growth, declining prices -- and they have now taken some serious measures.\" **********Tokyo's gradual change in attitude has been matched inby Washington, where the accepted wisdom has been that a weak dollar would bolster American exports to Japan, and bring down the trade deficit. But Mr. Rubin's constant incantation that \"a strong dollar is in America's interest\" came to signal a revisionist view that the American economy would be helped even more by a revived Japanese economy than by a struggling one."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/11/world/convicting-cali-s-drug-boss-may-be-as-hard-as-arresting-him.html": {"writer_name": "Larry Rohter", "pub_date": "1995-06-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 658, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Convicting Cali's Drug Boss May Be as Hard as Arresting Him", "print_headline": "Convicting Cali's Drug Boss May Be as Hard as Arresting Him", "body_text": " **********It took months of effort and a massive manhunt to capture Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela, the leader of the Cali cocaine cartel who was arrested Friday and immediately rushed to a maximum-security prison here.

Each time he was able to use his wealth and a battery of lawyers to gain his freedom, helping earn him the nickname \"El Ajedrecista\" -- \"The Chess Player.\" **********The arrest in Cali by a special security unit of more than 1,000 men was the most significant blow against drug traffickers since Pablo Escobar, head of the rival Medellin cartel, was hunted down and killed in December 1993. But for President Ernesto Samper Pizano, it is also a personal victory. **********Since taking office 10 months ago, Mr. Samper has faced accusations that his Government had failed to take an aggressive stance against drug trafficking because he was in league with the Cali cartel. **********\"The capture means a personal sigh of relief for me, because I was exposed to accusations and suspicions,\" the President said in an interview today at his weekend home. \"I feel relief for the country, which was also under suspicion.\" **********The charges against Mr. Samper arose as the result of telephone conversations tape recorded during his campaign last year in which cartel members were heard agreeing to donate $3.75 million to his campaign. Mr. Samper denied knowingly receiving money from the cartel. **********In March, the Clinton Administration, in an annual evaluation of the cooperation it receives from foreign countries, declined to certify Colombia as an effective ally in combating the drug trade. Shortly thereafter, Senator Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, introduced a bill that would deny Colombia important trade benefits unless its performance against drug trafficking improved. **********But in an interview Friday night, Defense Minister Fernando Botero Zea denied that the strike against the cartel had come in response to pressure from the United States. Rather, he said, Mr. Rodriguez's capture was the result of \"an incremental effort\" aimed at undermining the cartel from within and leaving its leadership exposed and vulnerable. **********\"The President has from the beginning of his administration ordered the most extreme efforts in order to capture the Cali kingpins,\" Mr. Botero said. **********He said Colombian authorities learned about three weeks ago that Mr. Rodriguez had purchased a house in the exclusive Santa Monica section of Cali with the intent of using it as a hiding place. From that moment on, he said, \"We had female police posing as joggers and policemen dressed as street vendors and the like making the necessary surveillance on this property.\" **********Though he is in custody, Mr. Rodriguez could still become a source of tension between the United States and Colombia. Just this week, he was among a group of 59 people indicted in Miami on drug trafficking charges. **********But the Colombian Constitution prohibits extradition, and Mr. Botero said the Government would abide by that provision. In the past, drug cartel leaders wanted in the United States have been able to continue running their operations from plush quarters in prisons here. **********In 1985 Mr. Rodriguez was arrested in Spain, and both the United States and Colombia sought his extradition. Colombia won, and he eventually was set free. **********Mr. Rodriguez \"will be prosecuted and judged in Colombia, without external pressures,\" Adolfo Salamanca, the deputy chief prosecutor here, said at a news conference on Friday.  He said the American Embassy had offered to supply evidence gathered in the indictments pending against Mr. Rodriguez in the United States.

For example, the fee for a Hertz rental car picked up in Munich, Germany, and left in Milan, Italy, is $320, while it is $464 for one picked up in Milan and dropped off in Frankfurt. **********At least those were the fees, before Hertz recently cut them to about $55 for rentals that begin and end in any of 16 European cities. In addition to Frankfurt and Milan, these also include Amsterdam, Brussels, Geneva, Munich, Paris and Zurich. **********\"The drop-off fee is so high in Europe,\" Lauren Garven, a Hertz spokeswoman, said, \"because some countries require that cars dropped off from another country must be re-rented within a specific time -- and to a driver going back to where the car came from.\" **********For example, a car rented in Paris and dropped off in Munich, she said, must be re-rented within 24 hours to avoid a high drop-off fee -- high, because to comply with such laws it is often necessary for the company that rented the car to send someone to drive the car back. **********\"We looked at our traffic patterns from country to country for over a year,\" Ms. Garvey said. \"When we found the movement was efficient and consistent among those 16 key cities, we decided we could offer the program.\" Always Time for Golf **********Mark Twain described golf as \"a good walk spoiled,\" but there don't seem to be many spoilsports among movers and shakers: A recent poll of the holders of American Express platinum cards found that a majority of them said they would modify their schedule to include a round of golf while traveling for business."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/28/business/taking-in-the-sites-for-designers-space-to-do-it-their-way.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Holcomb", "pub_date": "1995-08-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 560, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Taking In the Sites; For Designers, Space to Do It Their Way", "print_headline": "Taking In the Sites; For Designers, Space to Do It Their Way", "body_text": " **********In the old neighborhoods south of Times Square, an eclectic community of innovators and artists has grown up around the business of computer graphic designing.

The sites they create to promote their friends and neighbors in the jazz clubs, art galleries and on the streets of New York, however, can be far more engaging. Clicking from one to the next, one can almost sense the designers' sheer pleasure in pushing the potential of the medium and in bringing lower Manhattan to the Internet. **********\"There is an embarrassment of talent here in terms of new media production,\" said Guy Garcia, site director and editor of Total New York, the local forum where Web designers gather to flex their pixels. **********Total New York is a little city complete at this time with a mayor -- Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is to appear in a live Internet video conference sponsored by Sun Microsystems and Prodigy. (The event was scheduled for earlier this month but was canceled at the last minute and has yet to be rescheduled.) The site reflects the city in other ways -- there is a lot of noise in one of the links and some graffiti in others. **********More important, it has a slick look and a feature called Scanner: New Media Buzz. It is a commentary on the tools they use in their trade, focusing on the different options Web artists have to combine design with words, sounds and images. It is written by Carl Goodman, curator of the American Museum of the Moving Image and designed by the Total New York staff. **********On a personal computer with a 486 microprocessor and a fast enough connection (28,800 baud or more), Scanner screams with flashing colors and streaks in motion, before landing in Mr. Goodman's cyber column (he reports that the flashing colors are a result of a bug in Netscape \"that savvy programmers have discovered and exploited\"). On a computer with a 386 microprocessor and a 14,400-bps modem the effects are as disappointing as a motion picture shown at too slow a speed. **********The first link on Mr. Goodman's page takes one to the animated homepage of Razorfish Inc. (again, a fast connection is needed to appreciate the dynamics). He then offers three links in which he promises to \"make fun of easy targets,\" \"offer intelligent linkages,\" and \"present an opinionated calendar of New York media events.\" **********The other links look enticing. The Outpost, for example, was put together by a group of artists in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn and offers a look at their work and their lives. Unfortunately, a few of the other links go nowhere. **********Mr. Goodman's discussion of New York's media designers introduces some of the region's noteworthy design and production resources and provides links to organizations and consortiums like the Center for Digital Multimedia of New York University. **********Certainly there are other geographic clusters of cybertalent in the world, and many of their inhabitants have produced fascinating Web sites.

In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Omnicom shares closed up 75 cents at $58.50. Omnicom bested a second suitor, Richard Humphreys, a partner in the holding company that controls N. W. Ayer & Partners in New York. **********Omnicom has been a principal reason for the continuing consolidation of the agency industry, buying independents like Chiat/Day, Griffin Bacal and TBWA International in the last two years. It has grown to become the world's second-largest agency company in billings, according to Advertising Age, with 1994 billings of almost $16.1 billion, behind only the WPP Group at $20 billion. **********\"We get about equal parts of growth through acquisitions and organic means,\" said Bruce Crawford, president and chief executive of Omnicom in New York. **********\"But we're not on an acquisition binge,\" he added. \"It's all strategic. With Ross Roy, it's a strategic step in the marketing services area, where they're very strong.\" **********Ross Roy, based in the Detroit suburb of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., is the 27th-largest agency in the United States, according to Advertising Age, with 1994 billings of $508 million from clients like the Chrysler Corporation and Domino's Pizza. It lost a big important account last month when the Kmart Corporation left after 26 years for Campbell Mithun Esty in Minneapolis. **********Ross Roy has about 800 employees in offices in Bloomfield Hills; Hanover, Md., a Baltimore suburb; Windsor, Ontario, and Woodland Hills, Calif. It will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Omnicom, and its current management will remain in place. Ross Roy will join a division known as Diversified Agency Services with 35 autonomous units offering clients direct marketing, sales promotion, advertising and other services. **********\"There may, I think, be a little bit of nostalgia on the part of some of our folks,\" said Peter R. Mills, chairman and chief executive of Ross Roy, which was founded in 1926 by Ross Roy, a former automobile salesman who became a Detroit advertising pioneer and died in 1983 at age 85. **********\"But I think at this point in time most people are beyond that,\" he added, because \"if you look at the trends it's becoming clearer and clearer\" that agency companies like Omnicom represent an increasingly attractive option to all but the largest independents. Mr. Mills will report to John Wren, chairman and chief executive of the diversified services division. **********Omnicom's interest in Ross Roy was initially piqued more than two years ago, Mr. Crawford said, but talks were broken off after some discussions about Ross Roy's being absorbed into BBDO. Omnicom's interest in Ross Roy, then as now, was primarily because they share a significant client, Chrysler. BBDO is the agency for Chrysler's Dodge division, while Ross Roy is direct marketing agency of record for Chrysler. **********\"I don't think anyone views this as anything but an opportunity\" to better serve Chrysler and other clients, said Mr. Mills, who held top executive positions at BBDO in Canada and the United States before joining Ross Roy in June 1993 as president and chief executive of its advertising operations. **********For instance, he added, Mr. Wren told him of a client of Diversified Agency Services in Toronto \"with some pretty significant telemarketing needs, but D.A.S. in Toronto doesn't offer telemarketing.\" \"But,\" he said, \"our office in Windsor does.\" **********The other offer before the Ross Roy board was from Mr. Humphreys, a former executive of the Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising Worldwide unit of Cordiant P.L.C. He is now president of Adcom, a company that owns most of Ayer; Ross Roy and Ayer are joint venture partners in a direct marketing agency, Worldwide 1 on 1. A third bidder, the Bozell Worldwide unit of Bozell, Jacobs, Kenyon & Eckhardt, dropped out in early May; Bozell, like Ross Roy and BBDO, is a Chrysler agency. **********\"We had three pretty aggressive bidders,\" Mr. Mills said, but \"at the end of the day, our board felt Omnicom offered the best of both worlds, a financially strong partner and relative autonomy.\" **********\"We can operate independently to leap over conflict hurdles,\" he added, \"and still have a big daddy there with big pockets if you need it.\" **********Ross Roy's turning down of the bid from Mr. Humphreys could have implications for Ayer, according to trade publications, which have reported that W.Y. Choi, who owns Adcom with Mr. Humphreys, is reluctant to pursue acquisitions. If Mr. Humphreys and Mr. Choi part ways, senior executives of Ayer might seek equity stakes in that agency."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/11/business/accord-is-reached-on-a-common-security-system-for-the-internet.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Lewis", "pub_date": "1995-04-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 520, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Accord Is Reached on a Common Security System for the Internet", "print_headline": "Accord Is Reached on a Common Security System for the Internet", "body_text": " **********The three largest consumer on-line information systems and two major Internet software companies said today that they had agreed to adopt a common technology for protecting commercial transactions on the Internet from hackers, thieves and eavesdroppers. **********The agreement, announced before Tuesday's opening of the Spring 1995 Internet World Trade Show here, is expected to hasten the development of on-line shopping services and other commercial uses of cyberspace. **********Judging by the crowd here today, the advances cannot come soon enough.

For more than a decade, the station's announcers and transmitters were constantly under fire and on the move, eluding bombing attacks and ambushes intended to silence them. **********El Salvador is at peace now, and has been for nearly three years, but Radio Venceremos continues to broadcast -- though not from the hills, and not in the name of a guerrilla movement. Instead, the station has settled into comfortable studios on a quiet residential street here and has gone commercial, replacing its battle reports with the music of Madonna, Phil Collins, Air Supply, the Eagles and Boyz II Men. **********\"Our format and our audience are adult contemporary,\" explained Carlos Henriquez Consalvi, who under the nom de guerre Santiago was the station's primary announcer during the 12-year civil war. \"During the war, we did not have to pay rent or telephone bills, but now we do, and that means we have to play the music that people want to listen to.\" **********Throughout that conflict, Radio Venceremos, broadcasting from the mountains of Morazan Province with a second-hand 60-watt transmitter, later upgraded to 1,000 watts of power, was essential listening for diplomats, journalists and the front's own combatants. Working for the station meant \"doing radio with a microphone in one hand and a gun in another, broadcasting underground and amid flying bullets,\" as a writer, Jose Ignacio Lopez Vigil, described it in a recent history of Radio Venceremos called \"Rebel Radio\" (Curbstone Press, 1994). **********The transition to being \"a normal station, a radio station like any other\" has not been easy, said Marvin Galeas, who joined Radio Venceremos in 1982 and is now a member of the station's board of directors. But the process has been eased somewhat by similar changes that have occurred throughout Salvadoran society, as onetime enemies struggle to learn to live with one another and former allies take diverging political paths. **********At first, when the station's announcers and engineers returned to the capital and tried to resume civilian life, there were some death threats. The quarters Radio Venceremos was able to rent, and now hopes to buy, are owned by a member of the right-wing Arena Party, which during the civil war sponsored the death squads that massacred thousands of suspected rebel sympathizers. **********In place of guerrilla communiques, the 5,000-watt station now has commercials, including public service announcements paid for by the Salvadoran Government. During last year's election campaign, Radio Venceremos even broadcast the jingles of the Arena campaign slate, the winning presidential candidate, Armando Calderon Sol, among them. **********\"Business is business,\" Mr. Galeas said. \"That is the only way for us to stay on the air and pay our employees.\" Mr. Calderon Sol, he added, calls on Radio Venceremos reporters at news conferences, and his remarks are broadcast on the station. **********After the move to the capital, the station formally severed its links with the rebel front, which has itself now splintered, and also parted company with the front's political commissars. Later, five members of the news department were dismissed in an internal dispute that grew out of the management's decision not to support a teacher's strike. **********At the time, the dissidents argued that the station had a moral obligation to endorse automatically any action undertaken by left-wing labor unions or political movements. Radio Venceremos continues to emphasize news coverage, but prefers to offer what Mr. Galeas describes as reporting that is \"balanced, professional and intelligent, not contestatory,\" and has occasionally used programming material from the Voice of America's Spanish-language service. **********\"In the past, we did propaganda and political agitation,\" Mr. Henriquez Consalvi said. \"Now we want to do real journalism, and that means we cannot be the appendix of a political party.\" **********Such pragmatism, however, has not gone down well with some of the station's old admirers. Mr. Galeas said a German foundation affiliated with the Green Party, which had long supported Radio Venceremos with generous grants, cut off its financing in January for just that reason: \"They thought we had drifted too far to the right and were getting too bourgeois,\" he explained. **********As a result, Radio Venceremos has had to step up its efforts to attract advertisements from businesses, some of which are still reluctant to be associated with the station because of its guerrilla past. To soften that image, the station now more often bills itself as \"Your RV, an open window\" rather than use its full, formal name, taken from a leftist slogan that means \"We Shall Triumph.\" **********Though advertisers may still be hesitant about the station, listeners are not, which veterans of the old days find especially encouraging. Ratings here are not as reliable as in the United States, but Radio Venceremos consistently ranks in the top fifth overall in most radio surveys, rising in some to as high as second during the early morning rush hour. **********\"For some one to say that they listen to Radio Venceremos is itself a sign of the profound changes this country has experienced,\" Mr. Henriquez Consalvi said. \"To make such an admission five years ago could have meant death. No, the fear is diminishing, and that makes me optimistic about our future.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/01/business/investing-it-minding-your-business-an-options-strategy-for.html": {"writer_name": "Laura Pedersen", "pub_date": "1995-10-01", "snippet": "Q.

My broker suggested that I sell call options against some blue chip stocks I own. Isn't this a risky type of investment where only the broker ends up winning by making a commission?T. ESTRANew York CityA. Not necessarily. Let's face it, all investments carry some degree of risk. Nicholas W. Leeson, the rogue trader who last February lost $1.8 billion in Singapore and promptly took down Britain's oldest bank, Barings P.L.C., was trading in that scariest of investments, derivatives. **********But Toshihide Iguchi, the Daiwa trader who allegedly lost $1.1 billion and was arrested last week, was playing with Treasuries, that supersafe bond backed by Uncle Sam. **********In other words, how you use an investment sharply affects its risk. And what your broker seems to have in mind -- selling options against shares you already own -- is one of the few options strategies that make sense for individual investors. **********Known as writing covered calls, this tactic is a conservative way of insuring part of your portfolio against a decline, according to Stephanie L. Ackler, a vice president at Tucker Anthony, a financial services firm. **********Okay, here's how it works. Imagine you own 100 shares of XYZ Technology, and you are worried its price will fall, either for company-specific reasons or due to a broad market downturn. To soften the impact of such a drop, you sell an option to another investor to buy your stock. **********This \"call\" option gives the other person the right to buy your shares at a predetermined price, known as the strike price, within a certain period of time. One call covers 100 shares of stock. If XYZ is trading at $44, for example, imagine that you sell one November call at a strike price of $45. You get $300 for selling this right. **********First, the $300 goes into your account and you keep that no matter what. Next, one of two things will take place. If the market falls and XYZ stock closes at, say, $39 at some point before expiration, which occurs the third Friday in November, the option holder will have no interest in buying your stock at $45. The option will expire worthless. And, with the $300 you have pocketed, you have cut in half the losses on your 100 shares due to the stock's decline. If the stock stays at $44, you have made money on the deal, to the tune of $300. **********But suppose instead that the market rises and XYZ closes at $55 at the option's expiration. The defensive technique of writing covered calls doesn't work well in such a rise. The option holder will naturally elect to buy your 100 shares for $45 apiece.  You do get the $300 from sale of the option, but that isn't nearly enough to make up for the $1,000 you lose in selling stock for $45 a share in a market where it is getting $55. **********Knowing that this can occur, you may want to consider selling calls on only half the number of XYZ shares in your portfolio. This way you won't miss out completely should the stock go up. **********And you should select sleepy stocks -- those equities in your portfolio likely to remain at or around their current levels, said Ms. Ackler.  An example is Lilco,, the Long Island utility, which has been sluggish lately. A contrary example is a volatile stock like Cyrix, a technology company. While you will doubtless get more money for selling options on such a stock, you will also run a greater risk of missing out on a significant upside move. **********But be aware that selling calls without owning the underlying stock is an entirely different strategy. This is an uncovered position -- and a very risky one, even for the pros. I know, having been a floor options trader on the American Stock Exchange for a few years. A number of my colleagues had to trade in their yachts for rowboats. **********Still, even writing covered calls requires cautions. One big one: unless you know exactly what you're doing don't fly solo. Options are complicated, but more than that, they can be very volatile. Should you ever drop into a busy options pit around lunch hour, you'll observe the traders chomping their sandwiches, eyes riveted on the computer screens above them and essentially afraid to leave. Don't go it alone. **********Second, read \"Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options,\" a booklet your broker should send you when you open an options account. You may also want to read a book on the subject. Given that most tomes in the investment section of your local superstore are much too complicated -- as if the authors expect George Soros or Warren Buffett to buy one for a brush-up session -- look for something more easily understood. **********I suggest \"Getting Started in Options,\" by Michael Thomsett (John Wiley & Sons, $17.95). Just so you know where I'm coming from, my idea of a beginner's book is Elbert S. Mahoney's \"Chapman's Piloting, Seamanship & Small Boat Handling,\" which begins with the weighty question, \"What is a boat?\" **********However, if you don't get around to the book (there are only 84 days left for holiday shopping) here are a few guidelines. Always know your potential profit and loss before trading an option. **********Ms. Ackler warns against selling a call for under a half point ($50) since it won't be worth the commission cost. And don't get carried away; most professional portfolio managers only sell call options on 5 to 10 percent of their entire holdings. **********If you follow these rules and if you have the stomach for it, by all means listen to your broker and let him play the options game. After all, when Charles F.

Borland sold the Quattro Pro program to Novell in March 1994, but would nonetheless be liable for damages if Lotus eventually won its suit. **********The decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit that Lotus had no claim against Borland alarmed many in the industry, who warned that the court's analysis could easily extend beyond the menu commands at issue in this case to software programs in general. \"Virtually all elements of a program are means of operating some aspect of a computer,\" a brief from an organization called Intellectual Property Owners told the Supreme Court in support of the appeal by Lotus, which was acquired by International Business Machines in July. **********The Copyright Act of 1976 protects computer programs, defined in the law as \"a set of statements or instructions to be used directly or indirectly in a computer in order to bring about a certain result.\" The First Circuit Court drew a distinction between the ordinary computer program and the \"user interface\" at issue in this case, which one of the appeals judges, Michael Boudin, analogized to the familiar QWERTY layout on a typewriter keyboard. **********All typists \"would be the captive of anyone who had a monopoly on the production of such a keyboard\" if copyright protection were available for the arrangement of keys that operates a typewriter, Judge Boudin said in a concurring opinion. **********Borland offered its own analogy to the Supreme Court, describing the menu commands that operate a program as similar to the buttons on a videocassette recorder that operate the machine. Borland's brief drew a distinction between the commands and the program itself, which it said was \"copyrightable in the same way that the literal text of a play would be\" but was not at issue in this dispute. **********In its Supreme Court appeal, Lotus v. Borland, No. 94-2003, Lotus described the appeals court ruling as \"a jarring departure from the prevailing consensus\" and warned that the health of the software industry would be threatened if it could not rely on copyright law \"to protect the fruits of its creative efforts.\" **********The Court will hear the case in January. **********In stock trading today, shares of I.B.M. rose $1.50, to $94.375, on the New York Stock Exchange, while Borland shares fell 37.5 cents, to $14.125, in Nasdaq trading. **********As the Justices prepared for the official opening of the Court's term next Monday, they added several other business cases to their calendar, including these: Banks and Insurance **********The Justices agreed to resolve a dispute among the lower Federal courts and decide whether states can block national banks from selling insurance from their small-town branches, an activity that is authorized by Federal law. **********A provision of a 1916 banking law, known as Section 92, permits national banks that are \"located and doing business in any place\" with fewer than 5,000 inhabitants to act as agents for \"any fire, life or other insurance company.\" The Comptroller of the Currency has interpreted this provision broadly to permit banks with branches in small towns to sell insurance not only to residents of those towns, but also to customers anywhere in the state. **********The case before the Court is an appeal by Barnett Bank of Marion County, Fla., a subsidiary of Barnett Banks, from a ruling earlier this year by the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Atlanta. That court ruled that despite Section 92, Florida had the right to stop Barnett from operating an insurance agency it had acquired in Belleview, Fla., a town of 2,666, where the bank has a branch. **********Ruling that Florida could apply a state law that barred any financial institution from engaging in \"insurance agency activities,\" the appeals court invoked a Federal law, the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which gives the states the power to regulate the \"business of insurance.\" **********The Comptroller of the Currency's office joined Barnett's appeal, in a brief filed by Solicitor General Drew S. Days 3d. The brief said the McCarran-Ferguson Act should not apply because Florida in this instance was seeking to regulate banking, not insurance. The appeals court's analysis \"permits significant and unwarranted state interference with activities that Congress has specifically authorized national banks to undertake,\" the brief continued. **********Florida is defending its law, which is similar to laws in 14 other states including Connecticut and New Jersey, as a consumer-protection measure. The Solicitor General's brief disparaged this characterization, saying that the most plausible explanation was a desire to protect insurance agents against competition from banks. Shares of Barnett Banks rose 87.5 cents yesterday, to $56.375, on the New York Stock Exchange. The case is Barnett Bank v. Gallagher, No. 94-1837. Patent Juries **********The Court agreed to decide whether, in a patent-infringement case, there is a constitutional right to a jury trial to resolve a factual dispute about the meaning of the patent. **********In this case, Markman v. Westview Instruments, No. 95-26, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, a specialized court here that has nationwide jurisdiction over patent appeals, ruled in April that judges rather than juries should ordinarily determine what a patent means. The judges, by virtue of their specialized training, are better suited to this task than juries, the court said in an 8-to-3 ruling that was a departure from its own precedents. **********The particular dispute in the case is a limited one: a patent-infringement suit by the inventor of an inventory-control system for use in the dry-cleaning business against the inventor of a competing system. The case comes down to the meaning, in the disputed patent, of the word \"inventory,\" which the appeals court said referred to articles of clothing themselves and not just to the invoices. The appeals court ruled that the defendant's system, which keeps track of invoices but not the clothes, did not infringe the plaintiff's patent. **********But the broader issues are intriguing, involving both the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial in civil cases as well as a debate about whether the traditional jury system is up to the challenge of handling the scientific and technological cases that are increasingly common."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/30/business/earning-it-vineyard-immigrant-s-search-for-logic-leads-him-top-cpa-class.html": {"writer_name": "J.

He was born into a working-class family in Gomel, a small city 175 miles southeast of Minsk in Belarus. **********\"In Russia it's not what you know but who you know that counts -- and we didn't know anyone,\" he said, laughing. It didn't help that Gomel was the site of some of Chernobyl's heaviest fallout. **********So Mr. Sorkin and his family immigrated to Pawtucket, R.I., on Feb. 12, 1990.

Adding peripherals \"will become child's play,\" he said. **********For millions of PC owners, ease of use can't happen fast enough. The back of a typical PC is an uninviting collection of bare connectors. Attaching a new device, like a scanner or tape backup drive, is about as straightforward as triple-bypass surgery. In many cases, it involves opening the computer and inserting a circuit board, installing the appropriate driver software and sometimes getting out the magnifying glass and fiddling with little switches or configuring and reconfiguring software in an attempt to mediate incompatibilities with the system. **********Most ports on the back of a PC have a particular function: one for the modem, another for the keyboard, still another for a printer or a scanner, and so on. Oh, you want to hook up two printers? Easier said than done. **********The universal serial bus, on the other hand, consolidates the functions of the computer's parallel port, serial port, keyboard port, mouse port and others into a single connector that sends data at the moderately high speed of 12 megabits per second. No longer does each port need a dedicated controller associated with a particular function. With the universal serial bus, the user will be able to hook up any of dozens of peripherals, including several of the same type, into a single connector simultaneously, by daisy-chaining the devices. **********The universal serial bus is one manifestation of the Plug and Play specification co-developed by Microsoft and Intel, in which the bus automatically detects when devices are being added or removed. The bus also determines what software drivers each peripheral needs and loads them. **********\"It should make life easier for customers,\" said James L. Pappas, program manager in charge of the bus's development at the Intel Architecture Labs in Hillsboro, Ore. \"They won't have to skin their knuckles opening up the box.\" **********The new bus specification was developed by a consortium that includes I.B.M., NEC, Compaq, Northern Telecom and Digital Equipment. The idea for it came as the PC telecommunications industry started pushing for a higher-speed bus that could handle the various communications products under development, like integrated services digital network modems and cards that turn the PC into a phone answering machine or call management center. The idea was to develop a bus specific to the telecommunications market. But the idea of squeezing yet another specialized port onto the back of the PC made a lot of people in the industry cringe. **********\"The PC industry has evolved ad hoc,\" Mr. Pappas said. \"We were always adding one more piece of baggage.\" **********Carl Stork, Microsoft's director of Windows hardware programs, was one of the people who could be seen cringing the most. \"I thought to myself, 'You're going to give me another connector that's not any easier to use?' \" Mr. Stork said. Instead, he dug in his heels and starting looking for a satisfying permanent solution. **********The idea for a universal bus was not altogether original. Earlier, a group of developers led by Philips Electronics, the Dutch giant, had tried to popularize a universal bus, called the Access Bus. But the effort largely failed because the bus was not fast enough to accommodate the range of products that were to be delivered in the coming years, and Philips had trouble persuading developers to support it, Mr. Doherty said. Similarly, the Apple Desktop Bus found on all Macs was deemed too proprietary for PC's. **********Even though the list of companies endorsing the universal serial bus is an impressive one, support for it is less than universal. Apple Computer and AT&T are supporting an alternative bus, called the Geoport, but it too has limitations. For starters it is aimed at meeting the needs of the telecommunications market, rather than solving the problem of proliferating buses. It is also slower, operating at only 2 megabits a second. **********A chief advantage of the universal serial bus is its compactness: it takes up less than one square inch -- currently, the various connectors fill half the back of a desktop PC. And that should make it an instant hit on notebook computers, where real estate is so scarce. **********Some analysts say that by 1996 the new bus will be a standard feature on virtually all new PC's. Others are more cautious. Mr. Pappas compares it to the industry transition from 5.25-inch floppy disks to 3.5-inch ones. For years after the first 3.5-inch drives arrived, PC manufacturers included both drives to protect users' investments. **********Yet whatever progress it brings, the universal serial bus will not eliminate every port found today, in part because its top speed is limited. Ports for local-area networks, hard drives and monitors will still be needed, because they all require higher speeds. But the bus may serve for just about everything else. **********Numerous other ease-of-use issues remain for the PC world, most notably the lack of an industry standard for CD-ROM's and also for sound cards, making every purchase of new software a potential compatibility issue. **********Oddly, though, neither the mess at the back of the machine nor the other issues have kept other personal computers from outselling the Macintosh 10 to 1."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/16/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-health-for-youth-on-council-s-agenda.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1995-05-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 141, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Health for Youth On Council's Agenda", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Health for Youth On Council's Agenda", "body_text": " **********The Advertising Council, the agency industry's public service organization, said yesterday that it would place additional emphasis on campaigns that benefit \"the health and well-being\" of the nation's youth. **********As part of the new initiative, called \"Commitment 2000: Raising a Better Tomorrow,\" the council will introduce multiple, multiyear campaigns focusing on social issues like health care, education, family and community concerns.

Some people covered their mouths and noses with handkerchiefs, even though any odor had long since dissipated. **********A railway spokesman said passengers had reported smelling fumes in a wide underground passage that connects the east and west exits of the station. Somewhat later, witnesses said, fumes were apparent in a hallway one level up that is lined with shops.

At Ishikawacho, the train was evacuated and inspected for 10 minutes, but nothing was found, he said. **********Hiroko Nei, a passenger on the train, said that as soon as people boarded at Yokohama Station, they began jumping back out of the car saying there was a strange smell. **********\"I smelled something, and I started to cough and I had something in my eyes,\" Mrs. Nei recalled, saying the smell was irritating but hard to describe. She said the experience had lasted only two or three minutes and the pain and coughing abated quickly, so she went home. Later, though, she decided to go Saiseikai Kanagawa Hospital as a precaution. **********Hiroshi Yoshio, a doctor at that hospital, said most patients needed no treatment other than an intravenous drip. He said that although they had sore throats, they could talk and swallow. **********Descriptions of the fumes were varied. Some peoples reportedly described the fumes as smelling like sulfur, others like nail polish remover. **********The Kyodo News Service quoted witnesses as saying they saw a white liquid spilled on the floor in the underground passage after seeing a man, dressed in black and in his late 20's, walk through the passage with some luggage. **********A woman told a television reporter that she had smelled something like nail polish remover and choked after a thin man in his 20's walked by her carrying something in his hand that was little bigger than his fist. **********Kyodo also quoted witnesses as saying that investigators had found some blue vinyl bags containing liquid in the passageway. But television reports quoted the police as saying they had found no remnants of chemicals or of containers. **********Whatever the fumes were, they apparently dissipated quickly. Many people near the scene said they had not smelled anything. **********\"I only realized something happened when the police came,\" said Morihiro Murata, who was working in a kiosk in the underground passage at Yokohama Station. \"Until around 1:20, when the police started to evacuate the area, it looked normal and everyone was continuing to shop.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/23/business/credit-markets-bond-prices-move-higher-on-jobless-claims-report.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Hurtado", "pub_date": "1995-06-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 772, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bond Prices Move Higher On Jobless-Claims Report", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; Bond Prices Move Higher On Jobless-Claims Report", "body_text": " **********The Labor Department's report that more Americans than expected filed for jobless benefits last week sent bond prices higher yesterday.

The regular players have said that if United States District Court Judge Sonia Sotomayor grants an injunction in their favor, they would be willing to end their strike. The owners, who have said they do not want to play this season under the previous economic system, could them lock them out and field the replacement players. But they would suddenly find themselves at risk of having to pay huge fines, if they lost a second round in the courts. **********\"If you lock people out, you can hire temporary replacements; there is no question about that,\" said David M. Silberman, a labor law expert at the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations. \"But the risk in doing that -- the reason the owners might hesitate -- is that the damages are considerable.\" **********The courts, in effect, would have to decide whether the lockout was an unfair labor practice or a fair one. A fair lockout would be one that is a continuation of the battle over \"economic issues,\" which means the terms of a new contract. Using replacement workers, temporary or permanent, during lockouts over economic issues is legal. An unfair lockout would be one imposed without first engaging in strenuous good faith bargaining over the \"economic issues.\" **********If the judge grants the injunction, perhaps on Friday after a hearing, the owners could then lock them out, assuming 21 of the 28 teams vote to do so. But that would almost certainly draw the case back into court in the early weeks of the season for a battle over whether the lockout was fair or unfair. **********Under the National Labor Relations Act, if a court ruled that the lockout was unfair, the owners would have to immediately dismiss the replacement workers, take back the regulars -- if the players' union still wanted to end the strike -- and pay the players as a penalty two or three times their wages during the lockout period. That's no problem for lockouts involving auto workers or steelworkers. Their wages are clearly defined. But who knows how much to pay a major leaguer who had not yet signed a contract for this season -- the situation for most of the 700 or so players. **********The National Labor Relations Board, established in 1935 to govern relations between unions and management, plays a big role in this process. The board's general counsel, Fred Feinstein, with the backing of the five-member board, brought the court action that Judge Sotomayor is to rule on. The N.L.R.B. asked for an injunction against what Feinstein, responding to the outcry of the players, described as an unfair labor practice by the owners. **********The owners, according to Feinstein, unilaterally and precipitously changed the rules on player free agency and salary arbitration without first trying hard enough to reach agreement through collective bargaining. If the judge agrees, then the rules under the old contract on salary arbitration and players' rights as free agents would be temporarily restored -- and the players have said that in these circumstances, they would end their strike. **********The owners, although reinstating the old rules, could then lock out the players, perhaps immediately or after a few days of resumed negotiations, to help strengthen their case that they had done all they could to reach an agreement and they therefore had a right to continue the labor standoff in the form of a lockout -- using replacement players. **********That would start the legal process over again. The players would push Feinstein to decide whether the owners had in fact bargained sufficiently, and if he decides they had not, then he could once again take the case to court."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/02/world/peru-and-ecuador-sign-truce-in-effort-to-halt-border-war.html": {"writer_name": "James Brooke", "pub_date": "1995-03-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 534, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Peru and Ecuador Sign Truce In Effort to Halt Border War", "print_headline": "Peru and Ecuador Sign Truce In Effort to Halt Border War", "body_text": " **********Peru and Ecuador signed a new cease-fire today, seeking to end a monthlong Amazon border war that has claimed 73 lives and left at least 200 wounded. **********Last week, the heaviest fighting of the conflict broke the first cease-fire, forcing diplomats to negotiate the new one, which was signed in Montevideo, Uruguay.

Technically, euthanasia is still not legal in the Netherlands. But some Dutch doctors have practiced it knowing they will not be prosecuted. **********Now the medical profession has taken stock of its experiences of the last decade and decided to tighten some rules for euthanasia and assisted suicide. **********Among the most striking changes is the recommendation that doctors taking part in euthanasia should, preferably and whenever possible, have terminally ill patients administer the fatal drug to themselves rather than have a doctor apply an injection or intravenous drip. **********\"This step is first a decision of the patient, and eating or drinking the substance is a symbol of the patient's responsibility,\" said Dr. Robert Dillmann, a member of the ethics commission of the Royal Dutch Medical Association. \"It is consistent with the decision. An exception should be made when a very sick person is not able to swallow.\" **********While most doctors here are not challenging the basic notion of euthanasia or assisted suicide, many have expressed concern about the emotional and moral burden they feel during the decision-making process and at the time of death. **********A number of doctors have said they feel too much pressure from patients and sometimes from colleagues to engage in euthanasia when they personally oppose it or when they are not sure the circumstances are appropriate. A 1991 study said that only 40 percent of euthanasia requests are carried out. **********At present doctors must limit euthanasia to people who are incurably ill, suffer irremediable pain and who explicitly and repeatedly ask for death of their own free will while they are lucid. Doctors must report such a death to justice officials and fill out a detailed checklist. **********In essence, the new guidelines, recently issued by the Royal Dutch Medical Association, make no fundamental changes but put forward restrictions. **********The new text emphasizes the rule that requires doctors to ask for a second opinion from an experienced physician, a rule that doctors said at times had been ignored. It adds that the consulting physician may not have a professional or family relationship with either patient or doctor. **********In another change, the text stresses that no doctor is required to perform euthanasia, but if he is opposed on principle, he must help the patient get in touch with a colleague who has no such moral objections. **********Further, the medical association insists on the obligation of doctors to report all cases. While this was already an intrinsic part of judicial and professional rules, experts say an unknown number of cases still go unreported. **********While 591 euthanasia deaths were reported in 1991, the number rose in 1992 to 1,322. The figure remained almost constant the next year with 1,318 reported cases, then rose again in 1994 to 1,436. Experts say the increase does not reflect a rise in euthanasia cases but rather the willingness of doctors to report them. **********For those who have been fighting euthanasia, the changes in the rules were seen as small but significant. \"It is a little step in the right direction,\" said Dr. Karel Gunning of the Dutch Physicians League, a group of some 600 members opposing euthanasia. \"Doctors cannot kill. I think Dutch doctors will eventually regain their senses.\" **********The previous guidelines were drawn up in 1984, but even before then euthanasia was practiced here, and in a number of precedent-setting court cases, some dating from 1973, doctors were acquitted on charges of helping to bring on a patient's death. **********Although the Netherlands is unusually open to social experiments, the complex moral, ethical and legal issues involved in the question of whether or when a doctor may kill a suffering, terminally ill patient at that person's own request, keep resurfacing. They came to the fore again in angry debates in Parliament in the early 1990's, until a law passed in 1993 and taking effect in June 1994 allowed procedures that tolerated euthanasia under controlled conditions. **********Since then, euthanasia has not been a major public issue and individual cases are reported in the press only when they appear to extend the limits of what is considered permissible. These have included recent incidents when people have not explicitly asked for death, like those involving a comatose patient or severely deformed newborn babies. **********The latest policy changes, doctors said, have come about largely as a result of the debate that continues among doctors themselves. **********Specialists who helped draft the new document said it reflected the doubts and anguish that existed among physicians and others involved in caring for the terminally ill, even if health workers believed suffering or dying people had the right to take their own lives. The medical association says it regularly receives requests from health workers for guidance or clarification. **********The new guidelines, drawn up by doctors, lawyers and ethicists, appear in a 39-page policy document of the Royal Dutch Medical Association, sent out to its members on Aug. 25. A spokesman for the association said the principles were considered binding for the group's 24,000 members, who represent nearly 60 percent of Dutch doctors. **********Explaining why the association had called for the patients to take the fatal drug themselves when possible, Dr. Dillmann, of the association's ethics commission, said: **********\"Many doctors find euthanasia an extremely difficult and burdensome action, and the patient's participation diminishes this burden slightly. In the past we said that all things being equal, there was no difference between mercy killing and assisted suicide. But in practice, doctors say this is not the same, that there is a difference if a doctor gives a lethal injection or an intravenous drip and, on the other hand, if the patient drinks a potion. Doctors regularly signal that they prefer the patient to do it if possible.\" **********Dr. Herbert Cohen, a family doctor who has practiced euthanasia a number of times, described how for him there is no difference between helping someone to commit suicide or applying the lethal substance himself. **********\"Morally and emotionally it is equally difficult,\" he said. \"You help prepare the patient and the family and you accompany them. A doctor does not just give a box of pills and walk away.\" **********Death by taking pills can take three hours or more, he said. \"This creates a lot more tension, also among others who accompany the patient. There are risks because people are terribly sick. A patient can spill the medicine or choke or vomit or fall asleep before the full dose has been taken. It is never simple.\" **********With an injection, he said, the patient lapses into a coma within about 10 seconds and death often comes 10 minutes later. \"This method seems more emotional, harsher, but it is less open to error,\" he said. **********Eugene Sutorius, the country's leading lawyer in euthanasia cases, predicted that assisted suicide, in which the doctor provides the means, \"will in the long run take the place of euthanasia here.\" He argued that medically assisted suicide would not only ease the emotional pressure on doctors but also reduce the number of messy suicides. **********As for the obligation to consult another doctor in a case of euthanasia, Roelof Mulder, a spokesman for the medical association, said, \"This is not always done, or done in the right way.\" **********He said doctors often preferred to discuss such a complex and far-reaching decision with someone they worked with or who knew the patient well. But the new guidelines emphasize the need for consulting someone who is separate and has no professional or family links to either doctor or patient. Mr. Mulder said it was not a matter of ill will when a doctor called in an associate or friend; doctors can get very involved with a suffering patient, he said, and an independent voice can offer new insight and support. **********\"The consultant must see and examine the patient,\" Dr. Dillmann said. \"The telephone is not enough.\" **********On the point of doctors who refuse to practice euthanasia, Dr. Dillmann continued, the new text says more explicitly that a doctor should make his position known early on to a patient asking to die. \"The idea is that a doctor cannot hide his views and leave a patient in the cold at the last moment,\" he said. \"He should help find alternatives.\" **********Dr. Gunning, who opposes euthanasia, sees in this \"the dangers and madness of the euthanasia logic.\" Refusing to kill someone, he argued, \"is now called leaving a person out in the cold and it is considered cruel. To cooperate and kill someone is seen as showing compassion. People have gone mad.\" **********He said that \"the real problem is that in the Netherlands we are very far behind in palliative care,\" or on alleviating the pain, the feeling of nausea or suffocation of the terminally ill \"so that people do not get so frightened and want to be killed.\" **********\"Britain has some 200 hospices for the dying, and in this country we are only getting some just now,\" he said. **********The medical association said it would deal separately, next year, with the even more complex issue of mercy killing that was requested not by the patient but by relatives, such as in the case of patients with severe psychiatric disorders, patients in a coma or extremely deformed and ill babies."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/18/business/patents-good-bad-for-maker-drug-for-people-who-are-anemic-dialysis.html": {"writer_name": "Teresa Riordan", "pub_date": "1995-09-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 899, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Patents; Good news and bad news for the maker of a drug for people who are anemic and on dialysis.", "print_headline": "Patents; Good news and bad news for the maker of a drug for people who are anemic and on dialysis.", "body_text": " **********AMGEN INC., the pioneer biotechnology company, recently got good news and bad news on the patent front. **********First the bad news, which arrived in late August but which Amgen said it did not consider newsworthy enough to tell its stockholders about: the European Patent Office possibly has opened the door for a licensee of Amgen's archrival, Genetics Institute, to sell erythropoietin in Europe. The drug, better known as EPO, is used to treat anemia in people on dialysis. **********After millions of dollars in patent litigation, Amgen has successfully asserted a United States patent it received in 1987 to keep Genetics Institute and others out of the EPO market in the United States. But the European market is also important: it represents about $400 million of EPO's $3 billion worldwide sales. **********In November last year, the Technical Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office essentially upheld a similar Amgen patent covering Europe, which the company has licensed to Ortho Pharmaceuticals. But in that ruling the agency said it would address in later written comments several questions with potential commercial import. **********Essentially, there are two ways to make the EPO protein. One involves replicating an unabridged version of the hereditary material that encodes it, which is known as \"genomic\" DNA. The other involves making copies of something called cDNA, which is a condensed version of this hereditary material. **********In its written comments, the European appeal board appears to say that while the Amgen patent covers EPO made by the first method, it does not cover EPO made by the second method. **********\"The board's language, while not unambiguous, seems to say cDNA is outside the scope of the Amgen patent,\" said Bruce M. Eisen, a patent attorney who serves as a consultant to Genetics Institute, which has licensed its three patents covering other aspects of EPO to Boehringer Mannheim of Germany. **********\"It's a significant opening of the barn door to competitors in Europe,\" said Colin G.

New Check Design To Help Keep Track **********For most people, keeping track of household expenses -- whether for tax or budget purposes -- means having to conjure up lost receipts and sift through shoeboxes stuffed with canceled checks. **********Mason K. Yu Sr., a retired engineer in Birmingham, Mich., recently patented a checking system that would do away with this drudgery.  Mr. Yu has designed a check whose lower left corner is divided into different expense categories like \"medical\" or \"food\" or \"recreation.\" **********Each time the consumer wrote a check, according to Mr. Yu, he would mark the appropriate expense category. Normally banks process checks by putting them through an optical scanner, which reads the account number. Mr. Yu said that this same scanner simultaneously could read the checked-off category into a computer. **********At the end of the month, the bank statement would include, in addition to a list of deposits and debits, a bar graph showing the dollar amount spent in each category, and a pie chart showing each category's percentage of total expenditures. **********\"The number crunching is invisible to the end-user,\" said Mr. Yu's son, Mason K. Yu Jr. of Manhattan, who is marketing the idea. He pointed out that electronic checking programs like Intuit's Quicken are used by only a tiny proportion of the population. **********\"Americans still write 60 billion paper checks a year,\" Mr. Yu Jr said. \"The average person doesn't want to have to be a computer jockey to figure out their expenses.\" **********Mr. Yu Sr., who said he had a patent pending for a similar system using credit cards and automatic teller cards, said his idea would be helpful to small-business owners in particular. **********In addition, banks could generate valuable data bases of consumer information by providing such a service, according to Mr. Yu Sr. \"You could take the pulse of a regional economy at any given moment,\" he said. **********Mr. Yu Sr. received patent 5,433,483.

Daniels, of Sarasota, Fla., who invented a basketball backboard that forms a right angle. **********Above the hoop, in the corner formed on the backboard by the design, is a wedge that resembles an elongated pyramid. \"Originally the wedge was to keep the ball from getting stuck in the corner,\" Mr. Daniels said. \"But we discovered that it gives a missed shot an unpredictable bounce that helps sharpen your rebounding skills.\" **********Mr. Daniels's invention is covered by patent 5,299,800."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/15/business/market-watch-in-japan-s-facade-of-control.html": {"writer_name": "David Sanger", "pub_date": "1995-10-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 569, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "In Japan's Facade Of Control", "print_headline": "MARKET WATCH; In Japan's Facade Of Control", "body_text": " **********When the main measure of power in the world was military might, great and small powers dissembled with statistics inflating or minimizing their arsenals. Nowadays, in the struggle to attract capital or keep investors from fleeing, countries are perfecting the art of dissembling by omission. **********Last year's champion was Mexico, which hid the numbers that would have tipped off investors that an impending devaluation of the peso was imminent. When the bad news seeped out, investors not only raced for the exits, they pulled out of other emerging markets -- the \"contagion effect\" that that Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin feared would circle the globe. **********Now Japan, a country that usually drowns in statistical measures of itself, seems intent on seizing this year's title. This week, its ministry of finance admitted that it knew in early August that one of the country's biggest banks lost $1.1 billion during an 11-year fraud at its New York subsidiary. But rather than warn the Federal Reserve and the Treasury that a host of American laws had likely been violated, the financial leaders of the world's second largest economy clammed up for six weeks. **********Mr. Rubin, who has championed greater disclosure rules in the post-Mexico era, offered a little lecture when his Japanese counterpart, Masayoshi Takemura, called Wednesday with what was later termed an apology on these shores and a nonapology in Tokyo. Credibility in the markets, he said, means spreading the bad news, as the United States did after the 1987 crash. Anything short of full candor, he told Mr. Takemura, undermines confidence in global markets. **********There is reason to wonder if the message sunk in. \"I don't think there was anything improper in what we have done,\" said Eisuke Sakakibara, a top official of the ministry and the leader of a camp that questions how closely Japan should align itself with the United States. He and others attributed the disagreement to \"cultural differences.\" **********There are many cultural differences with Japan; this is not one of them. If a Japanese bank president tried to keep such data from all-knowing Finance Ministry -- rather than from foreign authorities -- he would soon be refilling teller machines in the most frigid reaches of Hokkaido. Japan didn't get its reputation as the world's most regulated capitalist economy for nothing. **********What was at work here was a radically different perception of national interest. The first instinct of United States regulators would likely be to embarrass and punish the offending bank, to set an example. In Japan, the first instinct is to say nothing that would tear down the banking system's facade of stability. After all, these are the same banks that went to extraordinary lengths to halt all major land transactions as soon as the real estate market began to collapse: If everyone knew how far prices had really fallen, the banks knew they would have to re-evaluate their portfolios and dramatically slash the value of their assets. That self-deception delayed the recognition of how serious Japan's banking crisis had become. **********The United States and Japan like to say that despite their constant bickering on trade, their governments work hand-in-glove on the important stuff. But Japan, like Mexico, now joins the ranks of countries where investors will no longer fully believe the government officials who insist that everything is under control."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/28/business/house-unit-seeks-to-soften-rule-on-poor-area-bank-loans.html": {"writer_name": "Keith Bradsher", "pub_date": "1995-06-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 447, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "House Unit Seeks to Soften Rule on Poor-Area Bank Loans", "print_headline": "House Unit Seeks to Soften Rule on Poor-Area Bank Loans", "body_text": " **********The House Banking Committee approved a measure today that would eliminate most enforcement of the Federal law that requires banks to lend in poor neighborhoods as well as rich ones. **********Conservative Republicans forced through the amendment to a bank deregulation bill on a party-line vote of 25 to 17.

It would end the ability of community activists to block banks with bad community-lending records from obtaining regulatory approval for mergers, acquisitions and other transactions. **********Instead, a bank's community-lending record would be included in regulators' overall review of the quality of a bank's management every 18 months or so. That review is important mainly for determining whether ailing banks are put on special lists for close observation and for possible closing by regulators. **********But House Democrats, community activists and the Clinton Administration strongly disagreed with the House Banking Committee's vote.

Analysts rave about the company's consistent earnings, which have risen for 23 consecutive quarters. And James Ting, the 44-year-old Chinese-Canadian businessman who took over Singer in 1989, wants people to consider the stock, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange at $27.125 a share under the vanity symbol \"SEW,\" as much a blue chip as DuPont or Coca-Cola. **********Only Singer isn't the real thing. Without doing anything illegal, and with the blessing of its independent auditors at Ernst & Young, the company employs a myriad of tactics to raise its profits. Nearly a fifth of the $98.5 million that the company earned last year came from sources other than basic operations: asset sales, one-time investment gains and interest income and fees from affiliated companies. In fact, Singer offers a textbook case of five reasons why investors need to look beyond what's reported on the bottom line to determine the quality of a company's earnings. And it serves as a reminder of the perils in dealing with foreign companies that are allowed to tap American capital markets without complying with the same ground rules that home-grown companies follow. **********Investors interested in doing their homework have one key disadvantage: they only get the opportunity once a year. Because the company is incorporated in the Netherlands Antilles, Singer is required to file detailed financial information just once annually -- and even that update is allowed to arrive as much as six months after the end of the company's fiscal year. **********LESSON 1: PROFITS CAN OFTEN BE TOO PREDICTABLE. **********Wall Street hates to be surprised, and Singer seems to provide enough informal guidance to make sure that analysts are never caught unaware. In that way, quarter after quarter, the company meets the analysts' earnings targets, almost to the penny. Only the massive devaluation of the Mexican peso caused the company to miss the mark by nine cents when it reported fourth-quarter 1994 results -- the first time Singer's earnings had significantly trailed expectations since it went public in 1991. **********Whenever a company's profit projections are so completely on target, investors should wonder how the company is pulling off the feat -- especially when it is subject to wildly fluctuating currencies. Singer's near-flawless performance is curious for another reason, too. Just this week, a Singer official was quick to endorse Wall Street's view that the company would earn $2.10 a share in 1995, up from $1.97 last year. But he would not even begin to estimate sales -- a key engine of earnings -- because of currency devaluations and the situation in Mexico. **********LESSON 2: FAMILY TIES CAN BE TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT. **********Investors should also look out when much of a company's business involves dealings with related businesses. Singer has very close ties to a Canadian holding company, Semi-Tech Corporation, which is also controlled by Mr. Ting, the chairman and chief executive of both companies. About half of Singer's stock is owned by Semi-Tech, and only two of its eight directors aren't linked to Semi-Tech in some fashion. \"It's very incestuous,\" said Howard Schilit, who heads the Center for Financial Research and Analysis, a Rockville, Md.-based research firm that analyzes accounting issues. **********Singer seems to use these close personal relationships to particular advantage. For instance, Semi-Tech Global, a company in which Semi-Tech Corporation has a big stake, owns a group of lackluster businesses that used to be owned by Singer. If the businesses turn around, Singer has the right to buy them on the cheap; indeed, it has already purchased seven of the original 12. In the meantime, Singer charges a 1 percent management fee and other fees. **********That's one reason why at least an eighth of Singer's net income last year was the result of dealings with affiliated companies. The company reported $12.2 million in management fees, royalties and interest, including $5.3 million of \"interest income\" from Semi-Tech Global, even after subtracting $8.5 million of selling and administration expenses, which the company claims were incurred on its affiliates' behalf. **********Whether Singer ever sees that entire $8.5 million in cash, however, is open to debate: while a company official said last week that Singer was paid at least $7.9 million in 1994, its year-end financial statements say it had collected only $2 million -- the rest is classified as \"accounts receivables,\" or outstanding debts owed the company. **********\"When you see the executives of the company also involved with affiliated companies and related-party transactions, it's an ugly picture,\" said Mr. Schilit. **********LESSON 3: THE BEST PROFITS ARE THE YEAR-IN, YEAR-OUT KIND. **********Tucked inside the $98.5 million in profits that Singer reported last year were an unusual amount of one-time-only gains. About 18 percent of earnings comes from extraordinary events that are unlikely to be repeated: a $4.7 million investment gain, foreign exchange gains of $600,000 (in spite of Mexico), asset sales worth $4.8 million, the $5.3 million of interest income, and $2 million in consulting fees. **********Thus, if investors simply excluded all the one-time items from last year's earnings, they would discover they were paying a hefty 17 times trailing earnings for Singer's stock, not the more modest 14 times that it otherwise appears. Alternatively, if they insisted on paying no more than the current multiple of 14, it would be hard to justify any price much higher than $22. **********LESSON 4: CASH IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EARNINGS. **********At healthy companies, cash flow -- a fatter version of profits because it is not burdened with noncash items like depreciation -- roughly approximates net income over time. And as far as Mr. Ting is concerned, investors have nothing to worry about. In Singer's annual report, he says \"Singer's cash flow remained strong,\" a position he obviously feels justified taking because the company reported that $46 million more cash flowed into the company's coffers than flowed out last year. **********That claim would be beyond question if all the incoming cash came from operations. At least $132.2 million of it, however, came from an increase in the company's borrowings. Looking just at operations, Singer's cash flow has significantly lagged reported earnings. In fact, in 1994, the company's operating cash flow was in the red for $29 million. **********\"That's a pretty telling measure,\" said Mr. Schilit. When the figures diverge so significantly, despite their both being representative of profitability, he said, \"bad things usually happen.\" Like an earnings surprise. **********LESSON 5: CASH BEATS CREDIT ANY DAY. **********Whenever a company allows consumers to buy its wares on generous credit terms, investors should look especially hard for signs that customers aren't paying their bills. **********In Singer's case, half the company's sales come from Asia and Latin America, and much of the company's success in countries like Turkey and Thailand is the direct result of how easy the company makes it for people of limited means to buy big-ticket items like refrigerators over time. As much as 100 percent of Singer's Turkey revenue, for example, came from the sale of products bought on installment credit, while 85 percent of Thailand's sales were on credit. **********Analysts shrug off concerns about the company's ability to collect from customers, but there are some worrisome signs. Singer's accounts receivables have swelled to 40 percent of sales, up from 33 percent. The company's days receivable -- how long it would wait to get paid if current sales and payment patterns persist -- has increased from about 105 days in 1993 to 146 days last year. **********The payment record of Singer's affiliates is no better. They owe a staggering $92 million -- an amount easily equal to three times the business they did last year with the company. **********None of that might matter if the company were setting aside ample reserves. But the allowance for possible bad debts is only 4 percent of the outsized $452.9 million sitting in accounts receivable. **********The point is, next time you're tempted to pick a stock that's been reporting great numbers, remember you can't always judge a company by its bottom line. Despite Mr. Ting's best efforts, Singer is no blue chip."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/27/business/company-news-j-p-morgan-says-it-will-reduce-staff.html": {"writer_name": "Saul Hansell", "pub_date": "1995-01-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 390, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "J.

Although statistics can be misleading -- the divorce rate is measured by comparing the number of marriages and divorces in a given year -- officials say it is rising all over China, and faster in cities than in the countryside. **********The national divorce rate is now 10.4 percent, still far behind the United States, where the divorce rate rose sharply in the 1970's to around 50 percent, where it has remained. **********The United Nations conference on women, to be held here from Sept. 4 to 15, is expected to draw attention to the social and economic ills facing women in China and elsewhere. **********Yet for women in Beijing, the growing divorce rate is a reflection of a new social and economic freedom, of the rising expectations that women bring to marriage, and of damaging effects from what many Beijing residents say is a remarkable increase in adulterous affairs. More than 70 percent of divorces are now initiated by women, divorce lawyers say, and the most common reason given is that a husband has had an affair. **********\"Only a few years ago, people would let a temple be destroyed before they would let a marriage fail,\" said Pi Xiaoming, a leading divorce lawyer whose work at the East Beijing Women's Federation used to involve applying intense pressure on couples not to divorce. **********\"We did everything possible to keep people from separating,\" Ms. Pi said. \"If there was 1 percent chance of saving a marriage, we'd expend all our effort to overcome the 99 percent of difficulty.\" **********Now, Ms. Pi and other Government officials who once actively opposed divorce support it as an acceptable alternative to an unhappy marriage, and a divorce that once took years to win approval can now be processed in three days if both side agree. Many officials even recognize a positive side of divorce. **********\"The high rate of divorce reflects a kind of 'master of my own fate' notion among urban residents,\" wrote the Beijing Youth Daily. \"From an overall perspective, the high rate of divorce represents a kind of social advancement.\" **********But the Government's shift in attitude is only one ingredient in the rising divorce rate. A larger one seems to be growing demands by women in an era of expanding opportunity. **********\"My husband used to say, 'You have your job, your study overseas, a roof over your head, what more do you want?' \" said Liang Hua, 41, who divorced last year. \"What I wanted was a husband who didn't sit at home all day, watching sports on television.\" **********If most Chinese men still look for a stable home and a reliable mother for their children, several women in different professions agreed, women who used to be content with a steady family income now want more: romance, sex and affection. **********\"My husband never kissed me, not once,\" said Lan Ding, 40, a self-employed tailor who said she had divorced her husband, an air force officer, because of the way he treated her. \"We had a child, but he never kissed me. I only learned how to do that much later.\" **********One of the most popular books in Beijing this year is \"The Bridges of Madison County,\" the American best seller whose story of a midlife affair that brings romance to a woman's life clearly struck a chord here. Several women said they had spent evenings sitting around with friends, debating whether the romance described in the book is possible in marriage. **********\"Before, marriage was very stable, but the quality was very low,\" said Wang Xingjuan, who listens to hundreds of complaints each month on the women's hot line she runs in Beijing. \"It was something you did and didn't think about. Now, people have high expectations from marriage.\" **********Ms. Wang also said that most Chinese women traditionally had sex only for the purpose of bearing children. But China's one-child policy, while resisted by many women in the countryside, has made urban women freer both to pursue careers and to pursue sex. \"Now it's for pleasure, for health,\" Ms. Wang said. **********Wu Liyong, 36, a director of a food products company in Beijing, said one of the causes of her divorce earlier this year, after 12 years of marriage, was an unsatisfactory sex life. **********\"We were taught that the man is the one to initiate sex,\" she said. \"I didn't say anything for a long time. But when I finally talked about it with my friends, they told me I was stupid. I feel like I wasted 10 years.\" **********If China's economic reforms have brought greater independence to women in some ways -- more choice of career, place to live, husband, lover -- they have also brought women a greater danger of unemployment than men face. **********At the same time, the loosening of Government control has also meant a resurgence of traditional attitudes among men: that money means access to women. **********\"Men like to see women as objects,\" said Feng Yuan, a journalist at China Women's News who has written extensively on how social changes affect women. \"They feel that the more they achieve, the more ability or charisma they have.\" **********A 32-year-old man who works for a securities company in Shanghai said that he was faithful to his wife during the three years they dated before marriage, but that he started having affairs about six months afterward. **********\"Chinese men need other women,\" said the man, who added that many of his friends feel the same way. \"Family life is one thing; life outside is another. You don't have to hide it; everyone at work knows who my girlfriend is.\" **********Part of the broader problem, both women and men say, is that Chinese society does not teach men to treat their wives well. **********\"My husband was a good worker, a good son to his parents, a good father to his son and a terrible husband,\" said Ms. Lan, the woman who divorced an air force officer. \"That's what our society teaches men to do.\" **********Ms. Feng, the journalist, thinks that one of several causes of the rising divorce rate is the influx of books and movies from the West. **********\"Ten years ago, the Government blamed affairs on 'bourgeois liberalization,' \" a code for Western influence, she said. \"But it was counterproductive because it made a lot of people think, now that capitalism is O.K., that it's also O.K. to have affairs, too.\" **********The current surge in divorce is not the first in modern China. The 1950 Constitution and a new marriage law, which redefined rights within families, encouraged a wave of divorces in the early 1950's. Many of these were initiated by Communist army soldiers who, after their victory in 1949, moved to cities and divorced wives they had married in rural hometowns but abandoned during the long years of war. **********At the start of the Cultural Revolution in 1966, when millions of lives were shattered by accusations of political incorrectness, many people were forced to divorce a spouse for political reasons. After that period of turmoil ended in 1976, many others divorced spouses they had married in unusual circumstances, though no reliable statistics have been kept on what the divorce rates were at that time, Ms. Feng said. **********For all the women who have divorced, there are countless more who have considered it but been unable or unwilling to do so. **********At the women's hot line, run out of a small office in central Beijing, a recent caller described herself as a 31-year-old doctor who has been married to a businessman eight years and has a small daughter. **********When she discovered that her husband was having an affair, she asked for a divorce. He refused, saying that he wanted to stay married for the sake of their child, and tried to soothe his wife by saying he would buy them a new house and give her a car of her own, still a rarity in China. **********\"I don't know what do,\" said the woman, who can still win a divorce if she demonstrates that she is incompatible with her husband. \"I want to rely on myself, but I don't want to have a less comfortable life.\" **********Ms. Lan said she urged many of her friends not to follow her example, because of the economic difficulty she has had raising a son on her own, and because of the hard time she has had finding another man. **********\"A lot of people still see a divorced woman as immoral, but see a divorced man as fine.\" Ms. Lan said. **********As for her son, Wang Xiyue, 14, Ms. Lan used to worry that he would be the only student in his class whose parents are divorced. She doesn't worry any more. **********\"There are six of them now,\" she said, affectionately rubbing a hand over his head. \"It's getting more and more common.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/25/business/the-media-business-expanding-in-tv-gannett-agrees-to-buy-multimedia.html": {"writer_name": "Geraldine Fabrikant", "pub_date": "1995-07-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 944, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Expanding in TV, Gannett Agrees to Buy Multimedia", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Expanding in TV, Gannett Agrees to Buy Multimedia", "body_text": " **********Moving to expand significantly both its television and newspaper holdings, the Gannett Company said yesterday that it had agreed to a $1.7 billion acquisition of the media company that syndicates the talk shows of Phil Donahue, Sally Jessy Raphael and Rush Limbaugh. **********Gannett beat out several rivals for the company, Multimedia Inc. of Greenville, S.C., which also owns cable television systems; 11 daily and 49 other newspapers, and television stations in Cleveland, Cincinnati, St. Louis, Knoxville, Tenn., and Macon, Ga. -- all markets where Gannett has no stations. Multimedia also owns two radio stations in Macon and a security systems business, as well as the television syndication business. **********Though the syndicated shows are the best-known of Multimedia's operations nationally, analysts viewed the shows as being past their prime and thus perhaps the least desirable part of the acquisition, which would be Gannett's largest ever. **********Diversification was a big appeal for Gannett, but the newspapers may be the real prize, the analysts say. Gannett is already the nation's largest newspaper publisher, and the Multimedia papers would add 321,000 to Gannett's 6 million daily circulation from 82 newspapers including USA Today, The Detroit News, The Courier-Journal of Louisville, Ky., and The Des Moines Register. Multimedia's flagship papers are in Asheville, N.C.; Montgomery, Ala., and Greenville -- all in states where Gannett owns no papers. **********Gannett, which is based in Arlington, Va., also operates 10 television stations, 11 radio stations and the largest outdoor advertising company in North America. Gannett's revenues, which were $3.8 billion last year, are expected to grow about 20 percent from the acquisition. **********\"It is a great fit,\" said John Reidy, media analyst for Smith Barney & Company. \"It broadens its geographic base, giving it very strong regional newspapers and TV stations,\" as well as putting it into cable and syndication. The company is paying a relatively low multiple of about nine times cash flow, he noted. **********Under the terms of the deal, announced jointly by John J. Curley, chairman, president and chief executive of Gannett, and Donald D. Sbarra, chairman and chief executive of Multimedia, Gannett would pay $45.25 for each of Multimedia's 37.87 million shares. In addition, it would assume Multimedia's debt of less than $600 million. The purchase price would be adjusted if Multimedia's debt exceeded specified levels at the end of the year. **********With the debt, the total value of the deal would approach $2.3 billion. But Gannett might have to sell some of the businesses, lessening the net value of the transaction. The deal was approved by both boards on Sunday and is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. **********Gannett would have 15 television stations after the deal, 3 more than the current Federal limit. But Congress is considering deregulating telecommunications businesses, ending limits on station ownership. **********\"This is a smart deal for Gannett,\" said Fred Seegal, president of Wasserstein Perella & Company, which represented Media General Inc., part of a group that was also trying to acquire Multimedia. **********Shares of Gannett fell 50 cents yesterday, to $53.25, on the New York Stock Exchange, while Multimedia's stock rose 50 cents, to $42.25, in Nasdaq trading. Multimedia's stock was in the low 20's in February, when it put itself on the block. **********Since acquiring the Louisville and Des Moines papers in the 1980's under Allen H. Neuharth, Gannett's previous chairman, Gannett has done relatively little on the acquisition front, except to buy back its shares from the Gannett Foundation, building up its balance sheet and enabling it to negotiate from a position of strength. Indeed, the company could afford to retain all the holdings, if permitted to do so. **********Multimedia's newspapers, like Gannett's, have very high profit margins. Indeed, Charles Baker, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, said Multimedia's margins, in the high 20's, were unusually high, exceeding even Gannett's. **********Gannett will also be acquiring cable television systems that serve about 450,000 subscribers and a security service that covers more than 76,000 security-alarm subscribers. **********Gannett tried its hand at television production in the 1980's and flopped. Its venture with Grant Tinker produced a short-lived television program named after Gannett's flagship national daily newspaper, USA Today. **********Analysts raised questions about the future health of one Multimedia business -- television syndication. A number of the company's talk shows are relatively old and may not wear well over time, the analysts said. However, they added that the overall price was reasonable enough that Gannett could afford the risk. **********One deterrent to selling any Multimedia holdings would be capital-gains taxes. As Arthur Feder, a tax expert at the law firm of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, noted, \"When a company buys another publicly held company for cash, if it chooses to sell any of the assets, it must use the cost at which the asset was carried by the original company.\" Many of Multimedia's assets have a low cost basis, so if Gannett were to sell anything, it would undoubtedly be liable for high capital-gains taxes. **********Mr. Baker of Salomon Brothers said: \"It looks to me like the company is generating $300 million or so of free cash flow after capital expenditures and dividends. And if you look at a $2 billion acquisition, that means you can repay the cost in little more than five years.\" **********Among those bidding against Gannett was a group including Ellis Communications, Charter Communications, Media General and two financial companies, that had offered $1.55 billion. Last year, Gannett had operating income of $812.8 million on operating revenue of $3.8 billion. Multimedia reported operating income of $189.4 million on revenue of $630.5 million."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/21/business/a-giant-health-care-company-is-said-to-be-looking-for-a-buyer.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1995-06-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 409, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Giant Health Care Company Is Said to Be Looking for a Buyer", "print_headline": "A Giant Health Care Company Is Said to Be Looking for a Buyer", "body_text": " **********The Metrahealth Companies, the nation's largest health care company created last year as a joint venture by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and Travelers Inc., is looking for a buyer, insurance executives and industry analysts said yesterday. **********Negotiations for a merger with United Healthcare of Minnetonka, Minn., are far advanced, although no agreement has been completed, according to officials at United Healthcare and analysts who spoke on condition of anonymity.

But most stood quietly, eager to see if this man who once held them in thrall would look any different now that he had been cut to mortal size. **********Eight months after he conceded defeat in an election that was forced upon him, Dr. Banda has been charged with ordering the murder of four top officials of his own Government. The men were rounded up by the police and clubbed to death with hammers and crowbars. **********The 12-year-old crime, its grisly details itemized in 1,000 pages of testimony, has absorbed this little sliver of southeast Africa, a country that prides itself on being a pocket of gentleness in a cruel continent. **********Even more than the elections last May, the case has become a rite of passage from the rule of one man's whim to the rule of laws. **********\"We're not wanting vengeance in this matter,\" said President Bakili Muluzi, who defeated Dr. Banda. \"We're not even wanting to use it as a political issue. But according to the laws of Malawi, you kill, you are tried.\" **********Echoing some of the gawkers outside the courthouse, he added, \"We must put the record right and make sure that nobody in my position, today, tomorrow, would ever commit atrocities like that and get away with it.\" **********In his mid-90's and reportedly given to depression and lapses of memory, Dr. Banda lives under luxurious house arrest and faces the possibility of being hanged if he survives the year or more his murder trial is expected to take. His lawyer, Lovemore Munlo, describes Dr. Banda as being \"in terrible shape.\" **********So far, Mr. Munlo has gotten his client excused from appearing in court. **********Dr. Banda (he earned a medical degree from Meharry Medical College in Tennessee) led the protests that won independence from Britain in 1964. Within two years he had consolidated all power in his own hands. **********The Victorian peculiarity of his rule -- he dressed formally in homburg hats and ordered long-haired male tourists shorn at the airport -- made him seem more comical than brutal. Even now many Malawians revere Dr. Banda as the father of their country, and blame any cruelties committed during his rule on his despised right-hand man, John Tembo, who also faces charges in the case. **********But the murder accusation, compiled by an independent commission created by Mr. Muluzi, has badly battered Dr. Banda's lingering reputation as a strict but well-intentioned patriarch. **********The commission found that in 1983 four men whose loyalty Dr. Banda had questioned -- three Cabinet ministers and a member of Parliament -- were arrested at police roadblocks, blindfolded, taken to a forest outside Blantyre and killed. **********\"I was the one who had the hammer and I hit him at the back of the head, where I knew, according to my police training, he would die immediately,\" said one policeman whose testimony filled pages of a local newspaper. **********The police packed the bodies into a blue Peugeot and rolled it over a cliff, and later presented the deaths to the country as an accident. **********The commission had only circumstantial evidence that Dr. Banda and Mr. Tembo ordered the men killed. The police official to whom Dr. Banda supposedly gave the command later died, although his wife and deputy say he told them about his instructions. **********But Robert Mzikamanda, who was secretary of the investigating commission, said there was \"debate, but no doubt\" about Dr. Banda's role.  Within days of receiving the report, the chief prosecutor ordered the former President and three others arrested. **********Dr. Banda's lawyer, Mr. Munlo, says the police must have acted on their own. The murder case, he argues, is a vengeful circus intended to distract public attention from the economic misery that has conspicuously worsened since Dr. Banda lost power. **********\"There is an enthusiasm to punish Dr. Banda,\" the lawyer said. **********It is true that President Muluzi could use a timely reminder of how bad things used to be, since many of his people are already muttering that life was better under Dr. Banda. **********Since the elections, the currency has lost more than half its value. The inflation rate is over 40 percent. Foreign aid, which keeps the Government afloat, is threatened by Republican control of the United States Congress and by competition from the more glamorous new democracy in nearby South Africa. **********The Government is also under pressure from others who lost husbands and fathers to search the past to its depths. **********Vera Chirwa, a human rights lawyer, contends that thousands died mysteriously. She and her husband, Orton Chirwa, spent 11 years in prison, much of the time manacled hand and foot in solitary confinement. Her husband died in custody in 1992. **********\"It's not enough,\" she says of the current murder case. \"My children would like to know, how did their daddy die?\" **********But in an interview at the hilltop palace he inherited, Mr. Muluzi said his country cannot afford a witch hunt, even if it wanted one. **********Investigating the one case, he said, has already cost his impoverished Government $250,000. In addition, courts have made huge compensation awards to victims of the past Government, which Mr. Muluzi calls forcing the new democracy to \"pay for Banda's sins.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/15/business/company-news-radius-and-ibm-talk-about-making-macintosh-clones.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-06-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 79, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "RADIUS AND I.B.M.

If injured, a button can be pushed on a wireless radio transmitter that is worn like a necklace or wristwatch. **********When the systems were first offered, in the 1970's, they worked as a one-way alert sent to an emergency service. Now, more advanced units use a receiver attached to the person's telephone that picks up the distress signal, automatically dials the emergency service, sends an identification code and then transforms the telephone into a speaker phone so emergency personnel can talk to the elderly victim. **********But sometimes that is difficult because of background noise. L. Dennis Shapiro, an electrical engineer and chairman of Lifeline Systems Inc., in Cambridge, Mass., first noticed the problem when meeting customers who use his company's personal emergency equipment. **********\"When I visit the homes of elderly people, they almost always have a television set on,\" Mr. Shapiro said. \"And typically when the TV is on, it's loud because the average age of our subscribers is over 75 and the majority have a hearing problem.\" **********Mr. Shapiro worried that loud televisions would make it impossible to hold a conversation over a speaker phone. So he patented a personal emergency device that mutes the television volume. **********\"It's set up to learn the particular muting code of the TV,\" he explained. \"It has a learning circuit inside. You take the TV remote, press the mute button and it acts just like a TV. It receives the digital sequence of ons and offs of the infrared light bulb. It learns them and can mimic them.\" **********A microphone is installed in the radio receiver attached to the subscriber's telephone. If an elderly person is injured and presses the emergency button, the signal causes the phone to dial a monitoring station. At the same time, the microphone receives a sample of ambient room noise. If the noise registers above a certain level, the television mute function of the emergency device is activated. **********The television silencer is just one of Mr. Shapiro's patents in emergency communications. **********\"My orientation has been to provide communication to at-risk people, especially the elderly who cannot manage for themselves if there is a personal problem or an environmental problem,\" he said. **********He holds a patent for including a radio receiver in the emergency device the elderly wear. In case of a hurricane, he imagines, if electricity and telephones are out of order, the wearer can still hear emergency broadcasts. Another patent allows an older person to press the device's button to turn a ringing telephone into a speaker phone, so that the answerer does not have to get up. **********Mr. Shapiro went into emergency communications after designing radar systems for the military during the Vietnam War. After the war, he used that technology to create motion detectors for alarm systems. Then he became interested in personal alert devices. **********\"This is a real swords-to-plowshares type of story,\" he said. In the United States and Canada, Lifeline Systems has 100,000 direct subscribers, who are monitored at the company's headquarters, and nearly 300,000 indirect customers who use Lifeline equipment but are monitored by hospitals. About 25 percent of those have the two-way voice system. His company's service costs about $1 a day, Mr. Shapiro said. Other, smaller companies provide similar services. **********Mr. Shapiro said his patent for television-muting technology could be adapted to silence radios, stereos or tape players. And he says it might be useful for automatically muting the television when a phone or doorbell rings in the home of someone who is hard of hearing. **********Lifeline Systems is not yet selling personal emergency systems with television-muting capability, and Mr. Shapiro is unsure when the service will be available. He holds patent 5,420,907. Food Container Lid That Pumps Out Air **********More help for the elderly and others with limited physical strength or disabilities may come from a newly patented lid for food containers. Eric Miramon designed a lid with a mini-pump that extracts air from a container in place of the manual technique of gripping the bowl and pushing down on the lid while pulling up on a corner to force air out. **********\"The basic lid is about the same size, diameter and depth as a mayonnaise-jar lid,\" said Jeff Stuebing, a partner with Mr. Miramon in Invental Laboratories Inc. The company, in Morro Bay, Calif., can make the lids in any size. **********\"But where normally there is air space on the inside of a normal lid, we incorporated a bellows connected to a small valve,\" he explained. The lid has a textured, rectangular-shaped button on top that activates the bellows. **********\"When you push the bellows down, the air is expelled through the small valve into the atmosphere,\" he continued. \"When you let go, the bellows has resiliency and returns to its original shape, sucking the air out of the container.\" **********There is another, smaller button on the side of the lid that releases air back into the container to make it easy to break the vacuum seal and open the jar. Mr. Stuebing said pressing the buttons took little strength. Ordinary jars, containers and leftover dishes require only one push of the bellows button to expel the air. **********\"If you had a five-gallon bucket or ice chest for keeping picnic food cold longer, you'd have to actuate the bellows five or six times,\" he said. **********Mr. Miramon and Mr. Stuebing said the lid was designed to fit standard leftover storage containers like Tupperware and Rubbermaid products. They are also designing a five-gallon bucket for restaurant use and have approached manufacturers of picnic coolers about designing an ice chest. They also said they thought their patent could be used for air-tight storage of medical or pharmaceutical products.

More than 300 newspaper, radio and television reporters have descended on the United States to chronicle every minute of Mr. Lee's trip, to broadcast every public word he utters, and glean meaning from every private conversation overheard. **********This afternoon, all three Government-controlled television stations carried Mr. Lee's departure ceremony, complete with red carpets, a receiving line of the country's senior ministers, a military honor guard, and lingering pictures of Mr. Lee's chartered Boeing 747 roaring off the runway en route to Los Angeles, where it landed later today to another large press reception. **********For 16 years, Taiwan's leaders had not been allowed to so much as step off an airplane in the Honolulu airport for fear that such a step would antagonize the Government of China and violate the official American policy that there is only one China. **********On Friday, Mr. Lee is to address alumni at Cornell, where he received a doctorate in agricultural economics in 1968. **********\"We hope this is a watershed,\" said Jason C. Hu, the Government's chief spokesman, who traveled with the president to Los Angeles today. \"We hope from now on people we see us as what we are.\" **********\"This is significant in the sense that we can be seen and heard and not isolated,\" he said, in an interview before his departure. \"We want Peking to understand that we have done nothing with the purpose of irritating anyone.\" **********Because the United States does not recognize the Taiwan Government, Clinton Administration officials have refused to meet Taiwan's president. However, Taiwan officials have said that Mr. Lee expects several members of Congress to come to Ithaca. **********Yet despite the cold shoulder the Administration is showing Mr. Lee, Beijing, which regards this island as a renegade province, has reacted with fury to his trip, declaring that Chinese-American relations would suffer as a result. **********Since Taiwan's expulsion from the United Nations in October 1971, the country has fallen into a diplomatic black hole, an oblivion that many thought complete when the United States severed relations in 1979 and granted full diplomatic recognition to the Chinese Government in Beijing. **********But Taiwan prospered. Its economy has expanded dramatically, catapulting the country's per capita gross national product from $443 in 1971, the year it was thrown out of the United Nations, to $12,640 today. And after decades of martial law, the country has now embraced democratic politics with a boisterousness rivaled by few Asian nations. **********In the last several years Taiwan has trumpeted its economic achievements and democratic credentials as it has sought wider international recognition. Last year, President Lee visited several countries in southeast Asia where he happened to find himself on golf courses with those countries leaders. \"Vacation diplomacy,\" it was called. And earlier this year, Mr. Lee visited Jordan and the United Arab Emirates. **********But the centerpiece of Taiwan's diplomatic offensive has been the struggle to send Mr. Lee to the United States. For its part, the Clinton Administration had resisted appeals by Taiwan to allow Mr. Lee to visit the United States. **********Last year, when Mr. Lee's plane stopped in Hawaii for refueling on a trip to Latin America, the Administration refused to allow him to rest there overnight. Humiliated by his treatment, Mr. Lee refused even to leave the plane. Then last month, only after nearly unanimous votes in the Senate and the House of Representatives expressing support for Mr. Lee's visa application, did Mr. Clinton bow to a rising tide of sentiment and permit Mr. Lee's current visit despite the reported opposition of the State Department, which argued against jeopardizing relations with China. **********In Beijing, the trip has been denounced repeatedly.

Spurs Politics by Allegory", "body_text": " **********On a bright spring day early this month, Beijing's powerful Deputy Mayor left his chauffer-driven car and walked into a ravine northwest of the city, where he smoked his last cigarette and then, officials said, killed himself with a pistol. **********Now, a Beijing newspaper has asked the question, \"Murder or suicide?\" -- but in such an oblique manner that it seems a throwback to another era in Communist Party history. **********The newspaper never mentioned by name the 60-year-old Deputy Mayor, Wang Baosen, who at the time of his death was caught up in one of the major corruption investigations laying siege to the city government. **********Indeed, the subject of the newspaper article was a poet who lived more than 2,500 years ago. **********\"It's just like the Cultural Revolution again!\" a senior Communist Party official exclaimed. \"Everyone is talking about this newspaper article and what it means.\" **********During the especially repressive era of the Cultural Revolution in the 1960's, political criticism was carried out by allegory. Oblique literary attacks in prominent newspapers were often the harbingers of a persecution campaign. **********In 1965, Wu Han, the Deputy Mayor of Beijing who was also a scholar, published the story of a fearless Ming Dynasty official named Hai Rui, who stood up to a dictatorial emperor. Despite the fact that Mao Zedong had encouraged the author to tell the tale, it was later seen as a veiled attack on him, and he used the perceived insult as a pretext for purges against his party rivals. **********Now, Beijingers, who still have received no official notice that their Deputy Mayor is dead, are instead told about Qu Yuan. **********\"For a long time people believed that Qu Yuan, the famous poet in the Spring and Autumn Period (770-481 B.C.), killed himself by jumping into a river after losing political power,\" the Beijing Daily said on April 10. \"The only evidence was the poem he wrote after being exiled. In this poem, Qu Yuan wrote that the way had been chosen for his suicide -- jumping into the river. But some researchers have pointed out that this poem might be a forgery written as a suicide note by his political enemies.\" **********The article asks whether \"assassins\" might have been sent by the Emperor to kill Qu Yuan. **********Beijingers who knew of Mr. Wang's death had been raising similar questions. Did he sacrifice himself, or was he sacrificed to protect someone above him? Even if he was not killed, was he being positioned as a scapegoat? **********Mr. Wang, whose responsibilities included the reconstruction of Beijing under a master plan unveiled last year, was the protege of Chen Xitong, the former Beijing Mayor who is the capital's Communist Party secretary and a member of China's ruling Politburo. **********In the past, Mr. Chen was considered a rival of the Shanghai party boss, Jiang Zemin, who has risen to become President, Communist Party boss and commander of the military. **********Western Embassies in Beijing believe that Mr. Jiang is using the opportunity created by the corruption inquiries to go after Mr. Chen's fief. **********\"It looks like Jiang is moving against people who have challenged him in the past or might challenge him in the future,\" a Western diplomat said. **********The events leading to the corruption allegations started, oddly enough, in December, when the American hamburger franchise, McDonald's, was served an eviction notice at its prime location just off Tiananmen Square. McDonald's was in the way of Orient Plaza, a huge shopping and office complex that had important political backers. **********Initially, public attention was focused on the plight of McDonald's. Foreign investors feared that if McDonald's 20-year site agreement could be violated, contracts meant nothing in China. **********Then, suddenly, the focus shifted. **********Prime Minister Li Peng got involved in the case. Orient Plaza's backers were said to have skirted required approvals and to have violated height restrictions meant to protect the skyline around the Forbidden City. How could this happen? **********The first rumors of an investigation centered on \"the gang of secretaries,\" as they have been dubbed. Current and former secretaries to Mayor Li Qiyan and Party Secretary Chen were said to be under investigation or arrest. Alleged crimes were not spelled out, but \"financial irregularities\" was the catch phrase used. **********Several Chinese officials, in conversations with Western diplomats and journalists, confirmed that prosecutors were deep into the city's books and that the case involved all manner of real estate transactions. **********Then another shoe dropped. **********In February, Zhou Guanwu, the chairman of Beijing's Capital Iron and Steel Company, abruptly retired and his son, Zhou Beifang, was arrested for alleged \"economic crimes.\" The steel conglomerate is owned by the Beijing Government. The company, under the Zhou family, had gone on a spending binge in recent years, and its Communist Party executives were living the high life. **********Mr. Chen has told officials that he could not be expected to know everything his subordinates were up to. **********For Mr. Wang -- guilty or not -- these could not have been welcome words, and so, as in the case of the poet Qu Yuan, \"a cruel historical tragedy was played out.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/01/business/retired-and-still-saving.html": {"writer_name": "Carol Cropper", "pub_date": "1995-10-01", "snippet": "CHARLES HUSKEY was terrified when he was pushed into retirement five years ago at the age of 54.\n\nMr. Huskey, a Bedford, Tex., manager at an oil company, had amassed pensions from two companies and two tax-favored retirement accounts, and he had s...", "word_count": 2503, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Retired, And Still Saving", "print_headline": "Retired, And Still Saving", "body_text": " **********CHARLES HUSKEY was terrified when he was pushed into retirement five years ago at the age of 54. **********Mr. Huskey, a Bedford, Tex., manager at an oil company, had amassed pensions from two companies and two tax-favored retirement accounts, and he had squirreled away several hundred thousand dollars in other savings, but he was still worried. \"What if I live to be 105? What's enough?\" **********Good question. Blessed with life expectancies that stretch out for decades, more and more Americans are fretting that their hard-saved money will peter out long before they do. Ideally, they would like to maintain the life style they have become used to in their working years, and yet there are just too many unknowns. How much will inflation rise? What will happen to the stock and bond markets and to interest rates? And for how long must one hoard savings? Government life-expectancy tables give the averages, and few people last as long as the Delany sisters, centenarians recently immortalized by a hit Broadway show, \"Having Our Say.\" But 1992 death records tell of a man who died at a claimed 125 or more and of two women who expired at 123. **********Faced with such uncertainties, many retirees react by drawing a minimal allowance from tax-deferred accounts and by living on the interest from other savings, said Seymour Goldberg, a certified public accountant and trust and estates lawyer. Mr. Huskey and his wife live off his pensions and the earnings from their investments, without touching the money sitting in their individual retirement account and 401(k) plan. **********As scary as the future looks to the current crop of retirees, it gets more terrifying for those coming up behind them. Of all generations of American retirees, \"this may be the group that fares the best,\" said Bill Wiatrowski, an economist with the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. **********This may be the last generation, for instance, that was swaddled in old-style defined-benefit pensions. That's the kind for which the company promises to send a check as long as you live. Today's firm is much more likely to offer a defined-contribution plan like a 401(k), for which it gladly deducts pretax dollars from the worker's salary, and maybe makes a matching contribution. Whatever accumulates, accumulates. There is no guarantee of payments for life -- or even of how much money there will be. **********The much-maligned Social Security system is also more of a certainty for today's retirees than for those of the future. The top payment for a retired couple who earned high salaries is now $2,398 a month. For a couple with one wage earner, the maximum is $1,798. **********Home equity is a potential source of income for this group. The median sale price of a house in this country soared to $110,000 last year from $23,000 in 1970, according to the National Association of Realtors. Reverse mortgages from companies like Transamerica Homefirst in San Francisco allow retirees to borrow against the equity in their homes as a way to raise money for living expenses, with the understanding that their estates will settle up later by selling the homes. **********A 1991 study by Mr. Wiatrowski showed that pensions plus Social Security on average replaced 56 percent of salary for a worker who earned $55,000, rising to 98 percent of salary for a worker who made $15,000. **********NONE of this seems to calm aging nerves. \"Their big fear, no matter how much they've got, is whether they will run out,\" said Tim Kochis, a San Francisco financial planner whose typical client sits on a $2 million nest egg. **********The worries can border on compulsion for the oldest retirees -- those who remember the Great Depression or at least their parents' skimping. This group is determined not just to die with break-even finances, but also to leave an inheritance. **********Linda K. George, associate director of Duke University's Center for the Study of Aging, tells of a 74-year-old Ohio man who went without his gout medication as long as he could stand the pain rather than pay more than $1 for each of the pills he was supposed to take twice a day. \"If you asked him why, he'd say, 'It could be worse. I might have to go to a nursing home, and I want to conserve my money. I might need my money.' \" Then he would talk about how he wanted to leave something for his children, she said. \"He wanted to be buried knowing that something he had went to his children.\" **********Such penny-pinching can be maddening to the children it is supposed to benefit. A North Carolina woman who insisted on anonymity complained of the coupon-clipping parents who never took vacations yet insisted on sending $500 birthday gifts to their grandchildren. Jerome Golden, an Equitable Life Assurance executive who markets investments for the elderly, told of a Florida couple who borrowed money from their children so they didn't have to spend the inheritance they wanted to leave to those same children. **********Often, the frustrated children are up against habits cultivated during a lifetime of frugal living, said Mr. Goldberg, the accountant. Never mind that there is a retirement bundle waiting to be spent and that there are only so many years of living in which to drain it. **********BARBARA WILKOC, a Manhattan public relations executive, knows that her 72-year-old father could treat himself better. But he insists on buying used cars, eating frozen dinners and spending his days fishing at a two-room lakeside cabin in South Carolina. Meanwhile, his hundreds of thousands of dollars languish in low-interest bank certificates of deposit. \"A part of it is for a rainy day. Primarily it's for the kids. He wants his kids to have it,\" she said. **********What makes this all the more galling to Mrs. Wilkoc is that her father's Depression-era parents were the same way. They hoarded so they could leave money to her mom and dad. \"My mother died the same month that the inheritance came,\" she said. **********Her father, Harry Potts, said he understood his children's attitude. \"I think they just feel that I have it, that it's mine, that I should use it to live the way I want to live. But, quite honestly, that's exactly what I'm doing. Why should I spend it just for the sake of spending it? I do everything I want to do.\" **********Leaving an inheritance \"is part of my heritage,\" he said. **********Sometimes giving to children springs from a desire to reassert the parental role of caretaker. Or to demonstrate independence despite growing physical infirmities. Other times, parental needs to control their children or to make sure the offspring don't abandon them are tangled in the desire to leave an estate, said Peter White, president of International Skye, a consulting firm that works with wealthy families. **********Younger retirees, in contrast, are more willing to spend their children's inheritances, Mr. Golden said. These retirees would be happy just knowing that the money won't run out, keeping them from becoming burdens to their children. **********No handy charts exist to tell these retirees exactly how much they can spend without running out. In publication 590, the Internal Revenue Service shows retirees how to calculate the minimum they need to withdraw each year from tax-deferred accounts like I.R.A.'s and 401(k)'s, just to avoid tax penalties. There is also a Government-imposed maximum of $150,000. In between is uncharted sea. The I.R.S., of course, says nothing about spending regular savings. **********Financial advisers can draw up plans based on likely inflation rates, investment returns and life expectancies. William Matthews, a Dallas financial planner, shows how a retiree with $500,000 saved could take out $30,000 a year, adjust the withdrawal upward by 3 percent a year for inflation, and still at age 90 have more than the $500,000 he started with at age 65. That is, if he can earn 8.5 percent after taxes each year, a feat that would almost certainly require investing rather aggressively in equities. If that makes the retiree uneasy, he could live on less or resign himself to having to invade the principal. **********Those numbers are terribly sensitive to earnings shortfalls. If the retiree merely earned 8 percent a year after taxes -- half a percentage point less than hoped -- the nest egg would dwindle to $343,194 by age 90. **********It is also up to the retiree to choose between the conservative assumptions and optimistic ones. Will inflation average 3.1 percent, as it did between 1925 and July 1995? Or will it top 13 percent, as it did in 1980? Will the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks average 10.5 percent compounded annual returns, as it did between December 1925 and this July? Or will it fall 3.2 percent, as it did in 1990? **********AND unpleasant as the task may seem, it is up to the retiree to form an opinion about his or her mortality. The average life expectancy for someone who has reached age 65 is 15.4 years for a man and 19.2 years for a woman. **********Faced with such choices, hordes of retirees are turning to the certainty of fixed annuities -- handing a chunk of their savings over to an insurance company to buy the promise of a check for life or at least a guaranteed return on their money. Sales of fixed annuities swelled 80 percent between 1990 and 1994, according to the American Council of Life Insurance. The cost of this peace of mind is often higher fees and lower returns. **********Medical costs may pose the biggest threat of all, and for the unlucky, no amount of savings may be enough. Ms. George recalled the wealthy Durham, N.C., surgeon she met five years ago. He had been driven to increasing desperation by having had to care for a wife with Alzheimer's disease for eight years. \"He said, 'I always thought I was a rich man. But at the rate we're spending because of this illness, I have enough money to last two more years.\" The woman died of natural causes 17 months later, Ms. George said, and the surgeon sold his house and went back to work. **********Retirees can buy policies to help fill gaps in Medicare. Long-term health-care insurance can cover nursing-home care, but it becomes much more expensive unless purchased early. **********So how did Mr. Huskey deal with his forced retirement? Quite well, thank you. After a few months spent \"scared to death,\" he realized he could live just as well off his investments as on what he had been bringing home after taxes while working at the oil company in Fort Worth. Despite his Scrooge-like ways, his wife, Dolores, is coaxing him into taking vacations in Colorado and Hawaii. He no longer worries -- not even about whether there will be something left for the heirs. \"I don't want to hold back. If there's something we want to do, I want to do it.\" **********Perhaps retirees should listen to Robert Armstrong, the government statistician who draws up those life-expectancy charts and who retires in three years. **********He and his wife plan to sell their house in the expensive Washington, D.C., suburbs and head for someplace less pricey, with lower taxes. They're thinking of Morristown, Tenn. Despite the fact that they have less than $100,000 in savings, Mr. Armstrong, 63, isn't worried about outlasting his money. \"I'm not frightened of that at all. The vast majority of my pension is indexed to inflation. I'm not too concerned with outliving that. I can't.\" **********He also isn't adamant about leaving money to his two children. \"My wife says, 'They both have master's degrees and straight teeth -- we're through with our obligations.' \" Instead, the Armstrongs plan to travel to Ireland and to the Gaspe Peninsula in Canada to see some of the highest tides in the world. Said Mr. Armstrong, who knows his life expectancy is another 16.9 years: \"There are a lot of things I'd like to see.\"Annuities Can Provide Security, at a Cost **********Robert Politzer of Solana Beach, Calif., lost $80,000 of his retirement savings in the stock crash of 1987. Then he bought an annuity, a life-insurance product that provides him with an annual payout for the rest of his life. **********\"I wanted to make sure I had a base income,\" said Mr. Politzer, now 78. \"I didn't want to ever have to depend on my kids. Between that and Social Security, I can scrounge around.\" **********He took the tried-and-true approach to making sure one does not outlive one's money. With an immediate or distribution-type annuity, the insurer essentially assumes the risk that the buyer will live beyond his or her life expectancy, in exchange for a fee and for the right to invest the money. The checks just keep rolling in to the buyer, no matter the age. For this certainty, Mr. Politzer paid $150,000, and he is guaranteed $21,000 a year for the rest of his life, an annual payment based on the prevailing high interest rates on the date of his purchase. **********Individuals poured $99 billion into annuities of all types in 1994, according to LIMRA International, an insurance trade association. But the vast majority of that went into investment-style annuities, whose payouts will not be made for years. **********Only about $5 billion went into the type of annuity Mr. Politzer bought. Most of the immediate annuities sold are fixed -- meaning the retiree locks in a rate of return when he buys the contract. Payments to a surviving spouse can also be locked in. If the buyer dies soon after distributions begin, the contract usually guarantees some payout to children or other beneficiaries. **********The contracts turn out to be the best deal for people who live well beyond their life expectancies. \"We'll take the risk of someone living to be 100,\" said Jerome Golden, president of the Income Management Group at Equitable Life Assurance. \"We have a million annuitants.\" **********The most prevalent type of annuity sold today is a deferred one, meaning the buyer pays his money and the insurance company, bank or stock brokerage invests it until he retires years later. **********With this kind, the purchaser can choose fixed returns or variable returns, linked to underlying investments in stocks and other securities. A variable annuity works more like an investment vehicle than an insurance policy, and the final payout is not certain, though there may be a guaranteed minimum. **********A big advantage of such annuities is their tax deferral. No taxes are due on earnings accumulating inside the contract until withdrawals are made. And, unlike with individual retirement accounts, 401(k) plans and other tax-deferred plans, \"there's no limit to how much you can put into an annuity tax-deferred,\" said Scott Dunn, an insurance analyst with LIMRA. **********Despite the advantages of annuities, many investment advisers caution against them.

The new policy will take effect April 1. **********Until now, Prudential has paid its 5,700 brokers 5 percent more for selling the firm's services than for selling those marketed by other investment banks or independent mutual fund companies. The firm's 60 mutual funds have total assets of $46 billion. **********The practice is common on Wall Street but is coming under increased scrutiny from regulators and some brokerage executives, who say the practice can lead to the perception that brokers are putting themselves and their employers ahead of their customers. **********\"We want to remove any perception, correctly or incorrectly, that there was any bias and to insure a level playing field,\" Mr. Perkins said. **********The new policy by Prudential, the nation's fifth-largest securities firm, is expected to give its brokers an incentive to steer clients to the best-performing investments, regardless of their source. **********\"Anything that takes compensation out of the equation is the right thing to do for the client,\" said Jeremiah Potts, director of marketing at Massachusetts Financial Services Inc., which sells its funds through Prudential brokers. \"Firms like Prudential are trying to level the playing field.\" **********The potential for conflict of interest exists throughout the brokerage business.

Now, under an agreement with the Federal Trade Commission, the medical bureau will become somewhat demystified. **********Under the agreement, an insurer that, having read the bureau records, decides to reject an applicant or charge a higher premium will have to tell the applicant of that decision. Consumers then have 30 days to get a free copy of the medical record. **********The bureau's medical records can be as key to obtaining insurance as a credit rating is in getting a loan. \"We view the reports as identical to credit reports, and you have the right to dispute them in the same way,\" said David Medine, the F.T.C.'s associate director for credit practices, who negotiated the agreement, which takes effect on Oct. 2. **********While the bureau now makes its reports available to individuals for $8 each, the new procedure should raise consumer awareness and may increase the number of challenges to the bureau's records. **********Most files are set up when consumers apply for an individual health or life policy and disclose personal medical information through their written application, medical charts they release or physical exams. **********If the insurer decides to reject the application or to charge a higher premium because of risk factors like heart disease or high blood pressure, it may report that to the bureau, identifying its reason by code. The data is then shared with other carriers. **********For the millions of Americans covered by group policies at work, the medical bureau is not a big factor, because their personal histories generally are not examined. **********But as more people become self-employed or supplement group coverage with individual policies, they are exposed to the network of personal medical information. And those who have had trouble getting insurance should find out if there are records about them and what they say. Even people under group coverage may want to consider the bureau records when they receive care and accumulate medical data that one day may be shared by insurers. **********The F.T.C. agreement brings the medical bureau into alignment with the credit bureaus regulated by the Fair Credit Reporting Act. In fact, the act does not require the bureau to disclose medical data or tell consumers how such information is used. **********Still, said Neil Day, president of the medical bureau, \"If you want to build credibility, and we've wanted to for over 30 years, you don't want to take legalistic postures.\" The bureau, which is based in Boston, had resisted the F.T.C. since the 1970's, but finally, Mr. Day said, \"It just struck a number of us that it was time to sit down and see if we could work out some clarification of it on a basis mutually agreeable to all.\" **********How much will consumers actually benefit under the new agreement? **********Correcting a file to the degree that it restores some or all insurability can be accomplished. But most consumers still don't have contact with insurance agents or brokers who will show them how. **********And fundamentally, it's better not to have a file created in the first place. **********Mr. Day said that the bureau has files on 15 million Americans. In 1994, of the 130,000 consumers who requested bureau reports, some 17,000 actually had files. Of those 17,000, 900 asked for a correction. Some 300 prevailed on their insurers to alter or expunge their files, and 20 inserted a letter into their files disputing the information in it. **********Sometimes an error can be prevented in advance. Suppose a doctor mishears a remark about alcohol use and writes down an erroneous statement in your medical charts. Then you apply for insurance, and release those charts to the insurer for review. The insurer could spot the comment, interpret it negatively and report a code to the bureau. In this situation, the consumer would be wiser to review the doctor's records first, and have any corrections made before authorizing their release. **********It may even be better to put off the application for coverage. For instance, someone who recently sought psychiatric counseling or had taken antidepressants could be at risk. Consumers should seek out insurance agents and brokers who are knowledgeable about the medical bureau and level with them. **********If the damage is done and the accurate codes are in place, there may be little to do but let time go by and later add a letter if the condition improves. But if the file is wrong, your best allies are your doctors. They can object directly to the insurer that created the codes. If the insurer acknowledges a mistake, it can then instruct the bureau to change the codes. And after seven years, records drop off the bureau's files. **********To see whether you have a file at the Medical Information Bureau and to obtain a copy, call (617) 426-3660 or write to the bureau, at Box 105, Essex Station, Boston, Mass. 02112."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/31/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-bell-atlantic-reviews-50-million-account.html": {"writer_name": "Leonard Sloane", "pub_date": "1995-05-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 216, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bell Atlantic Reviews $50 Million Account", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Bell Atlantic Reviews $50 Million Account", "body_text": " **********The Bell Atlantic Corporation said yesterday that it had begun a review on its account, now divided between J.

Still, G. Staley Cates, co-manager of the Longleaf fund, was disappointed. \"This was a low-ball bid,\" he said of the offer by Interbrew S.A. of Belgium for Labatt, a Canadian brewer. Mr. Cates, it turns out, expects all his investments to double in value. So does his mentor, O. Mason Dawkins, the fund's founder and co-manager. **********From Longleaf's offices in Memphis, Mr. Dawkins, 47, and Mr. Cates, 30, adhere to the gospel of value investing as written by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd in \"Security Analysis,\" the industry tome on how to buy a company when its stock is cheap and how to value a company correctly. **********\"I had to read that book three times, and even if we're a little slow here in the Southeast, common sense finally takes hold,\" Mr. Dawkins said in a thick Georgia accent, hinting of his childhood in a family of loggers amid the longleaf pine trees that gave the fund its name. **********His aw-shucks demeanor belies a razor intellect and steel discipline, said Ken Gregory, editor of No-Load Fund Analyst, a newsletter in Orinda, Calif. In his latest issue, Mr. Gregory heralds Mr. Hawkins as one of six masters of the No-Load Universe, among luminaries like Michael Price of the Mutual Series of funds and Shelby Davis of Selected American. **********\"Mason Hawkins thinks of himself as a partner in the businesses he buys,\" Mr. Gregory said. \"He comes up with the private market value of a company and buys at a huge discount to that.\" **********Mr. Hawkins doesn't buy stocks on momentum, nor does he look for industries expected to rise in the next economic cycle. He is an old-fashioned stock picker. And once he buys, Mr. Hawkins holds a stock until the market catches up. \"We don't pay more than 60 cents on the dollar, and we prefer 50 cents,\" he said of his investment philosophy. Rather than getting swept up in market fervor over a particular company's potential, he sells whenever a stock reaches the value he places on it. To stay up to date, he constantly reappraises his holdings. **********The results have been impressive. Longleaf Partners, known as Southeastern Management Value Trust until last August, chalked up a total return of 202 percent from its beginning in April 1987 through March of this year, nearly twice the 117 percent advance of the Standard & Poor's 500 index, including reinvested dividends. Last year, when the average equity fund turned in a loss, Longleaf gained 9 percent. **********Mr. Cates and Mr. Hawkins thrive on activity when they are outdoors and on research when indoors. Mr. Hawkins, a fly fisherman, studied Graham and Dodd in college, in graduate school and later in the Certified Financial Analyst program. Mr. Cates, who enjoys basketball and biking, got a dose of Graham and Dodd early in his career as well. After a college internship at Southeastern, he began pressing Mr. Hawkins for a job. \"I bugged Mason and he finally caved,\" said Mr. Cates, who was named co-manager in April 1994. **********Mr. Hawkins, Mr. Cates and a staff of three equity analysts dispense with usual stock measures like price-to-earnings ratios and price-to-book ratios. They prefer other yardsticks: a company's free cash flow, its value if liquidated and the prices that have been paid for comparable businesses. **********Of these, free cash flow is the most important. \"It is the determinant of a company's value,\" Mr. Hawkins said. Longleaf takes reported net earnings and adds back what accounting standards have taken out -- depreciation, depletion, amortization and deferred taxes -- and then subtracts necessary capital spending. **********Accountants can really snip off a company's value, Mr. Hawkins said. General Foods, for example, once carried popular brand names like Jell-O on its books at about $300 million. When Philip Morris acquired General Foods, those assets were revalued at more than $4 billion. **********Companies that don't throw off a lot of cash, but have hidden assets in the form of land, minerals or other property, are assigned a value based on what they would bring if liquidated. The Horsham Corporation, a Toronto holding company and a Longleaf favorite, owns 20 percent of American Barrick Resources. Horsham carries the company on its books \"at a historical, ridiculous number,\" Mr. Cates said. \"That's another accounting mistake we look for.\" **********LONGLEAF'S investment adviser, Southeastern Asset Management, of which Mr. Hawkins is chairman and Mr. Cates is president, has an extensive collection of corporate sales data, which can be used to estimate a company's ability to generate revenues. The managers bought Knight-Ridder, a newspaper company with a monopoly in 29 markets, after studying such numbers as what other acquirers have been willing to pay for each newspaper subscriber and for each dollar in newspaper revenue in single-paper markets. **********After a financial analysis, the managers burrow in on a company and look for managers who can put capital to work. The Washington Post Company, a big Longleaf holding, is using cash to buy back 10 percent of its shares. Frank Cahouet, chief executive of Mellon Bank, impressed Longleaf by using excess cash to buy two asset management concerns, the Boston Company and Dreyfus. **********When Mr. Hawkins and Mr. Cates identify a likely prospect, they pay a visit, the first of many sessions if they decide to invest. Just ask Quaker Oats, Longleaf's biggest stake right now. \"We've probably met with them in person at least three times in the last 10 months or so,\" said Margaret Eichman, vice president of investor relations at Quaker. \"They've had meetings with our senior executives and sat down with the chairman to talk long-term strategy.\" **********Many fund managers claim to do intensive research on companies and their management, but Ms. Eichman says she mostly hears from Wall Street analysts. **********For confirmation of the managers' success, just look at the holdings that have either doubled in market value in a short time or been acquired at a big premium. The fund built a big position in Gerber Products in 1993, when the stock was trading at $25. Longleaf's managers reckoned it was worth $48. Last year Sandoz paid $53 a share for the company. **********In 1992, the managers began buying General Cinema (later Harcourt General) at $17 to $22, gradually building it up to more than 10 percent of the portfolio. While the managers are content to wait years for Wall Street to confirm their judgment -- portfolio turnover was zero in the first quarter of this year -- that happened with General Cinema in eight months: the shares soared to $38, prompting Longleaf to sell. **********Observing Graham and Dodd's advice to avoid investments you don't understand, Longleaf shuns technology. It also avoids businesses that are hard to value because they are highly regulated, like utilities, telephone companies and banks. Automakers and airlines are forbidden too, for another reason. \"Companies that use more capital than they generate do not fall into our area of interest,\" Mr. Hawkins said. **********Few stocks meet the managers' high standards. The fund usually has no more than 35 stocks, a rather concentrated portfolio. Although this seems to defy the mutual fund rationale, which is to diversify, Longleaf's team views it as an advantage. \"You can be adequately diversified with fewer than 20 names,\" Mr. Hawkins said. Other advantages are that the fund buys only the managers' best ideas and that a single stock can lift the entire portfolio. **********FINANCIAL planners have long been big Longleaf promoters. Richard K. Hammel, a planner in Nashville, Tenn., says his typical client has been investing in the fund since 1990 and has put 13 percent of total assets there. The fund usually accounts for the client's entire allotment of big-capitalization growth stocks. \"It's done unusually well, even in poor times,\" he said. **********Individual investors have flocked to the fund in recent months, as returns have surged and its minimum investment has fallen to $10,000 from $50,000. (Discount brokers can get an investor in for $2,000.) Assets nearly doubled last year and nearly doubled again this year, to $1.3 billion. **********Such growth is a matter of concern to Mark F. Spangler, a financial adviser in Seattle, who said the fund is his clients' largest equity holding. As the fund has grown, he said, its managers have drifted to bigger companies. \"They are not continuing to buy the securities that made them successful in the past,\" he said, adding that he has urged the managers to close the fund. **********Mr. Hawkins conceded that the fund is now sitting on about 20 percent cash, a relatively high level and nearly three times the average for equity funds these days. The proceeds of the Labatt stock sale, rather than new money, are largely responsible, he said. **********The fund invests in the same companies as its parent, Southeastern, which has grown at a more modest rate to just under $5 billion today. Given that the fund is just a small piece of the assets under management, the growth is not as steep as it seems at first glance, Mr. Hawkins said. \"Our research rules haven't changed,\" he said. \"We're not all of a sudden a different fund.\" But sharp growth inevitably alters a fund that concentrates on a handful of stocks, making it harder to take big stakes in smaller concerns. The average market capitalization of the companies Longleaf owns is $3.3 billion, Mr. Hawkins said, and the median is $1.5 billion. He is aware of the growth concern, but says it is not a problem now. \"Once we think it becomes an issue, we'll be the first to recommend closing\" the fund, he said, adding that he doesn't foresee that happening in the near future."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/03/business/company-news-texaco-to-cut-its-work-force-by-another-1500.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-10-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 131, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TEXACO TO CUT ITS WORK FORCE BY ANOTHER 1,500", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; TEXACO TO CUT ITS WORK FORCE BY ANOTHER 1,500", "body_text": " **********Texaco Inc. said yesterday that it expected to post a charge of $55 million against earnings for the third quarter to cut its work force by an additional 1,500 people.

Bally Gaming was not accused of any wrongdoing. **********\"Bally Gaming's business decisions, particularly in Louisiana, have drawn innuendo and allegations of organized crime's involvment in gaming,\" said Bernard Murphy, a spokesman for Bally Entertainment. \"This has resulted in confusion as to Bally Entertainment's involvement in those ill-conceived decisions.\" **********In a interview last week, Daniel Horgan, a lawyer for Bally Gaming, said that company executives had done nothing wrong in Louisiana and that any disputes arising from the incident between Bally Entertainment and its former subsidiary had been resolved. **********\"We are surprised by the filing of this lawsuit,\" Mr. Horgan said. \"It is unwarranted and we plan to fight it.\" **********Starting in 1991, Bally Entertainment, which has its headquarters in Chicago and operates casinos in Atlantic City and in Las Vegas, Nev., began to spin off control of Bally Gaming, which is based in Las Vegas. At the time, Richard Gillman, a former Bally Entertainment executive, became chairman of Bally Gaming. He and Arthur M. Goldberg, the chairman of Bally Entertainment, have previously clashed over such issues as their management styles. **********In January, the president of the Louisiana Economic Development and Gaming Corporation, a state agency, denied Bally Gaming a permit to sell equipment to a Harrah's casino being built in New Orleans on the ground that company officials had allowed the company to become \"infiltrated\" by organized crime. **********But the agency's board later reversed the decision, siding with Federal prosecutors who described Bally Gaming as the \"victim\" in a scheme in which 17 suspected members of organized-crime families and associates from New Orleans and New York secretly controlled a distributor of Bally Gaming video-poker machines. **********All of those charged in the incident have denied wrongdoing and Bally Gaming was never a target or subject of the Federal inquiry. **********Separately, Alan J.

He is currently cooperating with Federal prosecutors. **********Mr. Murphy, the Bally Entertainment spokesman, said his company was particularly concerned because with the exception of Mr. Maiss, virtually all Bally Gaming executives involved in the Louisiana incident remain with the company. **********\"We are concerned that the same management structure is still in place,\" he said. **********Mr. Horgan, the Bally Gaming lawyer, said that disputes between the two companies had revolved around economic issues and that changes in Bally Gaming's managment structure had never been discussed during talks between the companies. \"The issue was never put on the table,\" Mr. Horgan said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/10/business/market-place-a-fund-s-risky-bet-on-labrador-mining.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Wyatt", "pub_date": "1995-05-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1160, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place; A Fund's Risky Bet on Labrador Mining", "print_headline": "Market Place; A Fund's Risky Bet on Labrador Mining", "body_text": " **********With the stock market setting record highs regularly, one of the year's biggest surprises is the performance of the Robertson Stephens Contrarian Fund, which is supposed to do well when the stock market is not. **********Nevertheless, the fund has gained more than 17 percent this year, most of it in the last month. That is barely behind this year's 18 percent rise in the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index, despite the fact that the Contrarian Fund owns stock in no technology companies, no medical or drug companies nor any other of the market's hottest-performing sectors. **********The Contrarian Fund does own, however, more than 2.8 million shares of Diamond Fields Resources, a Canadian mining company that apparently has struck pay dirt in a large deposit of nickel, copper and cobalt in Labrador, Newfoundland. Since announcing the discovery last November, Diamond Fields' shares, traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange, have soared more than 1,200 percent, to $54.625 (Canadian) from about $4 in early November. **********But investors who hope to cash in on the company's mineral discovery or the Contrarian Fund's performance should be wary of several potential pitfalls. Because of the big gain in the stock of Diamond Fields, the shares now account for more than 20 percent of the mutual fund's net assets. That is a big bet for any mutual fund, most of which rarely put more than a few percent of total assets in any one stock. But it is an especially huge bet on a company with no revenues, no earnings and a rather thinly traded stock. **********Diamond Fields Resources has attracted remarkable attention not only because of the apparent quality of the mining discovery. The company's co-chairman and largest shareholder, Robert M. Friedland, is a well-known Canadian stock promoter, some of whose previous projects left outside investors holding the bag. **********In fact, the Contrarian Fund itself got hurt last year by another of Mr. Friedland's companies, Vengold Inc. The value of the fund's 2.1 million shares of Vengold stock plummeted last summer when the prospects for the company's Venezuelan gold mine failed to meet initial projections. Another company related to Mr. Friedland, Galactic Resources Ltd., collapsed in late 1992, a couple of years after the Environmental Protection Agency began an investigation of the company's environmentally unfriendly mining practices in Colorado. **********The Contrarian Fund's bet on Vengold was a significant contributor to its dismal performance last year, when it lost 5.5 percent of its value, making it a bad performer in a bad year for stock funds, even though as a contrarian fund its purpose was to do better. **********The Contrarian Fund came closer to its stated purpose in the first quarter of this year. Its heavy investments in precious metals, real estate and oil and gas companies, as well as misguided bets that stocks of technology companies and other high fliers would fall, held the Contrarian Fund to a mere 1.2 percent gain -- far behind the 9.6 percent return of the S.& P. 500. **********But a frenzy of speculation surrounding the latest venture of Diamond Fields Resources has brought the Contrarian Fund's net asset value roaring back -- albeit only to its peak of a year ago, when Vengold shares were soaring. **********The prospects of Diamond Fields appear to be better than Vengold's, based on preliminary mining data analyzed so far. The newly discovered nickel deposits, near Voisey Bay on Canada's Atlantic coast, could yield more than 30 million metric tons of high-grade nickel, copper and cobalt, according to Ken Andrews, director of the mineral lands division of the Newfoundland and Labrador Department of Natural Resources. Reflecting that potential, the Teck Corporation, a large Canadian mining company, bought three million Diamond Fields shares for $108 million (Canadian) last month. The Canadian dollar is worth 73.6 cents in United States currency. **********But several obstacles are likely to delay construction and commercialization of a mine for several years, Mr. Andrews said. The area to be developed lies in the annual migration routes of caribou, ducks and geese, is home to several endangered species, including the harlequin duck, and serves large populations of birds of prey. **********In addition, two groups of native inhabitants, the Labrador Inuit Association and the Innu Nation, claim the area as part of their native lands, containing sacred burial sites. **********Environmental assessments and negotiations with the Eskimo and Indian tribes must be completed before any mining begins -- and then, mining activities will have to be scheduled around the fierce winter, which freezes the region solid for six months of every year. Edward L. Mercaldo, executive vice president of Diamond Fields Resources, said that while the project at Voisey Bay would likely use open-pit mining methods, it had hired an environmental consultant to advise it. And the company is in discussions with the native inhabitants, he said, about the project's potential impact on them. **********Diamond Fields Resources is in talks with several companies about a joint venture for long-term development of the site but it has yet to sign up a partner. Investors in Diamond Fields Resources do not appear to be concerned by any of those potential impediments. The recent run-up in the price of the company's 26.8 million shares has pushed their market value to $1.5 billion. But as of of Dec. 31, Diamond Fields Resources had a net worth of only $30.2 million. **********And while the Contrarian Fund is sitting on huge paper profits in its Diamond Fields shares -- which it bought for $5 to $6 (Canadian) apiece -- the fund has shown no inclination to cash in even a part of its investment. If it does, its sale order could unhinge the stock, which does not trade in large volumes and therefore is subject to big price swings. In addition, there is not much stock available to trade, because company insiders and Robertson Stephens together control more than half the shares. Paul Stephens, manager of the Contrarian Fund, declined to comment about the fund's holding. **********But clearly the fund wants to warn shareholders about its precarious position: Since April 27, every Contrarian Fund prospectus sent out by Robertson Stephens carries a special sticker noting that its Diamond Fields Resources investment accounts for more than 20 percent of the value of the fund. \"As a result,\" the warning states, \"a decline in the stock price of Diamond Fields Resources would have a significant adverse effect on the net asset value of the fund.\" In other words, caveat emptor."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/24/business/media-press-legacy-of-a-dead-newspaper-a-bottom-line-vocabulary.html": {"writer_name": "William Glaberson", "pub_date": "1995-07-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1029, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Legacy of a dead newspaper: A bottom-line vocabulary.", "print_headline": "MEDIA: PRESS; Legacy of a dead newspaper: A bottom-line vocabulary.", "body_text": " **********IF Mark H. Willes did not exist, the newspaper industry would have invented him. **********Two months ago, Mr. Willes said he had read New York Newsday once in his life -- when he was being considered to run Times Mirror, the company that published the paper for 10 years and vowed to stick with it forever. But Mr. Willes did not hesitate to close the paper on July 16, during his sixth week as chief executive. New York Newsday, he said, did not seem likely to earn an \"appropriate rate of return.\" **********That corporate-speak was not the kind of language newspaper publishers used to use when they closed papers. And that, perhaps, was the larger significance of the events in New York City, of the sweeping cost-reduction program at the company's flagship paper, The Los Angeles Times, and of the broad financial moves in Times Mirror's other businesses that were announced last week. **********Mr. Willes, a former General Mills executive, may now represent more clearly than anyone else the vast changes sweeping through the American newspaper industry. **********The New Yorker magazine said last week that Mr. Willes's arrival \"seemed to represent an encroaching soullessness.\" At a news conference last week, Mr. Willes kept talking about the business of publishing newspapers in the terminology of a chief financial officer. Newspapers were \"core businesses,\" he said, and shrinkage of papers' news staffs amounted to \"refocusing\" of those businesses. In the course of breaking some journalists' hearts in New York, he explained that \"we must get our cost base in line.\" **********But whatever the journalists said, one truth spoke louder than all their disappointment: The stock of Times Mirror went up on the news that one of its newspapers had died. **********In the past, when publishers closed newspapers, they sometimes talked about the pain. They noted the tragedy of voices silenced and wondered aloud whether there was some way to continue serving their cities. The Tribune Company, for instance, as bottom-line oriented a newspaper company as there is, remained entangled in New York City for more than a decade after it first said it wanted to sell The Daily News. **********This time, it happened with breakneck speed. There was Mr. Willes's lunch in Melville, L.I., where the paper is based, the helicopter ride, the tour of the New York newsroom and then the order to shut down. **********Times Mirror's stock price had been down and in the end there was no more complicated explanation for why New York Newsday had to die. **********When newspapers were minting money with high profit margins in the mid-1980's, the fact that many of them had sold their stock to the public seemed nearly incidental. But now, even at the premier newspaper companies founded by families that cared about journalism, business conditions are more difficult and an uncertain future is breathing down the necks of publishers. **********The stock market demands quarterly profit improvement. For public companies, there is no time to wait for long-term investments to pay off. **********Some publishers still talk about their various constituencies beyond the shareholders: advertisers, readers and perhaps even the democratic system that depends on newspapers. **********But when they talk that way, recent events at Times Mirror have shown, they may not be dealing in the real world. Murray Kempton wrote in his last column for New York Newsday that \"there cannot be much health left in a social order where corporations can clamorously proclaim a failure on Friday with entire assurance that therefore their stock will go up on Monday.\" **********Perhaps not. But Mr. Willes was not hired to worry about social order. He was hired to get the stock price up. And he did it. **********The stock market, that amorphous entity that provides the capital for business, does not like to worry about businesses that are struggling with such obstructions as the old-fashioned strike that has paralyzed the Detroit newspapers since earlier this month. **********When they went public, newspaper companies made a bargain of sorts with the market. In exchange for capital, the newspapers essentially agreed to behave more like companies that make shoes or ball bearings. They would have to live, or die, in the survival-of-the-fittest world. **********There have always been cycles in the newspaper business, of course, and shortcomings in the papers themselves. In all the sad obituaries of New York Newsday, in fact, maybe there was too little mention of the paper's flaws. **********It was not respectful to say it last week, but some journalists had always complained that New York Newsday seemed too slow-paced for the city and too confused about its identity. And when the other New York tabloids were on the ropes two or three years ago, Newsday's publishers did not seem to have the instinct to go for the jugular. **********But last week, some of those who remembered when The Los Angeles Times first began to expand as a company several decades ago recalled that the entire purpose of buying other newspapers -- indeed, of buying Newsday in the first place -- was to provide a cushion to protect any one of its papers from the consequences of mistakes and bad breaks. **********Other large newspapers have sought similar cushions. Under that concept, the corporation as a whole might have supported a fledgling New York City newspaper until the paper could support itself. **********Over time, a big corporation grew around the business of putting out newspapers. And then, some of Times Mirror veterans said last week, it seemed that the imperatives of being a big corporation took over and obscured the original idea that the point of the whole enterprise was to put out and protect good papers. **********\"The tail is wagging the dog,\" said Kenneth Reich, who has been a reporter at The Los Angeles Times for 30 years. **********Or perhaps what Mr. Reich and his colleagues really meant was that it seemed that Times Mirror could no longer afford to have a chief executive who cared too much about newspapers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/11/world/yeltsin-calls-for-talks.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Specter", "pub_date": "1995-08-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 433, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Yeltsin Calls for Talks", "print_headline": "Yeltsin Calls for Talks", "body_text": " **********Eager for a central mediating role in the widening Balkan war, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia called again today for an international peace conference to be held here under his direction. **********At the same time, though, he warned that further Croatian aggression against Serbs could force Russia to abandon unilaterally the international sanctions that have been imposed on what is left of Yugoslavia: Serbia and Montenegro. **********Mr. Yeltsin met today in the Kremlin with President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia to discuss the war. He ratcheted up his criticism of the recent offensive by Roman Catholic Croatia, which has close ties with the West, against rebel Serbs within its borders. The Serbs have longtime ties with Russia and share its Eastern Orthodox religion. **********\"I renew my offer to hold a summit of leading states with the participation of the warring sides,\" Mr. Yeltsin said after the meeting today, to which he also had invited President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, who refused to come. He added that \"Russia is ready to organize direct discussions between the leaders of the three states\" -- Yugoslavia, Croatia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. **********\"It is time to relieve Yugoslavia of the burden of sanctions,\" Mr. Yeltsin said. \"Further delays in solving this issue could trigger unilateral action by Russia.\" The sanctions were imposed on Yugoslavia to discourage its support of Bosnian Serbs in their drive to capture territory in Bosnia. **********His offer to be host of a summit mweeting will almost certainly be rejected, and his threat will add to the tensions in the region. Mr. Yeltsin is seen strongly as an ally of the Serbs, not as a neutral party. As he has done before, he again denounced the Croatian military's actions of the last week. \"Fast and firm steps are needed to contradict the logic of action by force,\" he said. **********Mr. Yeltsin has a tricky game to play here. Nationalists at home have been vocal in arguing that Russia should do more for Serbia. Yet the West finds such talk belligerently reminiscent of the cold war. Still, parliamentary elections are to be held in Russia this December, and a presidential election is scheduled for next year. He cannot ignore the critics at home to appease allies abroad. **********Mr. Yeltsin issued a five-point peace plan today that basically called for cessation of all hostilities and the start of immediate negotiations. **********Not surprisingly, Mr. Milosevic said the meeting in the Kremlin went well.

After four years, the wall between Croats and Serbs came down in this ravaged town, allowing the first, tentative meeting of two estranged and suspicious communities. **********It was early in the afternoon when Hrvoje Sarinic, a senior Croatian official, drove into what was, until its surrender Thursday evening, the Serbian-held half of Pakrac. He smiled, held out his hand to a Serb named Obrad Ivanovic, and ventured, \"You look well.\" **********Mr. Ivanovic, a corpulent figure and the former Mayor of the Serbian side of Pakrac, responded, \"You mean well-rounded.\" The Serb and the Croat laughed, a little too heartily. **********Beneath the momentary jocularity, the tension was evident. Mr. Sarinic's visit effectively marked the end of a lightning Croatian offensive that swept this week through a pocket in western Slavonia that has been held by separatist Serbs since the Croatian war of 1991. The successful attack has underscored the divisions and growing military vulnerability of the Serbs. **********Until today, Mr. Ivanovic was a sworn enemy of Croatia bent on upholding the 1991 division of Pakrac (pronounced PAH-krahts), one of the largest towns in the western Slavonia enclave, and the right of Croatian Serbs to live in their own-self styled republic, called the Krajina. **********\"The Republic of Croatia wishes to reassure you,\" said Mr. Sarinic, the chief aide to Croatia's President, Franjo Tudjman. \"You will be citizens of this country. There must be no difference between you and me. You must have your own home, your own fields, your own cattle -- nothing must happen to you. We must break this segregation and so stop people being killed.\" **********Mr. Ivanovic replied: \"I hope you will be able to deliver on what you promise. People here are afraid.\" **********It was a meeting of the kind that will have to occur throughout the lands of the former Yugoslavia if Serbs, Croats and Muslims are ever to bury their differences and end their wars. **********In one sense, the conversation was straightforward enough: two middle-aged men who lived until 1991 in a country called Yugoslavia chatting in their shared language. **********In another, it was immensely complex: two strangers trying to reach across the gulf caused by the Croatian attack this week, four years of division and hostile propaganda, a brutal war in 1991 and a history, stretching back to Yugoslavia's effective creation in 1918, of violent clashes between Croats and Serbs. **********The cost of this legacy was evident in the backdrop to the meeting on a Pakrac street corner. Buildings destroyed during the fighting of 1991, when Serbs fought to resist joining a newly independent Croatian state. Empty houses. Streets peopled only by Croatian police officers and soldiers moving among Serbian women, many of them worried about the fates of missing husbands and sons. **********Just over 1,000 Serbian men were rounded up by Croatian forces in the Pakrac area on Thursday evening and taken to three Croatian towns -- Bjelovar, Varazdin and Pozega -- for questioning. **********Despite a rebuke on Thursday from the United Nations Security Council to Croatia for that action, it appeared today from Red Cross and European Union reports that the Serbs were being treated well. Gunter Baron, a European Union monitor, said, \"They are being correctly treated as prisoners of war.\" **********There was no evidence in Pakrac of the looting by Croatian \"governmental and quasi-governmental organs\" that was criticized Thursday by the British representative at the United Nations. Indeed, the Croatian police were protecting the cars of Serbs for what they said would be eventual return to their owners. **********The Croatian Government, which has said all Serbian men who are not war criminals will be returned to their homes within days, today called the British statement \"tendentious and dangerous.\" **********If the Serbs remaining in Pakrac appeared satisfied with their treatment, they were clearly very worried about the men who have been taken away. \"What matters most at the moment is that the men should be brought back,\" Mr. Ivanovic said. \"It will be impossible to speak about the future until they have returned.\" **********A Serbian woman, Mira Resan, was sobbing uncontrollably. Her 17-year-old son, Ljubica, went out to visit some friends Thursday afternoon. At that moment, Croatian shelling started up -- either in response to a Serbian attack or in an attempt to force a final surrender. **********The boy has not been seen since. Mrs. Resan lost her other son, Milan, when he stepped on a mine in 1993. **********\"I've no idea where my boy is,\" she said. \"I don't know if he's dead or if the Croats have captured him.\" **********The dismay of Serbs in western Slavonia has clearly been reinforced by their sense of abandonment by their leadership in Krajina's stronghold, the town of Knin. Mr. Ivanovic said he was particularly angry with Milan Martic, the self-styled president of the Krajina Serbs. **********\"Mr. Martic left us high and dry,\" he said. \"He did not defend us. And then, when I was trying to negotiate a way out of this mess, he encouraged some Serbs to go on shooting at the Croats -- a policy that only brought more suffering and loss of life.\" **********The Croatian attack has revealed debilitating differences among the Serbs of Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia. United at the time of Yugoslavia's dissolution in their desire to go on living in a single state, they now appear deeply divided between a bellicose and a moderate faction. **********Serbs in Pakrac said they support a moderate, Borislav Mikelic, who is the self-styled prime minister of the Krajina and close to Serbia's President, Slobodan Milosevic. **********Mr. Martic, the leader of the faction favoring all-out war against the Croats, is close to the Bosnian Serbs' leader, Radovan Karadzic, whom he met on Thursday in Knin. **********Mr. Sarinic said the Croatian Government would do everything to strengthen the hand of the Serbian moderates. \"I am here to cool things down,\" he declared. \"But after what has happened, I am aware that it will take a generation to heal the wounds.\" **********Mr. Ivanovic, the former Mayor of the now-conquered part of Pakrac, shook his head. \"We are still in shock,\" he said. \"Can we Serbs now become part of Croatia?

And while there was no evidence that the soldiers were doing more than patrolling, the troop movements were seen by Government critics as violating Mr. Zedillo's public orders to the army last week \"not to carry out any action that could provoke confrontations.\" **********\"The physical conditions are not there for a dialogue,\" the Zapatistas said in a crudely written communique that was dated Feb. 17 and published in Mexican newspapers today.  \"An indispensable requirement for the renewal of the dialogue is the departure of the federal army from the Lacandon rain forest, that they return to the original positions they held on Feb. 8, 1995.\" **********Officials of the Defense Ministry declined to comment today on the reports of troop movements or on a series of new allegations that army soldiers have beaten or tortured peasants during their sweep through areas formerly held by the insurgents. **********In its first comprehensive report since the offensive began, the National Commission of Human Rights largely failed to confirm earlier allegations of abuses by the army in its occupation of the rebel zones made by human rights groups and the Zapatistas. **********The commission said it had found no evidence to support the rebels' claim of aerial bombing near two Chiapas hamlets, noting only that some peasants in one of the areas reported hearing explosions around the same time. But it also appeared that the commission's investigators reached few of the remote parts of the Lacandon rain forest to which the peasants who support the Zapatistas have fled and from which reporters have gathered accounts of mistreatment by army patrols. **********As has often been the case in the past, the commission provided more evidence of torture by the police. In the most important case, that of seven accused rebels captured at a safe house in the Gulf Coast state of Veracruz just before the Chiapas offensive, it said forensic doctors found evidence of torture on four of five men detained. **********The report, which also noted claims of electric-shock torture by the two women who were arrested, directly contradicted an earlier report in which an investigator from the federal Attorney General's Office absolved the police of any abuses. But the commission was vague about which police or prison officials might be responsible for the prisoners' mistreatment. **********The rights commission also supported claims by other accused rebels who said they had been pressed into signing confessions that they had not even been allowed to read. Along with new questions about the reported defection of a rebel commander, Salvador Morales Garibay, the commission's report raised further doubts about the Government's depiction of the rebel movement. **********At a briefing for foreign reporters on Friday, a senior official of the Interior Ministry said Mr. Morales had been one of four top commanders of the Zapatista force until he had turned to the army out of anger at the leadership of the rebel leader known as Subcommander Marcos. **********It was Mr. Morales, in court testimony on Feb. 8, who provided by far the most damaging information on the insurgents: that they had been financed in part by a leftist bus drivers' union in Mexico City, that they had received support in Nicaragua from the longtime intelligence chief of the Sandinista Front, and that Bishop Ruiz had known of their activities long before their uprising on Jan. 1, 1994. **********But while failing to provide any confirmation of Mr. Morales's assertions, the Interior Ministry has also failed to produce Mr. Morales. The senior interior ministry official had said he was in jail, but that was denied today by the Attorney General, Mr. Lozano. **********In a complaint to an independent Mexican human rights group, relatives of Mr. Morales also said that he had \"disappeared,\" but that he had called them after his reported testimony to deny that it was true."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/26/business/international-business-a-hostile-bid-russias-first-ends-in-a-deal.html": {"writer_name": "Selina Williams", "pub_date": "1995-07-26", "snippet": "One of Russia's largest banks today abandoned its effort to take control of the Red October Chocolate Factory, in what had been the first hostile takeover bid in post-Communist Russia.\n\nBut a compromise deal is in the works to give the bidder, Ban...", "word_count": 432, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;\nA Hostile Bid, Russia's First, Ends in a Deal For Two Seats", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;\nA Hostile Bid, Russia's First, Ends in a Deal For Two Seats", "body_text": " **********One of Russia's largest banks today abandoned its effort to take control of the Red October Chocolate Factory, in what had been the first hostile takeover bid in post-Communist Russia. **********But a compromise deal is in the works to give the bidder, Bank Menatep, two seats on the board of Red October, which had fought the bid. **********The failure of the takeover offer, which expired today, came five days after Red October announced a poison-pill defense, which would require the company to compensate shareholders, workers and management if an outside investor acquires at least 40 percent of the shares without board approval.

Even though people here have grown accustomed to violence, this newest wave of killings has left them shaken. **********The way the local government appears to have responded to peasant violence with even more violence has also raised concerns about the ability of other local governments to handle rising levels of discontent and crime caused by the country's worsening economic conditions. **********In less than two weeks, 34 people have been slain in Guerrero. The violence started on June 28 when state police agents fired on leftist peasants going to a political rally near Coyuca de Benitez. The authorities say the peasants attacked first; the peasants say they were ambushed. In all, 17 peasants died. **********Late on the night of July 5, the 12 members of the Salgado family, on their way back from a fishing trip, were attacked on a dirt road, forced to lie in a rough ditch and killed. The sole survivor says the killers had the appearance of police officers; the authorities say the attack was the product of a family feud. **********Then, on July 7, a convoy of police traveling the back roads in the northeastern section of the state near the town of Cualac was ambushed. Five officers were killed in what authorities say may have been some attempt at revenge for either of the two earlier incidents. **********\"Sure we're afraid, wouldn't you be?\" said Ramiro Andres Flores, a 50-year-old laborer who lives not far from the ditch where the Salgado family was killed. He got off his burro to show reporters where the bodies had been found. The ditch was marked with a dirty T-shirt, and on the spots where the men, women and a 2-year-old boy were forced to lie before being shot there were small bunches of purple flowers and dark patches where the grass was mixed with blood. **********\"There is no law here in the mountains -- that's why so many bad things have happened here,\" Mr. Flores said. \"The only law around here is money.\" **********Even though the state has a dark heritage of political and criminal violence, the latest bloodletting in Guerrero has put Governor Ruben Figueroa Alcocer on the defensive. Leaders of the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party, which has pockets of strength in the state, are pressing him to resign on the grounds that the state has become ungovernable. President Ernesto Zedillo has so far resisted demands that he intervene, saying it is the state, and not the federal Government, that has jurisdiction. **********Mr. Figueroa, who belongs to the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, has asserted that the police who fired on the peasants in Coyuca de Benitez were defending themselves from an initial attack by the peasants. There is even a videotape, taken by the police, that appears inconclusive but that the authorities say shows the peasants attacked first. **********Still, 10 policemen have been arrested in the case, and local photographers assert that the police put guns in the hands of dead peasants to make it appear that they had fired first. And the leftist Mayor of a nearby town says that on the day before the shooting, Governor Figueroa told the directors of a local hospital to be prepared for something big. **********The Miguel Agustin Pro Juarez Human Rights Center, a Jesuit organization, blames the state's long tradition of iron-handed control and corruption for having created \"an atmosphere of confrontation and general violence that has resulted in those people with the least protection being the most threatened.\" **********Nestor Inocenzia Marquez, the Mayor of San Miguel Totolapan, played down the violence. \"What's happened in Guerrero over the last two weeks,\" he said, \"is just coincidence, awful of course, but because of the state's reputation people make something bigger out of it.\" **********Indeed, down at the local tavern and on the streets of San Miguel, life seemed to have returned to normal just a day after the mass burial. **********\"We are accustomed to the violence,\" said Placido, a 33-year-old policeman in San Miguel who was afraid to give his last name. \"What happened out there on the road was between families, revenge, you know? It happens all the time here, especially up in the mountains, where even we police don't go.\" **********In those same mountains a guerrilla movement arose in the late 1960's that, until the Zapatista uprising in Chiapas state in January 1994, was the most significant revolt against government authority in Mexico since the Revolution of 1910. **********The movement, led by a former teacher named Lucio Cabanas, became known throughout Mexico on May 30, 1974, when it kidnapped Ruben Figueroa Figueroa, then a gubernatorial candidate and father of the current Governor. Army troops freed the elder Mr. Figueroa, who went on to become one of Guerrero's most repressive governors. Mr. Cabanas was killed by soliders a few months later. **********\"What we're seeing from this current government is a return to the old way of looking at things,\" said Marcelino Diaz de Jesus, an Indian leader in Guerrero. \"Figueroa the father was one of the most murderous governors Guerrero has had, and his son is proving himself to be very brutal as well.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/15/business/international-business-company-fined-in-libya-trade.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-07-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 128, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Company Fined In Libya Trade", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; Company Fined In Libya Trade", "body_text": " **********The Halliburton Company said today that it would pay $3.81 million in fines and plead guilty to charges that between 1987 and 1990 it had violated a Federal law banning trade with Libya. **********The oilfield service company admitted it had wrongly shipped spare parts for drilling equipment, trucks and specialized well evaluation gear. **********It said the tools, no longer in Libya, were in possession of a Libyan affiliate of the company. **********Halliburton said the judgment would not affect its ability to export products, services or technology.

Mr. Clinton has probably done more for American businesses operating abroad than any President in postwar history, turning the Commerce Department into a forceful advocate for American companies, pressing foreign governments to send business their way and raising trade issues to the top of the foreign policy agenda. But as the election approaches, Mr. Clinton also wants to protect his left flank after alienating many in the human rights community. **********The chief problem is that America's allies, who are also its biggest economic competitors, have no such codes, and companies in those nations stand to sweep in business that the United States passes by. That issue was highlighted earlier this month when the Clinton Administration barred Conoco Inc. from entering a billion-dollar development deal with Iran. Now French oil companies are negotiating with Iran to replace Conoco. **********It is unclear how many businesses will abide by the Administration's proposed code. Some executives reached last week said that if the wording is sufficiently weak or vague and appears unlikely to affect their competitiveness, there will probably be widespread adherence to what the Administration calls \"a model of behavior.\" **********But already there are signs that the final draft has so many compromises that it will disappoint the human rights groups it was trying to satisfy in the first place. **********Details of the code have not been disclosed, but Administration officials acknowledge that many provisions governing the rights of foreign workers have been weakened in deference to the commercial realities of competing with the Japanese and Europeans. **********People who have seen parts of the code say its strongest statements refer to bans on child labor and the use of prison laborers, actions that most large companies already say they oppose. The code will have deliberately vague language urging companies to respect the right of workers to organize and stops short of asking them to encourage such activities. The fear, several Administration officials said, is that such activity could be viewed in many nations -- including China -- as an effort to undermine national laws that strictly regulate labor activities. **********The principles will be described to corporate executives, members of Congress and human rights groups by the White House on Monday. But the code will make no mention of paying a \"fair wage\" to workers in developing countries and emerging markets, and it sidesteps the question of how companies should treat workers who are prosecuted for engaging in political dissent in countries like China. **********Nonetheless, the code is the biggest effort by the United States in two decades to create a minimum standard of conduct abroad for American companies. The last such effort was the passage of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, which bars American companies from bribing officials of foreign governments. That act has been widely criticized by American executives in recent years, who contend that while it is well intentioned, it often places them at a competitive disadvantage when they are bidding against companies from countries without comparable laws. **********\"We're back to the same problem again,\" a senior Administration official said. \"This time we're juggling the interests of the business community and human rights, and discovering that it's an impossible balancing act.\" **********In a declaration issued at the time he made the decision to extend China's trade privileges, Mr. Clinton committed himself to increased broadcasts into China by Radio Free Asia and the Voice of America, more support for nongovernmental human rights groups operating in China and \"the development with American business leaders of a voluntary set of principles for business activity in China.\" **********Progress on the first two commitments has been minimal. When the Administration began drafting the code of conduct, the State Department argued that developing such a code only for businesses operating in China would further irritate relations between the two countries. So President Clinton's plan quickly evolved into the development of what Secretary of State Warren Christopher described to Congress last month as \"the promulgation of a worldwide standard for the conduct of American business, not focused primarily on China, but focused on the world as a whole.\" **********Many private companies already have codes of conduct for their operations abroad, including running-shoe manufacturers like Reebok and Nike, which have advertised their standards and used them as a selling point with American consumers. An Administration official who was deeply involved in drafting the new guidelines said that the White House reviewed several of the corporate codes and also looked at standards published by the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce, whose members have extensive manufacturing operations in China. **********But in the course of consultation with the Administration last year, several executives warned the White House that its early drafts of the code would place a burden on American companies that was not shared by Japanese and European companies -- especially if the code appeared to create a standard for some kind of minimum wage. **********\"I give them credit, because no other Administration has even attempted to do something like this,\" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, the Washington director of Human Rights Watch/Asia, which was formerly known as Asia Watch. \"But they waited too long, and the human rights situation in China has deteriorated\" since President Clinton decided to extend what in the trade community is called \"most favored nation\" status to Beijing, he said. **********\"If the President had pulled C.E.O.'s into the Oval Office last May when he issued the M.F.N. decision,\" Mr. Jendrzejczyk said, \"he might have generated broader business support.

The building lies near the New York border and Westchester County Airport. Tenneco Gas will remain in Houston, and the staff for payroll, accounting and other corporate services will move to the Woodlands, a northern suburb. **********Dana G.

Until last year, the United States had a ban on official contacts with Sinn Fein, condemning it as a terrorist organization that condoned bombings and killings by the I.R.A. **********\"The President of this United States did the right thing once again when he accorded Sinn Fein equality of treatment,\" Mr. Adams told the crowd. **********\"What we want to do in the capital of this United States is to put forward our information, to put forward our analysis, to put forward the situation which we have a mandate to protect,\" he said. \"And we're not asking the United States Government to come in and interfere in our affairs. Nor are we asking them to interfere in their relationship with Britain. We're simply asking for a level playing pitch.\" **********To further underscore his new status, Mr. Adams announced that Sinn Fein would open an office in Washington on Tuesday. **********Yesterday's event was the first in his weeklong visit to the United States, several days of which will be spent in New York. Mr. Adams, who has been granted a multiple-entry visa for three months, is expected to return to the United States several times during the coming months, a spokeswoman said. **********He is scheduled to meet this afternoon with Gov.

On Thursday, he plans to attend a St. Patrick's Day lunch for members of Congress in Washington. **********His visit to the White House on Friday, Clinton Administration officials said, will not be a diplomatic meeting, but will revolve around a reception, at which the honored guest will be Prime Minister John Bruton of Ireland. **********The significance of yesterday's fund-raising effort was more symbolic than financial, organizers said. The suggested donation was $20. **********\"People want to feel that they're participating in some way,\" said Larry Downes, president of Friends of Sinn Fein, the party's United States arm. \"And a lot of these folks would be priced out of a $200-a-head luncheon.\" **********Organizers estimated that more than $20,000 was raised yesterday. **********Before Mr. Adams was given permission to raise funds, I.R.A. supporters in the United States over the years had given tens of thousands to Noraid, an organization the Irish and British Governments said was funneling the cash to the I.R.A. **********Most of the people who packed the ballroom at the Tower View Center on Roosevelt Avenue yesterday were overwhelmingly supportive of Mr. Adams, and some had lined up more than an hour before the event was scheduled to begin. They were Irish and Irish-American, from Long Island, New Jersey, Westchester and New York City, elderly people who had lived in the United States for 40 years, and young people who had immigrated only recently. **********Some had just come to have a look at the man. They were joyous, even giddy, as many drank beer, smoked cigarettes and listened to a trio sing Irish songs, while they waited for Mr. Adams. **********\"If it wasn't for Gerry, there would never have be peace,\" said Alfred Meade, 22, who came from Dublin a week ago after being arrested for \"getting caught with guns and explosives.\" **********Others wanted reassurance that Mr. Adams would not concede too much to the British in trying to bring about peace talks.

It's the way people were killed, in front of their families, the blood on the ground, the children crying.\" **********Mr. Adams, in his 15-minute speech, sought to satisfy everyone, it seemed. **********He called for the removal of British troops in Northern Ireland and the freeing of Irish prisoners.

A job at a bank, good pay, prestige and opportunities for promotion. But he did something that once would have shocked many Japanese. **********He quit and took a job elsewhere. **********\"Ever since I was a college student, I wanted to do something related to U.S.-Japan relations,\" Mr. Sasaki said. So he found a job at Sony, in the international relations department. \"Sony,\" he said, \"made my dream come true.\" **********Mr. Sasaki, 31, is among the growing ranks of Japanese workers in this land of lifelong employment who have followed their dreams out the office door. While American workers, both the laid-off and the survivors, grapple with cutbacks, one in three Japanese workers willingly walks away from his job within the first 10 years of his career, according to the Japanese Institute of Labor, a private research organization. And many more are thinking about it. More than half of salaried Japanese workers say they would switch jobs or start their own business if a favorable opportunity arose, according to a survey by the Recruit Research Corporation. **********\"People's attitude toward changing jobs has markedly changed,\" said Torao Tanaka, editor in chief of B-ing, Japan's biggest recruitment magazine. \"In the past, we always had difficulty asking people who had changed jobs to appear for interviews, even if their new job was going well. They would feel so sorry or embarrassed for the company they left behind.\" **********But two recent economic developments have made Japanese workers, particularly younger people, increasingly mobile. As Japan's economy boomed in the mid-1980's, many expanding companies aggressively sought experienced workers as well as entry-level college seniors. Then, when the \"bubble\" economy burst in the early 1990's, the same corporations were forced to cast off many employees, through buyouts and dismissals. These trends -- midcareer hirings and midcareer dismissals -- had the same result: a weakened national attachment to one job for life. **********Sometimes, foreign influences further attenuate the old way. For many years, Akitaka Asaga, 38, was one of Toyota's \"most dedicated employees,\" he said. But when he went to business school in the United States, his outlook changed. \"School taught me that I really have to retrain myself as a specialist and otherwise I won't be able to survive in this world,\" he said. Toyota and other Japanese companies, however, shape people as generalists, not specialists. **********Now, Mr. Asaga works in his chosen field -- corporate finance -- at a Ford office near Tokyo. \"I had never thought that there was such a good company like Ford,\" he said. \"My hours are considerably shorter, and I get to set the pace of my work.\" **********But job-switching has its downside, too -- and it goes beyond the predictable risk that the new job won't pan out. **********\"Those who make lateral entries often face discrimination in promotion and other kinds of frustration,\" said Tatsuya Kubo, 37, a former Toyota employee who now works for a large securities company. Many Japanese companies, particularly large ones, \"tend to favor those who rise through the corporate ranks,\" he said. Japanese words like Junketsu-shugi (the principle of \"pure blood\") and Haenuki (true born) prove the point. According to Mr. Tanaka of B-ing magazine, the advantage stems from the valuable familiarity with company culture and a wide network of allies that longtime workers can acquire. **********A fickle reputation is another peril for Japanese job-changers. \"Recruiters of a company would frown upon anyone who changed jobs too frequently, said Naomiki Amano, a counselor at an employment agency run by the Government. \"They would question your personality.\" **********Of course, lifelong employment is hardly dead; it serves the companies and workers' needs in many ways. But mobility is on the upswing. Mika Ishida, 32, who had three different jobs before joining Sony five years ago, said her company had been very open to job-seekers with previous experience. And the numbers show it. About 40 percent of Sony's managers have worked elsewhere. **********And while that number is unusually high, it may not be long before other companies equal it, adopting the attitude of Akio Morita, Sony's retired chief executive. Mr. Morita \"used to say in his address to the new recruits that they should all have a dream,\" Ms. Ishida said, \"and if they find that it cannot be realized at Sony, they should consider leaving for a different job. Because after all, we have only one life to live.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/31/business/company-news-olsten-and-hooper-holmes-in-swap-transaction.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1995-05-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 107, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "OLSTEN AND HOOPER HOLMES IN SWAP TRANSACTION", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; OLSTEN AND HOOPER HOLMES IN SWAP TRANSACTION", "body_text": " **********The Olsten Corporation said yesterday that it was acquiring Nurse's House Call, the home health care business of Hooper Holmes Inc.

But the diplomat said the Government at the same time is determined to preserve order at all costs and is likely to move vigorously to prevent any small-scale political challenge from expanding into a large one. **********The new petition, entitled \"Draw Lessons From the Blood,\" certainly is more challenging in tone than the previous one this week. It seeks major revisions in the laws governing freedom of the press, freedom of association, guarantees of basic human rights and the establishment of a constitutional court. **********\"Looking over the whole process of the movement that culminated on June 4,\" it says, \"we think one of the most important reasons for this bloody tragedy is that the ruling authorities could not acknowledge and adapt to the global trend of openness, diversification and democracy and could not solve China's social problems through the process of democracy and the rule of law.\" **********\"Instead, it once again treated the citizens' acts of political participation with hostility and autocracy,\" the document says. **********The detention of Mr. Liu came just hours after the Government spokesman, Shen Guofang, told reporters that Chinese citizens have a right to petition their Government.

A journeyman metal worker, Mr. Koseki can craft a turbine blade or a shaft to a precision of less than the thickness of a human hair. He has also written books celebrating the Japanese metal-working artisan. But Mr. Koseki, 62, said such craftsmen were now a dying breed. **********In this city's Ota Ward, where he works, many of the small metal-working factories are falling victim to hard times and the soaring yen, leaving a feeling of helplessness, \"like a carp on a cutting board.\" His own employer has only eight workers left, down from 20 a few years ago. **********For all the focus on how the rising yen is hurting powerful exporters like Honda and Hitachi, the impact is far worse on the small, anonymous manufacturers supplying the parts to the brand-name giants. The small factories either cut the prices of their parts to help the big companies maintain their profits or they lose business when the bigger companies relocate factories offshore. **********Yet these small factories have been instrumental in making Japan Inc. what it is -- an efficient producer of high-quality goods. And as their numbers keep on dropping, there is growing fear that Japan is losing some of its fundamental manufacturing know-how and possibly its ability to produce new products in the future. **********National and local officials, as well as the companies themselves, are devising countermeasures. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry is offering loans as well as advice to small factories. **********In Ota Ward, the local government formed a special task force to come up with ways to preserve the factories. Tadao Kamiya, a ward official, said the goal was not to keep all the factories but rather a \"manufacturing minimum\" -- enough to insure that know-how gets passed to the next generation. One plan is for the ward to give loans to factories to help master craftsmen train younger workers. **********The ebbing of the manufacturing culture in Japan is being played out in Ota Ward, an area in southern Tokyo that is home to more than 7,000 small, mostly metal-working factories, 80 percent of them with fewer than 10 employees. These are not the direct suppliers to the big companies, but second- or third-tier ones. **********In the last decade, more than 2,000 factories have vanished from Ota Ward, driven out of business, or at least out of Tokyo, by land prices, recession, difficulties in recruiting workers and the rise of the yen. **********In one sense, Ota Ward is to metal working in Japan what Silicon Valley is to electronics in the United States. Just as Silicon Valley has the engineers, programmers and financiers who can join to create electronic products, so Ota Ward has a network of specialized workers to supply virtually any metal part, often quickly and in lots as small as one. **********The factories can share jobs, allowing them to accept bigger and more complex orders than any one shop could handle by itself. **********\"The high level of technology arises because these small factories complement one another,\" said Atsuhiko Takeuchi, a professor of geography at the Nippon Institute of Technology, near Tokyo. \"In that regard, this is the only place where such a concentration exists.\" **********Kuwashi Otomo, who owns a small grinding shop in Ota Ward, cited an instance of such industrial networking -- a complex valve that is part of a machine used to make computer chips in South Korea. Eight companies in Mr. Otomo's neighborhood teamed up to make the valve, with one doing the specialized welding, another the screw, and so on. **********Mr. Otomo said the valve could not yet be made in South Korea or other Asian nations with lower wages. The same is true, experts said, of many high-precision parts used in aviation, electric power generation and electronics equipment. **********But run-of-the-mill parts, like pins and screws, can be made offshore, and such work is leaving Japan. Mitsuhiro Seki, a professor at Senshu University, said that Japan was losing its \"full set\" industrial structure, in which it made virtually all components by itself, and would be more fully integrated with the economies of other Asian nations. **********American parts suppliers could also benefit as the big Japanese companies move more of their manufacturing -- of cars, machine tools and electronics -- to the United States. **********The Ricoh Company, the office equipment maker, is now importing 10 percent of its parts, from China and elsewhere, up from 2 percent a few years ago, although the heart of a copier machine, a specially coated aluminum cylinder, can still be made only in Japan. The company has urged its 350 local suppliers, one- tenth of whom are in Ota Ward, to adopt more sophisticated technology or face losing business. **********Takahide Kaneko, general manager of Ricoh's purchasing division, noted that salaries in China are one-tenth or one-fifteenth of those in Japan. Senior craftsmen in Ota Ward can make more than 5 million yen a year. In the last four months, the dollar equivalent of that has risen to $60,000 from $50,000. **********The pressures on small companies are heightened because many of them borrowed heavily during Japan's speculative boom of the late 1980's to buy new computerized machine tools, which can cost $100,000 apiece. **********\"At the peak I was boasting to people that debt is a barometer of your power -- it shows how creditworthy you are,\" said Norihide Fujita, 50, a factory owner. **********Mr. Fujita's company makes metal molds for one customer, Fujikura Ltd., which uses the molds to stamp out printed circuit boards. The boards are sold to another company making speedometers for Nissan cars. **********But in 1989 Fujikura moved part of its operations to Thailand, even studying Mr. Fujita's shop to set up its own metal mold operation there. **********Mr. Fujita's sales have dropped to 80 million yen, or about $1 million, from 140 million yen a few years ago. Since January, he said, four of his eight workers had quit. And these days Mr. Fujita can afford to pay only interest, not the principal, on his loans. **********\"Actually, we want to quit but we cannot because of the debt,\" Mr. Fujita said. \"Probably most of the factories in Ota Ward are in that situation.\" **********The constant pressure to cut costs has strained what is supposed to be a harmonious, long-term relationship between the big companies and their suppliers. **********Manufacturers are forcing the small companies to bid against one another, and suppliers who cannot meet demands for price reductions are losing business. Mr. Otomo, the grinding shop owner, said the big companies often unilaterally cut prices or changed the terms of an agreement. **********\"They say orally that an order will continue for a year,\" he said. \"It never continues for a year.\" **********Recruiting is another problem. In Ota Ward's heyday -- during Japan's high-growth years of the 1950's through the 1970's -- 15-year-old junior high school graduates known as \"golden eggs\" would arrive in Tokyo from the hinterlands and find work in metal shops. After they became skilled craftsmen, many would go into business for themselves. **********But nowadays, affluent and well-educated Japanese young people shun factory work. At Mr. Koseki's factory, the eight remaining employees are all more than 50 years old. Teiichi Matsuda, the factory owner, said he had given up trying to find young blood. So it is a matter of time before the factory shuts down. **********The real estate boom in the late 1980's created more problems. It forced some factories to move to outlying areas with cheaper rents. Some owners converted their factories to more lucrative apartments. (There are few zoning restrictions in Japan.) Since Ota Ward is in the middle of a big metropolis, defunct factories quickly give way to office buildings or shops. So the area has avoided the fate of Bridgeport, Conn., which turned into an urban basket case when its factories shut down. **********Masahito Ohma now manages an apartment house built on the site of the factory he closed in 1990. The factory, started by Mr. Ohma's father in 1951, made lenses and other camera parts but suffered as Japanese camera makers began buying parts from Taiwan and Southeast Asia. The company, which had 150 employees, could not meet the camera makers' demands to cut its prices 40 percent. **********\"When we said we could not cut prices further, orders stopped coming,\" Mr. Ohma said. \"At our peak we were making 5,000 lenses a month but it dropped to the 1,000 to 2,000 level. The most difficult thing in making the decision was that we felt so bad toward our workers.\" **********To survive, some companies are looking for products they can sell themselves, rather than continue solely as parts suppliers. Here, the networks in Ota Ward come in handy. Mr. Fujita's company and 10 others recently teamed up to develop a nozzle that when attached to a vacuum cleaner sucks the air out of plastic soft-drink bottles for recycling. **********Mr. Fujita said Ota Ward should try to advertise itself as a parts supplier to the world, not just Japan. \"It's so sad to just sit here and see the town losing factories,\" he said. \"We have to move.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/16/business/company-news-carson-pirie-may-raise-bid-for-younkers.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-06-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 113, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CARSON PIRIE MAY RAISE BID FOR YOUNKERS", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; CARSON PIRIE MAY RAISE BID FOR YOUNKERS", "body_text": " **********Carson Pirie Scott & Company said yesterday that it was willing to raise its bid for Younkers Inc. to $20 a share, or $179 million, if an agreement could be signed by July 1.

Such a sale is not needed to pay for the extra reserves, which Aetna executives said could be paid for from profits and the sale of bonds later this year. **********Not everyone is convinced that Aetna has solved its envirnomental problem, particularly since the company was the insurer in the 1970's and 1980's to many small businesses that are not part of the 1300 Superfund sites, and whose environmental costs remain unkown. **********Alan M.

Many African diplomats bitterly describe Mr. Compaore's support for Mr. Taylor as part of a French-inspired plan to limit Nigerian influence in Liberia. **********The result has been to frustrate a Nigerian-led peacekeeping operation in the country, while opening channels for French businesses to Liberia's vast mineral and forest wealth.

PRIORY, the president and chief operating officer of the Duke Power Company, the huge utility covering much of North Carolina, is loaded for bear. **********He is keeping the utility's balance sheet and borrowing ability strong to be ready to buy weaker and more vulnerable utilities, as the industry enters a more competitive age. **********\"You will see utilities that want to merge and be acquired, and we want to be one of the players,\" he said in an interview last week. **********Utility industry analysts, like Edward Tirello Jr. of NatWest Securities, agreed on the trend. Pressure is building for a period of consolidation when the larger, stronger utilities will acquire their smaller and weaker brethren. **********Every utility is adding up the numbers, Mr. Tirello said. The stronger want to see what others might fit into their systems. The weaker want to determine a fair sale price. **********Some consolidation has already taken place, and it could accelerate in the next two years as some states, notably California, allow more competition among utilities. And a proposal last week by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to open the country's power grid to more competition could also quicken the changes. **********The uncertainty has forced down the stock prices of many utilities. Investors could benefit, however, if they own utilities that become takeover targets or utilities that become stronger after an acquisition. **********In addition to Duke, huge utilities that Mr. Tirello expects to be on the prowl include the Southern Company of Atlanta, Entergy of New Orleans, Dominion Resources of Richmond and American Electric Power of Columbus, Ohio. These utilities are giants with customer bases of 1.3 million to more than 3 million, and some serve several states. **********Among the utilities that he sees as possible takeover targets are Dayton Power and Light, Rochester Gas and Electric, Idaho Power, Scana of Columbia, S.C., and Delmarva Power and Light of Wilmington, Del. These utilities are smaller, serving from 350,000 to 600,000 customers, and generally will have a tough time holding onto industrial customers unless they give them lower rates. **********Even after intense cost-cutting, Mr. Tirello predicted, these utilities will still be vulnerable if their states decide to allow outside utilities to compete where they now have monopolies. **********Until now, the few mergers in the utility industry have been for strategic reasons -- two strong utilities have combined to take better advantage of opportunities when states begin to allow more competition. An example of such a combination was the friendly merger last fall of PSI Energy, a utility serving a large part of Indiana, with Cincinnati Gas and Electric to form the Cinergy Corporation, the country's 13th-largest utility. **********PSI, which had plenty of surplus cheap power, greatly broadened its customer base through the merger. Meanwhile, C.G.& E. gained a management team that has geared up to cope with the expected rapid changes in the industry. **********The merger became embroiled in a rare hostile bid by a rival utility, Ipalco Enterprises of Indianapolis, which tried to acquire PSI in an attempt to prevent it from becoming more powerful. The hostile bid was beaten back. **********Future takeovers will generally be friendly, Mr. Tirello said, because they are subject to approval by state regulators, who may frown on hostile bids. **********The larger utilities, Mr. Priory of Duke said, will not look just at neighboring utilities -- the pattern that acquisitions have followed so far. **********Some of the larger companies have invested in overseas utilities; Duke, for example, has invested in companies in Argentina. They have also built power plants in other parts of the United States in their efforts to grow beyond their traditional territories. **********\"We would be comfortable operating generating equipment and transmission systems just about anywhere,\" Mr. Priory said.

They also contend that handing over wide areas of the West Bank to the Palestinian police will endanger Jewish lives. **********Eliakim Haetzni, a lawyer from the West Bank settlement of Kiryat Arba and a leading advocate of civil disobedience, said that the aim of the campaign is \"paralyzing the army\" and that recent protests were a dry run for responding to possible Israeli Government attempts to dismantle Jewish settlements. **********Faced with tens of thousands of resisting settlers and supporters who will arrive to bolster them, Mr. Haetzni says, the army will find it impossible to carry out orders to evict Jews from the settlements. He predicts that some soldiers will refuse orders while many more will shirk duty under various pretexts. **********\"The main front of the civil disobedience campaign is the military, because it is a people's army,\" Mr. Haetzni said in an interview. \"The message to Rabin and the military command is that they don't have the troops for this.\" **********The group that Mr. Haetzni leads has begun a petition campaign to get Israelis to sign a declaration stating that the eviction of Jewish settlers is \"inhuman, anti-Zionist, and violates my conscience.\" Mr. Haetzni said that hundreds of people have already signed, including many officers in the army reserve. **********Literature distributed by the group compares the settlers' campaign to the civil rights movement and the protests against the Vietnam War in the United States. **********Unlike Mr. Haetzni, many leaders of the protests are immigrants from the United States. \"We see what protests and sit-downs can do, and it's time we bring these concepts here,\" said Shmuel Sackett, a leader of the group who moved to Israel from Queens five years ago. **********But critics of the settlers say that their actions contradict the idea of civil disobedience. **********\"They're talking about a rebellion, not disobedience,\" said Yishai Menuhin, a leader of Yesh Gvul, a group that supported army resisters who refused to serve in the occupied territories and in Lebanon after Israel invaded it in 1982. **********\"Civil disobedience accepts the legitimacy of the Government and seeks to change specific policies,\" he said. \"The settlers reject the legitimacy of the Government.

J. Reynolds Tobacco Company will be happy. Because 20 miles down the road from Advance, in Winston-Salem, N.C., is the headquarters of R. J. Reynolds, the nation's second-largest tobacco marketer -- and the parent of Moonlight Tobacco. **********R. J. Reynolds is moonlighting, you might say, pitching cigarettes under the Moonlight Tobacco label while continuing to sell venerable brands like Camel, Winston and Salem under its own well-known moniker. It's the same ploy that was used to sell Bartles & Jaymes, which is owned not by Frank and Ed but by the huge E.& J. Gallo Winery. **********When conglomerates cloak the corporate connections of products and assume the trappings of smaller -- and presumably more forward-thinking -- concerns, it's a tactic known as faux or stealth parentage. The goal is to persuade consumers that the new brands are produced by iconoclastic, independent spirits rather than calculating corporate minds. **********\"It's a fascinating concept to set up a different kind of corporate brand,\" said James R. Gregory, chairman of the Corporate Branding Partnership, a consulting company in Stamford, Conn., affiliated with the Gregory & Clyburne agency. \"But to reach out to a new audience, to appeal to a different mind-set, you need to try new marketing techniques.\" Other examples of faux parentage include the General Motors Corporation's promotion of Saturn automobiles as \"a different kind of car\" built by \"a different kind of company,\" and the Coca-Cola Company's marketing of OK Soda with a campaign mocking conventional soft-drink sales pitches. **********Practitioners of faux parentage see the benefit of increased sales as outweighing the risk of shoppers feeling deceived or betrayed when they learn an upstart actually has a big parent with deep pockets. Rather than undertaking the difficult task of changing the images of established brands, the behemoths mimic the offerings of successful, less bureaucratic competitors. As with other weapons in the marketing arsenal, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't; in some instances, the products are hits but fade later. **********\"These strategies are probably smart,\" said John Grace, senior vice president of Gerstman & Meyers, a corporate identity and brand consulting company in New York, \"because consumers for the most part don't know who makes what. **********\"If the product delivers, there's no wool over the eyes because you buy the brand, not the parent corporation.\" **********Print advertisements for Moonlight Tobacco use colorful imagery to help mask its parentage. An Art Deco-style logo depicts a crescent moon, smoke rings coming from its mouth, above the slogans \"Working overtime for you\" and \"Smoke 'em if you got 'em.\" The text declares that Moonlight Tobacco's \"mission is to make the most exciting and innovative tobacco products in America today and have fun along the way.\" Although the ads omit mention of any link to R. J. Reynolds, the connection is noted on the cigarette packs and acknowledged in brochures that describe Moonlight Tobacco as \"a separate, independent company within\" R. J. Reynolds. **********\"Here's a chance for people to better identify themselves as opposed to being associated with mass products,\" said Mr. Herrman, who started Moonlight Tobacco in April with Ms. Roberts. He was a senior brand manager at R. J. Reynolds, which is owned by RJR Nabisco Holdings, and she was a research and development specialist. **********By donning disguises, marketing giants like R. J. Reynolds and E.& J. Gallo hope to appeal to consumer sentiment that favors Davids over Goliaths. That is increasingly pervasive among consumers in their 20's and 30's, who regard many big brands as outdated or obsolete. **********\"We're in an era of backlash against bigness,\" said Myra Stark, a senior vice president of Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising in New York, owned by Cordiant P.L.C. \"It's become a basic belief of ours that when things get too big, they get inefficient and corrupt. **********\"This movement is very revealing of the American consumer,\" she added, because \"we love the underdog coming up a winner, the small company taking on the biggies.\" **********Davids now even have a cigarette named Dave's sold by Dave's Tobacco Company, the creation of \"a guy named Dave,\" according to materials in test markets that describe him as an \"entrepreneur who believes in the value of homemade products.\" **********Truth be told, Dave's Tobacco is actually the Philip Morris U.S.A. unit of the Philip Morris Companies, the biggest tobacco marketer, which is better known for its best-selling brands including Marlboro and Virginia Slims. Dave is \"a fictional character\" meant to symbolize \"a home-style, homespun campaign with a grass-roots feel,\" said Karen Daragan, a spokeswoman for Philip Morris U.S.A. in New York. **********Faux parentage or not, the fact that the two largest tobacco companies are rolling out new brands shows that the industry is pushing ahead despite attacks by Federal regulators and antismoking forces. **********Another arm of Philip Morris, the Miller Brewing Company, is using faux parentage in trying to compete against the so-called microbreweries and their popular brands like Samuel Adams and Pete's Wicked Ale. Miller is marketing two new beers, Red Dog and Icehouse, under the aegis of the Plank Road Brewery, the name under which Miller operated from 1855 to 1873. **********Asked why Moonlight Tobacco is not identified as owned by R. J. Reynolds in its advertising, which was created by a small New York agency named Vernacular Communications, Mr. Herrman replied, \"You can only communicate so much in an ad.\" The parentage is explained in the brochures, he added, which are being inserted into packs of the seven Moonlight Tobacco brands. **********The trade publication Brandweek estimated this week that R. J. Reynolds was spending in the low seven figures to market the Moonlight Tobacco brands, which also carry the names City, Metro and North Star. They are now on sale in Chicago and New York and will be available later this month in Seattle; they are being advertised in publications like Details, Rolling Stone and Spin. **********Diana Temple, an analyst who follows the tobacco and cosmetics industries for Salomon Brothers in New York, praised the R. J. Reynolds foray into faux parentage. **********\"Innovation in advertising is critical,\" she said. \"What people in their 20's today want may be very different from what people in their 20's wanted 30 years ago.\" **********However, she added, \"it all depends on the execution and the image.\" **********Indeed, the track record is mixed. While Red Dog beer is selling well for Miller, Coca-Cola announced this week that it would discontinue OK Soda because it was unprofitable. Saturn, too, has had its growing pains, but research indicates the brand has helped General Motors appeal to car buyers who might otherwise have gone for imports. **********This arm's-length relationship can also be beneficial on the way down, said Mr. Grace of Gerstman & Meyers. **********\"If one of these products doesn't work,\" he explained, \"you pull the plug, and it doesn't hurt the parent company\" in the same way that a new product bearing the corporate name might. **********Dave's, which is in three test markets, seems to be developing into a hybrid example. Dave's Tobacco is now being identified as a division of its parent, Ms. Daragan said, because of \"the quality aspect\" of association with Philip Morris. **********Perhaps the company's next new cigarette will be named Phil's."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/12/business/wall-street-at-cbs-the-shows-are-bad-but-the-stock-is-good.html": {"writer_name": "Susan Antilla", "pub_date": "1995-02-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 155, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Wall Street; At CBS, the Shows Are Bad but the Stock Is Good", "print_headline": "Wall Street; At CBS, the Shows Are Bad but the Stock Is Good", "body_text": " **********The ratings stink, earnings are off, and a key executive is reportedly shopping for a new job.

The presiding official, Yang Baojing, called it a shining moment in China's fight against corruption. **********The cars, Mr. Yang said, were confiscated from senior officials in a display of the leadership's determination to rein in excesses in the upper ranks of the Communist Party, which long ago lost its reputation for purity. **********Yet the auction was probably more an ordinary money-making procedure masquerading as government virtue than an indication of any zeal in cracking down on corruption. Nearly all the cars, three of them Mercedes-Benzes, had over 100,000 miles on their odometers, and each had seen better days. **********Despite what Mr. Yang said, they appeared to be cars that senior officials -- complying with a new regulation that officials use domestically produced cars -- would be eager to trade in for a new Chinese-made Audi, the current favorite among the leadership. **********If the anti-corruption campaign is netting bigger fish this year than ever before, Chinese officials and Western businessmen say, it is more an indication of corruption's growing pervasiveness than of any official determination to alter the situation that allows graft to flourish. **********\"The network of gift-giving and favors involves the families of almost every senior leader,\" a mid-level Chinese official said. \"So anyone who tries to move against them immediately runs into resistance.\" **********Traditionally, those disciplined for corruption have been people who run afoul of officialdom, while those who preserve connections with ranking officials go unpunished no matter how bad their crime. Since investigators and court officials take instructions from party officials, no prosecution can proceed without approval from the senior authorities, either at a local or central level. **********With an economy growing at breakneck speed and officials involved in many stages of business ventures, corruption has accelerated greatly in the anything-goes economic atmosphere in recent years, the official said. **********Small examples abound. A Chinese chief representative of an American company in Beijing complained that she ran into corrupt practices every week. Getting a telephone installed, having an operating license approved and even registering her office all involve cash payoffs, the executive said. **********\"It's everywhere,\" the executive said. \"I hate it. It's getting worse and worse.\" **********Last week the authorities announced that more than 47,000 officials had been disciplined on corruption charges in the first half of this year, an increase of 7.8 percent over the same period last year. Of those punished, official news reports said, more than 1,801 were division chiefs or magistrates or higher, a 44 percent increase. **********Large cases are more common, too. In July, investigators publicized the outline of the largest corruption scandal yet in 46 years of Communist Party rule, a case involving central Government as well as provincial officials. **********A well-connected woman in Wuxi, 100 miles west of Shanghai, bilked Government officials and private investors of more than $380 million over five years in a pyramid scheme built on imaginary investments, an official account said. **********The woman, Deng Bin, 57, was accused of running an operation that bribed officials in dozens of cities to invest in her company, Xinxing Industrial Corporation, sometimes offering profits in advance. The operation even reached into Beijing's Municipal State Security Bureau, where a senior official lured high-ranking customers into the scheme, before it collapsed last summer when the Wuxi authorities arrested Ms. Deng. She now faces the death penalty. **********An even more explosive corruption case came to light in April when the Deputy Mayor of Beijing, Wang Baosen, was found dead in a ravine in Huairou, 35 miles north of Beijing, apparently a suicide. **********Mr. Wang was later accused of embezzling $37 million, but a second Chinese official said investigators might find even more by the time they finish looking into a series of Beijing construction projects under Mr. Wang's control that apparently involved huge payoffs to staff at the Beijing Municipal Communist Party Committee, headed by a Politburo member, Chen Xitong. **********\"It's hard to separate corruption from politics in this case,\" the official said. \"No one doubts that Chen Xitong was dirty, but if only he and the people around him are charged, it will look very political.\" **********Mr. Chen has been a rival of the Communist Party chief, Jiang Zemin, since the latter won his post in 1989, and is said to have complained in meetings that he was better suited for China's top position than Mr. Jiang. **********Mr. Chen's arrest, announced in early July, aroused speculation that Mr. Jiang would open a far-reaching crackdown on corruption, both to clear out political enemies and to earn respect from ordinary Chinese, who almost uniformly express disgust with the level of graft that has spread throughout Chinese society. Yet no more officials have been charged. **********It is not clear why Mr. Wang chose to kill himself in Huairou, where the nongovernmental forum of the United Nations Conference on Women is being held next month. But a popular theory in Beijing is that he chose Huairou because he had arranged several villas for senior Chinese leaders there, and wanted to send a signal that if he was blamed for a huge corruption scandal, his superiors had indirect complicity as well."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/03/world/goiania-journal-tourist-site-springs-from-a-nuclear-horror-story.html": {"writer_name": "James Brooke", "pub_date": "1995-05-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 801, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Goiania Journal; Tourist Site Springs From a Nuclear Horror Story", "print_headline": "Goiania Journal; Tourist Site Springs From a Nuclear Horror Story", "body_text": " **********Brazil's only nuclear waste dump is to become a tourist attraction this year, complete with nature trails, a visitor information center and a 100-seat auditorium. **********\"This is going to be an example for the world,\" Paulo Ney, regional director of Brazil's National Nuclear Energy Commission, said of the $4 million toxic tourism project taking shape here. **********\"We already have had 5,000 schoolchildren at the deposit,\" he continued, adding that the area was entirely safe. \"On tour buses, tourists always ask guides to show them 57th Street.\" **********In September 1988, 57th Street, several miles from where the dump lies, burned into Brazil's national consciousness as the site of the worst radiation accident in the Americas.

A laboratory will allow technicians to monitor the waste contaminated by the cesium, which is packed in 6,000 metal barrels, encased in concrete and buried underground. The laboratory will also serve as a regional training center for nuclear technicians. **********Inside the compound's chain-link fence, about 400 acres are to be planted with trees native to the surrounding savannah.

But he said that with conflicting information being received about the fate of the pilot, a search-and-rescue effort was continuing. **********Mr. Perry said the Pentagon has found no proof that the pilot managed to eject from his aircraft before it crashed. As for the contention by Gen. Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serbs' military commander, that his forces have captured the pilot, Mr. Perry said, \"He may be playing some kind of cruel game.\" **********American officials said today that they would ask President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia to inquire about the fate of the pilot and to push for his release, if he has been captured. **********Mr. Perry announced the increased intelligence cooperation a day after the Administration notified its European allies that it was narrowing the circumstances under which American ground troops could be used to help redeploy United Nations peacekeepers in Bosnia. **********In a speech on Wednesday, President Clinton suggested that he was prepared to send American ground troops to assist a reconfiguration and strengthening of peacekeepers. But in a radio address on Saturday, he said American troops would be used only if peacekeepers \"become stranded and could not get out of a particular place in Bosnia.\" **********After severely criticizing President Clinton three days ago for talking about committing ground troops to Bosnia, Senator Bob Dole, the majority leader, said today that he supported the President's current plans to provide American assistance to help rescue beleaguered United Nations peacekeepers. **********Appearing on the NBC News program \"Meet the Press,\" Mr. Dole said: \"I would support the President's efforts to rescue or to remove some of the United Nations protection forces. We are a member of NATO. What I would not want is American troops there under U.N. command with limited rules of engagement and without consulting with Congress.\" **********Taking President Clinton's lead, Gen. John Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, played down the likelihood that the United States would ever have to send ground troops to Bosnia to help redeploy peacekeepers there. **********Appearing on the ABC News program \"This Week with David Brinkley,\" General Shalikashvili said America's European allies have not asked the Pentagon to help move peacekeepers who find themselves in an untenable situation although \"we certainly are now aware that this could come up.\" **********He added, \"After our meeting yesterday in Paris, it is becoming more and more clear that this is not an eventuality that stares us in the face right now.\" **********The general said that the United States would not provide ground troops to serve as United Nations peacekeepers or to join the rapid reaction force being established by Britain, France and other countries. He said that the United States would be willing to provide close air support to the quick reaction force and would be willing to fly British, French or other allied troops into the area, if requested. **********One senior Administration official said today that an American envoy's talks with President Milosevic in Belgrade were deadlocked, and near collapse, as the Serbian leader had stepped up his demands. The United States, Britain, France, Germany and Russia are pressing Mr. Milosevic to recognize Bosnia in exchange for a suspension of economic sanctions against his country. **********\"Milosevic is trying to reopen things that we thought we had settled long ago,\" the official said. He said that Mr. Milosevic was demanding that the United States and other nations recognize Serbia and Montenegro, the rump Yugoslavia, as the official successor state of the former Yugoslavia. The United States has refused to do that on the ground that it would give Serbia a status it does not deserve and would strengthen Serbia's claim over assets that belonged to Yugoslavia. **********Senator Dole reiterated his call for unilaterally lifting the arms embargo against Bosnia's Muslim-led Government and for withdrawing the 22,500 United Nations peacekeepers in Bosnia. **********\"I think if you provide the equipment and they're properly trained and they lose, they've given it their best shot,\" he said. \"It's not our problem.\" **********But Madeleine K. Albright, the chief United States delegate to the United Nations, criticized his position. Ms. Albright, who also appeared on \"Meet the Press,\" said that unilaterally lifting the embargo \"is a feel-good option,\" which \"would undoubtedly lead to an Americanization of the conflict.\" She said the United States would have to supply a large proportion of the arms and train the Bosnian Government forces. **********Senator Richard Lugar, an Indiana Republican and like Mr. Dole a presidential candidate, said that if American troops are to be used, they should assist in a withdrawal of United Nations forces from Bosnia. In an appearance on ABC's \"This Week,\" he said the Administration should work with Congress to arrange for American troops to help withdraw the peacekeepers, who he said are unable to keep the peace or protect themselves."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/23/business/nellcor-to-acquire-puritan-bennett-in-457-million-stock-deal.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-05-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 536, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Nellcor to Acquire Puritan-Bennett in $457 Million Stock Deal", "print_headline": "Nellcor to Acquire Puritan-Bennett in $457 Million Stock Deal", "body_text": " **********Nellcor Inc. said today that it would acquire the Puritan-Bennett Corporation for about $457 million in stock, expanding its line of patient monitoring and respiratory care systems. **********The acquisition, the latest of many recent mergers in the health care industry, would extend the reach of Nellcor in the respiratory care market by adding respirators and other products to its line of monitors that measure oxygen levels in blood. **********Hospitals and home health care companies that use Nellcor products are consolidating and want to buy from companies that make a wider range of medical equipment, said Michael Downey, the chief financial officer of Nellcor, which is based here. **********\"We had to broaden our product offerings,\" he said.

As a result, Nellcor's shares fell $1.625 today to close at $39.625 in Nasdaq trading. **********Under the agreement, each Puritan-Bennett share will be exchanged for 0.88 Nellcor share.

P.

But Mr. Lemaitre raised his rating on Nellcor's stock today to \"strong buy\" from \"buy\" because he expects cost savings to propel earnings and push the stock to about $50 in 12 to 18 months. **********Puritan-Bennett, which returned to profitability last year, has faced intense shareholder pressure to improve its financial performance after rejecting an unsolicited offer of $24.50 a share from Thermo Electron last year.

This button, because of its strength, size, conductivity and single connection point, has freed the computer chip from its fixed, soldered point on a circuit board. **********All that is required to transfer information contained in the ring to a computer is to touch it with a probe attached to the computer.

The county says it has no money to repay those bondholders and, in their eyes, is doing little to change that. **********Only one proposal has been floated so far, and it is hardly the comprehensive solution that bondholders seek. Some county officials have suggested diverting part of the county sales tax of 7.75 percent that normally goes to the county's general fund and use the money to issue new bonds to pay off the old ones. Such a diversion still faces many legal hurdles and even if approved, might not provide enough money. **********Orange County declared bankruptcy last Dec. 6, after sustaining losses in an investment fund that bet interest rates would fall. The losses have amounted to $1.7 billion, and the financial crisis that followed has made it difficult, if not impossible, for the county to repay the investors who bought Orange County bonds in recent years. **********As the bonds' repayment dates near, bondholders are becoming worried by statements from county officials. The officials have consistently warned that they will not raise taxes to solve the problem and that bondholders may have to delay getting paid back or take less than what they are owed. Even more troubling, county officials have not ruled out a default on the obligations entirely. **********\"The county does not have funds now to make all these payments,\" said Bruce Bennett, the county's bankruptcy lawyer. \"It is now exploring every conceivable method of dealing with these bonds without defaulting. **********\"We are looking at refinancing and at renegotiating with existing bondholders,\" he added. \"The unilateral nonpayment of these bonds, defaulting on them, would be the absolute last resort.\" **********Such talk alarms the world of municipal finance. It undermines the basic tenet on which the municipal bond market is built: that municipal borrowers like Orange County are morally obligated to repay their debts, even if it means cutting services and raising taxes. **********Outright defaults are extremely rare in municipal finance and many municipalities with financial problems, like New York City and Philadelphia, solved their problems by raising taxes and taking other hard steps to prevent a default. **********Should Orange County default on its outstanding bonds, it would most likely be unable to ever borrow again in the municipal markets. That has been the fate of the handful of other public borrowers that have defaulted on their bond obligations. **********What is more, it would make investors think twice about lending to all other municipalities and could force municipal borrowers to pay more to entice investors to lend to them. **********No other large municipality has ever declared bankruptcy and none has been as adamant in saying it will not raise taxes to resolve its crisis. The anti-tax stance of the county's board of supervisors has not softened since the crisis began, much to the consternation of bondholders. **********\"It's atrocious,\" said Joe Mysak, editor of Grant's Municipal Bond Observer. \"Orange County has crossed the line and gone into the unspeakable. It was one thing to declare bankruptcy. But the talk about deferring debt payments takes this into the beyond. It's revolutionary and it will stand municipal finance on its head. **********\"The idea that a county as wealthy as Orange County is suddenly balking at making debt payments and is being intransigent on raising taxes has really damaged them in the marketplace. They are saying, 'We won't pay.' And the market is going to say, 'Oh, really?' \" **********David MacEwen, senior municipal portfolio manager at the Benham Group, added: \"They might as well be Mexico. The people in Orange County don't feel that this is their problem and they shouldn't pay. The fact that this is a wealthy county doesn't help if you can't tap the wealth. \" **********Angry bondholders have scheduled a meeting for Feb. 7 in Anaheim, Calif., to air their grievances. The $1.2 billion in debt includes a $600 million short-term note that matures on July 10 and more than $644 million in a number of revenue and property tax anticipation notes that mature in June and July. **********Bondholders were particularly troubled by a decision by the county last month to halt payment of $53 million into a special reserve fund used to pay coming bond obligations. That action put many of the county's bond issues into technical default. **********\"Orange County is waiting for someone else to solve their situation,\" said James E. Spiotto, a bond lawyer with Chapman & Cutler in Chicago. \"They won't raise taxes. They want to share the pain with others and they want to borrow. That's nice, but I'm not sure the world is made that way.\" **********Most troubled municipalities have escaped their problems by converting their short-term debt to long-term debt and coming up with new sources of revenues -- usually new taxes -- to finance the payments on the new debt. The county recently hired Goldman, Sachs & Company and A. G. Edwards & Sons to underwrite any new long-term bonds. **********Several factors, however, will make new bond underwritings difficult. First is the amount of borrowing that will be needed -- several hundred million dollars. Second, the county's bonds are now rated as \"junk\" -- below investment grade -- increasing borrowing costs. And finally, and most importantly, there is the question of how the county will support these new borrowings without new taxes. **********\"The county is going to have to show it has some sort of earmarked tax against this new debt or it will have problems convincing investors that they will get paid back,\" said Jane Eddy, an analyst with Standard & Poor's Ratings Group. **********The lone proposal afoot is to divert 1 percent or so of the county's sales tax to meet the payments on new bonds. Some estimate that could raise up to $140 million a year to cover the new bond payments. Not only is it unclear whether that would be enough to support new borrowings, but that is also money that would otherwise pay for county services. **********\"When you live without this revenue source in the budget, it has implications for people's lives,\" said Karen Kropp, an analyst with Moody's Investors Services. \"I'd love to know how the county is going to come up with more funds.\" **********The diversion would come at a time when Orange County is already facing a budget crisis. From now until July, the county faces a shortfall of $172 million in its general fund budget because of its investment losses. In the fiscal year starting next July, the county is expected to come up short by another $154 million. **********So far, the county has proposed cuts of only $40 million from its budget, and some modest other cuts have been suggested. County supervisors have said they will seek state approval to lower wages on public projects and cut welfare and health programs. **********What about help from the State of California? **********Orange County officials have long stated that they will not seek a state bailout. The State Treasurer, Matthew Fong, said he would be inclined to support the sales tax diversion proposal because it did not put state money at risk. **********\"I'd be concerned that you'd set a precedent that if a local government makes a bad decision, they'll be bailed out by the state,\" Mr. Fong said. \"The state does not want to reward bad performance.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/08/business/for-matsushita-life-without-mca-probably-means-a-return-to-nuts-and-bolts.html": {"writer_name": "Sheryl Wudunn", "pub_date": "1995-04-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1063, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "For Matsushita, Life Without MCA Probably Means a Return to Nuts and Bolts", "print_headline": "For Matsushita, Life Without MCA Probably Means a Return to Nuts and Bolts", "body_text": " **********If the flamboyance and extravagance of Hollywood has an antithesis, it may be the penny-pinching tradition of Osaka, Japan, where older folks still greet each other with \"mokarimakka,\" or Have you made money today? **********That difference in attitude and business outlook helps explain the reason for the imminent parting of the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, the world's largest consumer electronics company, and MCA Inc., one of America's most dynamic movie and music studios. **********When Matsushita, which is based in the commercial center of Osaka, suggested that it would sell a stake in MCA, many people in the business community took it as an admission of failure: there would be no magical synergies between MCA's popular culture and Matsushita's compact disk players and other electronic gadgets. **********\"Matsushita basically gave up,\" said Koichiro Chiwata, a technology analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd. \"One thing for sure is that they had a lot of dreams and hoped a lot of things would happen with this acquisition and now they're giving up.\" **********What went wrong? From the start the two companies were an odd couple. Matsushita is a name that few Americans know, but its products -- from televisions and stereos to video systems, washing machines and vacuum cleaners -- are fixtures in homes around the world. Its brand names are household words like Panasonic, Technics, National and Quasar. **********Yet Matsushita is not so much a creator or pioneer as it is a brilliant imitator and marketer, advanced in producing an ever smaller Walkman, clearer television screen or tinier compact disk. **********Moreover, Matsushita is conservative in nearly every way, from the dull blue employee uniforms and company song to the frugal beliefs that pulled the purse strings on MCA's desires. **********By contrast, Hollywood is instinctively ostentatious and extravagant. **********\"It is difficult for them to understand how someone plays a role in a film, that actors should have personal private jets, while the top Japanese executives here will live in condominiums,\" said David M. Benda, a technology analyst at BZW Securities (Japan) Ltd. \"To manage a bunch of people in California -- that was impossible for Matsushita. They basically couldn't talk to each other.\" **********Yet many industry experts say that it was not just a clash of cultures or mishandling of a wayward American subsidiary that led Matsushita to forsake Hollywood. After all, Matsushita has more than 100 subsidiaries all over the world, as well as domestic subsidiaries that sometimes give Matsushita more painful headaches than MCA does. **********\"It sounds too emotional to say that it was a corporate culture clash -- Matsushita is much more shrewd and logical than that,\" said a Japanese entertainment executive who declined to be named. \"They just changed their strategy or business plan and probably they made some sort of priority in their business. They may have reached the conclusion that they don't need the movie business. From the beginning, they never needed the movie business.\" **********To borrow a Japanese saying, the two companies may have been lying \"in the same bed, with different dreams.\" Matsushita had a vague hope of achieving cost-saving synergies by marrying its compact videodisk players and other hardware with MCA's popular culture software. MCA, in contrast, wanted a financial sponsor. **********But even from the start, Matsushita did not know exactly what kind of new product it wanted to create, putting it at a loss as to how to integrate movies and music into a vast electronics empire. **********Indeed, the main reason it bought MCA, many analysts and industry experts say, was because the Sony Corporation had purchased Columbia Pictures. The two Japanese companies compete head on in several markets and Matsushita is always looking over its shoulder at Sony. **********Matsushita thought that it could not go wrong with a prized Hollywood property. It would let MCA run itself, and Matsushita executives, who shone in manufacturing or marketing, would not need to dabble in the entertainment business. **********In contrast, Sony had already been in the music business for years and so getting into movies was just one more extension of its business. Sony was also a more relaxed, California-style company: accountants at Sony might scratch their numbers in the ledgers with music pulsing through a Sony Walkman on their heads. Matsushita employees would probably never do that. **********And from the start, Sony, which has always been more of a risk-taker, poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the studio and took an active role in its management. Last year, it said it would write off $3.2 billion from its Hollywood studios, but analysts say that its movie business may turn a profit in the near future. **********Now, Matsushita's sale of a majority stake in MCA represents a significant departure from Sony. **********\"It's a strategic issue,\" said Akihiro Okumura, a business school professor at Keio University. Mr. Okumura said that while Sony was pursuing a future as an audio-visual company, from singers to speakers, Matsushita was choosing to focus instead on its strength as a first-class manufacturer of everything from cordless telephones to LCD's, or liquid crystal displays. **********\"They want to get out of software permanently and concentrate on manufacturing hardware devices, like LCD's or batteries,\" said Joseph A. Osha, technology analyst at Smith New Court (Japan) Ltd. \"Matsushita's path forward is much clearer. They're going to try to become a company much more oriented toward making hard-to-make bits and bobs.\" **********Industry experts say that Matsushita wants to improve its narrow margins in its core electronics businesses. MCA contributed about 9 percent of Matsushita's overall sales in the fiscal year ending in March 1994, but it has significantly higher margins than Matsushita's businesses, which generally eke out returns of under 1 percent. The yen's appreciation, however, has undercut the value to Matsushita of MCA's earnings in recent years. **********Moreover, Matsushita paid a substantial amount for good will, the excess over book value, and continues to amortize that sum. Along with financing costs related to about $2 billion it originally borrowed to pay for MCA, analysts say that MCA was not contributing significantly to Matsushita's overall profits. **********Still, if the sale goes smoothly, Matsushita executives face another, somewhat happier, problem: what to do with all the new cash. Should they invest in personal computers, LCD panels or batteries? **********\"They got plenty of money but they don't need the money; they are not a bank,\" said Mr. Benda of BZW Securities. \"This is not their function in life.

The rating agency in one move changed its credit ratings outlook for six major firms to \"negative\" from \"stable,\" and cited \"uncertainty about the future depth and duration of the earnings downturn currently affecting\" these companies. **********The firms -- the Bear Stearns Companies; CS First Boston; Goldman, Sachs & Company; the Morgan Stanley Group; Paine Webber Group and Salomon Inc. -- are, with the exception of Paine Webber, all businesses that make most of their money in the capital markets. In those markets, revenues have got much tougher to come by in the last year as margins have narrowed and transaction volumes have declined. **********These securities firms are also borrowing much more than they used to -- in some cases as much as twice what they did six or seven years ago, according to one analyst. **********The rating agency's move has few recent precedents. \"Basically you'd have to go back to 1987\" to find a similar announcement from one of the big rating agencies affecting such a large number of securities firms, Perrin H. Long, an analyst for Brown Brothers Harriman, said. **********In a conference call with analysts and investors, Mark E. Bachmann and Jake Newman, respectively a managing director and director for S.& P., indicated that if current business trends continued, an actual downgrade in the firms' credit ratings was likely. \"Ratings may be lowered for individual firms, if profitability worsens or if continued market turbulence persists,\" S.& P. said in its statement. **********Mr. Bachmann and Mr. Newman declined to quantify the cost of any future downgrades for these firms. But after Lehman Brothers, the big investment bank, was downgraded last week by the other big American rating agency, Moody's Investors Service , the firm said the rating cut could add more than $50 million a year to its borrowing costs. **********In announcing its outlook change, Standard & Poor's said that \"turbulent conditions continue to plague the global capital and currency markets, exposing most of these firms to trading results that could further aggravate\" already depressed core businesses. **********The S.& P. officials cited recent financial debacles and difficulties -- including those of Orange County, Calif., Barings P.L.C., Mexico, and the weaker dollar -- as factors influencing their reassessment of the outlook for the firms. The financial environment has become much riskier and less predictable, and these recent events have caught the rating agencies themselves off guard. **********Securities firms in London, Europe's financial center, are also being hurt by the tougher business environment. Moody's yesterday put the long-term debt of S. G. Warburg & Company, an investment bank based there, under review for a possible downgrade. Warburg also has big capital markets businesses. **********\"Clearly the rating agencies are concerned with the capital markets firms,\" said Michael A. Flanagan who follows the brokerage industry for the Lipper Analytical Securities Corporation. **********The rating agencies have not expressed the same concern about brokerage firms with strong retail businesses, such as Merrill Lynch & Company, Smith Barney, Charles Schwab, Dean Witter Reynolds, A.

The statements seem certain to strengthen the conviction both within the Clinton Administration and in Congress that Iran is determined to become a nuclear power. **********In addition to its oil reserves, Iran has the second-largest natural gas reserves in the world, and natural gas is much cheaper to develop than nuclear energy. That makes American officials suspicious that Iran wants nuclear power as part of a weapons program. **********In a clear attempt to answer charges that Iran is developing nuclear weapons, Mr. Amrollahi made his remarks in a two-and-a-half-hour interview at his agency's new six-story building. It is part of a sprawling complex in central Teheran that includes a small nuclear research reactor built for Iran by the United States in the late 1960's, when relations with Washington were close.  Officials offered a brief tour of the complex, including a visit to two radio isotope laboratories for medical research, although they did not allow a tour of the reactor. **********\"In case we get enough money, in case we have enough trained people, we have a plan to take 20 years to get 20 percent of our energy from nuclear,\" Mr. Amrollahi said. Asked whether that could mean about 10 reactors, he said, \"Something like that.\" **********If Russia completes two reactor projects in Iran, and China builds two, it would seem that the Iranian Government intends to build six. **********At the summit meeting in Moscow last week, President Clinton tried without success to persuade President Boris N. Yeltsin to abandon Russia's nuclear energy project with Iran, arguing that the Islamic Government had embarked on a crash nuclear weapons program. Secretary of State Warren Christopher was similarly rebuffed when he made the same point to China's Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen, last month in New York. **********Mr. Amrollahi reiterated that Iran had already invested $6 billion in the project -- which is subject to international inspection and safeguards -- and wanted to finish it. He said the contract with Moscow consists of a $780 million deal in which Russia is to complete one of two reactors that a German firm was building at Bushehr, a southern port city, before the project was halted after the 1979 revolution. If that project goes well, Russia will finish the second reactor. **********The United States opposes the project in part because it will give Iran access to new expertise, technology and training. **********Mr. Amrollahi said that 150 Russian nuclear experts were already working at the site and that 500 would eventually be based there; a much smaller number of Iranians are to be trained in Russia on how to operate the plant, he added. \"Training people is part of that nuclear power plan,\" he said. \"I don't know why they make such a hot fudge of it.\" **********Mr. Amrollahi denied reports that Iran had negotiated -- or even discussed -- a plan to buy a gas centrifuge from Russia that could have rapidly enriched uranium to bomb-grade quality. \"This was a diplomatically made cake,\" he said of reports about a separate albeit tentative agreement with Russia. **********Russia has agreed to supply the enriched uranium to operate the plant it plans to finish, he said. Asked whether Iran was pursuing a program to enrich uranium, at first he said, \"Not now,\" but then added quickly: \"No. Not forever. Not, no, not at all.\" **********Asked why Iran simply does not use natural gas for fuel, Mr. Amrollahi said, \"Natural gas is one of the best fuels, and many countries at the moment need it. So we think it is better to sell it.\" **********The United States and Germany have amassed substantial evidence that Iran is secretly buying components and technology abroad that could be useful only in a determined weapons program. **********Although Mr. Amrollahi has headed Iran's nuclear agency for 15 years, American and German intelligence officials say that he controls only part of Iran's nuclear program and that Iran has created a parallel program through the military that is largely responsible for purchases of nuclear related items. According to this view, the Defense Ministry Organization inside the Defense Ministry uses front organizations like the Sharif University of Technology in Teheran to help buy nuclear-related equipment. **********On the basis of reports by Germany's foreign intelligence agency in 1992 and 1993, Germany began to reject all requests for equipment by the university. Early last year, the German agency said the university's physics research center was involved in buying technology that could be used in making weapons, including nuclear-related materials. **********Mr. Amrollahi strongly denied the claim that he was not fully in charge. \"I am the responsible for the atomic energy of Iran,\" he said. \"Believe it, we don't have any other institutions or departments that pay attention to nuclear issues.\" **********Mr. Amrollahi also denied reports that Iran has secretly been buying nuclear technology and equipment abroad, noting that the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors nuclear programs around the world, turned up nothing suspicious during a visit to Sharif University. **********But the official was unfamiliar with intelligence reports about Iran's nuclear-related overtures abroad and asked for copies of news clippings describing the details. **********Asked, for example, about a report that Iran tried unsuccessfully to buy cylinders of fluorine for Sharif University in 1991, Mr. Amrollahi said, \"Wrong. I deny it totally.\" Asked about a report that Sharif University approached the German firm Thyssen in 1991 for specialized magnets he replied, \"No, we never did.\" **********Asked whether Sharif University tried to buy balancing machines from another German firm in 1991, he replied, \"You can go and ask Sharif University.\" **********Asked about a seizure last January by Italian authorities in Bari of high technology ultrasonic equipment that could be used in nuclear reactor testing, he replied, \"Believe it, that's wrong, totally.\" **********Asked about a 1993 seizure by Italian customs of eight steam condensers destined for Iran, he said, \"I don't know really. I don't know. It's totally wrong.\" **********Mr. Amrollahi also denied a recent accusation by Secretary Christopher that Iran tried to buy enriched uranium from Kazakhstan in 1992. Other senior American officials in Washington said that Iran sent a purchasing team to Kazakhstan three years ago, but that it came home empty-handed. **********\"We didn't send any team,\" Mr. Amrollahi said. \"Definitely not. What is the use of enriched uranium for? The Russians do have many, many nuclear weapons but they couldn't use them. I think the bomb age is over. We don't think we need a nuclear weapon.\"                    --------------------       U.S. Unaware of Iranian Goal **********WASHINGTON, May 13 (By The New York Times) -- One of the Administration's leading nuclear experts said late today that he had not heard that Iran had a goal of building 10 nuclear reactors, although he said he was not surprised because of the plans that Iran had already announced. **********Since the Administration had strongly urged Russia not to build two planned reactors and warned that Iran would not be able to pay for them, the official questioned whether Iran could finance 10 reactors. **********\"I think there is a general question about Iran's ability to finance any new project,\" he said, speaking on the condition that he not be identified. **********Another official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, said a plan for 10 reactors was hardly more worrisome than for two or four. The Administration's major concern about the Russian reactors is that they will help augment the expertise of Iran's nuclear specialists, making it easier for them to develop nuclear weapons. **********\"Our concern is about technology and expertise,\" the official said. \"You could argue that they could learn most of what they will learn from the first two reactors.\" **********The Administration also fears that once the Iranians have the reactors, it will be easier for them to import technology to develop either civilian nuclear power or nuclear weapons. The more reactors Iran has, the easier it will be for it to purchase such dual-use technology, one official said. **********The expert also said the Administration already knew that there were 150 Russian engineers in Iran and that China had signed a contract for two reactors. \"Our understanding is the Chinese signed something a while ago, but we're not totally sure it will go through,\" the official said. \"It seems more doubtful than the Russian project.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/12/business/time-warner-under-its-own-spotlight.html": {"writer_name": "Mark Landler", "pub_date": "1995-06-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1246, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Time Warner, Under Its Own Spotlight", "print_headline": "Time Warner, Under Its Own Spotlight", "body_text": " **********Time magazine's dogged coverage of the controversy involving its parent, Time Warner Inc., and gangsta rap music may burnish the publication's reputation outside the company. But it could exacerbate the strains inside Time Warner. **********After years of missed opportunities and pulled punches, Time published an aggressive cover article last week about its owner. In stark black and red type, Time asked: \"Are Music and Movies Killing America's Soul?\" **********Depending on who is discussing it at Time Warner, the article was either a gutsy show of independence or a nasty example of ax-grinding. **********\"What makes the piece terrific is that we had the guts to write about an issue so close to the company,\" said Henry Muller, a former managing editor of Time who is now the editorial director of Time Inc., the company's magazine division. **********Executives at Warner Music, though, say several Time editors have long been sympathetic to critics who say the company should stop distributing gangsta rap music because of its violent and sexually degrading lyrics. The music executives say the Time article reflected this argument. **********\"The piece was tendentious,\" said one senior executive at Warner Music, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. **********By ratcheting up the pressure on Gerald M. Levin, the chairman of Time Warner, Time's coverage could also aggravate tensions between the magazine group and the corporation. **********Though Mr. Levin has championed the role of the magazines in the corporation, some editorial employees say Time Inc. has become a vestigial part of an entertainment-driven colossus. **********Mr. Levin did not grant an interview to Time, and senior executives of the magazine group said he had not discussed the article with them. The only corporate comment came from Tod R. Hullin, a senior vice president of Time Warner, who said, \"Their persistence is up there with anybody else's.\" **********The Time Warner response to the rap issue underscores that the company is a collection of baronies -- with powerful executives who do not hesitate to air views that conflict with those of the parent company. **********Last week, for example, Time Warner corporate executives said the company was calmly and gradually formulating a response to the outcry over rap lyrics. By the middle of the week, though, they had to quell rumors stirred by executives in the music group that Time Warner might sell off the group as a way to extricate itself from the dispute. **********With its June 12 cover story, Time magazine became both an observer and a player in this corporate drama. **********Several editors attributed Time's aggressive tone to Norman Pearlstine, who became the editor in chief of Time Inc. in January. Mr. Pearlstine, a former executive editor of The Wall Street Journal, was heavily involved in the editing of the article. He signed off on the final version at 1 A.M. on the Sunday before publication, hours after the usual deadline. **********Mr. Pearlstine also made a personal pitch to Mr. Levin and Richard D. Parsons, the president of Time Warner, to grant interviews to Time reporters. Both declined. **********\"I think it always looks strange when the chief executive of Time Warner isn't available for comment in the pages of Time,\" Mr. Pearlstine said. \"As an editor, I wanted them to talk to us first.\" **********Several Time editors said it was unprecedented for an editor in chief to show such independence. Indeed, Mr. Pearlstine's predecessor, Jason McManus, made what many journalists considered an infamous decision: that Time should not cover the merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications the week it was announced in 1989. **********Other Time Warner executives said Mr. Pearlstine might feel more free to scrutinize the company than his predecessor did. Before the merger, the editor in chief of Time was still a member of the Time Inc. board. So Mr. McManus cast a vote on the very issue that his magazine later had to treat -- or not treat -- as a news event. **********Certainly, Mr. Pearlstine did not seem constrained on the rap coverage. As part of its 14-page cover package, Time examined how Time Warner was responding to the brouhaha over rap lyrics. Quoting \"company insiders,\" the article said Mr. Levin might back off his refusal to stop distributing music by gangsta rappers like Tupac Shakur and Snoop Doggy Dogg. **********\"Never in the history of the magazine have they run such a story,\" said Richard M. Clurman, a former Time editor and the author of \"To the End of Time\" (Simon & Schuster, 1992), which harshly criticized Time Inc. for uneven coverage of its parent company. \"It's the first piece of really candid coverage of their own affairs.\" **********Ray Cave, a former managing editor of Time, said: \"I was impressed by the fact that they did a cover. They didn't need to. It would have been tempting to avoid it.\" **********Mr. Pearlstine denied that he had set the tone for the coverage. He said James R. Gaines, the managing editor of Time, proposed the cover story after Bob Dole, the Senate majority leader, made a widely publicized speech on May 31 criticizing Hollywood and Time Warner. **********In 1992, when Time Warner came under fire about the lyrics of another rap performer, Ice-T, Time magazine took note of the dispute in a series of brief articles. But the only large article in the publication was a generally sympathetic profile of the artist. **********Mr. Muller, who was then the managing editor of Time, defended the magazine's treatment of Ice-T. \"You can always argue two or three years later about the coverage of a story,\" he said. \"But the salient point is that we didn't shy away from it then, either.\" **********As for the accusation that Time's editors were venting their opposition to Time Warner's rap policy, Mr. Gaines denied that he had a strong opinion on the issue. But, he added, \"I think journalists are free to dislike Snoop Doggy Dogg just like anybody else, aren't they?\" Chart: \"Two Approaches at Time to In-House News\" 1995 THE STORY: Senator Bob Dole and Wiliam J.

Pretax profit was up by 23.2 percent for the first half of the year, the merger of A & W Brands into its beverage business in the United States had gone smoothly and unusually warm summer weather in Europe seemed to promise a strong sales increase for the second half of the year. **********But in the last few months, the fizz has gone out of Cadbury Schweppes, at least as far as investors are concerned. The stock, which rallied over the summer after having plunged along with the rest of the market earlier in the year, has fallen sharply again since September. **********In London, Cadbury Schweppes closed on Friday at 433 pence a share, 20.6 percent below its 52-week high, reached in January, of 545 pence, and 11.6 percent down from its summer peak of around 490 pence. **********In New York, its American depository receipts, which represent four shares, closed at $27.25, down nearly 16 percent from their high for 1994. **********The culprit, more than anything else, has been a resurgence in the cola wars in Britain. Cadbury Schweppes is 51 percent owner of Coca-Cola and Schweppes Beverages, the bottler for Coke in Britain. The British beverage business accounts for 24 percent of Cadbury Schweppes's operating profit. **********Coke and Pepsi fight it out here as they do elsewhere, but this year the competition has been complicated -- and intensified -- by the appearance of two potentially powerful new products: private label colas sold by some of Britain's largest supermarket chains, and Virgin Cola, which was introduced by Richard Branson, the entrepreneur who owns Virgin Atlantic Airways. (The largest of the private label colas, J. Sainsbury's Classic Cola, and Virgin Cola are both manufactured under contract by the Cott Corporation of Canada.) **********Coke's sales continue to grow in Britain, but it has been losing market share. Taylor Nelson AGB, a market research firm, reported in December that Coke's market share in supermarket purchases in Britain fell below 50 percent for the first time in November. The firm said Coke had a 42 percent share in the last week of November, down from 54 percent in October. **********The cola war has investors worried that profit growth in Cadbury's beverage business will slow or reverse, especially since the competition has sent retail prices down by 15 percent this year. **********Large supermarket chains, where the fight is currently most intense, account for a relatively small portion of the company's total sales and earnings, said Edouard de Boisgelin, an analyst at Merrill Lynch in London. Still, he said, the competition is not going to help earnings or investor sentiment toward the stock. **********\"Margins are likely to be negatively affected,\" Mr. de Boisgelin said. \"It will put pressure on part of their business.\" **********Mr. de Boisgelin said Cadbury Schweppes is a \"good, solid, well-managed company.\" But he said the cola wars and other questions hanging over the company make him neutral on the stock, which he said was likely to do no better than to track the overall market. **********Among the other questions swirling around Cadbury Schweppes are the extent to which it will be able to match last summer's strong soft drink sales, helped as they were by unusually warm weather in Europe, and perhaps most important, the company's long-term intentions toward the Dr Pepper/Seven-Up Companies, the American soft drink maker in which Cadbury already has a 25.9 percent stake. **********Cadbury has been debating for some time whether to try to acquire the rest of Dr Pepper/Seven-Up in a bid to solidify its position as the No. 3 soft-drink company in the United States and the world. In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in the United States in October, the company said it had had \"exploratory\" discussions about taking over Dr Pepper/Seven-Up, but had no firm plans. **********Dr Pepper/Seven-Up has so far resisted Cadbury's calls for a seat on its board, and it is unclear whether Cadbury could make an offer that would not provoke a hostile response. **********Any bid for Dr Pepper would probably require Cadbury to issue more shares through a rights offering to raise cash, a prospect that would force current holders to put up more money or see their holdings diluted. **********\"If they did take Dr Pepper on board at a very large cost, something that would require some form of equity issue, one has to question whether the market would be prepared to accept an issue of the magnitude required,\" said one London-based analyst who spoke on the condition of anonymity. **********\"The issue is whether as a result of the reduction in free cash flow that will be the inevitable result of the cola war in the U.K., the group's intention as far as expansion into other markets will be stymied,\" the analyst said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/03/business/market-place-kodak-taking-the-digital-plunge-will-line-up-with-computer-giants.html": {"writer_name": "John Holusha", "pub_date": "1995-04-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 564, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place; Kodak, taking the digital plunge, will line up with computer giants.", "print_headline": "Market Place; Kodak, taking the digital plunge, will line up with computer giants.", "body_text": " **********DESPITE misgivings by some analysts, the stock market appears to be applauding Eastman Kodak's decision to plunge into digital photography using alliances with some of the big players in the computer world. **********The price of Kodak's shares has been rising since early this year, when it became clear that the company planned to deal aggressively with the new computer-based technology, whatever the repercussions on its still lucrative chemical- film and sensitized-paper businesses. The shares, which were selling for about $46 late last year, had climbed to the low 50's before last week's announcement, and ended the week at $53.25. **********George M. C. Fisher, the former Motorola executive who became chairman of Kodak in December 1993, outlined a vision of electronic images, which would be easy to capture, manipulate, transmit and incorporate into documents. Adopting a computer style strategy, rather then the beloved Brownie of Kodak's past, he said most of the new electronic products were aimed at small businesses and home offices, rather than the broad consumer market. **********For example, the new DC 40 electronic camera, intended for use with desktop computers, is to be priced at less than $1,000. But Kodak executives said their eventual goal would be a price below $300, making it a consumer product. **********Mr. Fisher acknowledged that Kodak could not go it alone in the world of electronics and he announced agreements with I.B.M., Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard and Wang Laboratories to develop ways to move and use images once they have been captured, usually on chemical film. **********Mr. Fisher, who has a Ph.D. in mathematics, seemed to take particular delight in the wizardry that can compress the unwieldy mass of information needed to describe a color photograph into a code that could be written onto the magnetic stripe of a credit card or a bar code on a check. This would allow sales clerks to view the photograph of a card's authorized user on a point-of-sale terminal to deter fraud. **********B. Alex Henderson, who follows Kodak for Prudential Securities, said that for all the alliances and technical dazzle, Kodak's announcement left the financial benefits unclear. **********\"The printers, scanners and recording devices they announced are pretty much commodity items,\" he said. \"It is difficult to determine how much the new products will cannibalize older ones and difficult in long terms to see how they will make any more money.\" **********Mr. Henderson said Kodak's example of how the company is supplying Empire Blue Cross/ Blue Shield with optical scanners and storage devices to cope with an avalanche of paperwork was a good illustration of the substitution problem. \"They have a $750-million-a-year microfiche business,\" he said. \"What happens to that?\" **********Kodak executives acknowledged that commanding premium prices for devices and software is difficult in an open-systems environment. \"You practically have to give things away to establish a standard,\" said Carl E. Gustin Jr., the manager of digital imaging operations. **********But they said it was necessary to develop a coherent system for electronic photography to complement film-based picture taking and to encourage people to take advantage of the ease of electronic enlarging, correcting and cropping to do more with their images. Mr. Fisher said fewer than 3 percent of all photographs taken are reprinted and fewer than 1 percent enlarged. If electronics can bump these percentages up by even modest amounts, it will mean important new revenues for the company, he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/16/world/omagh-journal-at-the-rainbow-s-end-gold-and-a-donnybrook.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Stevenson", "pub_date": "1995-06-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 932, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Omagh Journal; At the Rainbow's End, Gold and a Donnybrook", "print_headline": "Omagh Journal; At the Rainbow's End, Gold and a Donnybrook", "body_text": " **********Ten years ago, farmers here started noticing men traipsing unannounced through their fields, digging holes and hammering at rocks in the bogs and pastures that cover the area's rolling hills. All kinds of rumors spread, including one that the Government had found uranium and that the whole region was radioactive. **********One day a few years later a man appeared at Bertie and Gladys Kerr's farmhouse door. He wanted to take soil samples on their property, maybe do a little digging. Mr. Kerr asked why. Gold, the man said. **********The Kerrs laughed in his face, but said go ahead. **********Much to the surprise of the Kerrs and a lot of other people, several more years of digging and testing panned out, so to speak. There is gold in them thar bogs, and silver too. **********Omagh Minerals, a company formed to exploit the discovery, has already dug several exploratory trenches. In May, after a long battle with the project's opponents, it won approval from the Government to build a processing plant and to begin extracting ore from a trench half a mile long, 300 feet wide and 120 feet deep. Ultimately, the company could apply to open mines in two dozen other nearby sites that, it says, show equal potential. **********Garry Phelan, one of the prospectors who made the discovery and now the manager of Omagh Minerals, said there is enough gold and silver in the rock beneath the area to make Omagh, a town of 25,000 people, the site of the only commercially viable gold and silver mine in Britain or Ireland. The company hopes the mining can get under way next year, producing 12,000 ounces of gold and 15,000 ounces of silver a year, worth around $6 million, Mr. Phelan said. **********But if the discovery was the most astounding thing to happen around here in memory, it also created a split in the community nearly as wide as the Protestant-Catholic rift that has long defined relationships in Northern Ireland. The latest dispute pits two forces that run powerfully through the region -- economic pragmatism and environmentalism. **********\"It's an untarnished landscape, and that's its true value,\" said Ed Winters, a photographer whose home overlooks the site of the proposed open-pit mine. \"To extract a few grams of gold and risk ruining that area is a totally unsatisfactory legacy for future generations.\" **********There's no risk entailed at all, especially not with all the environmental regulation imposed by the Government, Mr. Phelan said. **********There would be dozens of jobs at the mine, he said. Moreover, the project's backers are touting plans to develop a local jewelry-making industry to use the gold and silver, and to use the publicity to bring in tourists, perhaps creating scores more jobs here, in the middle of Northern Ireland 60 miles west of Belfast. **********With the unemployment rate running well into the teens and few new employers in the area, Mr. Phelan said the project could create a windfall not just for the mining company and the farmers lucky enough to own the land, but for the entire region. **********\"This is the beginning of a long-term project and a long-term industry,\" Mr. Phelan said. **********Mr. Winter and other opponents said they would fight on to block the project, though they have few legal options open to them. Even as some of their neighbors tally up their possible riches -- a handful of farm families like the Kerrs have agreed to sell portions of their land to Omagh Minerals for amounts rumored to run well into the hundreds of thousands of dollars -- and others wonder about getting jobs, the opponents continue to emphasize that there is another side to gold mining. **********Though the mining company has pledged to fill in the mines and replant the area after excavation is done, opponents talk of the scars that could be left on the bleakly beautiful countryside by the digging. **********Then there is the use of highly toxic sodium cyanide to help remove the microscopic gold flecks from the rock around them, and the question of how effectively the waste from the process can be cleaned up before being discharged into the Creevan Burn, the river that runs through the area. The biggest employer in the area, Nestle, which makes milk powder at a plant not far from the proposed mine site, has opposed the mining plan, saying it feared the risk of pollution and contamination of the local milk supply. **********With Northern Ireland's sectarian strife as background, the predominantly Catholic nationalist parties, the majority on the city council, oppose the project. The Protestant unionist parties support it. (Among the area's residents, however, religion seemed to have little to do with their position.) **********\"Most people we talk to are happy about it,\" said Mrs. Kerr, who said she and her husband were selling 38 acres to the mining company; she would not name the price. \"I don't know anything about gold mining, but it should be good for the county and good for the town.\" **********Mr. Winters, though, said townspeople were deluding themselves into thinking that mining could be environmentally benign, or even that it would create lots of jobs and lure tourists. **********\"It's not like you're going to have lumps of gold being turned into leprechauns at the local shop,\" Mr. Winters said. \"We're going to be on the map for a different reason, and that's because its going to be a giant disaster.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/10/world/secret-guatemalan-military-unit-linked-to-cia-dies-and-is-born-again.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-04-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1785, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Secret Guatemalan Military Unit, Linked to C.I.A., Dies and Is Born Again", "print_headline": "Secret Guatemalan Military Unit, Linked to C.I.A., Dies and Is Born Again", "body_text": " **********The following article is based on reporting by Clifford Krauss in Guatemala City and Tim Weiner in Washington and was written by Mr. Weiner. **********The enormous building under construction on Seventh Avenue in downtown Guatemala City is supposed to be an icon of reform -- the headquarters of a new civilian intelligence service. **********Officially, that new service will replace the disbanded, despotic unit known as \"the Archivo,\" whose ranks have included the Guatemalan colonel and C.I.A. agent linked to the 1990 slaying of an American citizen. **********But the Archivo -- which for years spied on and sometimes murdered Guatemalans -- is still in business, though under a different name, foreign diplomats and a former Guatemalan Defense Minister say. And death-squad killings, torture and the arbitrary detention of peasants, students, academic figures and political leaders are still going on Guatemala, the United Nations mission there reported in March. **********The half-completed building is a freeze-frame image of where things stand today within Guatemala's intelligence services -- somewhere between brutal repression and unrealized reform. **********The Clinton Administration suspended most of the covert aid flowing from the Central Intelligence Agency to the Guatemalan military last week, preserving only a counternarcotics program. But the deep and tangled connections between the C.I.A. and its \"assets\" in Guatemala continue to enhance the military's dominance as civilians try to secure control of the nation's politics. **********The question of who paid for the building seems to be a sensitive one. A construction company executive working on the project, Jesus Garcia, said it would be a Defense Ministry office. Asked where the money came from, he laughed nervously. Not the Defense Ministry, he said, but \"another agency that I can't identify, exactly.\" A senior State Department official involved in Guatemala policy, asked if any American money went toward construction of the building, replied: \"I don't think I can get into that. There shouldn't be.\" **********The State Department official said the question could only be answered by the Clinton Administration's sweeping investigation of C.I.A. involvement in Guatemala -- an elaborate search for facts that has proved so difficult that one senior White House official called it \"a total nightmare.\" **********The C.I.A.'s direct financial support for Guatemala's military intelligence services totaled roughly $30 million during the Reagan, Bush and Clinton Administrations, according to United States intelligence officials. As the cold war wound down and Central America ceased to be a battlefield between the superpowers, it fell from a peak of about $4.5 million in 1989 to about $1 million this year. **********The Administration is now assessing what the agency received in return for its money and what role the C.I.A. should play in Guatemala's future. Partnership  The C.I.A.'s Goal: Trade and Gather **********The C.I.A. and its defenders in Congress and the State Department say the agency's Guatemala station worked hard to instill professionalism and discipline in hundreds of intelligence officers in the Central American nation, which has the worst human rights record in the region. But critics say the agency's efforts were offset by its abundant support for a military that was essentially waging war against civilians. **********The C.I.A.'s role in Guatemala was also to supply information for policymakers in Washington. That effort is now being viewed in a harsh light. **********Faced with appeals in 1990 and 1991 to find the officers who ordered the killing of Michael DeVine, the American innkeeper murdered in Guatemala, the C.I.A. could not provide the information that its own agent, Col. Julio Roberto Alpirez, was implicated in the killing. **********In 1992, the C.I.A. turned to its sources inside the Guatemalan military for information on human rights problems. That reliance helped produce an agency report that Senator William S. Cohen, a Maine Republican and a member of the Senate intelligence committee, described last week as \"deliberately designed to mislead\" the United States Congress. **********The same critics in Congress and the State Department who say the C.I.A has undermined human rights policy on Guatemala say the agency did good work when its focus shifted from the war on Communism to the war on drugs in the early 1990's. **********An estimated 70 tons a year of Colombian cocaine flow through Guatemala en route to the United States. Under the agency's guidance, the Guatemalan military has infiltrated cocaine-trafficking organizations and stopped some big shipments, State Department officials say. **********\"The only reason to have a C.I.A. station down there is because of the war on drugs,\" said Thomas F. Stroock, the Ambassador to Guatemala from 1989 to 1992. \"But if you're going to interdict drugs, you have to use the agency involved in the country. Unfortunately, in Guatemala, that's the army. **********\"At the same time you're beating these people over the head because of human rights, you're using them to stop drugs,\" he said. \"It's a dilemma.\" **********The Guatemalan military has the power to stop United States drug operations any time it wishes. At least 10 current and former Guatemalan military officers have been identified by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration and other agencies as suspects in cocaine trafficking. And \"officers strongly suspected of trafficking in narcotics rarely face criminal prosecution,\" according to a recent State Department report. **********In one recent example, a lieutenant colonel in the Guatemalan Army, Carlos Ochoa Ruiz, was indicted in Florida on charges of shipping more than 1,000 pounds of Colombian cocaine through Guatemala. In March 1994, the highest-ranking justice in Guatemala, Epaminondas Gonzalez Dubon, president of the Constitutional Court, ruled in favor of Colonel Ochoa's extradition to the United States. A few days later, four men assassinated the justice. Personnel  The Hard-Liners And Their Heirs **********The public revelations about the C.I.A.'s relationships with senior Guatemalan military officers have deepened tensions between two factions in the army, the hard-liners and the modernizers. **********Diplomats and analysts say both groups have poor human rights records and share the goal of maintaining strict order through repression to preserve military control.  Both have long ties to the C.I.A. **********But while some members of the old guard are involved in traditional economic crimes like car theft, smuggling timber and working in concert with drug smugglers, the modernizers tend to steer clear of those areas. \"The hard-liners are out of Godfather I, and the modernizers would fit in Godfather III,\" said a South American diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"They prefer clean businesses like telecommunications, banks and property.\" **********The old guard fervently opposes any meaningful form of civilian rule. Although Guatemala has had a civilian President since 1986, the army and military intelligence services still wield power in every domain of public life. **********The modernizers also want to protect the military's immense power but realize that it needs to adapt to the changing political mood in Central America and to the end of the cold war. In the late 1980's, they grasped that international criticism of the army's human rights violations -- it has killed some 110,000 Guatemalans during the last three decades -- required at least the appearance of civilian leadership and skilled use of the language of democracy. **********The idea was that the people need a little political breathing space, although they should be arrested if they got out of line. \"Let the trade unions organize, let students demonstrate and repress them only selectively,\" is how Jennifer Schirmer, an American anthropologist, sums up their philosophy. Ms. Schirmer has interviewed dozens of officers for a forthcoming book on the Guatemalan military. **********A turning point for the modernizers came in the late 1980's, in part from conversations that Hector Gramajo, then the Defense Minister, said he had with the C.I.A.'s station chief. The station chief from 1988 to 1991 was a former National Security Council staffer with a geopolitical flair. The former station chief still serves as a C.I.A. officer but is now based at the agency's headquarters. **********General Gramajo, now retired from the Army said he advised the station chief to win over the hard-liners with money and military equipment. **********The station chief, while still supporting the modernizers, took his advice. After December 1990, when the United States angrily cut off overt military assistance to Guatemala because of the military's stonewalling in the DeVine case, the C.I.A. continued to send covert aid, disbursing an estimated $10 million before that support was suspended last week. **********Based partly on information supplied by the station chief, the policy of the United States evolved to support the modernizers in the military, analysts say. \"The C.I.A. wants information from everybody, but when it tries to promote officers it seeks to promote the modernizers,\" said Gabriel Aguilera Peralta, a political scientist who heads International Relations and Security Studies at the Latin American Faculty of Social Sciences, a Guatemala City think tank. An Administration official who monitors Guatemala agreed with Mr. Aguilera's analysis. **********The modernizers are the reason why \"the Archivo doesn't exist by that name, but it continues to exist,\" Mr. Aguilera said. \"The modernizers in the army want to legalize it and institutionalize it.\" Reshaping  Disbanded Agency Makes a Comeback **********In 1993, President Ramiro de Leon Carpio announced that he was abolishing the Archivo, which kept files on thousands of Guatemalans, tapped their telephones, read their mail and occasionally committed political assassinations. **********\"Officially, the Archivo doesn't exist,\" said General Gramajo, now a conservative presidential candidate. \"But it does exist -- until a new organization replaces it.\" **********He added that the new, supposedly civilian intelligence organization, whose creation still has not been approved by the Guatemalan congress, already \"has too much military orthodoxy\" imbedded in it. **********President de Leon Carpio, who was once the Government's human rights ombudsman, has recently become more supportive of the military -- particularly since the assassination of his cousin, a former presidential candidate. **********Last week he denied what the C.I.A. has tacitly affirmed -- that Colonel Alpirez was in the agency's pay and that the C.I.A.'s Guatemala station penetrated the highest ranks of the military. He rejects repeated reports by human rights groups that clandestine jails still hold political prisoners in Guatemala. **********But the United Nations mission in Guatemala reports that between Nov. 21, 1994, and Feb. 21, it received reports of 22 political assassinations, 10 attempted assassinations and 68 death threats against priests, labor leaders, teachers, public prosecutors and human rights campaigners. **********Meanwhile, hundreds of workers toiled on the enormous building one block south of the old Archivo headquarters, where death-squad vans have come and gone through military and civilian governments for the last two decades."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/25/business/spending-it-minding-your-business-breaking-up-doesnt-have-to-break.html": {"writer_name": "Laura Pedersen", "pub_date": "1995-06-25", "snippet": "Q.

And it's not just cheaper but often better, although it's not necessarily simpler. It's called divorce mediation, and despite some disadvantages for those bent on getting even, it's even winning over those matrimonial lawyers who would have the most to lose should mediation replace the adversarial system. Who knows, maybe someday mediated divorce will take its place alongside that other socioeconomic phenomenon, the smoke-free restaurant. **********Here's how it works: husband and wife select a single mediator, either a lawyer or a nonlawyer professional. Over several sessions in the mediator's office -- anywhere from 6 to 20 hours -- the partners work out the terms of their apartness. **********The angrier the couple and the more complex their assets, the longer it will take. If need be, specialists are called in to help clarify and settle issues like the sale of a house or the custody of children. **********After all issues have been resolved, a settlement is drawn up and signed by both parties. This legal document -- the cost varies with complexity -- is submitted to the court with other required papers, where it becomes part of the final divorce. **********Surprisingly, even though the mediation process is not binding and spouses can walk away, really angry couples can still benefit from it. \"Most couples, regardless of their level of animosity, can utilize mediation,\" says Margorie L. Engel, author of \"Divorce Help Sourcebook.\" The best mediators, she points out, are \"trained to deal not only with the legal but also with the emotional aspects of divorce.\" **********To Lenard Marlow, a Long Island divorce mediator, this approach is far superior to the unmediated variety, which he contends some of his fellow lawyers have turned into a game of legal chicken. \"In too many traditional divorces, the goal is for one side to come out a 'winner' and avoid being the 'loser,' \" he argues convincingly in his book \"Divorce and the Myth of Lawyers.\" He says, \"Lawyers can turn reasonable people into embittered enemies, not because they want to but because that's all they know how to do. The adversarial process makes it impossible for either side to reach an agreement, which forces the dispute into court where the judge then imposes an agreement which will please neither.\" **********Besides giving parties control over the outcome, a mediated divorce can be economical. While high-priced lawyers can cost $350 an hour or more and demand a five-figure retainer, many mediator-lawyers charge roughly $200 an hour and sometimes waive the retainer. Nonlawyer mediators generally charge less. Most mediators figure on an average of 10 sessions, plus document drafting, court fees and certified transcript. About $5,000 total, give or take. **********And cooperation can make things still cheaper. \"The more information you and your spouse voluntarily share, the less expensive divorce is likely to be,\" Ms. Engel writes. And remember, she warns, \"money spent for services solely to obtain ego satisfaction comes from money available to you, your spouse and your children.\" **********An even cheaper way to split up: forget the mediators and get the divorce yourself for less than $350 -- carfare included. Ms. Engel's book lists sources for do-it-yourself divorces in all 50 states. In New York, for instance, call the the Julius Blumberg company at (800) 529-6278 for a kit of divorce forms ($44.50 for New York City, $48.95 for elsewhere) and manuals like the \"Guide to Uncontested Divorce.\" **********Less confident do-it-yourselfers can buy the forms and kits and turn them over to paralegals to fill out. Steve Malkin, who runs a New York City firm called Divorce Kit Law Guides, will take you through the Blumberg kit -- including the filing -- for $175 plus court costs and optional transcript (212) 687-5790. **********Mr. Malkin's firm is one of a growing number of paralegal enterprises, listed in telephone books, whose clientele are mainly low-income couples with few assets to divvy up or fight over. \"They simply want to end their marriage, period,\" he says. He does not recommend the do-it-yourself divorce to those with children, 401(k) retirement plans, pensions or real estate. **********A \"successful divorce\" may sound like an oxymoron. After all, if divorce doesn't feel like failure, what does?

But the man who met with President Clinton in Washington today has changed all that in his three months as Ireland's Prime Minister. **********In an interview before he left on Tuesday, Mr. Bruton said his primary mission on his weeklong visit to the United States would be to advance a political settlement of the 25 years of sectarian guerrilla violence in Northern Ireland, to \"get a few messages into the political system about the need to get a balanced approach to this problem, to recognize the rights of both communities\" -- Northern Ireland's Protestant majority and its Roman Catholic minority. **********\"I think I'm realistic enough to know that people in America don't wake up every morning and ask what's happening in Ireland,\" Mr. Bruton said, discussing the timing of his visit. \"They think about Ireland maybe twice or three times a year in a serious way.\" St. Patrick's Day, he said, \"is one of those times.\" **********Mr. Bruton's meeting with President Clinton today was his first, but it was upstaged by another first encounter, that between the President and Gerry Adams, the political leader of the Irish Republican Army. **********Since he became Prime Minister quite unexpectedly last December in a maelstrom over a domestic issue in Irish politics, Mr. Bruton has become instrumental in trying to advance a settlement in Northern Ireland. **********But before he became Prime Minister, Mr. Bruton was a frequent critic of Mr. Adams and of the I.R.A.'s violent struggle to end British rule over Northern Ireland. The tall, balding, 47-year-old lawyer and gentleman farmer from rural County Meath was often described by Irish nationalists like Mr. Adams as a unionist -- a supporter of the Protestant leaders who want the North to remain part of Britain. **********Mr. Bruton, a Catholic, denies this, and he is generally considered to have moderated his views. But much of what Mr. Bruton said in the interview would seem likely to make Irish nationalists and their Irish-American supporters grind their teeth. **********Discussing Mr. Adams's refusal to make a categorical denunciation of the I.R.A. \"armed struggle\" even though the I.R.A. has observed a cease-fire for six and a half months, and Mr. Adams's hesitancy to discuss I.R.A. disarmament in the peace negotiations, Mr. Bruton said, \"The insistence on the maintenance of substantial amounts of arms is not consistent with saying you are entirely and exclusively willing in all circumstances only to use political, nonviolent methods.\" But he said the British and the unionists must also make concessions. **********Mr. Bruton's view of the republicans is a legacy of his party, Fine Gael. The grandfathers of many Fine Gael supporters defeated the republicans in the civil war that followed Irish independence from Britain in 1922, under a treaty that left the six counties of the North part of Britain. Today, Sinn Fein, the I.R.A.'s political wing, gets about one-third of the Catholic vote in the North, but not quite 2 percent in the Irish Republic. **********In polls taken a few weeks before Mr. Bruton took office, only 10 percent of the voters who responded said he was their choice to lead the country, and his party had not led a Government since 1987. But he was vaulted to power when Mr. Bruton's predecessor, Albert Reynolds, was forced from office after a scandal in which his Government was accused of failing to act in the case of a Catholic priest accused, and later convicted, of sexually abusing children in Northern Ireland. **********In recent weeks, the polls show him gaining in popularity and that more than half of the people are satisfied with him. **********He has been accused, mostly by political enemies, of being gruff with his party colleagues, some of whom had tried to oust him, and stiff and uncharismatic in leading Fine Gael in Parliamentary debates. His critics said he was unable to focus on a single issue for very long, but his supporters noted his intelligence and dedication to the art of government, which he has learned in 25 years as a member of Parliament. **********He also knows politics. When Mr. Reynolds's Government fell, he was able to make a deal with the Labor Party and the Democratic Left to form a center-left Government. He came into office charged not only with trying to advance the peace effort, but also with dealing with serious difficulties in the economy. While economic conditions have been improving, Ireland still has one of the highest unemployment rates in Europe -- about 16 percent. **********He is generally considered a liberal on social affairs, and his Government overcame strong opposition over the last two weeks to win final approval in Parliament for a measure guaranteeing women access to information about foreign abortion clinics. Mr. Bruton has indicated, however, that his Government will not take on a revision of the country's constitutional ban on abortion. Abortion is legal only if the woman's life is in danger. **********Asked whether his trip -- which includes visits to New York, Chicago and St. Louis -- was primarily to seek economic aid in Washington, he said: \"This is not a poor country. We have plenty of resources, education, talent. What we need from the United States is political support, political recognition, political encouragement.

Maughan, the chairman and chief executive of Salomon Brothers, and Robert E. Denham, the chairman and chief executive of its holding company, Salomon Inc., said executives' compensation in 1996 would be based on a combination of the firm's return on equity, the profits generated by their particular business unit and individual productivity. **********That has been the standard for determining compensation for top executives on Wall Street for as long as anyone can remember. And Salomon's return to it demonstrates how difficult it is for securities firms to tinker with pay, which eats up roughly half of their revenue and amounts to almost two-thirds of their annual costs. **********The return to the old system is also a defeat for Warren E. Buffett, the billionaire investor who owns roughly 20 percent of Salomon and has championed the notion that Wall Street executives should not expect to walk home with seven-figure salaries each year if shareholders failed to get a minimum return on equity. **********A spokesman for Salomon, Robert F. Baker Jr., said the firm had not abandoned its commitment to aligning the interests of its managing directors with the interests of shareholders. Rather, it has decided that \"business unit performance and individual performance are also important determinants of a person's compensation,\" he said. **********The compensation system put in place last October set a base salary of $400,000 for managing directors who work in businesses driven by client demand and promised them a bonus only if the firm achieved a return on equity of 7 percent. In most Wall Street firms, a professional's base salary is only a small fraction of his annual compensation, the bulk of which consists of a bonus. **********Many managing directors who were used to living on $1 million or more a year doubted that the firm would achieve the minimal return-on-equity requirements in 1995. **********Another source of tension was that managing directors in the proprietary trading unit, which trades about $2 billion of the firm's capital to generate the bulk of its annual earnings, were paid under a separate system that gave them a direct cut of the profits they generated without regard to return on equity. That meant that last year, when Salomon Brothers had an after-tax loss of $399 million, seven managing directors in proprietary trading took home a total of about $175 million. **********Furious over the perceived inequity, more than two dozen senior managing directors left this year. **********Earlier this month, the board voted to scrap the pay plan it adopted last fall, but yesterday was the first time Mr. Maughan and Mr. Denham sketched an outline of its replacement. They did not describe specifically how much a managing director could expect to make under the new plan, one managing director who attended the meeting said last night. **********They also told the managing directors they planned to unify the firm by bringing the proprietary trading unit under the same pay system."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/24/business/media-business-advertising-software-makes-strange-bedfellows-britain-microsoft.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Stevenson", "pub_date": "1995-08-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 760, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Software makes strange bedfellows in Britain as Microsoft and Murdoch team to push Windows 95.", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Software makes strange bedfellows in Britain as Microsoft and Murdoch team to push Windows 95.", "body_text": " **********IN the computer software business, the Microsoft Corporation is not known for treading lightly.

The paper is printing 1.5 million copies, 845,000 more than it usually sells. **********Credit for the giveaway is given in the paper to Microsoft.

The Times announced the giveaway plan yesterday in a front-page article. **********Neither side would disclose how much Microsoft is paying for the supplement, the advertising and its sponsorship of the giveaway. The Times said Microsoft was paying for \"the whole print run of the paper.\" But Andrew Lees, the director of desktop products for Microsoft in Britain, said at least some of the costs of producing and distributing the free copies of The Times would be borne by the paper. **********\"It's very much a joint effort,\" Mr. Lees said. **********Indeed, it was clear that both the paper and Microsoft expected to benefit from the arrangement. The Times, which cut its price last year to build circulation in a hotly competitive market, will get the paper into the hands of hundreds of thousands of additional readers who can see if they like it. Microsoft will not only benefit from getting its name and advertising in front of The Times's readers, but will also reap the rewards of the considerable publicity the plan generated yesterday. **********\"This is a landmark in newspaper publishing,\" Peter Stothard, editor of The Times, said in a statement. \"We are delighted that Microsoft has chosen The Times for its campaign and that more than 1.5 million readers will benefit from Britain's fastest-growing newspaper, many of them for the first time.\" **********The deal here is part of an enormous worldwide marketing effort by Microsoft. The company is beginning an advertising campaign with the Rolling Stones song \"Start Me Up\" in most major markets around the world today. And it has devised a series of promotions more reminiscent of the recording industry than the computer business, complete with parties and midnight store openings for consumers who cannot wait an extra minute to get their hands on the product. **********In the United States, the promotional frenzy includes an appearance by Jay Leno as host of the introductory ceremonies at Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Wash., television infomercials, newspaper supplements and the lighting of the Empire State Building in the logo colors of Windows 95. **********Heavy advertising by Microsoft and other computer companies and retailers has clearly helped to generate media attention for Windows 95. But only in Britain is Microsoft sponsoring an entire newspaper. **********What Microsoft hopes it will get, in addition to the chance to place its advertising in front of 1.5 million readers and reap the benefits from the publicity, is what it hopes will be \"fair and balanced\" coverage of the product in the editorial supplement to be carried by the paper, Mr. Lees said. **********Mr. Lees said that he had not yet seen the supplement, and that Microsoft had no editorial control over it. The supplement, though sponsored by Microsoft, was largely prepared by freelancers hired by The Times under the paper's direction. **********Mr. Lees probably does not need to worry.

But as these sub-Saharan nations face grave crises of debt, population growth, poverty and religious militancy, leaders in Washington and in the capitals of Western Europe are increasingly telling African governments that they will have to rely on their own meager resources to solve the continent's problems. **********According to a recent report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which monitors Western aid, the net flow of assistance to developing countries fell to $55.96 billion in 1993, down from $60.85 billion the year before. Aid to all of Africa accounts for about $20 billion a year. **********American assistance to sub-Saharan Africa has followed a similar trend, falling to $1.2 billion in 1992, the latest year for which complete figures are available, from a high of $1.72 billion in 1985.

The world around Africa is fast coming together, and this continent risks becoming the odd man out.\" **********Mr. Lake's comments followed the November elections, in which Republicans won control of Congress and began urging cuts in foreign aid, often singling out Africa. **********As they struggle to carry out Western-prescribed economic reforms that focus on privatizing industry, trimming government payrolls and paying off the huge debts that benefited dictators' personal accounts, Africa's new generation of democratic leaders is warning that the growing indifference of the West imperils the continent's democratic spring. **********A result, many say, will be the resurgence of military-led governments and a spread of misery and chaos throughout the continent. **********\"We are confronted with a series of grave inherited problems today, and if we do not receive the kind of help that we need, we will not make it,\" said Mali's President, Alpha Oumar Konare, an archeologist by training who was elected in 1992. **********\"This does not mean that we are stuck in a logic of eternal recipients, but the next two or three years will be critical for the future of democracy in Africa,\" he said. \"So far there has been a lot of sympathy from the West, but there has been no real premium for democracies here.\" **********Mali, a predominantly Muslim country of 9 million people who eke out an average per capita income of $280 a year and have a literacy rate of about 40 percent, is in many ways typical of the new democracies. **********For decades development experts have spoken of Mali, with its long stretch of the Niger River winding through a fertile, flooded delta, as a potential breadbasket for a region that has long imported large quantities of grain. But if it is ever to fulfill this potential, development experts say, Mali will require new injections of foreign capital and much technical aid. **********Diplomats also speak of this large landlocked country as a bulwark against the spread of Islamic militancy from its northern neighbor, Algeria. Already Mali faces a destabilizing conflict involving Tuareg tribesmen in the north, but any settlement has been thwarted by a lack of resources. **********At the same time, Mali's debt burden, contracted under years of dictatorship, consumes so much of the country's revenues that there is little left for development needs. **********Even though they have already sharply pared back their civil service, Malian officials say that giving priority to debt servicing, a requirement of staying in the good graces of Western financial institutions like the World Bank, has turned each month into a frantic juggling exercise to meet Government payrolls. **********\"Today our foreign debt is higher than our gross domestic product,\" said the Minister of Finance, Soumaila Cisse, who said 60 percent of fiscal receipts were used to service debt obligations. **********\"If we didn't have aid, we could not pay salaries. If we can't pay salaries, that means social disturbances, that means no scholarships for students, that means we give up on preparing for the future.\" **********In the current climate in the West, few expect large new infusions of aid to countries like Mali. Many development experts say debt forgiveness, particularly for payments owed to the World Bank, the biggest lender to Africa, will go a long way toward helping some of Africa's poorest countries get back on their feet economically. **********Officials with the World Bank say that they have long been in discussions with its leading contributors over debt relief, but that Western capitals have been unable to agree on a plan. **********Already, many experts in the United States say inaction in the early part of this decade by the West may have squandered a crucial opportunity to help consolidate democracy in Africa. **********\"When you looked at Benin and Mali and Zambia and the experiences of several other places, it appeared at the beginning of the decade that what was happening in Africa would just overwhelm despotism,\" said Makau wa Mutua, director of the human rights project at Harvard Law School. **********\"The values so long preached by the West were being realized in fact, and many of us naively thought that the West would have shown patience in nurturing democratic movement, not just in Eastern Europe but in Africa too.\" **********Instead, he and other critics say, after a burst of enthusiasm for the changes sweeping the continent, Washington and other Western capitals turned their interest elsewhere. **********Experts like Mr. Mutua said the West's short-lived attention to Africa has had a doubly negative impact. On the one hand, dictators who might have been persuaded to make way for democratic systems interpreted the relative silence as acquiescence in their continued rule. The result, many say, has been a strengthening of autocratic leaders in Nigeria, Kenya, Zaire, Togo and Cameroon who have been able to hold out against the democratic trend. **********On the other hand, the failure by the West to relieve economic misery in many newly democratic countries has discouraged Africans on democracy, and may ultimately fuel takeover attempts by new military or civilian dictators. **********\"In most of the countries where they have had elected democratic governments, the fundamental problem is that they are left with precisely the same economic and social problems they had before,\" said L.

Indeed, according to the 1994 American Information User survey, the number of part- and full-time telecommuters in the United States reached 9.1 million in 1994, up 20 percent from 1993. **********If this trend continues, in 50 years we will probably look back on our current commuter society as only a blip in history, an artifact of the industrial age sandwiched between the cottage industries of the last century and the information age of the next. As sociological, technological and environmental forces converge, we will no longer need to go to work. Our work will come to us. **********But a close examination of the A.I.U. statistics and several backup interviews indicate that the pace of change may be overstated. Most people are only inching toward their virtual offices, at times under duress. Telecommuting requires some significant adjustments, and the human factor is often a big obstacle. Consider these examples: *********** One woman said she had intended to continue telecommuting after her maternity leave, but found that she too often had to be at the office for meetings, files or last-minute projects. She also said her husband expected the laundry to be done more frequently when she was at home. Now, she rarely telecommutes. *********** A journalist with two preschool children recently bought a house about an hour-and-a-half commute from her job. When I suggested she set up a home office, she told me at length why it would never work for her. Not if you want to be a player. *********** A sales manager who tried tele commuting found that his staff hesitated to call him at home, kept their calls short and even apologized for the intrusions. He soon returned to working at the office every day. **********Additional data indicate that these workers are not alone. The A.I.U.'s statistics are based on a minimalist definition of a telecommuter as someone who works from home as little as one day a month during usual business hours. The group's finding that telecommuters work at home an average of 39.6 hours a month -- or only about 12 weeks a year -- means that most work is still done at the company office. **********Many companies were initially encouraged to use telecommuting by changes in the Federal Clean Air Act in 1990 that were intended to reduce pollution from autos. Their efforts were buoyed by concerns about commercial real estate costs -- telecommuting allowed them to eliminate office space -- and were applauded by a new generation of workers looking for family-friendly employers. Clearly, telecommuting must make economic sense. **********Most companies already profit by some work similar to telecommuting. Many salespeople enter orders on laptop computers directly from the customer's office. Also, people who work extensively with colleagues away from the office have already made many of the logistical adjustments to fax, E-mail and teleconferencing. For them, tele commuting is a simple and reasonable next step. **********Interviews have revealed few complaints about the technology.  But over and over people say that while telecommuting is a great idea, it is not for them. They need access to files, or have career concerns (\"out of sight, out of mind\"), or want to be available for impromptu meetings, or feel they can't supervise employees they can't see. **********To overcome these human factors, organizations must address more than technology and policy. In time, companies will rethink their work processes and human resources systems to reflect telecommuting as the standard rather than an exception to the rule. **********A national effort called Telecommute America -- whose founders include AT&T;, the Commerce Department and the Environmental Protection Agency -- is devoted to that goal, and this week it begins a national drive to convert another million workers into telecommuters by the end of next year. But it will be a real challenge. **********For, as with any other major change, managers and employees will creatively resist. And our work norms, culture and management systems will all need to be realigned. **********Personally, I know how hard it will be. When my husband moved into my home office a few months ago, his files and speaker phone calls were somewhat annoying. But what really set me off was his subtle expectation that I make lunch. I recently jested to his boss that, along with a laptop, fax and phone line, his company should provide marriage counseling for dual-career telecommuting couples. **********But who knows? Perhaps 50 years from now, the home office will be the standard.

That is because employee compensation costs rose overall just 2.9 percent in the 12 months through March, the narrowest year-to-year increase for civilian workers since the Government began publishing such figures in 1981. **********\"This confirms that there's no inflation push from wages,\" Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich said in an interview. The slight rise in benefits costs reflected employer scale-backs in coverage and greater reliance on health maintenance organizations, as well as requirements that employees shoulder a greater proportion of health costs. **********But although growth in pay and benefits was being held to no more than the inflation rate -- retail prices also climbed 2.9 percent over the last 12 months -- bond traders found something else to worry about in indications that the economy might not be as weak as some of them had thought. **********The price of long-term Treasury bonds ebbed after the Conference Board, a business-oriented research group, reported that that consumer confidence had jumped in April after a marginal March rise. **********\"The latest confidence readings show a strong increase in expectations for the next six months,\" Fabian Linden, executive director of the board's Consumer Research Center, said today in announcing the latest findings. \"Over the years, this component of the index has proven to be a reliable forecaster of economic trends.\" **********Based on a survey of 5,000 households, the consumer confidence index rose to 105.5 in April, its highest point in nearly five years, from 100.2 in March. Expectations for the next six month jumped to 97.8 from 90.1 after three straight declines. Assessment of the current situation edged up to 117 after the initial March figure of 117.1 was revised down to 115.3. **********Confidence ebbed, however, in four of the nation's nine regions, including the Middle Atlantic states. **********Another expansionary sign, at a time when many believe economic growth to be sharply slowing, was a report by the National Association of Realtors showing that sales of existing homes climbed 5.8 percent in March to an annual rate of 3.62 million, as milder weather encouraged buyers. **********\"The consumer still has some vigor,\" said Daniel Laufenberg, chief domestic economist at American Express Financial in Minneapolis. \"Maybe he hasn't landed yet,\" Mr. Laufenberg added, alluding to the so-called soft landing that policy makers are seeking to produce in the economy at large after more than a year of rapid growth. **********For many economists, though, the surprisingly tame Employment Cost Index warranted the most attention. **********Although wages and salaries rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in the first quarter, slightly more than the December quarter's six-tenths of 1 percent, this was more than offset by the sharp slowdown in benefits costs -- to two-tenths of 1 percent from seven-tenths of 1 percent the previous quarter. **********Ed Yardeni of C. J. Lawrence/ Deutsche Bank was particularly impressed by American business' increasing ability to keep its costs under control. Not only did overall compensation costs show the skimpiest increase on record last quarter, he said, but \"the benefits-inflation rate has been more than cut in half since 1990.\" Pay and benefits account for more than two-thirds of total business costs. **********According to Albert Schwenk, economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, somewhat more than half the benefits deceleration in the January-March period reflected lower costs for health care. In industries producing goods, benefits fell three-tenths of 1 percent, primarily because workers were paying a larger share out of their own pockets. Often, this takes the form of extra premiums or higher deductibles before insurance kicks in. **********Another way that companies save money is by inducing more of their employees to use the less expensive health maintenance organizations, rather than remaining in medical plans with no cost deterrent on which doctors they visit. **********In addition, companies saved money was through lower payments to funds that provide for workers injured on the job, Mr. Schwenk said. **********The other main benefits area is pension plans, where employers have been rapidly switching from traditional plans providing specific regular benefits for retirees to defined-contribution plans, like 401(k)'s, in which companies often make matching contributions to employee accounts and leave the responsibility for investment decisions to the employee. **********Joseph Liro, an economist at S. G. Warburg, called the latest reading of the Employment Cost Index \"extraordinarily reassuring\" evidence that inflation was likely to remain subdued through the rest of the current business cycle. He suggested that the past pattern of rapidly rising costs in fringe benefits had perhaps been \"permanently broken.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/28/world/diplomatic-moves-pressed-by-paris.html": {"writer_name": "Craig Whitney", "pub_date": "1995-05-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 844, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DIPLOMATIC MOVES PRESSED BY PARIS", "print_headline": "DIPLOMATIC MOVES PRESSED BY PARIS", "body_text": " **********After a pitched battle between French peacekeepers and Bosnian Serbs, France and its NATO allies renewed diplomatic efforts today to stop the violence and asked Russia to help persuade the Serbs to free United Nations troops seized as hostages. **********Although more than 150 French troops were among the 220 surrounded or held as human shields, France did not publicly repeat earlier threats to withdraw its three battalions from Bosnia. **********But the new French President, Jacques Chirac, authorized his troops to shoot back if they were attacked again.

They were courageous. They were prepared to die. For a bad cause, but what they did had nothing to do with that. They loved their country.\" **********Mr. Mitterrand's main message was that 50 years ago Europe had won a victory over itself and over the dark side of nationalism, and that the lessons of that struggle had yet to be learned all over the continent. **********But to some ears, he also seemed to be saying that if 18-year-old draftees into the German Army could be forgiven, so could the Nazi SS legions who perpetrated the worst atrocities. **********\"The only German soldiers whose courage I respect are those who deserted or rose up in revolt,\" said Jacques Attali, a former aide to Mr. Mitterrand who said he was in \"complete disagreement\" with the words the President had chosen. **********Alfred Grosser, a French professor of political science who has been one of the architects of postwar reconciliation with Germany, said, \"The President did not distinguish sufficiently between Germans who were responsible for atrocities and those who tried to resist them.\" **********Blurring this distinction, Professor Grosser said, violated the principle on which reconciliation rested: that victims of Nazi aggression in France could rebuild a relationship with Germans who had themselves been victimized by the Nazis or had not actively supported them. Mr. Mitterrand's office let his words speak for themselves. **********Mr. Mitterrand was not the first French President who had chosen not to make this distinction, which is just as fragile in France as in Germany and for the same reason: in both countries, only a small fraction of the population actively resisted. **********The myth, or the hope, that many more had their hearts in the right place was used by Konrad Adenauer and Charles de Gaulle to help build a new Europe. Mr. Mitterrand cultivated it himself, but unlike de Gaulle, who led the Free French from exile in London, he had compromised himself during the war. **********Only last year, Mr. Mitterrand acknowledged publicly that he had received a decoration from the collaborationist French Government in Vichy during the war for his work with veterans and former prisoners of war. He had been wounded and taken prisoner himself by the Germans in 1940, escaping in 1941 and making his way to Vichy because before the war he had shared many of the extreme-right nationalistic ideals supported by its leader, Marshal Philippe Petain. **********It was only in 1943 that Mr. Mitterrand joined the Resistance, though he never reconciled himself to its leader, de Gaulle. **********Mr. Mitterrand today continued the process of handing over the Government to his successor by accepting the resignation of his Prime Minister, Edouard Balladur, who lost out to Mr. Chirac for the presidency.

He contends that Sun Microsystems, by distributing Java freely over the Internet, will create an alternative software world that Microsoft will be unable to dominate. **********A Canadian who came to the United States to attend graduate school at Carnegie Mellon University in the late 1970's, Mr. Gosling had been a hacker from the days he discovered computers while hanging around at the University of Calgary at age 13. **********He had always been an electronics tinkerer.  \"I was always interested in building things, but in order to build things you have to have parts,\" he said. Software, whose parts are just digital ones and zeros, liberated him. **********The Java programming language is Mr. Gosling's second effort at transforming computing with a software design that permits programs to operate over computer networks. The first project, which he began shortly after arriving at Sun in 1984, was known as NEWS, or Network Extensible Windowing System. The idea -- radical at the time -- was to enable any computer screen on a network to display a program running on any other computer on the network. **********While NEWS never caught on as a commercial product, it did demonstrate the potential for distributing computer-processing power across a network. And it helped pave the way for today's so-called client/server computer networks, in which a network of desktop client computers can share programs that run on centrally located server machines. **********\"He has skills of making code very compact and very fast,\" said David Rosenthal, a software designer who joined Mr. Gosling's NEWS project after initial skepticism. **********Despite its technical success, the commercial failure of NEWS taught Mr. Gosling some valuable lessons. So did the near-failure of Java, which Mr. Gosling began working on as a secret project in 1991. Conceived as a programming language for interactive television and the consumer electronics industry, the Java project was originally called Oak and was at the heart of Sun's attempt to create software for set-top television controllers. **********\"We got seduced by the dark side of interactive television,\" he said. **********But by mid-1994, as the industry hype over interactive television was deflated by economic realities and a realization that neither the audiences nor the technology was ready for prime time, Sun and Mr. Gosling steered Java toward the Internet's World Wide Web -- where most of the real \"information highway\" action was starting to take place. **********Even if Java takes off and becomes an Internet standard, Sun Microsystems may receive little direct financial benefit, Mr. Gosling acknowledges, since most people will be getting it free. But indirectly, the overall growth of the Internet is a boon for Sun, whose network server computers are the most popular way for companies, agencies and universities to connect to the global computing web. \"Anything that contributes to the health of the Internet contributes to Sun's health as well,\" Mr. Gosling said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/22/business/company-news-delcor-ends-bid-for-national-gypsum.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-02-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 112, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DELCOR ENDS BID FOR NATIONAL GYPSUM", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; DELCOR ENDS BID FOR NATIONAL GYPSUM", "body_text": " **********After having had two acquisition offers rejected, Delcor Inc. dropped its takeover bid for the National Gypsum Company, the nation's second-largest wallboard manufacturer.

Pacific Telesis's share price lost 12.5 cents yesterday, closing at $30.875, on the New York Stock Exchange. **********\"This is a real challenge for us,\" said Lee Bauman, the vice president in charge of competition issues at Pacific Bell. \"We believe that all markets should be opened to all players.\" **********Pacific Bell, GTE and their would-be competitors have 30 days to respond to the proposal. After that, the Public Utilities Commission will issue final rules -- as early as June 21. Most telephone executives said they did not expect the commission's final regulations to differ substantially from the rules issued yesterday. **********To a certain extent, Pacific Bell is a victim of jurisdictional boundaries. California's Public Utilities Commission has authority over the state's local phone market, which comprises both local and toll calls. But the long-distance market is governed by Harold H. Greene, the Federal judge who ordered the breakup of AT&T's Bell System in 1984. **********California has aggressively sought to open up its markets: the state allowed long-distance companies to compete for toll calls starting in January. Judge Greene, however, has been extremely wary of allowing the regional Bells into the $66 billion long-distance business. **********\"This certainly puts Pacific Bell at a competitive disadvantage,\" said Ronald Altman, a telecommunications analyst at Furman Selz & Company. \"Given that all the competitors are there and are ready to go, they're going to lose share in the local market quickly.\" **********The commission said that the state's local market could be open to new competitors as early as June. But MCI executives said they did not expect to be able to offer local service in California until early next year. A spokeswoman for AT&T said the company was still studying the California rules, and that it was too early to say when AT&T might make a move. **********Mr. Bauman said that Pacific Bell objected to the plan because it would allow long-distance providers and cable companies to \"cherry pick\" business and affluent residential customers without guaranteeing that poorer residential customers would continue to receive reasonable phone rates. **********Pacific Bell and other regional Bell companies contend that they subsidize residential rates with revenue from more lucrative business and toll services. If Pacific Bell were to lose those profits to a long-distance provider like AT&T or a cable company like Time Warner, Mr. Bauman said, it might no longer be able to provide low, basic rates. **********Not surprisingly, the long-distance companies said they were generally pleased with the proposal. **********\"The commission has taken an important first step, and they plan to do this on a pretty reasonable schedule,\" said Stephen Bowen, a lawyer for MCI, and the spokesman for the California Telecommunications Coalition, a group of companies seeking to enter the state's local telephone market. **********Consumer-advocacy groups were more guarded in their appraisals. Thomas J. Long, a lawyer for Towards Utility Rate Normalization, a consumer watchdog group based in San Francisco, said that the proposal still allowed the local telephone company to charge customers for the right to keep their phone numbers if they changed carriers. **********\"We still have some reservations over whether these rules will allow true competition to develop,\" Mr. Long said. **********California's local market is considered a plum. And a spate of competitors are lining up to enter it. In addition to AT&T and MCI, they include Sprint and so-called competitive access providers like the Teleport Communications Group and MFS Communications. **********Industry analysts estimated that Pacific Bell controlled 80 percent of the local phone market and GTE 10 percent. **********Recent history shows that rivals can make quick inroads in the California market. Although long-distance companies have been allowed in the toll, or short-haul long-distance, business for only four months, Pacific Bell said that it had already lost 5 percent of that market."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/02/world/a-leak-in-ulster-peace-plan-stirs-a-storm.html": {"writer_name": "John Darnton", "pub_date": "1995-02-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1081, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Leak in Ulster Peace Plan Stirs a Storm", "print_headline": "A Leak in Ulster Peace Plan Stirs a Storm", "body_text": " **********Prospects for peace negotiations in Northern Ireland hit a snag today when details of a British-Irish plan to guide the talks were leaked to the press and published, provoking a storm of protest from unionist politicians of Ulster. **********The Protestant unionists, who want Northern Ireland to remain part of Britain, said the plan went too far in giving the Irish republic a role in running the affairs of the six counties of the north. In particular, they objected to a proposed joint north-south Irish authority that would have strong executive powers in certain areas and would deal directly with the European Union. **********To the unionists, this was too large a concession and it conjured up the slippery slope that is their ultimate nightmare, a trail of events leading to Irish unification. **********The publication of key sections of the draft document in The Times of London turned into a sudden crisis for the Government of Prime Minister John Major and threatened the delicate, 13-month search for a way out of 25 years of sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland. **********\"If this document were agreed by the British Government it will be regarded as a sellout,\" said David Trimble, a Member of Parliament from the dominant and moderate Ulster Unionist Party. \"It is completely unacceptable to unionists.\" **********Mr. Trimble said the unionists might not only refuse to join in negotiations on Northern Ireland, but they might also withdraw their support from the Conservative Government in Westminster, reducing Mr. Major's working majority in Parliament into a minority. **********The gravity of the response to the report was signaled by a special debate this afternoon in the House of Commons and by a televised address by the Prime Minister this evening. **********In his five-minute speech tonight, Mr. Major pleaded with the people of Northern Ireland not to jeopardize hopes for peace that have been raised by nearly six months without violence. He said talks with Dublin were continuing and promised that there was nothing to fear because \"nothing is going to be imposed on Northern Ireland.\" **********\"The Government is working for a peaceful future in Northern Ireland,\" Mr. Major said. \"Tonight I ask for time, and I ask for trust and I promise to pursue a lasting peace.\" **********Throughout the day, the Government was trying to put out fires ignited by the unionists, who represent the province's 950,000 Protestant majority. Government officials pointed out that the leaked document was only a draft, that it had not yet been signed and that even if the agreement had been struck, that the unionists could turn it down at the negotiating table or reject it in a referendum. **********\"This is not some blueprint to be imposed on the people of Northern Ireland,\" Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary, said in the House of Commons. He reiterated the Government's insistence that the document in no way envisioned joint authority over Ulster between Dublin and London. **********This was not enough to assuage the unionists. The Rev. Ian Paisley, whose Democratic Unionist Party is more extreme than the Ulster Unionist Party, thundered that it was all a sellout. \"The Secretary of State cannot expect any self-respecting unionist to sit down at the table if that is going to be on the agenda,\" he said. **********The document was, he charged, \"the price\" paid to get a deal with Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, the political arm of the I.R.A. **********James Molyneaux, who heads the Ulster Unionist Party in Parliament and controls its nine votes, which are crucial to Mr. Major, was more restrained. But even he indicated that he felt there had been double-dealing and that the parties of Northern Ireland have \"all been effectively excluded from discussions.\" **********Mr. Mayhew's job was made more difficult by the approach taken in The Times article. The first paragraph said that the document \"brings the prospect of a united Ireland closer than it has been at any time since partition in 1920.\" **********In a radio interview, Mr. Mayhew denounced that interpretation as \"rubbish.\" The Times was soundly thrashed on the floor of the House of Commons by several Members of Parliament for \"scandalous behavior\" that could derail the peace process. The newspaper said it had obtained the document \"from sources in Dublin,\" but several M.P.'s regarded that as a subterfuge. **********The new Irish Prime Minister, John Bruton, warning that the leak could damage \"the entire process towards peace and reconciliation,\" stood before the Irish Parliament and insisted there was no sign it had come from \"an Irish quarter.\" **********The document emerged from countless hours of talks between British and Irish officials. It is called a \"joint framework\" and is intended to provide an outline for negotiations involving all the parties of Northern Ireland, including the Protestant unionists and Sinn Fein. **********The central point, as disclosed by The Times, was the Irish authority with powers in such areas as agriculture, trade, education and health. It would contain representatives from both the Irish republic and the proposed reconstituted Northern Ireland Assembly. **********Particularly galling to the unionists was a provision that members of the Northern Ireland Assembly could not boycott the authority but would have to participate as a \"duty of service.\" They also objected to the ideas that the authority might handle much of the combined $2.2 billion in European Union assistance funds and that it was not clear what would happen if the authority broke down. **********Underlying their concerns was language in the document that said \"the body should be dynamic, enabling progressive extension of its functions to new areas.\" This aroused the fear that the authority could grow, hydralike, into something powerful enough to eventually bring about unification. **********Other points in the document suggested that Britain would change the Government of Ireland Act of 1920, which paved the way to partition, in exchange for the Irish Republic amending its Constitution to drop a territorial claim to the north. **********The document also pledged \"rigorous impartiality\" on the part of the British Government and a declaration of \"the birthright\" of everyone born in either jurisdiction to be part \"as of right\" of the Irish nation. This was seen as a means of reassuring nationalists in the north that they could still obtain Irish passports."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/25/business/executive-changes-449095.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-01-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 38, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Executive Changes", "print_headline": "Executive Changes", "body_text": " **********REEBOK INTERNATIONAL LTD., Stoughton, Mass., appointed Roberto Muller chief marketing officer and co-president of the Reebok brand.

Signals that American trackers thought might be coming from the pilot ceased, and a senior Bosnian Serb official, Jovan Zametica, told the CNN television network that the Serbs were not holding the pilot. **********The hostages released today were the second group to be freed; 121 were freed on Friday. Of the more than 320 seized after NATO planes launched bombing raids against Bosnian Serb arms depots last month, some were disarmed and held as hostages while others were surrounded and their movements restricted. It was unclear what, if any, the political significance the release of a second group of hostages would be. **********[ In Washington, a Clinton Administration official said \"we are not in a position to confirm\" that the peacekeepers had been released. The official repeated the United States position that the United Nations forces should not have been detained in the first place. **********[ In New York, United Nations officials said they were aware of the reports of the release but could not confirm it until the peacekeepers were delivered to their custody. United Nations officials did say, however, that the Government of Spain had confirmed the release of a Spanish soldier. ] **********News that more hostages were to be released on Tuesday came from Pale, the Bosnian Serb headquarters. The release was delayed for several hours. **********One bus carrying 58 hostages -- 43 Ukrainians, 14 Frenchmen and one Spaniard -- arrived in Zvornik on Tuesday. The remainder, which also included some British soldiers, arrived in a second bus at the border hours later. **********Among the factors that evidently persuaded the Bosnian Serbs to begin releasing hostages was the appearance in Pale of Mr. Stanisic, one of President Milosevic's most powerful aides. **********Mr. Stanisic commands fear as well as respect among Serbs, and the President's decision to use him as an emissary was a signal that he considers this matter gravely important. **********President Milosevic has staked his personal prestige on Mr. Stanisic's mission, announcing publicly that he expected all the hostages to be released soon and making the same promise in a telephone conversation with the French President, Jacques Chirac. **********Two Greek negotiators, Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and Defense Minister Gerasimos Arsenis, held a seven-hour session with Bosnian Serb leaders at their Pale headquarters on Monday night and Tuesday morning. Greece is the only NATO ally, and one of the few countries in the world, that maintains good relations with the Bosnian Serbs. **********Spokesmen for the Bosnian Serbs refused to confirm reports that they had promised the Greeks that they would soon release all the hostages they hold. Foreign leaders have insisted that all be released unconditionally. In Paris on Tuesday, French Prime Minister Alain Juppe reiterated the demand. **********\"I want to remind the Bosnian Serb leaders that we hold them directly and personally responsible for the fate of each one of the hostages, whether French or not, and this is no idle warning,\" Mr. Juppe said during an emergency debate in Parliament."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/21/business/goldman-struggles-to-produce-revenue.html": {"writer_name": "Stephanie Strom", "pub_date": "1995-09-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 799, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Goldman Struggles To Produce Revenue", "print_headline": "Goldman Struggles To Produce Revenue", "body_text": " **********While other Wall Street firms have reaped the rewards of a marketplace ripe with underwriting activity and huge mergers, a recent document shows that Goldman, Sachs & Company struggled to produce revenue and retain capital during the six months that ended on May 26. **********At $1.99 billion, the firm's revenues net of interest expenses were flat compared with the comparable period a year earlier, which was by all accounts one of the worst in Wall Street's history. **********Only by reducing its expenses by about 4.5 percent, to $1.49 billion, compared with $1.56 billion in the first six months of the previous fiscal year, did Goldman, Wall Street's last private partnership, wring out profits before taxes of $506 million, a 13 percent increase over the corresponding period a year ago. Sharply lower provisions for taxes, likely a result of the states in which Goldman is making its money in a particular quarter, also helped. **********Despite the better profits, Goldman's capital dropped slightly, to $4.71 billion, from $4.77 billion at the end of last year. Capital has become increasingly critical to firms on Wall Street because, as profits from their traditional advisory businesses decline, they are being forced to use their capital for investment purposes, or principal investing. That in turn forces them to accumulate additional capital to protect their balance sheets against the risk of such investing. **********And its return on net capital, similar to return on equity in a public company, halfway through this year is roughly 5 percent -- the same as it was last year, the firm's worst year ever. Partners could make a better return on their capital if they invested in Treasuries. **********The drop in return on capital stands in contrast to the return at the end of November 1993, the end of its fiscal year, of 22 percent. **********But Goldman partners said yesterday that while the firm had a difficult first half, its profits before taxes in the third quarter, which ended in August, almost equaled its profits before taxes in the first half. **********The document, an offering memorandum for $350 million of notes the firm is selling, raises a curtain on Goldman's performance that the public is rarely allowed to peek under. Its circulation comes against a backdrop of Goldman's bitter fight for control of Rockefeller Center, which has raised eyebrows on Wall Street, in Corporate America and among institutional investors. **********The firm, through its Whitehall Street Real Estate L.P. V, a fund that invests in distressed real estate, is squaring off against one of its biggest clients, the General Electric Company, by bidding for control of Rockefeller Center. General Electric is part of an investor group led by Sam Zell, the Chicago financier who is another Goldman client, that has struck a deal to acquire control of the real estate investment trust that is poised to acquire the trophy property once it emerges from bankruptcy protection. **********Goldman's efforts to unseat its clients is considered bad form on Wall Street, where client relationships are handled with kid gloves. **********But in the offering memorandum, Goldman makes it clear that principal investments, which run the risk of pitting investment bank against client, are becoming a more important part of its business. \"Goldman, Sachs has increasingly used its capital and funds under its management in a variety of activities that can be described as principal investing,\" the firm says in the document. **********The battle for Rockefeller Center is a prime example of that strategy. Whitehall and Goldman put up a $225 million loan to the real estate investment trust, Rockefeller Center Properties, that holds the mortgage on the center. To protect its investment and the investment of the clients for whom it manages money, Goldman is making clients it serves in an advisory capacity furious. **********\"The Goldman role in Rockefeller Center is rife with conflict,\" Mr. Zell said yesterday. At the same time Whitehall is fighting him in Rockefeller Center, Goldman investment bankers are working to sell Mr. Zell's mall holdings and to underwrite a bond offering for one of his public companies, for which it will receive handsome fees. **********But the trend toward principal investing is likely to increase as the firm continues to feel pressure to bolster profits. **********The offering memorandum gave a few glimpses of how that pressure may be increasing. Bankers and analysts were mystified, for example, by the precipitous drop in Goldman's net interest income, the interest a bank or investment bank makes on its investments less its interest expenses. **********The firm's net interest income plummeted in the fiscal first half, falling to $12.7 million from $283.6 million in the comparable period last year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/02/business/company-briefs-949095.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-03-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 75, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********GREAT WESTERN FINANCIAL CORP., Chatsworth, Calif., a holding company, said it was seeking to convert to a commercial bank from a savings and loan institution.

As the first step, you grab the latest version of Quicken, the best-selling personal finance software from Intuit Inc. **********Quicken, you've heard, is the most user-friendly product of its kind. But doubt creeps in as you start to pore over its 300-page user's guide. **********No need to fear, though. In just an hour or so, you can get the hang of the software and use it to print checks, pay bills and -- starting sometime this fall -- even do your banking from home. Spend a few more hours tinkering with Quicken, and you'll see its wide range of investment tools, which are not being used to full advantage by nearly 40 percent of buyers. **********Now accounting for almost 80 percent of the market for personal finance software, Quicken long ago outran its competitors, including Microsoft Money, which will soon introduce a new version. A distant third in the market is Managing Your Money, recently acquired from H & R Block by Nationsbank and Bank of America. **********Since last fall, Quicken's market lead has been enhanced by certain budgeting, forecasting and tax planning features. Intuit's goal is to help users understand not only where they have already spent their money, but also where their money will go down the road. Users can now create forecasts for specific financial situations -- like the purchase of a new mini-van. Before, Quicken offered forecasts for only five matters, including saving for college and refinancing a mortgage. **********While Quicken has never given technophobes much reason to moan, the latest version is clearly more user-friendly, offering everything from advice on how to use a computer mouse to an icon bar that you can customize to go to a frequent transaction. A new \"snapshot\" feature allows users to get an instant picture of their bottom lines with a single keystroke. This eliminates the task of having to run a series of financial reports and charts. **********So where do you start with Quicken? Like most products of its kind, Quicken just about installs itself. Users are ready to go in less than five minutes. After that, it's worth hooking into the 10-minute overview. The best way to get a quick read on Quicken's investment prowess, though, is to set up an investment account and start generating financial reports or charts with it. **********Try creating a \"where am I spending my money?\" report, as outlined in the \"101 tips and tricks\" booklet that comes with the new version, Quicken Deluxe. It will sort your financial transactions from the largest expenditure to the largest source of money. **********Quicken still has one serious drawback: there is no very fast way to get an overview of what it can do. Instead, you have to scan the instruction manual, pull down each menu option and explore. While Intuit is trying to address the problem, for now, the best way to learn about Quicken's uses is to go to the \"homebase,\" which was added last fall and offers information on popular features. **********To avoid wasting time, remember that everything put into Quicken needs to go into one of six basic \"accounts.\" One account is for banking transactions (for checking, savings and money market purposes), and the other accounts are for credit cards, cash, assets, liabilities and investments. While a single data file in Quicken can hold 255 related accounts, anyone who wants to use the software for both personal and business finances might be better off keeping separate files, each with separate accounts. To save time, assign a \"quick key\" to zip into an account used often. **********Quicken does have a number of relatively underappreciated features. For example, its loan planner can help you compute monthly mortgage payments, compare adjustable-rate loans, figure out the tax advantages of a mortgage, determine when a mortgage will be paid off and even make a mortgage fit a budget by making adjustments in other spending areas. **********Quicken still can't compute taxes for you. But it does contain a tax planner that lets you move tax information from Quicken to an external file that can be read by a tax-specific product like Intuit's Turbotax.  Quicken Deluxe also comes with a guidebook from tax experts, as well as a feature for assigning tax line items to various categories to make tax preparation faster and more accurate. **********To make the most out of Quicken's financial help, it's worth plunking down an extra $20 for Quicken Deluxe. While the standard version of the product is the one that Intuit claims is geared for novice investors, anyone looking for even simple portfolio management help would be better off sticking with the deluxe version. In addition to new tax tools, it contains a home inventory feature that tracks household goods and can generate detailed reports for insurance purposes. **********If you have a modem, Quicken Deluxe is also handy for retrieving the prices of more than 100,000 stocks, mutual funds and options, by either accessing a special \"900\" telephone number or using the basic services account on Compuserve. A portfolio can be updated daily. **********Quicken Deluxe comes in a CD-ROM version as well. Spring for it and you'll get not only multimedia tutorials on Quicken, but also a mutual fund selector that can be tailored to your financial goals. Or, if you prefer, use the CD-ROM to enter a computer-generated \"conference room\" and get interactive advice from the tiny, seated images of two personal finance gurus, Jane Bryant Quinn and Marshall Loeb. How's that for hand-holding? **********When it comes to more complex investment information, however, Quicken has its limits. It doesn't keep track of every change in tax law, for example, nor does it track aspects of certain sophisticated transactions like commodities trading. As for the mutual fund selector, while it keeps tabs on the historical performance of a fund, it can't be updated on-line unless you have a Compuserve account. Instead, users have to buy quarterly updates on floppy disks at $13.95 each, or $39.95 for four. **********To get the most out of Quicken's investment abilities, keep in mind that the best advice isn't in the hefty user's guide but in the tips booklet that comes with Quicken Deluxe. There, you'll find hints on recording stock buyouts and spinoffs, as well as tracking foreign currencies, employee stock options and family medical expenses. **********As you grow ever more confident with Quicken, you may look for new financial territories to conquer. One option might be to wait until this fall, when the next version of Quicken comes out. Or you could spring for Pocket Quicken, the pint-sized version used mostly by traveling business people to track travel expenses and to generate expense reports.  Pocket Quicken is loaded into one of the new devices called personal digital assistants and does not have any investment features. Data can be transferred, however, to a parent Quicken program at home. Come fall, Pocket Quicken will be available on its own handheld unit."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/22/business/company-news-shelton-bancorp-stock-jumps-12-on-takeover-plan.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1995-06-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 100, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SHELTON BANCORP STOCK JUMPS 12% ON TAKEOVER PLAN", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; SHELTON BANCORP STOCK JUMPS 12% ON TAKEOVER PLAN", "body_text": " **********Shares of Shelton Bancorp vaulted 12 percent yesterday after it was announced late on Tuesday that the company, based in Shelton, Conn., would be acquired by the Webster Financial Corporation of Waterbury, Conn., for about $29.4 million in stock.

D'Amato, the New York Republican, has introduced legislation to prohibit American companies or their foreign subsidiaries from doing business with Iran, arguing that the United States is \"subsidizing Iranian terrorism by purchasing their oil.\" **********The issue of the Iran trade ban poses a particularly difficult dilemma for the Administration because it represents a clash between two pillars of its foreign policy: its desire to promote American business around the world and its determination to punish countries it considers \"rogue states.\" **********The United States bans imports from Iran, but Iran is allowed to buy a wide range of nonlethal American goods, including consumer items, oil drilling and engineering equipment, chemicals and gas turbines. The United States is the eighth-largest exporter to Iran, far behind countries like Germany, Japan, France and Britain. **********Nearly two years after it unveiled a policy of \"dual containment\" to isolate both Iran and Iraq, the Administration still considers Iran an \"international outlaw\" that sponsors terrorism worldwide, opposes Middle East peace efforts and is involved in a crash program to develop nuclear weapons. **********Mr. Christopher has opened an international campaign to deprive Iran of equipment useful to its military and to oppose international lending and the rescheduling of Iran's debt. The Administration has also tried unsuccessfully to block a Russian deal to sell Iran two nuclear power reactors. **********As for Iraq, the United States has successfully headed off efforts by France and Russia to ease economic sanctions imposed after the country's forces invaded Kuwait more than four years ago. **********But acute economic deprivation has not eased President Saddam Hussein's firm grip on power in Iraq. And Mr. Hussein has challenged the international community once again by imprisoning two Americans who crossed into Iraqi territory this month. **********The State Department recommendation comes after President Clinton's executive order this month to block a $1 billion project by Conoco Inc. to develop two offshore oil and gas fields with Iran. Mr. Christopher is asking for a broader executive order that could perhaps be followed by legislation, a senior official said. **********The current rift in the Administration reflects the positions taken by various agencies last year over whether to sell Boeing 747's to Iran. The Commerce and Treasury departments and some senior officials in the Pentagon strongly favored the deal, but Mr. Christopher opposed it and ultimately prevailed. Iran bought European Airbus planes instead. **********When Administration officials are asked why, if Iran is truly an outlaw state, the United States does business with it at all, the answer is a practical one: If we don't trade, someone else will. **********The State Department has not decided whether to recommend a ban on exports to Iran, which totaled $328 million last year, down from $750 million in 1992. Nor has the department decided whether the trade ban should cover trade by foreign subsidiaries of American firms. **********Over the last several months, Mr. Christopher and Martin S. Indyk, the new Ambassador to Israel and until recently the senior Middle East specialist at the White House, have become increasingly uncomfortable with the inconsistency in the current policy. They argue that it has complicated Washington's efforts to persuade its allies to weaken their ties to Iran. **********Every time Mr. Christopher has raised the issue of Iran with Germany and Japan, they have cited the American oil purchases, officials said. Chancellor Helmut Kohl made that point publicly during his recent meeting at the White House with President Clinton, saying it was \"American companies, not German oil companies\" that were buying Iranian crude oil. **********Japan is Iran's largest customer for crude oil, and Japanese officials have told their American counterparts that they would not take part in efforts to isolate Iran economically. **********On the other hand, after intense American pressure, the Japanese have agreed to delay a loan for a dam project over the Karun River in Iran, and will send a senior emissary to Washington this weekend to inform Mr. Christopher of their decision, officials said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/25/business/most-wanted-showgirls-brings-the-curious-to-theaters.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-09-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 91, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Most Wanted; 'Showgirls' Brings the Curious to Theaters", "print_headline": "Most Wanted; 'Showgirls' Brings the Curious to Theaters", "body_text": " **********\"Showgirls,\" the Paul Verhoeven film about Las Vegas strippers, chorus girls and lap dancers which has received an NC-17 rating, was a weak second at the box office this weekend to \"Seven,\" the film, directed by David Fincher, about a string of murders.

Authors tour less, and many New York publishing houses shut down on Friday afternoons, with editors and executives wafting between holidays and the Hamptons. While books sell steadily, most bookstore owners and customers still look forward to the publishers' fall lists for the freshest, strongest titles of the year. **********This summer has been something of an exception, especially for fiction. Instead of waiting for the fall, trade-book publishers released a number of new novels by best-selling authors between June and August, including \"Beach Music\" (Talese/ Doubleday) by Pat Conroy; \"Memnoch the Devil\" (Alfred A. Knopf) by Anne Rice, and \"Rose Madder\" (Viking) by Stephen King. **********The publishers were hoping to get a head start on the fall competition. They were also copying the strategy of mass-market publishers, whose smaller, less-expensive paperbacks (the kind found in supermarkets and airports) enjoy wide distribution in summer, the peak beach-reading season. **********Consequently, this fall's hardcover roster is dominated by nonfiction -- biographies and memoirs being the largest category. **********Though the balance of fiction and nonfiction books varied among publishers, many houses have especially large nonfiction lists this fall, with fiction titles making up just a third of the releases from some publishers who normally split their lists evenly. **********Bookstores have been carrying more books from university presses, which tend toward more scholarly histories and biographies. **********That publishers experimented by moving fiction rather than nonfiction titles to the summer lists is not surprising. **********When it comes to summer sales, nonfiction is not nearly as popular as the romances and thrillers that are typical of mass-market lists. **********\"People just don't want to get themselves all worked up in the summer,\" said Carolyn K. Reidy, president and publisher of Simon & Schuster's adult trade division. \"They'd rather relax. That's why summer has always been a big season for mass-market fiction.\" **********Nonfiction books have generally been considered to be more reliable Christmas gifts than fiction titles, so nonfiction sales are particularly strong in the fall. And since nonfiction authors do not generally give public readings, publishers look to television talk and news shows, which often suspend production in the summer, for their best publicity. **********But book publishing is not scientific, and with every rule comes exceptions and counterexceptions. There are many strong novels and books of poetry coming out this fall, for example. **********An informal poll of more than 30 publishing houses offered a picture of general trends for this fall. **********Leading the lists were autobiographies, biographies and memoirs, which will be competing for shelf space with books on religion, values and spiritual journeys, as well as on self-help and business. And with an election year around the corner, publishers are also focusing on politics. **********On the fiction front, readers will find books by commercial authors, like Michael Crichton, as well as by so-called literary novelists, like Kazuo Ishiguro. **********But the big heave this fall is in nonfiction, where doorstop volumes will carry list prices as high as $50. **********Among the most anticipated memoirs are \"All Rivers Run to the Sea: Memoirs\" by Elie Wiesel (Alfred A. Knopf) and \"My American Journey\" by Colin Powell (Random House). **********Biographers, for their part, will chronicle the ups and downs of actors (Humphrey Bogart, Tom Cruise, James Dean, Betty Grable, Burt Lancaster, Barbra Streisand, John Wayne), musicians and composers (Noel Coward, Cole Porter, Buddy Holly, Alan Jay Lerner, Frank Sinatra, Kurt Weill), writers (Tennessee Williams, James Thurber) and politicians and celebrities. Senator Bob Dole is the subject of three books being published or republished. **********The fall lists also include big books about public policy, AIDS, terrorism and race. **********Among the most anticipated of these titles are \"It Takes a Village\" (Simon & Schuster), in which Hillary Rodham Clinton reflects on children's needs, and releases by Lamar Alexander and Mario Cuomo, who offer new visions of government with \"We Know What to Do\" (William Morrow) and \"Common Sense\" (Simon & Schuster), respectively. **********On race issues, Dinesh D'Souza's \"The End of Racism\" (Free Press) contends that racism is not the main obstacle for blacks today, and \"Facing Up to the American Dream\" (Princeton University Press) by Jennifer L. Hochschild, compares the successes of blacks and whites. **********There are also histories of the Vietnam War, immigration, the Romanov family and the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. **********On the fiction front, though some best-sellers defected to the summer list, readers can expect new books from Ann Beattie, Ken Follett, Carlos Fuentes, James Michener, Phillip Roth, Danielle Steel and Amy Tan, to name a few. **********First novels and books by lesser-known literary writers will get extra shelf space this fall, some of it left by the summer defectors. **********Random House, for instance, is hoping to do well with \"Range of Motion\" by Elizabeth Berg.

But, she said in an interview, additional steps are needed to strengthen the city's ability to deal with terrorism. **********More than a year ago, at the invitation of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which was evaluating the ability of the Federal Government to work with state and local agencies, representatives of several agencies met to test their response to a hypothetical terrorist attack. The situation involved a car going through a red light, a police chase, an arrest, the finding and spilling of an unknown substance in the car and the subsequent fatal illness of a police officer who handled the material. **********As the participants asked questions and sought clues, it became apparent that those arrested were part of a conspiracy and that the officer died of anthrax, which can be spread through bacterial warfare.

And it has assembled a cadre of medical and toxicologic experts in the city to advise on preparations and to be available in case of an attack. **********A critical factor in handling such attacks is making a quick and accurate identification of the toxic agent. **********\"The city has around-the-clock laboratory services that would enable it to make a diagnosis fairly rapidly, but perhaps not immediately because of the uncertainty of what to look for and the limitations of science,\" Dr. Hamburg said. **********Once a diagnosis of sarin or similar poison was made, the Health Department would send faxes to every hospital in the city to alert them and to advise on care for victims.

Starting with a 1,200-acre farm a little over a decade ago, Mr. Ferrell has increased his holdings fivefold, bought 1,100 head of cattle and the latest in tractors and combines, and started construction on the tallest farmhouse -- two stories -- and the biggest grain silos ever seen in these parts. **********One of his Mennonite neighbors recently cautioned that Mr. Ferrell was getting a \"big head.\" But his success is part of an agricultural boom that is thrusting Brazil into the world's top ranks of food exporters. **********Often overshadowed by Brazil's coastal industries, farming has been the country's fastest-growing sector since 1980. Over the last 15 years, farm production increased by 47 percent, while industrial production increased by just 11 percent. **********This farming boom has made Brazil one of the world's top five \"food powers\" despite the fact that since 1980, the acreage under cultivation in Brazil has remained the same, and Government subsidies have been cut in half. **********The productivity increases are a result of heavy investment in mechanization, typified by the brand new tractor and combines on Mr. Ferrell's farm. **********Critics note that Brazilian agribusiness grows food for export while a large portion of the country's 154 million people go hungry at home. **********\"How can it be that, in one of the largest grain-exporting nations in the world, we have 32 million people going hungry and 8 million rural workers without land?\" asked the Rev. Ricardo Rezende, a Roman Catholic priest who promotes the distribution of land to small Amazon homesteaders. **********The World Bank estimates that about 7 percent of Brazilian children under the age of 5 suffer from malnutrition. **********Big farmers respond that their efficiency keeps domestic food prices low and that their exports earn Brazil needed foreign exchange. **********Brazilian farmers are so successful that they trample national borders in search of cheap land. Today, Brazilian colonists plant and harvest one-third of the soy planted in Bolivia and Paraguay, and own 4 percent of Uruguay's land. **********But the region's \"Green Revolution\" is most visible here in the table-flat lands of the country's midwestern savannah, or cerrado. **********\"In 20 years, Brazil will be exporting throughout the world food produced in the cerrado,\" predicted Norman Borlaug, 81, the American agricultural scientist who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for research that helped bring about Asia's \"Green Revolution.\" **********Over the last 25 years, grain production in the cerrado has quadrupled to 20 million tons. And farmers only till 15 percent of the arable land in a region with an area equal to that of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Spain combined. **********\"I could never have done this back in the States,\" said Mr. Ferrell, a straightforward man who monitors truck weights from a gauge in his farmhouse kitchen. \"Last year, I bought a grain dryer. This year, I'm putting in the two storage bins.\" **********As a North American pioneer in a South American wilderness, Mr. Ferrell played it safe by buying a farm next door to 100 American Mennonite farmers in Rio Verde. **********\"People used to be kind of rough around here,\" he recalled of his first visit to Goias state in the 1970's. \"You know -- if you don't like 'em, shoot 'em -- that kind of thing.\" **********Posting a farm sign, a plow disk inscribed \"Filadelphia Ranch,\" Mr. Ferrell started farming surrounded by peace-loving neighbors with names like Koehn, Hibner, Mininger and Warkentin. He has seen his land values increase fivefold from the $100 an acre he and his father paid for their initial stake in 1981. **********\"I have been planting for 13 years, and I have never had a crop failure,\" Mr. Ferrell said. \"Some of the Mennonites have been here almost 30 years and they have never had a crop failure.\" **********With land fertile and cheap, and dependable rains, soy is grown more cheaply in Brazil's midwest than in the American Midwest. But there are considerable obstacles. **********\"We have a lot of trouble with transportation -- we are awful far from the ports,\" Mr. Ferrell said, referring to the Atlantic port of Santos, 600 miles southeast of here. Because of poorly maintained highways, a ton of Brazilian soy arrives at Santos costing more than a ton of American soy costs in New Orleans. **********Like farmers everywhere, Mr. Ferrell has little use for the flash of big cities. For their annual trip to the States, his family drives five hours to Brasilia, to catch a flight north. **********\"I went to Rio once, on my honeymoon,\" he said, referring to Rio de Janeiro, a beach metropolis viewed by many rural Brazilians as their country's sin city. \"They stole my pickup truck.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/16/world/returning-tutsi-herders-add-to-rwanda-s-strains.html": {"writer_name": "Donatella Lorch", "pub_date": "1995-04-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1052, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Returning Tutsi Herders Add to Rwanda's Strains", "print_headline": "Returning Tutsi Herders Add to Rwanda's Strains", "body_text": " **********\"On this road, wildlife is a priority,\" reads a huge billboard at the entrance of Akagera National Park. But not a single zebra or gazelle is to be seen on the paved road that winds for miles along the park border to the rolling savannah -- just two cranes hiding behind a bush. **********Instead, the hills and plains are dotted brown with long-horned cattle -- hundreds of thousands inching across the tawny grass, prodded by dogs and young boys with sticks. **********The cattle herds have arrived from Uganda in recent months with their owners, ethnic Tutsi who have lived in exile since fleeing massacres in Rwanda in 1959. These families have been returning since a rebel force dominated by the Tutsi minority came to power in Rwanda last summer. **********For decades, the struggle for arable land contributed to ethnic hatred between the Tutsi and the majority Hutu. Again and again, Hutu and Tutsi refugee groups have moved across borders, abandoning land to the other ethnic group until another ethnic uprising reversed the cycle. **********With arable land at a premium, the Government of this tiny, densely populated country has had little choice but to let returning families settle on this arid savannah bordering the 925-square-mile park. **********If it looks like an idyllic grazing area now, the area will soon bear all the signs of a catastrophe, Western relief officials warn. As the influx has gathered momentum in the past month, the herds have advanced 15 to 20 miles into the park, threatening its fragile ecosystem and pushing many of the wild animals into neighboring Tanzania. **********Alternating between swamp, savannah, forest, valleys and hills, Akagera National Park's remarkable topography has fed a diverse ecosystem of wildlife, from lions and leopards to gazelles, giraffes, elephants and birds. Herders say their cattle have been attacked by lions. **********More than 250,000 people and 700,000 head of cattle are now grazing in the Domaine de Chasse, a 130-square-mile hunting area bordering the park. **********Dry and infertile, this land can only support one-tenth of the present cattle population, wildlife officials say. Already it is infested with tse-tse flies, hoof and mouth disease and many other threats to the animals. And when the rains end next month, the water holes and the savannah will dry up, and the cattle will begin dying, Rwandan Government and relief officials say. **********There are no easy solutions. No arable land is available for these Rwandans, and the Government lacks the money to provide the basic services to support them here. Most are living in thatched huts covered by bright blue plastic tarpaulins issued by the United Nations. **********The returnees do not want to go back to Uganda, and the n Government there does not want them back. **********One idea would be to start slaughtering the cattle now and sell their meat. But there are no slaughterhouses here in Nyagatare, and no way to transport the meat. In any case, the herders are pastoralists whose culture is based on their cattle, and they are resisting efforts to cull their herds. **********\"Eventually the cows will be dying in thousands,\" said Chris Kille Kigezo, a Rwandan field assistant for the World Food Program whose own family fled to Uganda in 1959. \"Here everything is seen in cows. A man would rather have five sick cows than three healthy ones. Cows are the center of life.\" **********Their dilemma is a reminder that land shortages are one of the biggest problems facing Rwanda's leaders. **********Reintegrating the more than one million Tutsi who fled to Burundi, Uganda and Zaire in 1959 and have now returned with some two million Hutu who fled the advancing Tutsi rebel army last summer is the immediate challenge for the Rwandan Government. **********Sixty percent of the houses in the capital, Kigali, are still occupied by Rwandans who moved in after the city fell to the Tutsi army in July, officials say. The Government has said the previous owners can reclaim their houses, but residents are resisting, and for now there is no legal remedy for the dispossessed. **********With one-seventh of Rwanda's territory consisting of national parkland, the Government has begun to resettle some returnees in forests previously used by the military and in the Akagera hunting area. The Government acknowledges that the influx threatens the land and wildlife but insists that any delay in resettling people will only aggravate tensions. Ultimately, they say, the park might well be a necessary victim. **********\"We are saying this is a mother to all the problems,\" said Christine Umutoni, the Deputy Minister of Rehabilitation and Reintegration. \"It is very urgent to resolve if we are to avoid other social clashes. Our objective is not to destroy the park but to resettle people. We might be forced to use the park. **********\"It is not easy to settle people in virgin areas,\" she added. \"We need money for roads and water.\" **********The northern section of Akagera National Park was a front line during the civil war, and the border remains heavily mined -- another problem for the returnees. The park is still closed to tourism, and the main hotel is a military base. **********The Rwandan Government has begun a campaign to convince the pastoralists to cull their herds in exchange for larger plots of land. If there was a big slaughterhouse and a way to transport frozen beef, that might prove a success. The rest of Rwanda has hardly any cattle, and the Government is thinking about using some of the beef to feed the army. **********The beef could also be exported to Burundi and to Uganda. Since the Rwandan Tutsi started leaving Uganda with their herds, the price of meat in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, has more than doubled, relief officials note. **********For the moment, the problem is startup money. **********One 20-year-old returnee, Alex Nkubana, each day herds his 20 cattle and about 50 others belonging to friends to the nearest river, walking one and a half hours each way. **********\"The problems will start when the rains finish and the grass dies,\" he said. \"We will have to move our home and follow the water.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/28/business/philip-morris-annual-meeting-snubs-protests.html": {"writer_name": "Glenn Collins", "pub_date": "1995-04-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 884, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Philip Morris Annual Meeting Snubs Protests", "print_headline": "Philip Morris Annual Meeting Snubs Protests", "body_text": " **********At an often combative annual meeting of the Philip Morris Companies that was a magnet for anti-tobacco activists who tried to transform the proceedings into a cigarette circus, stockholders voted overwhelmingly today to elect management's slate of 14 directors. The victory trounced a symbolic protest vote that had been spearheaded by some of the company's large institutional shareholders. **********In addition, voters rejected by a wide margin six shareholder proposals that had been opposed by Philip Morris management. **********It was a showcase for a new, publicly confrontational, Geoffrey C. Bible, who ran his first annual meeting as the company's chairman and chief executive. Mr. Bible, keeping the two-hour meeting under firm control from the podium, not only used the opportunity to try to reassure investors about legal and regulatory challenges to tobacco, but also inveighed against \"plaintiff lawyers looking for clients, and for new ways of lining their purses.\" **********The company produces popular cigarette brands, including Marlboro and Virginia Slims, as well as food and beverage brands including Miller beer, Maxwell House coffee and Post cereal. **********An optimistic presentation by Mr. Bible was met with often hostile questions at the meeting, involving inquiries about the potential of risk for tobacco investors. Such concerns have spurred a battle with the pension funds, and are likely to keep doing so. **********\"We are going to keep close tabs on how the directors will be acting next year,\" said Anne Hansen, deputy director of the Council of Institutional Investors, a group of 100 pension funds whose assets exceed $800 billion. She called it \"gratifying\" that nearly a quarter of the shareholders voting had supported a resolution to scrutinize the pensions paid for outside directors. **********The council's largest member is the California Public Employees' Retirement System, or Calpers, the nation's biggest public pension fund and the largest institutional shareholder of Philip Morris among the public funds, with $365 million worth of stock. **********Its deputy executive director, Richard H. Koppes, led the movement to reject the company's slate of directors as a symbolic protest against Philip Morris's refusal to schedule a meeting between outside directors and institutional shareholders. **********But the company's choices for the 14-member board were resoundingly approved by 96 percent of the shareholders voting. \"Our purpose was to send a message,\" Mr. Koppes said in a telephone interview, \"and I hope we did.\" **********The company has, in fact, attempted to mend its shareholder fences. After several representatives of the big public funds walked out of a Manhattan meeting with management and several outside directors last September, DeDe Bartlett, the company's corporate secretary, was reassigned, and G. Penn Holsenbeck, a lawyer, replaced her. Fund managers say he has been trying to smooth relationships by visiting larger investors to hear their concerns. **********Industry executives say the board has been divided in its discussions of an appropriate response to the protesting shareholders. According to executives outside the company, the Philip Morris management has even offered a lucrative corporate-governance job to Mr. Koppes of Calpers, who turned it down. He and company spokesmen declined comment, and another spokesman for Philip Morris declined to answer questions about its board. **********During the meeting, members of Infact, an anti-tobacco group, held up pictures of people they said had died from smoking-related illnesses, and also presented 720 arriving shareholders with a spectacle: 22 protesters holding a 100-foot-long \"tobacco wall.\" It was a banner displaying photographs of \"cigarette victims and their families,\" a spokeswoman said, outside the company's sprawling manufacturing center here on Commerce Road. **********The tobacco opponents also made much of an impromptu remark by Mr. Bible that \"it would be sensible for pregnant women not to smoke.\" **********He made the comment in response to a question from Dr. Lori D. Karan, an assistant professor at the Medical College of Virginia, who asked, \"If your wife or daughter was pregnant, would you want her to smoke?\" **********It was \"the first time a tobacco company chief executive has admitted that there is a health problem with one group of smokers,\" said one of those at the meeting, the Rev. Michael Crosby, coordinator for the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility in Manhattan. \"He's opened the door to a Pandora's box of more and more litigation.\" **********Company spokesmen played down Mr. Bible's statement, saying tobacco manufacturers had long said that pregnant women concerned about smoking should consult their doctors. **********\"For years there has been a warning on cigarette packs that smoking 'may complicate pregnancy,' \" said Steven C. Parrish, who was named by the board today as Philip Morris's head of corporate affairs. **********News of the statement may have concerned Wall Street, as shares of Philip Morris edged down 12.5 cents to close at $67.625 on the New York Stock Exchange. **********The annual meeting was held in a friendly hometown auditorium equipped with soft maroon seats fitted with chrome ashtrays for the numerous smoker-stockholders in the audience. **********The meeting would ordinarily have been an occasion for dignified self-congratulation, since it took place only a week after the company had announced strong first-quarter gains in sales and market share. And two days before, its rival, RJR Nabisco Holdings, released disappointing earnings. **********Yet Mr. Bible may have set the tone when he said, \"We are not going to be anybody's punching bag.\" Many shareholders applauded him enthusiastically."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/16/world/world-news-briefs-us-warns-airlines-of-threat-in-east-asia.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-01-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 183, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "World News Briefs; U.S. Warns Airlines Of Threat in East Asia", "print_headline": "World News Briefs; U.S. Warns Airlines Of Threat in East Asia", "body_text": " **********The Federal Aviation Administration has ordered United States airlines flying to and from East Asia to increase security measures as a result of bomb threats, a State Department official said tonight. **********In the wake of the directive, a United Airlines jet, Flight 826 en route to Hawaii, returned to Tokyo today after F.A.A. investigators warned airline officials in Chicago that a bomb might have been planted on the plane.

It buys bills from the previous day's prescription sales at a slight discount, paying the pharmacist immediately and eliminating weeks of cash flow delays for drugstores. The Pharmacy Fund then collects from the health plans. **********Consumers with plastic cards that identify them as members of a health plan that pays all or part of a prescription now purchase roughly half the $40 billion in prescription drugs sold each year. As more drugs are paid for by third parties rather than by the customer standing across the counter, problems with slow and incomplete payments have become a $100 million headache for the nation's more than 50,000 pharmacies. **********While millions of other merchants are paid within days after credit card sales are approved by the bank that issues the card, pharmacists and others in the health care business are forced to endure long delays. The computer links connecting health plans and pharmacists are used to approve the dispensing of drugs, but not to speed payments. So, if the quick payment method catches on with drugstores, the owners of the Pharmacy Fund also hope to apply it to doctors, dentists and even hospitals. **********For now, the company -- founded by Fred B. Tartar, owner of the largest newspaper in Puerto Rico, El Vocero, and Jeffrey M. Green, the former head of a Citibank business that hoped to track consumer purchases and sell the information -- is operating a pilot project with about 100 pharmacies. **********But the company has partners with deep pockets -- a subsidiary of Zurich Insurance last year invested $5 million for a 5 percent ownership stake -- and Smith Barney is nearing completion of a private sale of $75 million of three-year notes. By June 1, Mr. Tarter said, the company plans to take on new customers. **********Small pharmacies, struggling to compete with the big chains that buy large quantities of prescription drugs at bargain-basement prices, are particularly vulnerable to the late payments and frequent errors that plague the industry. **********\"It used to take an average of 30 to 45 days to collect, and that tied up a ton of our money,\" said Louis J. Giannotti, the director of the pharmacy division at the Mayfair food store chain in Elizabeth, N.J. Now that the Pharmacy Fund makes it possible for him to collect only a day after a prescription is filled, \"a lot of the smaller chains like us have more ability to compete for contracts and take advantage of special merchandise offerings.\" **********There are other advantages for pharmacists in the accelerated payment system. Roger Malerba, owner of the Hylan Medicine Cabinet on Staten Island, said it was now easy to match, using his computer, the payments received from Pharmacy Fund with the prescriptions dispensed the previous day. When payment and paper printouts of drug sales were received weeks later, that accounting often kept two employees busy nearly full time. **********For the two or three of every 100 prescriptions that involves some problem, Pharmacy Fund reviews records to correct clerical mistakes. The remaining problems, such as large prescriptions of several hundred dollars or more that are not approved for payment because they are placed under review, the Pharmacy Fund does not advance funds to drugstores. But its computerized record system enables pharmacists to spot problems quickly so they can work to overcome them. **********Another aggravation for drugstores is the \"shrinkage\" that occurs when a pharmacy is paid less than it is entitled. Pharmacists usually just throw up their hands in despair at tracking down the cause and getting it corrected. **********\"You see lots of little discrepancies for 50 cents or a few dollars and I don't know any store owner who wouldn't consider them paid,\" Mr. Malerba said. \"You would spend more money chasing them down than it is worth.\" **********The payment plans that stand between pharmacists and insurers or managed care providers operate outside the regulated insurance industry. They range from giants like PCS, which was bought last year by Eli Lilly for $4 billion, to hundreds of small companies with little more than a few computers and a modem. **********PCS says it pays pharmacists within 14 days. But many health plans and the companies they hire to handle pharmacy bills take far longer. Mr. Greene said the Illinois Medicaid plan, for example, typically took 100 days to pay. Others may pay most bills in a few weeks, but hold up expensive prescriptions for a review that could last weeks. **********And then there are the claims that never get paid. Prescription Drugs Inc., a pharmacy plan administrator in Maryland, for example, went out of business in 1993, owing Rite Aid more than $929,000. **********To avoid such losses, Pharmacy Fund does its own evaluation of delays and risk of default at 3,500 insurers and health plans. It charges higher fees to pharmacies whose business depends more heavily on risky health plans; less for more reliable bill payers. On average, the Pharmacy Fund fee is 2 percent what the drugstore is owed. **********Mr. Tartar concedes that his idea could be imitated, but he says that would-be competitors should find it hard to catch up. Not only has Pharmacy Fund arranged financing through Smith Barney, but it also has an exclusive arrangement with the National Data Corporation, the Atlanta-based company with computer links to 48,000 drugstores that account for 70 percent of the electronic messages between drugstores and pharmacy payment plans. **********\"We can't take our business to anybody but National Data,\" Mr. Tartar said, \"and they can't handle other customers competing in our business.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/13/world/serb-says-files-link-milosevic-to-war-crimes.html": {"writer_name": "Roger Cohen", "pub_date": "1995-04-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2911, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Serb Says Files Link Milosevic To War Crimes", "print_headline": "Serb Says Files Link Milosevic To War Crimes", "body_text": " **********As Western governments seek to turn President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia into a peacemaker, a former senior member of the Serbian secret police has come forward with documents that could incriminate Mr. Milosevic as a war criminal. **********The former agent, Cedomir Mihailovic, 45, escaped from Serbia last October with a temporary passport provided by the Dutch Embassy in Belgrade, where officials believed his life was in danger. **********One document, dated May 24, 1992, appears to include directions from the Serbian state security services in Belgrade on running concentration camps in Bosnia. At that time, tens of thousands of Muslim civilians were already being tortured and sometimes killed in the camps, and the Milosevic government was beginning to deny active involvement in the conflict in Bosnia. **********\"It is urgently necessary to reduce the number of camps and to concentrate on two to three camps,\" says the order, which bears a signature of the head of state security at the Serbian Interior Ministry and is addressed to the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic. **********Another document includes orders from the state security services, which are in almost daily contact with Mr. Milosevic, to the Serbian paramilitary leader known as Arkan about the \"ethnic cleansing\" of the Bosnian town of Bijeljina and the killing of some Muslims there. **********In a dozen interviews, in which his accounts were consistent, Mr. Mihailovic presented a view from inside of the Milosevic government diametrically opposed to the Serbian political leaders' explanations of how 750,000 Muslims came to leave the 70 percent of Bosnia now controlled by Serbs. **********The Serbian President has always denied any such responsibility and has progressively sought to distance himself from the Bosnian war. He and Dr. Karadzic have claimed that Serbian militias may have done terrible things to Muslim civilians, but the forces were under no political direction and were responding to Muslim provocation, they add. **********No final word exists on the authenticity of the documents. \"The documents look pretty good, but we are not ready to give a final judgment that they are authentic,\" a senior United States official in Washington said after showing copies to the Central Intelligence Agency. **********The documents were delivered last October to the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague, and examined by the court and then by the Dutch internal security services, only to disappear. **********Those mysterious dealings between the tribunal and the Dutch agency might suggest concern by Western governments about the documents' possible effect at a time when President Milosevic stands center stage in international negotiations to end the war in Bosnia. **********\"If the originals have disappeared, there must be sufficient concern about their possible veracity for somebody in Western governments not to want them waved around in public,\" said an American official familiar with the case. The Documents Killings Ordered From the Top? **********On Oct. 6, 1994, the Dutch Embassy in Belgrade issued a temporary passport to Mr. Mihailovic, a former senior member of the Serbian secret police who said he possessed documents incriminating President Milosevic in war crimes in Bosnia. **********The decision to give him a Dutch passport was unusual, reflecting the embassy staff's conviction that he might be killed by the Serbian secret services he had just deserted. **********On Oct. 10, Hubertus van Schip, the administrative officer in the Dutch Embassy, traveled to the Macedonian capital, Skopje, where he met Mr. Mihailovic. They picked up the incriminating papers at Invest Bank, where, Mr. Mihailovic said, he had deposited them in a safe. **********Mr. Mihailovic and Mr. van Schip then took the documents to a Skopje pizzeria, where they were given to a United Nations official for dispatch to the International Tribunal in The Hague. **********\"We did not feel it appropriate that such sensitive documents should travel by diplomatic pouch, so we contacted the United Nations,\" a Dutch official said. **********If authentic, the documents are explosive. The five most sensitive include the one dated May 24, 1992, that appears to issue directions from the Serbian state security services in Belgrade on running concentration camps in Bosnia. It says 10 agents were to be sent from Belgrade to \"be distributed as prisoners in camps and prisons on your territory.\" These agents apparently would have gathered intelligence for the Serbs. **********That order, marked \"State Secret\" and carrying \"top secret number 778-11-3588-V-78/5-92,\" adds that six other agents were to work with the Bosnian Serb authorities to check prisoners' identities and select those to be transferred from Bosnia to Serbian-dominated Yugoslavia. **********Regarding the decision to reduce the number of camps, it says, \"Based on the findings of our services, there are indications that Western intelligence services may have passed information on the existence of the camps to their media so they may be exposed.\" **********Another document, dated April 3, 1992, and bearing \"top secret number 675-11-428-V-8/4-92,\" purports to be an order from the same state security section of the Serbian Interior Ministry to the Serbian paramilitary commander known as Arkan. It concerns the eviction and killing of Muslims in the Bijeljina, which was \"cleansed\" of Muslims at the start of the war. **********It says: \"The leadership of the S.D.A., Muslim members of MUP and the organizers of Muslim paramilitary formations should be arrested and transferred to Erdut. **********\"In order to frighten the Muslim population, a smaller number should be executed.\" **********The S.D.A. is the Muslim nationalist Party of Democratic Action of President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia, and MUP is an acronym for the Bosnian Interior Ministry police. Erdut, a Croatian town captured by the Serbs in 1991, is the headquarters of Arkan, whose real name is Zeljko Raznatovic. **********As Serbian militia leaders rampaged in Bosnia, they grew rich. How they did so is suggested in another of the documents. Dating from Nov. 19, 1991, this order from Sector V includes instructions to Arkan on what to do with booty seized from the fall of Vukovar. **********\"For the needs of the unit, keep 2,500,000 German marks and 15 kilograms of gold,\" it says. \"3,876,000 German marks, 375,780 dollars, 430,600 Swiss francs and 38 kilograms of gold will be taken by our agents in Erdut. **********\"All the fighters who have taken part in cleansing have to be searched and everything not belonging to them should be taken away.\" **********Mr. Mihailovic said he was one of the S.D.B. agents who went to Erdut at that time to collect money. Hooded prisoners were being killed with arrows fired from bows by Arkan's forces, he said. He shook his head. **********\"After a while, it's not just Croats,\" he said. \"It's not just Muslims. You see your own friends being killed for dirty reasons, and you can't stand it anymore.\" The Defector An Agent's View From Belgrade **********Nobody contests that Mr. Mihailovic held an influential position in the Serbian secret services, where he held identity number MUP 2675 and worked from 1991 until September 1994. **********American officials, and the chief prosecutor and his deputy at the United Nations Tribunal -- Justices Richard Goldstone and Graham Blewitt -- all agreed that Mr. Mihailovic had indeed worked as a Serbian agent. He was engaged principally in the financing of the Serbian war effort through Cyprus and the circumvention of an international trade embargo by dealing arms through Ukraine and elsewhere. **********Mr. Mihailovic said the initial Serbian onslaught on Bosnian Muslims, and the earlier attack on Vukovar, in eastern Croatia, were directed through President Milosevic's handpicked agents at the Center of the Department of State Security, in the Interior Ministry. This department was known in the former Yugoslavia as the Sluzba Drzave Bezbednosti, or S.D.B. **********The S.D.B. agents, Mr. Mihailovic said, trained, paid and issued orders to Serbian militia leaders like Arkan. These militiamen in turn terrorized the Muslims and so set \"ethnic cleansing\" in motion in Bosnia. **********\"From the beginning, Milosevic wanted his people in the S.D.B. to be the channels for Greater Serbia,\" said Mr. Mihailovic, who speaks good English. \"Unlike the army, this was Milosevic's handpicked apparatus, and he wanted the minimum of people to know. By using paramilitary groups, the appearance of disorder in Bosnia could be maintained.\" **********Under Mr. Milosevic, the Serbian police force has grown to about 130,000 people. Those who work for the S.D.B., and particularly Sector V, which deals with intelligence and counterintelligence, are the elite. **********\"The S.D.B. Sector V supplied the weapons and the training for the militias,\" Mr. Mihailovic said. \"Arkan himself was on the S.D.B. payroll from 1986, as a killer in the West able to obtain a passport in whatever name he wanted.\" The militias included the Serbian Volunteer Guard, nicknamed the Tigers, run by Arkan, and the Kninjas of Dragan Vasiljkovic (Captain Dragan). **********Mr. Mihailovic identified Jovica Stanisic, the overall head of the S.D.B. and a man who was heavily involved in Serbia's onslaught on Vukovar in 1991, as the most important official in the Serbian operation. Mr. Stanisic is the nacelnik, or chief, whose signature is on some of the documents, all of which emanate from Sector V of the S.D.B. **********Western diplomats in Belgrade said Mr. Stanisic speaks to Mr. Milosevic almost daily. **********Because the possession of top-secret documents of the kind Mr. Mihailovic claims to have is punishable by imprisonment in Serbia, it was impossible to present the papers for comment to the Serbian government or to the people named by Mr. Mihailovic. The Authenticity The Originals Have Disappeared **********The documents were delivered to the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague, which was established in 1993 to try people accused of war crimes. They were examined by the court and then by the internal security services, but have not been seen since. **********\"The formats are accurate, but we are hesitant to say they are real because the documents could be reconstructions of things Mr. Mihailovic did see,\" said a senior American official in Washington who has seen copies of the documents. The official, who plays a central role in the formulation of the Administration's Balkan policy, added, \"What seems clear is that the guy was in a position to know this information.\" **********One senior court official said one of the documents \"does not appear to be what it purports to be.\" The official would not say which of the documents or why, and no court official in The Hague was prepared to produce the results of forensic tests on the documents. **********In what seems to be a case of negligence or malfeasance, the original documents were lost in murky transactions between the tribunal and the Dutch secret services, for whom Mr. Mihailovic was put to work for several months. **********On Oct. 17, 1994, according to a statement from Justice Goldstone, the head of the tribunal, questioning of Mr. Mihailovic began in The Hague. This interrogation went on \"over a period of weeks\" while Mr. Mihailovic was housed at the court's expense. **********On Nov. 18, 1994, Simon Leach, the investigator on the Mihailovic case, acknowledged receipt of the documents in a letter and stated, \"The originals will be returned to Mr. Mihailovic or his agent in the near future.\" **********Instead, Mr. Leach said in a telephone interview, the documents were passed on to the Dutch internal security services, which took charge of Mr. Mihailovic after Dec. 1, 1994. Mr. Leach said that after that date he did not know where Mr. Mihailovic was and so could not return the documents directly to him. **********Justice Goldstone said that after Mr. Mihailovic came under the supervision of the \"Dutch authorities,\" the tribunal received a request from them saying Mr. Mihailovic required the original documents. **********\"These documents were in turn handed to the Dutch authorities in separate bundles on 12th January 1995 and 20th January 1995,\" Justice Goldstone wrote. **********And what did the Dutch secret services do with the original documents? **********Justice Goldstone, after repeated questioning, forwarded a copy of the receipt that the Dutch secret services say they obtained when handing back the documents to Mr. Mihailovic. That receipt is undated and faintly signed on a blank piece of paper. **********Shown the receipt, Mr. Mihailovic said: \"I have never seen this piece of paper, never signed it and never received my documents back. They are afraid because they know the documents are 100 percent genuine. Why on earth would I conceal the original documents if I had them?\" **********In a telephone conversation on March 20 between Mr. Leach and Mr. Mihailovic, Mr. Leach promised \"to do everything I can\" to return the documents. **********Yet, according to the tribunal, the documents had been handed back in January, two months earlier. It was only on April 4 that Judge Goldstone produced the \"receipt\" from the Dutch secret services. **********Mr. de Vries, the Dutch Interior Ministry spokesman, said, \"I can confirm that the Dutch authorities returned the documents.\" Asked if it was not unusual that a service of a Dutch ministry would issue an undated receipt, Mr. de Vries said, \"It could happen.\" The Fallout A Message No One Wanted to Hear **********Mr. Mihailovic's story -- of intrigue and arms smuggling -- clearly led the tribunal to view him with circumspection, possibly even as a double agent sent to provoke the court into action that could later be ridiculed. **********But in the interviews, Mr. Mihailovic presented a generally convincing picture of a man with a message nobody wants to hear. **********His flight from Serbia, he said, followed the killing in Zvornik, in northeastern Bosnia, of a close friend, Risto Djogo, the head of Bosnian Serb television in Pale, the headquarters of the Serbs in Bosnia. **********The killers have never been found. But Mr. Mihailovic said the killing, which took place on Sept. 10, was the work of Arkan's Tigers militia, which was in Zvornik on the night of Sept. 9 for a concert by the Serbian singer Ceca, who later married Arkan. **********For more than a month before his death, Mr. Djogo had been mocking Mr. Milosevic on Pale television for his decision in August to blockade the Bosnian Serbs for refusing to sign an international peace accord. **********Mr. Djogo and Mr. Mihailovic had also been jointly collecting videos and documents, some already deposited in the Skopje bank, that they thought might one day incriminate Mr. Milosevic. **********Most of the documents came from a childhood acquaintance in the security services who is the chief of the archive and had financial difficulties, Mr. Mihailovic said. He identified the acquaintance as Zoran Vukelic, and said he paid him the equivalent of more than $7,000. **********Mr. Mihailovic said he believes that before Mr. Djogo was killed, he was tortured and spoke of their collaboration. **********Mr. Mihailovic's apartment at Omladinskih Brigada 208 in Belgrade was raided by the Serbian security services on Sept. 11. A private and diplomatic passport and the equivalent of more than $1.3 million in cash were taken, according to a report of the raid Mr. Mihailovic said he obtained from Mr. Vukelic. **********The raiders did not capture Mr. Mihailovic because he was already in hiding. He quickly approached the Dutch Embassy in Belgrade. \"Deeply in my heart I believed in the United Nations tribunal,\" he said. \"This was my main reason to go to the Dutch rather than the Americans.\" **********Mr. Mihailovic explained his decision to go public as stemming from deep frustration at his treatment by the United Nations tribunal and later by the Dutch secret services. **********From Dec. 1, 1994, until he fled the Netherlands in March, these Dutch services provided Mr. Mihailovic with an apartment in the hope of gaining intelligence on the Serbs, Mr. Mihailovic and several officials in the Netherlands said. **********The only complaints Mr. Mihailovic heard about the documents from Mr. Leach, the investigator, were that they appeared to have been typed on the same typewriter and were not in the Cyrillic script now increasingly used in Serbia. But official documents from the 1991-93 period were mainly typed in the Latin script, several Serbian officials said. **********Some questions were also raised about the timing of the Bijeljina document in that by April 3, 1992, some parts of the town were already under Arkan's control. **********Mr. Mihailovic offered on several occasion to take lie-detector tests, but the offer was declined. **********Paul de Vries, a spokesman for the Dutch Interior Ministry, confirmed that \"Dutch authorities\" had dealt with Mr. Mihailovic. Bert Ten Wolde, the Dutch agent in charge of Mr. Mihailovic, did not return several calls. **********On March 9, after concluding he had no future in the Netherlands, Mr. Mihailovic left and went into hiding with his wife, Tatjana, and their 1-year-old daughter. He lives in the tiny apartment of a distant cousin. **********Mr. Mihailovic says he wants to get to the United States, where his son by a first marriage lives on Long Island. He says he is broke and feeding his little girl on Red Cross milk."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/27/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-accounts-019095.html": {"writer_name": "Leonard Sloane", "pub_date": "1995-03-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 246, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Accounts", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Accounts", "body_text": " *********** Harvey Electronics, Secaucus, N.J., to J.

But because her employers had helped provide for her medical insurance, she received good care, averted financial disaster and returned to work a week later. **********\"For me the insurance has been a really big deal,\" said Ms. Sullivan, who is 21 and works in Montclair, N.J. \"I'm still getting doctors' bills.\" **********Jenny Healy, a full-time nanny in Manhattan, also places a premium on health insurance and says she won't take a job without it. \"A lot of families I interviewed with were appalled by the idea that I would ask for insurance,\" said Ms. Healy, 22. \"When the people I now work for were willing to do it, it showed a commitment on their part. It was a big factor in my taking the job.\" **********Qualified caretakers increasingly make such a demand -- and eventually get it in what has become a competitive market for child care. Parents who cover at least part of the cost of medical insurance, which can be expensive, say the benefit helps instill a professional attitude in their nannies, with pleasant side effects like better child care and less turnover. **********\"All the better agencies urge employers to at least go 50-50 on medical insurance,\" said Mary Clurman of Apple Pie USA, a nanny placement agency in Princeton, N.J. \"It's a wonderful hiring tool.\" **********To be sure, these nannies are still in the minority. Most nannies do not get medical benefits from their employers -- even if those employers consider coverage an essential component of their own compensation. The Nanny News, a newsletter in Hopewell, N.J., asked its readers, both nannies and their employers, if the employer contributed some portion of the cost of the nanny's health insurance. Although the survey was not scientific, the newsletter found that about 1 in 4 employers paid some part and slightly more than 1 in 10 paid the full freight. According to people who specialize in household help, the cost typically ranges from 10 to 20 percent of the nanny's overall pay, though both salaries and insurance premiums vary widely. **********If employers do not chip in for insurance, nannies often find monthly premiums out of their reach and choose to go without a medical safety net. \"Very few people get insurance for their nannies,\" says Jane McIntosh, the editor of the newsletter. \"But they should understand that they're at risk if their nanny gets sick.\" **********For starters, parents might find themselves in the lurch for child care. Perhaps an even bigger concern is the well-being of someone who has become a member of the household. Cut off from friends and family, many live-in baby sitters turn to their employers in a medical emergency. **********Richard Eisenberg, an insurance broker in Newton, Mass., and the insurance representative of the International Nanny Association, described a client who bought insurance for his children's first two nannies, who never needed medical care. So he didn't insure the third nanny. When she complained of eye trouble, he referred her to his doctor. The doctor discovered a detached retina and sent her to the hospital for surgery; he assumed her employer would pay the bills, which came to $30,000. The employer, who had more than modest means, did pay them. **********Monetary considerations aside, health benefits can promote a certain stability and security in any workplace. Ms. Sullivan's employers, Liz Byrnes, a managing director at a bank, and her husband, Carey Africk, a marketing executive, considered insurance an obligation. \"My husband and I both have health insurance at our jobs, so we felt she should, too,\" said Ms. Byrnes, the mother of two girls, 5 and 7. \"I want her to feel she is respected and has a professional job.\" **********If Ms. Sullivan's life is running smoothly, the couple reason, she will also be better able to care for their children. \"I don't want her to have tons of bills and responsibilities and worries that would affect her work,\" Ms. Byrnes said. **********Hiring a nanny raises many thorny questions: Will she fit in with the household? Is she responsible? Can you afford to pay her $300 a week or more? How will you handle all the taxes and paperwork? There are so many issues that anything to stem turnover and foster a good working relationship is welcomed by some parents. \"My wife and I want to have confidence in the person taking care of our children,\" said Michael Gray, a portfolio manager at Fidelity Investments in Boston. \"Part of that confidence is that she's well. Our nanny shouldn't feel that she can't go to a doctor for strep throat because she doesn't have the money.\" **********For his nanny, Mr. Gray pays $180 a month for a preferred provider health plan from John Alden Life Insurance. His nanny can go to any doctor in the network for about $10 a visit or pay 30 percent of doctors' visits outside the network, after she has paid the $250 annual deductible. **********WHEN shopping for a nanny's insurance, cost is always a factor. In New York, New Jersey and a handful of other states, it can be particularly difficult. These states require insurers to use a community rating system, which means that the young and the old, the sick and the healthy all pay the same for individual insurance policies. **********Inexpensive policies for young nannies are not so hard to find elsewhere. In states without a community rating, Mr. Eisenberg said, young nannies should be able to get either major medical or preferred provider plans for $75 to $150 a month, depending on the city. In states with a community rating, he recommends turning to a health maintenance organization, which covers visits to doctors in its network. Otherwise, the monthly premium for a preferred provider or major medical policy can run $250 or more. **********Instead of choosing a policy for her, Ms. Sullivan's employers give her $100 a month toward medical insurance. Ms. Sullivan uses this toward the $136 a month for coverage on her mother's policy. **********A nanny coming from another state to New York or New Jersey should get insurance at home before she moves, Mr. Eisenberg added, because it will probably cost substantially less. Older nannies should probably stick with H.M.O.'s no matter where they live. \"For older people, an H.M.O. is great because everybody is charged the same rate,\" he said. **********In New York, H.M.O. coverage costs $160 to $200 a month for individuals. For $163 a month, Oxford Health Plan's Freedom Plan allows individuals to go to doctors in the network for a nominal fee, or it will pay 20 percent of the cost of visits to outside doctors. The Health Insurance Plan of New York, another H.M.O., costs about $200 a month. Because insurance brokers rarely want to bother with an individual plan, it's a good idea to call a company directly and request an information packet. **********Short-term plans are an inexpensive option, and typically cost half of what permanent plans do. They are not legal, though, in New York, New Jersey or a few other states. The Time Insurance Company of Milwaukee sells a short-term policy for $40 to $60 a month, depending on the city and the deductible. Administration Associates Inc. in Washington has a short-term plan specifically for nannies. It is available for three years or until age 35, whichever comes first. On this major medical policy, the annual premium is about $800. **********\"Short-term insurance is designed to take care of one major catastrophe, not to take care of a long-term health condition,\" Mr. Eisenberg said, \"because once you are sick, it's impossible to renew.\" **********FOR employers who don't want the paperwork problems that may come with a nanny -- quarterly state tax filings or health insurance forms -- Pacific Benefits of Salt Lake City will do it all. The company essentially puts the nanny on its own payroll and pays her salary, taxes and insurance for a fee. The company's insurance plans, developed by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Utah, are rather inexpensive. For a New York nanny under 30, a standard policy with minimal coverage and a $300 annual deductible costs $139 a month. \"This is limited and reasonable coverage for people who find most health insurance too expensive,\" said Sidney Marion, who leads the company's underwriting group. The plan excludes maternity benefits and remains active only while the person works as a nanny, and for 90 days thereafter. **********Illegal aliens are another touchy subject.  Any foreigner can get coverage through global insurance companies, though some aliens may be wary about applying. WASA International Insurance of London offers a major medical plan costing about $1,520 a year for a 30-year-old. The insured has to pay a $1,000 deductible and receives up to $25,000 in maternity coverage. Routine doctors visits are not covered. **********Employers with a household staff of three or more can try to get a group rate for insurance. But business owners should avoid the common practice of sticking a nanny on the company payroll, financial advisers said. \"Telling the I.R.S. that your nanny works for your company when in fact she works in your house is illegal,\" said Alan Goldberg, president of Nanny Tax, a Manhattan company that handles payroll taxes for families with domestic help. \"It's tax evasion, because the presumption is it's a business expense when it's not.\" **********If a nanny is not on the payroll of a business, the employer is advised not to pretend she is for insurance purposes. \"We've seen a lot of problems with groups,\" said John Kelly, a spokesman for Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield. \"We check the tax records, so don't try to make a small group with a nanny and a few relatives.\" **********In most states, families with full-time nannies should be paying workers' compensation insurance, since many insurance policies won't cover injuries on the job. And it's wise to make sure the household has sufficient liability coverage, which can be bought inexpensively along with homeowner's insurance. Ms. Clurman of Apple Pie USA told of one couple whose nanny broke her leg while running down the stairs of their house. Since she was working illegally, she was not eligible for workers' compensation. And she had no health insurance. So she did the logical thing: she sued."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/19/world/world-news-briefs-bosnian-forces-battle-rebel-muslims.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-02-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 162, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "World News Briefs; Bosnian Forces Battle Rebel Muslims", "print_headline": "World News Briefs; Bosnian Forces Battle Rebel Muslims", "body_text": " **********Government troops and the forces of a renegade Muslim leader fought today for control of Bosnia's northwestern Bihac enclave, ignoring a United Nations call for an immediate cease-fire. **********The fighting began at dawn when the rebels apparently launched an offensive to reclaim territory the Government forces had recently captured. **********Muslim-led Government troops are concentrated in the southern part of the enclave, around the town of Bihac.

Medical teams also attended the most badly wounded at first-aid posts set up in the station. They said several victims had lost limbs. **********\"It's carnage in there,\" a fireman told reporters as he emerged from the station. **********Nearby, with the police screening off the area, dozens of passengers from the train could be seen undergoing treatment for minor injuries and shock. The most seriously wounded victims were taken to the hospital in helicopters that landed in front of Notre-Dame. The last victims were taken from the station three and a half hours after the explosion. **********Packed with bars, restaurants and movie theaters, the Left Bank area around St.-Michel is very popular with tourists and many were in the crowd watching rescue teams carry out the injured, but it was not known if any tourists were hurt in the bombing. No victims have yet been identified. **********The train, which was headed south toward St.-Remy-les-Chevreuse, a few miles outside the perimeter of the City of Paris, is normally crowded with commuters, carrying some 400,000 people to, from and within the city each day. Trains belonging to the R.E.R., the Reseau Express Regional, or Regional Express Network, are longer than normal subway cars and they travel faster and make fewer stops inside Paris. **********Their stations are also deeper than those used by the Paris metro system. At St.-Michel-Notre-Dame, passengers can change to the metro, although the St.-Michel subway stop is not immediately adjacent to the station where the blast took place. **********President Jacques Chirac as well as the Transport Minister, Bernard Pons, and the Mayor of Paris, Jean Tiberi, were among officials visiting the scene of the explosion, although only Prime Minister Juppe spoke to reporters, noting that presumptions of a bomb blast were \"very strong.\" **********The Interior Minister, Jean-Louis Debre, called the Government's antiterrorist advisory group to a meeting that lasted late into the night. Mr. Debre also ordered a reinforcement of security measures at Paris's two main airports, Orly and the Charles de Gaulle International Airport at Roissy. **********Tonight, Adm. Jacques Lanxade, Chief of Staff of the French armed forces, said it was too early to point the finger at any suspects, but French television immediately began speculating as to what groups might be motivated to carry out such an action. **********France has angered Algerian Islamic fundamentalist groups by clamping down on their support network in France. Algerian militants have pledged not to bring their war against Algeria's military Government onto French soil. But an Algerian religious leader and fundamentalist sympathizer was slain outside a Paris mosque earlier this month. **********France has also recently taken a strong stance against the latest Bosnian Serb offensive in Bosnia, although it did not win American and British support for its call for a buildup of United Nations troops in so-called \"safe areas\" of eastern Bosnia. **********Further, Mr. Chirac has angered several governments as well as worldwide environmental groups by deciding to resume France's nuclear testing in the Pacific. A French consulate in the Australian city of Perth was firebombed last month, apparently in reprisal for the planned tests, but most antinuclear protesters are pacifists. **********There was even speculation that the bombing could be linked to remnants of the group once headed by Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, better known as Carlos, the Venezuelan-born international terrorist who was extradited from the Sudan to France last year to face trial for murder."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/15/business/company-news-paine-webber-is-said-to-be-considering-job-cuts.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-03-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 125, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PAINE WEBBER IS SAID TO BE CONSIDERING JOB CUTS", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; PAINE WEBBER IS SAID TO BE CONSIDERING JOB CUTS", "body_text": " **********Paine Webber Group Inc. may eliminate as many as 500 jobs, or 3 percent of its total work force, in an effort to cut its compensation costs, traders at the brokerage firm said yesterday.

Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., has been hiring journalists to produce a section of its planned on-line service that will gather and package news for its computer users from a variety of electronic sources. **********Some members of the Internet group opposed the idea of permitting the Microsoft employee, John Callan, to join. Other members said they needed to know more about the news-gathering strategy of Microsoft. **********\"I think it's a fundamental issue for the journalism profession,\" said Bill Densmore, president of the Newshare Corporation, an electronic news publisher in Williamstown, Mass. \"This is about how we as independent observers maintain our independence in the face of the business interests of our employer.\" **********Executives at Microsoft say they have still not decided on the shape and content of their news service, which will include reports generated from traditional news suppliers like USA Today, but they insist that Microsoft employees will not be gathering or writing news directly. **********\"We have no plans to directly report the news,\" said Steven Ballmer, who works in the office of the president. He added that Microsoft had not hired anywhere near the 60 journalists that members of the Internet discussion group have asserted are part of the news service. **********Mr. Ballmer acknowledged, however, that there were important editorial decisions inherent in how and where news is displayed on a computer screen. **********He said the company was working on policies to govern the gathering and organizing of news and the handling of editorial material from outside providers. **********Microsoft, which is battling the Federal Government over a controversial antitrust suit, is certain to be watched carefully for any sign that the company is influencing the news coverage on the Microsoft Network. **********\"If they are going to have editors of professionally generated news, there will be questions,\" said Ben H. Bagdikian, a media critic and a former editor at The Washington Post. \"When you get a powerhouse like Microsoft and this kind of wide distribution to a high-demographic audience, lots of issues are raised.\" **********If Microsoft does become a news provider it will not set a precedent. NBC, for example, is owned by the General Electric Company. And the Prodigy Services Company is a joint venture of I.B.M. and Sears, Roebuck & Company. Prodigy uses professional editors to edit its news service, but the company has set up policies to prevent its owners and advertisers from influencing editorial decisions. **********Some of Microsoft's toughest rivals say they have decided on a strategy for providing electronic news that is different from the one used by Microsoft because they will maintain the independence of news-gathering organizations. **********\"There is no reason why I would want to compete with the people I'm going to provide technology to,\" said Farzad Dibachi, vice president of the new-media division of the Oracle Corporation. \"That is a stark contrast to Microsoft.\" **********Oracle is reported to be negotiating with the AT&T Corporation to offer a service that would permit many kinds of information vendors, including news providers like Reuters and CNN, to publish on an AT&T computer network. **********Mr. Dibachi said Oracle's strategy would be virtually identical to the company's current business practices, in which software is licensed to customers for a specified number of users. That is, Oracle plans simply to license the software to distribute the news, and thereby avoid the issue of editorial control over content providers. **********In contrast to Oracle, \"Microsoft's strategy is the same one which I.B.M. employed in the 1960's and 1970's,\" Mr. Dibachi said. \"They tell their customers, 'We'll do everything, don't you worry your pretty little head about a thing.' \" **********Mr. Bagdikian says he is also concerned about whether Microsoft can be trusted as a news provider. \"It's not being paranoid to ask if such a company that has goals of its own in public policy is a good entity to create news for the general public,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/24/world/israeli-premier-sees-no-alternative.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Haberman", "pub_date": "1995-01-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1148, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Israeli Premier Sees 'No Alternative'", "print_headline": "Israeli Premier Sees 'No Alternative'", "body_text": " **********Against a chorus of demands that he halt peace talks with the Palestinians, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said tonight that he would not let negotiations be disrupted by a wave of Islamic suicide bombings, including the one on Sunday that killed 18 Israeli soldiers and a civilian. **********\"We shall continue on the path of peace -- there is no alternative,\" Mr. Rabin said in an unusual televised speech to a nation still reeling from one of the deadliest episodes in its history. \"We will achieve peace because that is the solution in the long run to the terrorist attacks.\" **********But despite his commitment to forge ahead, peace talks seemed to be frozen for now, with no clear sign of when they might resume. **********Israeli officials acknowledged that public confidence was badly battered by the attack on Sunday at a rural junction in central Israel, where one or more suicide bombers detonated two explosions near a bus stop crowded with soldiers traveling to their bases. **********This time, it was not just the rightist opposition that demanded a break in the talks, as it usually does after such incidents. Even a committed dove like President Ezer Weizman stretched the confines of his largely ceremonial position and, to Mr. Rabin's dismay, issued his own call for a suspension, an appeal echoed today in many newspaper commentaries and editorials. **********The fact that the Prime Minister went on the air tonight to speak directly to Israelis for nearly 15 minutes reflected his concern about plummeting support for the course he had charted with Yasir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization. **********\"We must break the cycle of hatred,\" he said. \"And we shall, so that we, as mothers and fathers, and I as a grandfather, will not have to mourn our beautiful children.\" **********The target of the explosions was a heavily trafficked transfer point for soldiers, especially on Sundays, when they are returning to duty after spending the Jewish Sabbath at home. The blasts hit hardest at young people in or near a snack bar, sending bodies flying through the air and slicing many of them to pieces. **********Altogether, according to updated police figures, 19 Israelis were killed, all but one of them men and women in uniform, and 65 others were wounded. About 30 people, again mostly soldiers, remained in several hospitals today, including 13 said to be in serious condition. **********Responsibility for the attack was taken by the group known as Islamic Holy War, which said it had been carried out by two Palestinians from the Gaza Strip and which warned today that its campaign \"will continue and will not stop.\" **********Israeli police officials said, however, that they had yet to determine if there was more than one bomber.  They said they were convinced that the attacker had carried explosives or strapped them to his body, based on the many body fragments found that clearly were not those of Israelis. Soldiers were easily identified because of the identity tags and uniforms, they said, but they added that they would need more time to determine whether more than one Palestinian was involved. **********Even before the bombing, the peace talks were in fragile condition, weakened by growing ill will and repeated disputes over rights to Jerusalem, Israel's expansion of West Bank settlements and mutual accusations of bad-faith bargaining. A question widely asked here today was how many more blows the negotiations could absorb. **********For Israelis, the acid test is whether they feel safer in their new partnership with the P.L.O. The answer for most is no, certainly not after a series of attacks inside Israel that have killed 54 of them and wounded nearly 200 others since last April. **********For Palestinians, the test is whether they feel Israel is sincere in wanting to expand their autonomy beyond Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho to include the entire West Bank. Given the fact that planned elections are more than six months overdue and Israeli troops have yet to budge in the West Bank, the answer for most of them, too, is no. **********If anything, their grievances mounted today when the Israeli Army put up roadblocks to keep more than 50,000 of them from leaving the West Bank and Gaza Strip for jobs in Israel. Such restrictions have become a standard Israeli response after major attacks, one aim being to keep the peoples apart until tempers cool. But Palestinians call it collective punishment, and some Israel officials acknowledge that it inflicts economic harm while doing little to improve security. **********On Sunday, the Government also suspended plans to free Palestinian prisoners and other measures intended to push the talks forward. **********Today, it demanded that Mr. Arafat extradite Gaza-based militants wanted by Israel and take other actions that would prove he is serious about forestalling attacks. It was not clear, though, if this was an Israeli condition for the resumption of talks. **********For his part, Mr. Rabin pledged a stronger fight of his own against \"lunatics\" who strike at Israel. \"The whole nation is an army, the whole country is a front line until we overcome this problem,\" he said. **********In Gaza, senior officials of Mr. Arafat's Palestinian Authority promised to take a tougher stand against militants, adding that this time they meant it -- tacit acknowledgment that past efforts were inadequate. **********\"Anyone with incriminating evidence of his responsibility or involvement will be held accountable,\" said Nabil Shaath, the P.L.O.'s chief negotiator with Israel. \"This time it will not be a show for two or three days.\" **********But at the same time, Palestinian officials protested that they could not be expected to stop all terrorists ready to commit suicide when Israel has itself failed, despite giving a looser rein to its security forces after the bus bombing in Tel Aviv that killed 22 passengers in October. **********Mr. Rabin acknowledged on Sunday that Israel now had to contend with \"a kind of terrorism we didn't face two or three years ago -- only in Lebanon.\" And with the Islamic Holy War and Hamas groups both threatening new attacks, other officials said that there may be no way to block them all. **********A big problem, some specialists said, is that the Israeli Army's withdrawal last May from Palestinian towns and refugee camps in Gaza has made it more difficult to infiltrate radical groups to gather intelligence. **********\"If you don't have precise advance information on the time and place where an attack will be carried out, you cannot prevent it,\" said Ron Ben-Yishai, a military writer for the newspaper Yediot Ahronot. \"The suicide attacker and the planners will always find a soft spot.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/04/business/bond-prices-fall-on-fears-about-dollar.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Hurtado", "pub_date": "1995-03-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 384, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bond Prices Fall on Fears About Dollar", "print_headline": "Bond Prices Fall on Fears About Dollar", "body_text": " **********Prices of Treasury securities fell sharply yesterday, as investors sold because of concern about the dollar and fear that the Federal Reserve might be forced to push up interest rates to support it. **********The Treasury confirmed in early trading that it was supporting the dollar in foreign exchange markets, and in some cases was acting with other central banks. **********A weaker dollar can accelerate inflationary pressures by making imported goods more expensive, and it can also make dollar-denominated assets like Treasury securities less attractive to foreign investors who convert their returns into other currencies.

At $50,000 a pop, he gives 50 or so speeches a year, raking in $2.5 million. His speeches help sell his books and vice versa -- he's a walking, talking version of the success principles he lists in \"Swim With the Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive.\" **********At the moment, Mr. Mackay is swimming in a very profitable tide. Even in this day of electronic connections, the old-fashioned business of business speaking is booming. The number of business and trade conferences is growing, more people are becoming speakers, and fees are rising. While few industrywide numbers are available, most speakers bureaus -- companies that provide speakers to banquets, conferences and other corporate events -- report revenue growth of around 20 percent a year. **********The National Speakers Association, a trade group for professional speakers, has grown by 30 percent in the last five years to 4,000 members, most of whom speak to business groups. In the same period, the Conference Board, a global business-research group, has doubled the number of its conferences to more than 100 a year, requiring about 2,000 speakers. **********With the summer holidays behind it, corporate America is getting back to work -- and shopping around for speakers like Mr. Mackay to inspire the troops. \"The number of platforms available for business speakers has easily doubled in the last decade,\" said Robert Dilenschneider of the Dilenschneider Group, a public relations firm in New York. \"Everyone wants a speaker these days and when they sit around in meetings, they are all looking for the Norm Schwarzkopf of today,\" he added, referring to the retired Army general and Persian Gulf war hero. **********Mr. Schwarzkopf may add glitter. But when it comes to speakers with more corporate knowledge than marquee value, a review of their latest themes provides a window into the current mood of business. **********Today's public speakers have a more upbeat message for American business than the one they pitched just five years ago, specialists say. The emphasis has shifted from managing corporate cutbacks and revampings to coping with growth and changes. A recent survey by the National Speakers Association shows that two of the hottest new topics are finding opportunities in the global marketplace and developing strategies for the future -- nonexistent categories in a similar survey in 1990. **********\"Business wants to know what to do with the corporation now that it's re-engineered,\" said Robert Falcey, vice president for conferences at the Conference Board, referring to the popular term for cost-cutting. \"Re-engineering ground up business and took out the fat. Now businesses are having to start again and build anew.\" **********Gurus of the moment on these topics are Tom Peters, the former McKinsey consultant and best-selling author, who discusses ways for corporations to cope with change; Roger Blackwell, the Ohio State University marketing professor who specializes in how to do business in a global marketplace, and Daniel Burrus, the futurist who talks about how a vision of times ahead can shape business decisions today. **********The more optimistic attitude can be measured in another way -- the return of humor. \"As business becomes more stable, people are letting their breath out and relaxing a bit,\" said Brian Palmer, vice president at the National Speakers Bureau, based in Chicago. **********Business groups looking for public speakers basically have three choices. They can hire high-powered types like Mr. Peters or Mr. Mackay, who combine business expertise with polish. Or they can get lesser-known specialists whose main purpose is to impart information, whether the topic is mutual funds or chemicals. **********Finally, companies wishing to make a big impression can go for celebrities with high marquee value. In this category, No. 1 on almost everyone's list is the former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who gives fewer than six speeches a year for up to $100,000 each. Her topic is always foreign affairs. **********Running close behind is Gen. Colin L. Powell, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Three former Presidents -- George Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald R. Ford -- are also stars, along with Henry Kissinger, the former Secretary of State. And the speaker of the hour is James Lovell, commander of the Apollo 13 space flight that is the subject of a hit movie. **********What can Colin Powell tell business? At $60,000 or more a speech, he delivers anecdotes about growing up, insights into leadership and thoughts about the military experience. \"He doesn't pretend to know the organization well,\" said Thomas Fiske, manager of special events at Andersen Consulting, who hired Mr. Powell to speak at its annual partners' meeting last October. \"But he speaks about his experiences and the experiences of the gulf war.\" **********Some business motivational speakers are legends. These are typically sports figures hired to pump up sales meetings. Lou Holtz, the Notre Dame football coach, is considered the undisputed master. But others in his league are the basketball coach Pat Riley, who has moved from the New York Knicks to the Miami Heat, and Tommy Lasorda, the manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers. **********\"Holtz gets them weeping and cheering in their seats,\" Mr. Dilenschneider said. \"He delivers a speech about self-realization and how if you believe in yourself, you can make it.\" **********Betsy Berg, head of the lecture division at the William Morris Agency, said: \"Pat Riley is in huge demand. People bring these guys in to get the sales force revved up.\" **********Among businessmen who are speakers, the big draws include the economist Henry Kaufman, for his \"inside baseball\" view of the Federal Reserve System, and Malcolm Forbes Jr., publisher of Forbes magazine, because, according to Ms. Berg, \"people assume he knows what's going on.\" **********Richard Branson, head of the Virgin Group, is also popular, as is C. Everett Koop, the former Surgeon General, for his views on health care. **********It also helps to have a best-selling book or to appear frequently on television. \"When television first came around, people thought it would end the speaker business,\" said Don Walker, president of the Harry Walker Agency. \"But the more people are on TV, the more they are in demand. People want to ask questions eyeball to eyeball and see these people in the flesh.\" **********As for books, Mr. Palmer of the National Speakers Bureau said they \"propel you into the arena of celebrity, even if the book didn't do well.\" **********Chief executives are in high demand, but few speak to outside groups. John F. Welch Jr., chief executive of the General Electric Company, is the most sought after, but he is \"really difficult\" to get, said Mr. Falcey of the Conference Board. And while no one would turn away Michael D. Eisner, the Walt Disney chairman, or Bill Gates, the Microsoft founder, they rarely give speeches, except to trade groups. **********Appealing to core business concerns can be a hit with specialized groups. Jack Florin, director of advertising and promotion at the Kelly-Springfield Tire Company in Cumberland, Md., recalls how the tire sales force was mesmerized by Mr. Blackwell of Ohio State. **********\"He held the audience for three hours by talking about the future of retailing,\" Mr. Florin said. \"Three hours is a lot.\" **********In speaking before business groups, lesser-known names sometimes fare better than the stars. \"Those that receive the best reviews are those who aggressively personalize their presentation,\" said Mr. Palmer of the National Speakers Bureau. \"Prominent speakers sometimes come with such a high level of expectations that they leave their audiences disappointed.\" **********Mr. Mackay parlayed his success as a businessman into a set of sales tips that are articulated in his books.  His audiences sometimes measure in the thousands -- including, once, a group of 10,000 Century 21 real estate agents, all in their company's distinctive gold jackets. **********Mr. Mackay, who also runs an envelope manufacturing company with $50 million in sales, jumped on the speech bandwagon after \"Swim With the Sharks\" became a best seller. The book is a paean to aggressive sales techniques and describes how business needs to be focused on the consumer in order to succeed. **********Following the techniques he outlines in his book, Mr. Mackay hits up the companies that hire him to speak to buy envelopes from his company. \"I have the unusual opportunity to walk into wonderful companies, share information with them and get an obscene honorarium,\" Mr. Mackay said, \"and then I get a chance to do business with them for the rest of my life. It's a dream.\" **********If business is still a mostly male domain, so is the world of business speakers. Only a handful of women can be pitched to men's groups -- notably Margaret Thatcher and Barbara Bush and, on a less-exalted level, Peggy Noonan, a former speechwriter for President Ronald Reagan, and Christie Hefner, the chief executive of Playboy Enterprises. **********Among businesswomen's groups, one of the hottest tickets is Ivana Trump, who speaks on \"how I had it all, lost it all, got it back and now am doing terrifically on my own,\" according to Ms. Berg at William Morris. Other current favorites are the television star and pitchwoman Candice Bergen and the entertainer Lily Tomlin -- sought for their image as strong, successful women. **********But sometimes women are a tough sell -- at least at first. Mr. Dilenschneider remembers proposing Ms. Hefner as a speaker for a world economic forum in Switzerland a few years ago. \"A lot of the heavy guys in the group said, 'no way,' \" he recalled. He booked her anyway, assigning her to a small room with only 40 chairs. **********By the end of the conference, he said, 500 people signed up to hear her -- more than for any other speaker."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/15/business/viewpoints-clarifying-those-complex-car-leases.html": {"writer_name": "S.

In 1990, it accounted for 13 percent of all transactions for cars and light trucks. In 1993, it reached 25 percent. And in 1994, it should gain several more percentage points. **********But despite the accelerating popularity of leasing, the costs remain hard for consumers to gauge. If, however, the leases' most misleading feature -- the monthly payment -- is standardized, much complexity can be dispelled for both lease-only customers and those who buy when the lease has expired. **********Typically, the monthly payment is the central selling point of these leases, the number in big print in the ads. But the leases also require many other cash payments, often exotically titled.  There is the bank fee, delivery charge, acquisition fee and capital-cost reduction payment, for example. Also, leases frequently have complicated financing arrangements -- several payments up front, say, or large refundable security deposits. These myriad and differently timed payments will confuse anyone without an advanced degree in finance. **********A sensible solution is to calculate a standardized Equivalent Monthly Payment for auto leases. The E.M.P. will do two things. First, it will combine all payments over the lease's life into one easily comparable number. **********And, by making certain assumptions about the time value of money, the E.M.P. will account for the different timing of payments under different leases. If a consumer had to pay $500 at the start of a two-year lease, for instance, that payment might be the equivalent of a $564 payment due at the lease's end. The E.M.P. will adjust for this forgone interest. **********The E.M.P. may sound complex, but similar calculations are already used to make consumers' lives simpler. One common example involves adjustable-rate mortgages. **********In such mortgages, customers often get a low introductory interest rate -- 2.75 percent, say. But, just like auto leases, the mortgages have varying features that affect the attractiveness of this teaser rate. The mortgages may differ, for example, in how often the interest charged, including the teaser rate, can be changed; common adjustment periods are 3, 6 and 12 months. Also, the mortgage might have a cap on how much the rate can be raised at one time; a maximum of 2 percent is common. Many mortgages have lifetime rate caps as well. **********Under the rules of the Federal Reserve, banks must roll all these factors together and, using common assumptions about interest rates, figure out the mortgage's overall annual percentage rate. This A.P.R. -- used for other loans and for credit-card balances, too -- allows consumers to compare the costs of different mortgages without relying on enticing but misleading teaser rates. **********Auto leases can be similarly shorn of mystery. Imagine that the same model car is offered in a two-year lease in two different ways. In one deal, the driver can pay $139 a month, along with a $1,500 capital-cost reduction charge and a $278 refundable security deposit. The second deal calls for $170 a month, with a $170 refundable security deposit, a $400 bank fee up front and a $350 delivery charge at the lease's end. **********The deals seem impossible to compare. But if the regulatory authorities adopt my suggestion, advertising for these leases will feature an E.M.P. to consolidate these varying charges into one number. At a discount rate of 0.5 percent a month, for example, the E.M.P. is $208 for the first lease and $203 for the second -- clearly a much different picture than the one the ads paint. Yes, the calculation involves financial technicalities like \"discount rate\" and \"present value,\" but consumers need only focus on the end result. **********Auto leases have other confusing elements, too. Some states, for example, are examining possible dealer misrepresentations over the \"capitalized cost,\" or basic price, of a car. Together with these and other regulatory efforts, the use of E.M.P.'s can lend bewildered consumers a helping hand."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/23/world/election-campaign-in-haiti-splits-allies.html": {"writer_name": "Larry Rohter", "pub_date": "1995-06-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 802, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Election Campaign in Haiti Splits Allies", "print_headline": "Election Campaign in Haiti Splits Allies", "body_text": " **********The midday election rally was drawing to a close, and Senator Turneb Delpe of the National Front for Change and Democracy was about to move on to his next campaign stop when a small plane appeared. Suddenly, hundreds of leaflets for a rival electoral slate endorsed by the President began raining down on Mr. Delpe and his supporters. **********Mr. Delpe, whose party also supports Mr. Aristide, gestured to the sky and smiled ruefully. \"I wish we had the money to do that,\" he said. \"But we don't, so we are just going to have to rely on the people remembering that without the Front, Aristide could not have come back.\" **********After a slow start, the campaign for Haiti's legislative and municipal elections on Sunday is moving to a contentious finish. Some 10,000 candidates representing 28 parties are running in more than 2,200 races, but much of the attention has focused on the deepening rivalry between the National Front for Change and Democracy and the official pro-Aristide group, the Lavalas Political Organization. **********For more than four years, the two parties were allies, the chief members of the coalition that struggled first to elect Mr. Aristide to the presidency. After he was overthrown in a military coup in September 1991, the parties worked together to help return Mr. Aristide to power. **********But the return of democracy splintered the alliance, turning the two parties into bitter competitors, each claiming to be the sole heir to Mr. Aristide's mantle and popularity. **********When Mr. Aristide ran for President in 1990, he did so on the slate of the center-left National Front and adopted its emblem, a crowing rooster. Proud of that association, the party retained the rooster as its symbol, potentially a wise choice in a country where three-quarters of voters are illiterate. It also continues to use the word Lavalas, which means flood or avalanche, on its campaign posters and stickers. **********\"Until the moment President Aristide's term finishes, the Front supports him, regardless of whether or not he now supports the Front,\" Mr. Delpe said. \"For us, it's a question of morality, of political ethics.\" **********But many of Mr. Aristide's supporters further to the left have now decamped to the Lavalas Political Organization, which has replaced the popular crowing rooster with the slogan \"Gather around the table\" and an emblem of four people seated at a table. **********National Front candidates, including Mr. Delpe, have complained in their campaign speeches that \"there is no room at the table, because all of the seats are already taken\" by Lavalas partisans. **********Tensions rose last week when Evans Paul, Mayor of Port-au-Prince and the most widely known figure in the National Front, suggested that Lavalas opportunists were trying to lead Mr. Aristide astray and urged the President: \"Come back to your base.\" **********But at a meeting of Lavalas candidates today in Port-au-Prince, the party's most fiery orator, Chavannes Jean-Baptiste, leader of a powerful peasant movement, issued a mocking reply: \"Aristide never left his base. His base is the people.\" **********On the stump, National Front candidates and others who remained in Haiti during the three years of military dictatorship also stress that they experienced brutal political repression firsthand while some prominent Lavalas candidates joined Mr. Aristide in exile in the United States. **********Mr. Delpe is one of 24 candidates for two Senate seats in the Western Department, which includes the capital. His former ally in the Senate, Wesner Emmanuel, is running on the Lavalas ticket this time, and stands to benefit the most from his connection with the President. **********Thomas Figaro, 32, a farmer who came to the market here today, could not recall Mr. Emmanuel's name when asked to identify the Lavalas candidate, but argued that it did not matter. **********\"I don't need to know,\" he said. \"Any time I see the table, that's what I'm voting for.\" **********President Aristide's own role in the campaign has been the subject of some controversy. During a visit here in February, former President Jimmy Carter thought he had extracted a promise from Mr. Aristide to refrain from a partisan role in the campaign; Mr. Aristide told reporters he would be \"the President of every citizen, every candidate, every political party, creating the space where we can meet together.\" **********But as the election draws closer, Mr. Aristide's speeches, including one he delivered Monday in Gonaives that has been replayed frequently on state television, have been replete with images of tables and chairs and references to Lavalas. Today, as candidates of other parties made their final campaign swings, Mr. Aristide sponsored a reception at the National Palace for the entire Lavalas slate, which was also broadcast nationwide."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/19/business/media-business-advertising-move-over-norma-desmond-postum-coffee-substitute.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1995-04-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 827, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Move over, Norma Desmond.

A campaign by FCB/Leber Katz Partners in New York includes print advertisements, radio commercials, recipe promotions and cents-off coupons. **********Those efforts, which began in February, market the brand as a caffeine-free alternative to hot beverages like coffee and tea. The campaign coincides with the 100th anniversary of Postum, the initial product sold by the Post Cereal Company. Post was later absorbed by General Foods, a predecessor of Kraft Foods, the $17 billion grocery giant that now sells Postum. **********For decades, Postum, made from roasted wheat, bran and molasses, has dominated the market for coffee substitutes. That's partly because of hyperbolic campaigns promoting it as a healthful antidote to the dreaded coffee-nerves character. In a 1934 newspaper ad, a husband suffering from indigestion, headaches and sleeplessness beamed after his wife switched from coffee to Postum; Mr. Coffee-Nerves, retreating, glowered, \"Postum, curse it, has driven me out of another home!\" **********Postum had 87.7 percent of the coffee-substitute market in the 52 weeks ending Dec. 10, according to data from large supermarkets compiled by A. C. Nielsen. And Kraft Foods estimates that two million people a year buy the product. **********But that market has been moribund, to say the least. The 52-week sales, according to Nielsen, totaled only $7.5 million, down 5.4 percent from the corresponding period a year earlier; by contrast, the most popular coffee brands enjoy annual sales of several hundred million dollars. **********Postum is \"a brand with a very stable franchise and a lot of loyal users,\" said Tate Lacy, senior brand manager for Postum at the Kraft Foods unit of the Philip Morris Companies in White Plains. But now Kraft Foods is \"thinking about ways to leverage the historical presence the brand has had,\" he added. **********The Postum push is indicative of widespread initiatives by consumer marketers to investigate whether so-called ghost brands -- older, unadvertised products -- can be revived. The increasing scarcity of shelf space, and consumer perceptions that there are too many brands, mean that venerable, vulnerable products must grow or die. **********In the last year, for instance, Kraft Foods has discontinued one small coffee brand, Brim, and combined its Sanka line of decaffeinated coffees with the far larger Maxwell House brand family. **********Postum \"deserves its chance to be aggressively marketed and see how high is up,\" said Tom Cotton, senior vice president and group management director on the Kraft Foods account at FCB/Leber Katz, part of True North Communications, which was awarded the account in June. **********The sales slump \"is more a function of having no marketing support for a decade plus,\" he added, \"than anything to do with the product.\" **********The Postum campaign, describing the brand as \"the truly soothing hot beverage,\" emphasizes its attributes as \"naturally caffeine-free.\" The humorous radio spots present Postum as the answer to a question on a test for airline flight attendants: \"Coffee, tea or . . . ?\" **********The ads suggest that \"you add Postum to your portfolio of drinks,\" Mr. Cotton explained, because it \"would be unrealistic\" to assert that Postum should supplant coffee or tea. The campaign is aimed at consumers aged 55 and older, he said, because that's a logical extension of the brand's traditional strength among shoppers 65 and over. **********\"Postum has no business being a product only for retired people,\" he added, yet \"we're not going on MTV tomorrow, because you'd have your loyal audience saying 'What are you doing?' and a credibility problem with a 21-year-old.\" **********Mr. Lacy said the goal was to \"seed Postum with younger groups, particularly the baby boomers,\" because \"people tend to look for hot-beverage alternatives more and more as they get older.\" **********Postum sales have increased by double-digit percentages, Mr. Lacy and Mr. Cotton said, since Feb. 6, when the radio ads began running in test markets and the print ads began appearing nationally in magazines like Better Homes and Gardens, Modern Maturity, Prevention and Woman's Day. **********\"We've got a yearlong effort,\" Mr. Cotton said, \"and we're looking forward to more gains.\" **********Both executives declined to discuss the campaign budget. According to Competitive Media Reporting, which tracks advertising spending, Kraft Foods has spent $983,900 on Postum ads so far this year. **********The Postum assignment is significant for FCB/Leber Katz because it is the first account the agency has received from Kraft Foods since joining the company's roster in 1993, when Kraft Foods bought Shredded Wheat and other cereals from RJR Nabisco, a longtime FCB/Leber Katz client.

We are the loving but aging parents of three children -- one is a teen-ager with mental retardation. How do we go about leaving him part of our $450,000 estate?GLEN WEEKS Houston **********A.  You will probably want to construct a \"special needs trust\" specifically for the teen-ager and then make a bequest or trust for the others. But get ready to make a considerable investment of time: estate planning, never easy, is even more complicated when beneficiaries are not able to manage their own legal and financial affairs. **********Although the Dustin Hoffman-Tom Cruise film \"Rain Man\" was fiction, the underlying message of estate mismanagement is all too real. Not to make a special plan to meet the needs of a relative with a mental disability can be heartless. **********A new book by Mark Russell and Arnold Grant, who are lawyers in Illinois, describes the case of a mother of two adult children, one of them living in a state-financed facility. The mother died without a will but with an estate of more than $200,000. Under the state's probate laws, half the money went to each sibling. But Medicaid intervened and seized the patient's half to pay for care. **********Mr. Russell, who handled the case, says there are legal ways to leave property to a child who is disabled without imperiling government benefits. But there are so many methods that no single formula applies. **********The book by Mr. Russell and Mr. Grant is a comprehensive guide for parents facing this challenge, even if their estate is small. It is titled \"Planning for the Future: Providing a Meaningful Life for a Child With a Disability After Your Death,\" and has a companion volume, \"The Life Planning Workbook.\" They were published this year by the American Publishing Company ($24.95 each, (800) 247-6553). **********The authors cover the legal and monetary aspects of creating a special needs trust, and explain how to choose an advocate and trustee. The book shows how parents can convey crucial information, beyond finances, to future care givers to help insure the realization of their hopes for their child. **********But the authors also explain how the parents can prepare for their own needs as they age -- ways to protect property from nursing home expenses, for example, and strategies for reducing estate taxes and probate costs so as not to deplete the estate. **********Here are some of their recommended steps: *********** Write down your hopes for the child so that future care providers will have a road map. In this \"letter of intent,\" discuss what you want for your child in various areas: social, medical and residential. You can also discuss employment, religion, even final arrangements. Samples of such letters can be found in both books. *********** Decide who will be the future advocate or guardian for the child -- in other words, the decision-maker who will make sure your wishes are carried out. While most people would probably start by naming another of their children, it is probably wise to list a successor or successors, or to ask the advocate to appoint a successor, since the arrangement may last for many years. *********** Estimate the future costs of caring for your child. You may want to ask a financial planner for help in juggling government benefits, family assistance and your own investments and life insurance policies. *********** Ask a lawyer to prepare estate planning documents. This is when you can establish a special needs trust to manage the future resources of the heir and protect his or her government benefits. Upon completion, organize your documents in one binder, including the letter of intent, copies of legal documents and records of bank and brokerage accounts, as well as information about the child, like the birth certificate, Social Security number, medical records and any admission papers to a residential home. Make sure that future care givers are aware of the binder and have access to it. **********Lifelong care can run into the millions of dollars. Typically, arrangements are made to get medical and residential assistance from the government, and to use the trust to cover other needs and to enrich the child's life. For instance, the trust may cover dental work. But it can also provide gifts at birthdays and holidays, or pay for plane tickets for relatives who want to visit. **********When a special needs trust is in place, the advocate's job is usually not terribly difficult and brings its own rewards. **********Mr. Russell's brother Jon has a mild retardation and mental illness, and one day Mr. Russell will be his primary advocate. The only problem he foresees is Jon's vacation. Every summer, around the time of his birthday, Jon loves going to Nashville to hear country and western music. Mr. Russell goes along and truly looks forward to the trip, but he despises the music."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/30/business/marcus-cable-pursues-cencom.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1995-03-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 110, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Marcus Cable Pursues Cencom", "print_headline": "Marcus Cable Pursues Cencom", "body_text": " **********The Marcus Cable Company is in talks with certain limited partners of Cencom of Alabama L.P. to acquire the interest in Cencom that Marcus does not already own. **********Marcus Cable's unit called Marcus Cable of Alabama Inc.  is general partner of Cencom, a cable television system serving about 83,000 customers in the Birmingham area. **********The purchase would be for about $150 million in cash and equity securities. **********Marcus Cable, based in Dallas, said it planned to use proceeds from the sale of its San Angelo cable system, about $65.5 million, as well as new equity from its limited partners, to pay for the Cencom purchase."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/28/world/rwanda-calls-for-others-to-join-massacre-inquiry.html": {"writer_name": "Donatella Lorch", "pub_date": "1995-04-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 713, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rwanda Calls for Others To Join Massacre Inquiry", "print_headline": "Rwanda Calls for Others To Join Massacre Inquiry", "body_text": " **********The Government said today that it would organize an international inquiry into a massacre last weekend at a refugee camp, but then promptly began digging up the corpses, a move that drew sharp criticism from diplomats and senior United Nations officials. **********\"What's the point of establishing a commission and then pre-empting the work of the commission and starting digging?\" said Shaharyar Khan, the United Nations special envoy to Rwanda. He said that the United Nations welcomed the inquiry but that it stood by its figure of 2,000 killed in the camp. **********The Rwandan Government dug up several mass graves at the camp at Kibeho in southwest Rwanda, displaying bodies to United Nations officials and foreign ambassadors it had invited to the site. Government officials said they had counted 338 bodies, close to the original Government estimate of 300, but they avoided questions on whether the tally was final. **********The United Nations says some 2,000 ethnic Hutu refugees were killed -- shot, trampled or hacked to death -- when Rwandan Government troops opened fire Saturday on a surging crowd in Kibeho. Many bodies were buried before the United Nations gained complete access to the site early Sunday, so the figure is an estimate based partly on its survey of the carnage on Saturday. **********Diplomats and United Nations officials said the exhumation today was counterproductive and a mistake. **********The gathering at Kibeho was part of an effort by the Government to control the damage that the killings have done to Rwanda's image abroad. All the top Government officials were there, including President Pasteur Bizimungu and the Defense Minister, Gen.

He invited Western nations, the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations to join Rwanda in nominating its members. **********In New York, the Security Council today condemned the \"killing of numerous civilians\" at Kibeho but said it was encouraged by the Rwandan Government's decision to conduct an investigation and bring those responsible to justice. **********The massacre occurred during a Government operation to close down camps in the southwest sheltering about 350,000 members of Rwanda's Hutu majority. Most of the camps were set up last summer by French troops as a safe zone for Hutu fleeing a victorious rebel army led by the Tutsi minority. **********The Tutsi-led Government insisted that the camps were sanctuaries for armed Hutu militias seeking to destabilize the country. **********For months many of the refugees refused to leave the camps, saying they feared they would face reprisals from Tutsi soldiers. Many of the Hutu militiamen in the camps are believed to taken part in ethnic massacres last year in which some 500,000 Rwandans, mostly Tutsi, were killed. **********Soldiers opened fire on the crowd at Kibeho when it panicked and tried to break through military cordons on Saturday. **********Members of the United Nations peacekeeping force were not allowed immediate access to certain areas of the camp. United Nations officials say the Rwandan Army began immediately burying bodies in shallow graves and dumping them in pit latrines. **********About 1,000 Hutu took refuge in a school and hospital compound in Kibeho and are now refusing to head home, asking instead for safe passage to Zaire. There are many women and children in the compound, as well as armed men, United Nations officials say. **********The Rwandan Government has not allowed water or food to be delivered, and the Hutu are living in squalor among the wounded and dead. The Government has tried unsuccessfully to persuade them to leave. **********Today Government officials spoke to the crowd with bullhorns, appealing to the Hutu to exit from the camp in the presence of United Nations officials and diplomats. The diplomats offered to escort people in their own cars to their homes, and the Red Cross and the United Nations provided trucks.

He declined to discuss its contents, other than to say that it did not contain an invitation for a meeting when Mr. Jiang travels to New York for the 50th anniversary of the United Nations. **********\"It would be very difficult for me to envisage any circumstances in which President Jiang Zemin would be able to come to Washington to meet the President if Harry Wu is not released,\" he said. **********Mr. Christopher's statement was a significant toughening of his position just hours earlier, when he repeatedly told reporters that Mr. Wu's detention on charges of stealing state secrets was just \"one of the factors\" in deciding whether a summit meeting would occur. But later in the flight, Mr. Christopher and his aides apparently grew concerned that the Administration would be perceived as taking a weak line on a critical issue of human rights, and open itself to further criticism in Congress that it was too soft on the Chinese leadership. **********The question of how to handle the detention of Mr. Wu, who was arrested on June 19 when he tried to enter China from Kazakhstan, has become an extremely delicate one for the Administration as Mr. Christopher prepares for his meeting on Tuesday with Qian Qichen, China's Foreign Minister. It is the first such meeting since a flare-up between the two countries over the decision to allow Taiwan's President to go to the United States on a private visit. Since then, China has arrested Mr. Wu, who was born in China and is a naturalized American citizen. **********Mr. Wu, who spent 19 years in Chinese labor camps, has been a thorn in Beijing's side because of his efforts to document the treatment of prisoners there. **********Administration officials say they are fearful of hinging the near-term future of the already badly strained relationship with China solely on the question of his release, or taking any action that would fuel Beijing's oft-stated fears in recent months that the United States is trying to contain China's power. **********But the invitation to Mr. Jiang, which the Chinese President is thought to be eager to receive, is one of the few cards the Clinton Administration now holds to alter China's behavior. Some officials clearly hope that the release last week of a tape of Mr. Wu, appearing to concede that some of his reports on the treatment of dissidents were wrong, was a prelude to his release in coming weeks. But they have little evidence that is the case. **********During the last Presidential campaign, Mr. Clinton attacked President George Bush for being too soft on China's treatment of dissidents.  Since then, Mr. Clinton's policy has come to closely resemble Mr. Bush's, and last year he decided to \"de-link\" human rights issues from the annual renewal of China's preferential trading status. After some furious behind-the-scenes negotiating last week, the Administration and some Republican leaders managed to derail an effort in Congress to re-link those issues in this year's renewal of China's most-favored-nation status. **********Mr. Christopher said today that he would try to impress on the Chinese that Congress had \"a number of reservations and concerns\" about China's recent actions, and had the power to override Mr. Clinton on issues regarding China policy. **********\"I certainly will not be making any threats to the Chinese,\" he said. But he quickly added that \"you have to be realistic about the situation\" and said he was concerned that Chinese leaders did not fully understand the nature of Congress's power. **********This issue has tripped Mr. Christopher up once before, earlier this year. At a previous meeting with Mr. Qian he suggested that the Administration was not inclined to give a visa to Taiwan's President, Lee Teng-hui, to attend a reunion at Cornell University.

Because the House approved a different version of the bill on Feb. 21, a group of House and Senate members will try to work out a compromise bill in the coming days and then resubmit it to each chamber for another vote. **********The Senate vote was a setback for Viacom Inc., the New York-based media company. Viacom agreed last year to sell its cable television systems for $2.3 billion to a group of investors led by Frank Washington, a black entrepreneur in California, who had financial backing from Telecommunications Inc., a large cable company. **********The minority communications tax break currently allows a company to avoid capital-gains taxes if it sells a broadcasting or cable system to a company controlled by members of a racial or ethnic minority. **********But that program came under strong criticism in Congress following reports that Viacom would receive a tax break worth $400 million to $600 million. **********Mr. Washington and Viacom both reacted with dismay to the senators' willingness to change the law. \"I've been totally unsuccessful in trying to figure out what these people do and why they do it,\" Mr. Washington said. **********Mark A. Harrad, a spokesman for Viacom, said the deal with Mr. Washington's group was contingent on Viacom's obtaining the tax treatment available under existing law. But the company remains committed to finding a buyer for its cable systems in any case, he added. **********The lack of serious opposition to the bill in the Senate reflected not just the current mood of skepticism in Congress toward affirmative action programs but also the tremendous political power of self-employed Americans. An estimated 3.2 million self-employed Americans deducted 25 percent of their health insurance premiums last year under the tax break that today's bill would revive and extend. **********The House bill calls for 25 percent deductibility. The Senate version allows 25 percent deductibility for health insurance costs in 1994 and 30 percent deductibility thereafter. **********The political influence of self-employed Americans had prompted a push in both houses to pass the bill and send it to President Clinton for his signature before April 17 so taxpayers could include the deduction in income tax filings then. If the deduction is not passed by then, self-employed people will have a choice of either filing immediately and possibly amending their returns later, or filing for an extension. **********The White House had tried to save the tax break for minorities in broadcasting and cable transactions by proposing ways that the program might be modified, including changes that would have raised the threshold for minority ownership of broadcasting and cable operations. **********Under the current law, the minority-owned company can qualify for the program even if it supplies almost none of the capital for the purchase and holds only 20 percent of the voting stock. **********Mr. Washington wrote in a recent letter to Senator Frank H. Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, that his plans called for borrowing $2.2 billion of the purchase price from Viacom while putting up $100 million in equity. Mr. Washington said that he would put up 21 percent of the equity, including $2.1 million of his personal money and the $18.9 million balance in borrowed money. Telecommunications Inc. would hold a smaller ownership stake but might lend part of the $2.2 billion, he wrote. **********After today's Senate vote, senior White House officials said the question of whether Mr. Clinton would fight to protect the tax break was now tangled in the Administration's review of affirmative action programs. They said it could be some weeks before the President and his aides decide whether the program and others should be protected. **********The White House has been reluctant to threaten a veto because of the popularity of the health insurance deduction. **********Senator Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon, the chairman of the Finance Committee, led supporters of today's legislation. While minorities have had trouble raising money to buy cable and broadcast companies, there is not a problem of people refusing to sell such properties to them for discriminatory reasons, so the tax break is not needed, he said. **********But Senator William S. Cohen, Republican of Maine, disagreed. \"We have yet to fully and honestly confront the fact that racism is an evil that is not simply a stained chapter in our history books,\" he said. \"It still flourishes in many overt -- and, I would suggest, even more subtle -- ways.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/15/world/mandela-tries-step-to-reduce-rival-s-power.html": {"writer_name": "Howard French", "pub_date": "1995-06-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 729, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mandela Tries Step to Reduce Rival's Power", "print_headline": "Mandela Tries Step to Reduce Rival's Power", "body_text": " **********In his most direct attack yet on the power base of his most nettlesome rival, President Nelson Mandela today proposed changes in the traditional chieftancy system that would clip patronage strings to local chiefs from provincial governments. **********At its simplest level, the proposal would create standardized payments and benefits for the chiefs to be financed directly by the central Government, giving hundreds of traditional leaders many of the same perquisites as national legislators. **********Political analysts here are nearly unanimous in saying, however, that beyond the plan's surface simplicity lies a potentially revolutionary shift in rural political power that would help fulfill Mr. Mandela's desire to bring to heel the Zulu leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi. **********Mr. Buthelezi, who is Minister of the Interior in Mr. Mandela's national unity Government, is the leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, the most important rival for support among blacks to Mr. Mandela's African National Congress.

Growing frustrated with Mr. Buthelezi's refusal to participate in a constitutional conference, and his minister's calls on supporters to \"rise and resist\" the central Government, the President last month threatened to cut off funds to the KwaZulu/Natal provincial government, a move that critics said would be unconstitutional. **********Political observers here say that Mr. Mandela's changes in of the traditional chieftancy were designed to gain the upper hand in KwaZulu/ Natal."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/08/business/company-news-20th-century-and-benham-to-join.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-02-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 508, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "20th Century and Benham to Join", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; 20th Century and Benham to Join", "body_text": " **********The 20th Century Companies and Benham Management International Inc. announced a merger today that will create the nation's fifth-largest no-load mutual fund company. **********The combined companies will manage assets of $37 billion after the merger is completed sometime in May or June, said James Stowers 3d, president of 20th Century, at his company's headquarters in Kansas City, Mo.

In London, the Underground, which is ventilated but not air-conditioned, provides indisputable evidence during the evening rush hour that antiperspirant makers have not fully exploited the market here. **********\"You try sitting in a hot cab all day, mate,\" one London taxi driver snapped the other day when asked why all his countrymen were so grouchy. **********The parks and beaches are packed with sunbathers, normally pale skin turning a luminescent pink despite well-publicized warnings from doctors that sun block is not just for use on holidays in Spain. **********Water companies have banned use of hoses in much of the country, a heavy blow to a nation of enthusiastic gardeners. In Wales, reservoirs around Cardiff and Newport are so low that tap water is running green, forcing the local water company to distribute bottled water. **********Fearful of a serious drought, some regions have drawn up plans for water rationing. In the city of Bradford, the water company has installed communal standpipes in case it has to cut off residential users. **********The heat and drought are killing off crops, pushing prices for fruits and vegetables up sharply. There have been reports of muggers holding up motorists as they sit with convertible tops and windows down. **********\"We are hot, and we are bothered,\" The Independent on Sunday newspaper said in an editorial this week. \"The sunshine we craved for so long, now it is here in such abundance, does not fulfill us or relax us; instead, it shortens our tempers and aggravates our tensions.\" **********In historical terms the British have some cause for complaint. The average daily temperature in central England since June has been 63.3 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the Meteorological Office. That makes this summer the third-hottest since the Government began keeping records in 1659, following 1976 at 64.1 degrees and 1826 at 63.7 degrees. **********The driest summer since the Government began tracking rainfall in 1727 was 1800, when 74 millimeters fell. So far this summer rainfall has totaled 71.8 millimeters, so there is a good chance of a new record. **********The public is looking for someone to blame. The regional water companies, whose managers have been collecting better paychecks since the industry was privatized a few years ago, have been one easy target. Alan Smith, the group managing director of Anglian Water, cashed in some stock options the other day, netting him $250,000 in profit and the scorn of overheated, thirsty customers. **********\"There can be no justification for someone picking up this sum of money at a time when millions of people are not getting the water they pay for,\" said Nigel Griffiths, the opposition Labor Party's spokesman on industry. **********This being animal-loving Britain, concern runs deep here about weather's effects on wildlife. **********\"I have treated at least a dozen distressed hedgehogs in the last week,\" Alan Brockbank, who runs a wildlife rescue service, told The Daily Telegraph the other day. \"In a couple of bad cases we had to inject fluid directly into the skin of very dehydrated hedgehogs. The problem is that they cannot find moisture or earthworms.\" **********Mr. Brockbank suggested that people leave bowls of water and cat or dog food outside at night to help the hedgehog community and other parched creatures. **********Some people have benefited from the weather. Seaside resorts reported a surge in visitors as the warm sunshine persuaded people to remain in Britain for their summer vacations rather than traveling, as many usually do, to Spain, France, Italy or points even further distant. **********But most people don't quite know how to handle the weather. **********\"The British are a strange breed,\" said Sean Clarke, a spokesman for the Meteorological Office. \"You'll hear our weathermen now saying things like: 'Unfortunately, the sunshine is going to continue.'

The  police fired tear gas and stun grenades at the miners, who are protesting cuts in subsidies that would lead to layoffs. **********A Government-appointed mediator opened talks with railroad unions and appeared to make a first concession by agreeing to delay the signing of a contested five-year plan to reform the state-owned railways, which are losing about $2.4 billion a year. The plan would end some rail services and overhaul the company's pension scheme. **********But the postponement seemed unlikely to have any immediate impact on the strike. **********Beyond the strikers' specific complaints, there seems to lurk a far deeper malaise. **********\"The Government tells our people that the only objective is to fight against  deficits and debt,\" Charles Pasqua, a former Interior Minister with a keen sense   of the sentiment in the French heartland, told the weekly magazine L'Express. \"But you cannot run this country as you would run a board of directors. The French need dreams, they need hope and they need passion.\" **********At present the integration of Europe, the project in whose name the budget cuts and reforms of Prime Minister Alain Juppe are being presented, seems to offer very little in the way of dreams, hope or passion. **********Indeed French workers increasingly see the Maastricht Treaty of European Union, which calls for the introduction of a single European currency by 1999, as synonymous with job cuts, austerity, declining benefits and general joylessness. **********Today, for the 15th day, there were no trains, and public transport was at a  standstill in Paris, Marseilles and Bordeaux. There were delays of up to two hours at both major Paris airports as air traffic controllers staged intermittent strikes. **********Postal services continued to function at a fraction of their normal capacity, and about one-third of school teachers were on strike. But the strike showed little sign of spreading into the private sector and the violence remained   isolated. **********In an extraordinary expression of support for the strikers, given the disruption they have caused, 58 percent of French people say the strikes are justified, according to a poll published today by the weekly magazine Le Point.  Of the 841 people questioned, 56 percent said they felt \"sympathy\" for the strikers. **********Such support suggests the degree to which France is now divided. **********On the one hand, there is a generally affluent class still favorable to European integration and a strong franc. The franc's strength and France's ability to meet the rigorous German standards set for a single European currency are in turn dependent on reducing the deficit and paring the huge state sector. **********On the other hand, a growing number of people have the dim but troubling sense that the old values of France are being eroded by the slogan of \"Europe,\"  and by the sort of revolution in communications and business that can leave a country's policy captive to international currency dealers. **********Prime Minister Juppe seems to have done little to assuage these fears. His Government today announced an advertising campaign aimed at explaining the planned reforms. But Mr. Juppe has declined to meet with union leaders, although meetings between them and the Labor Minister have now been scheduled for this weekend. **********Marc Blondel, the head of the leftist union Workers Force, was skeptical today about these meetings. **********\"We are going to see the movement grow with a new action day on Tuesday,\" he  said, \"since Mr. Juppe does not want to understand that the only solution now is a global negotiation directly with him.\" **********By \"global negotiation,\" Mr. Blondel seems to mean that everything from stagnant salaries to rising unemployment must be discussed, and new solutions found. **********At the heart of Mr. Juppe's reform proposals lies an attempt to cut spending  in France's comprehensive social security system, whose deficits are mounting as people live longer and unemployment becomes more widespread. Mr. Juppe has proposed, for example, that most state employees be required to work 40 years instead of 37 1/2 before collecting full pensions. **********The Prime Minister left today for Bordeaux, where he is Mayor. He is also president of the Gaullist Rally for the Republic.

But before investors send their checks, they should take a close look at the fund's portfolio and decide how much risk they are willing to take. **********The fund, called Perkins Opportunity, belongs to one of the riskiest categories -- funds that buy stocks of small companies. And even within that category, it appears to be among the riskiest. **********Largely because of its aggressive investment style, the fund has gained a stunning 15.2 percent already this year, compared with 4.9 percent for all growth funds. It rose 14.8 percent in 1994, while the group lost 2 percent, according to Morningstar Inc., fund researchers in Chicago. **********Such performance does not go unnoticed. The fund's assets have nearly doubled since the beginning of the year, from $5 million, to $9 million, though that total keeps it below the $30 million cutoff for listing in this newspaper. **********The Perkins fund specializes in the smallest companies, many of which are not tracked by Wall Street and which are thinly traded. The median market capitalization, or the number of shares multiplied by the share price, of the stocks it owns is $70 million. Only four of the 1,620 diversified stock funds tracked by Morningstar own smaller stocks. Stocks of small companies tend to be more volatile than their large counterparts. And very small companies, sometimes called micro-caps, are more volatile still. **********\"We've always been more interested in micro- and small-cap stocks,\" said Richard W. Perkins, who manages the fund with his son, Daniel, from Minneapolis. In total, their firm manages $200 million in assets. **********The managers are fond of shopping for penny stocks, a bit of a misnomer since the classic definition is a stock that costs less than $5 a share. By this measure, more than a third of their portfolio is in penny stocks. **********The companies that issue such stocks often have erratic revenue and earnings histories, if they have any record at all. Many of these stocks do not trade on the major exchanges either, meaning the fund may have trouble finding a buyer when it decides to sell. **********The fund's largest holding is Innerdyne Inc., a maker of surgical equipment based in Salt Lake City. The company went public at $11 a share in 1992 and leaped to $17 on its first day of trading. By the fall of 1993, its stock had fallen to $1.25. **********Although Innerdyne has yet to have a profitable quarter, it has been a winner for the Perkins fund. It paid an average of $2.65 for the company's shares, which have risen in value to $4.38, and the stock accounts for 3.6 percent of the fund's holdings. Innerdyne's market capitalization is $72 million, typical of a Perkins stock. **********In another attempt at bottom fishing, Mr. Perkins bought shares of the Cooper Companies, whose chief executive was convicted of fraud and whose board recently paid a multimillion-dollar fine to settle charges of lax oversight brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The fund paid $2.02 a share for Cooper stock, now trading at $2.13. **********\"This is a forgotten, down-trodden company,\" the senior Mr. Perkins said of Cooper, which is based in Fort Lee, N.J., and makes ophthalmic supplies. \"New management came in, saved it from bankruptcy and is fixing it.\" **********A stock that has not proved profitable is General Magic Inc., a computer software company. The fund bought it at $22 a share, but the price now hovers at $13.38. \"I wish I hadn't bought it,\" Mr. Perkins conceded. **********Perhaps the most notable thing about the Perkins fund besides its small-company bent is its technology fascination. About 45 percent of the fund's assets were invested in technology stocks in June 1994. Such shares now account for roughly a quarter of the portfolio, Mr. Perkins said. **********Technology and small companies add up to volatility in the stock market. But the volatility has all been positive for shareholders of the Perkins fund -- so far. **********The fund \"is lucky enough to have been around in an environment that hasn't punished really small-cap technology funds,\" said John Rekenthaler, who edits the Morningstar 5 Star Investor, an investment newsletter. **********The fund dabbles in restricted securities and warrants. Restricted securities, which accounted for nearly 3 percent of the fund's assets on Sept. 30, cannot be sold on stock exchanges, and their prices are determined by the fund's trustees. What the fund would actually get for them if it needed to sell is impossible to know. **********With warrants, investors get the right to buy a certain amount of common stock at a fixed price for a period of time. If the stock never reaches that conversion price, the warrants expire worthless. The Perkins fund carried warrants for Work Recovery Units of Tucson, Ariz., which makes equipment and supplies for medical rehabilitation, on its books at $33,000 on Sept. 30 but has since marked them down to nothing. **********While not a good fit for the timid, the Perkins fund does have one big advantage. Its small size allows it to buy and sell stocks in companies without driving the price up or down the way a behemoth Fidelity fund would. **********On the flip side, the Perkins fund owns only 56 stocks. That highly concentrated portfolio means declines in just a few stocks could send the fund reeling. **********\"If we have too many stocks, we will have market performance,\" rather than above-average performance, Mr. Perkins said of his strategy. Acknowledging the risk, he said that investors might want to put only a portion of their assets, perhaps 5 percent or 10 percent, in the fund. **********One final caveat for investors. The Perkins fund's expenses are sky high, perhaps because the fund is so small and cannot reap economies of scale. Expenses exceeded 5 percent of assets on Sept. 30, leading the fund to pay more than 2.5 percentage points of those costs itself to comply with various state laws. Should annual returns decline from their double-digit levels, those expenses could be a big drag on performance. **********Of course, Mr. Perkins expects the fund to grow and expenses to wane. And there's little danger of this fund turning investors away anytime soon. How big would be too big for a fund that specializes in the teeniest companies? About $100 million, Mr. Perkins ventured."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/26/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-ally-gargano-plans-reorganization.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1995-07-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 225, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ally & Gargano Plans Reorganization", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Ally & Gargano Plans Reorganization", "body_text": " **********After a series of large account losses, Ally & Gargano, the New York agency founded in 1962, said yesterday that it would sell three divisions, dismiss half its employees and reorganize itself as a smaller, retail-oriented agency with a different name. **********\"It's necessary to reduce our overhead and pay our debts to be able of having any hope to go forward,\" said Bill Luceno, chairman and chief executive of Ally. \"We're doing what we can.\" He disputed a report in the Daily Fax edition of Advertising Age that said the agency would close. **********In the last four and a half months, Ally has lost an estimated $80 million in billings from longtime clients, including the Lorillard Inc. unit of the Loews Corporation, the Weight Watchers Food Company unit of the H.

A Marketing Coup; At 50, Mountain Dew Manages To Tickle Innards of Young Men", "body_text": " **********And now, as the soft-drink industry gears up to quench our summer thirsts, what is the trendiest, hottest new contender in America's beverage wars?  Mountain Dew. **********Mountain Dew? Yes, this 50-year-old brand -- its name born in backwoods whisky stills, a drink once marketed as \"zero-proof hillbilly moonshine that will tickle yer innards\" -- is on a roll. For two years it has been the fastest-growing soft drink in the fastest-growing corner of a $50 billion national industry. **********For all its rustic beginnings, Mountain Dew, which is owned by Pepsico, is now such a hit that \"it is the phenomenon of the nonalcoholic beverage marketplace,\" said Jesse Meyers, publisher of Beverage Digest, an industry newsletter in Old Greenwich, Conn. \"It's a real surprise, given that it flies in the face of the lighter, low-calorie ethic.\" **********Mountain Dew, with $2.7 billion in annual sales, ranks No. 6 in popularity in the nation, behind Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola, Diet Coke, Dr Pepper and Diet Pepsi. By the end of the year, some Pepsico executives predict privately, Mountain Dew could unseat Diet Pepsi to break into the top five. **********Despite -- or maybe because of -- its caloric wallop (Mountain Dew has 170 calories, compared with 150 for Pepsi and none for Diet Pepsi), huge numbers of teen-agers and Generation-Xers are gulping down Dew, as it is known in the industry. The phenomenon is a classic marketing success story, a demonstration of the way a giant consumer products company took a tiny local brand with an edge flavor and broadened it to national popularity through brute-force distribution accompanied by a succession of inventive and irreverent advertising campaigns. **********The real surprise, though, has been apparent during just the last few years. Realizing that it owned a distinctive product that its competitors were too slow, or too distracted, to counter, Pepsico figured out how to surf the wave. With high-impact television ads, the company used its marketing muscle to take over a targeted audience of its highest-consuming group: 12- to 24-year-old male soda chuggers. **********Although Mountain Dew has a mere 5 percent share of the carbonated beverage market, it scored its second year of double-digit growth in 1994, up 17.9 percent to 458 million cases. That is the fastest growth of any of the top 10, according to Beverage Digest. **********And Mountain Dew is king of the \"heavy citrus\" sodas, a fast-growing category that distinguishes Dew and its competitors from lighter fruit-juice sodas like Sprite, Fresca and Slice. Marketers refer to the heavier sodas as \"neon citrus,\" so named for their typical greenish-yellow color. **********Mountain Dew has provided a lot of the growth kick in what is a mostly stagnant soft-drink industry. And it is by far the biggest contributor to Pepsico's gains in recent years, accounting for 66 percent of its United States sales growth of soda beverages. Today, Dew represents about 10 percent of Pepsico's worldwide carbonated-beverage volume and a powerful 17 percent of its domestic sales. Dew, says Andrew Conway, an industry analyst with Salomon Brothers, is \"critically important to Pepsico's volume numbers.\" **********So, you might ask: Just why, as the company's slogan puts it, do so many soft-drink consumers want to Do the Dew? **********After all, this is a high-calorie, tart, sticky-sweet, lemon-lime beverage with a hint of orange juice and a caffeine kick. In short, it's the utter antithesis of the lighter caffeine-free drinks that have been all the rage in today's dietetically correct world. **********The answer reveals a lot about the increasingly segmented beverage market. **********\"There is a dichotomy among beverage consumers today,\" Mr. Meyers explained. **********Older consumers and younger women are making a big business out of teas, waters and juices, he said. **********\"But the younger consumers, generally male,\" he said, \"are looking for as many calories and as much carbonation as possible, and their favorite is Mountain Dew.\" **********Calories they get, and caffeine they also get: Mountain Dew delivers 54 milligrams of caffeine in a 12-ounce serving, compared with 38.4 in Pepsi and an average of 240 in a cup of coffee. Brian Swette, Pepsico's executive vice president for marketing, attributes the product's popularity not to caffeine but to its unique taste and \"gulpability.\" But Mr. Conway, the analyst, said the caffeine kick, while below that delivered by soft drinks like Jolt cola, may well be part of the attraction. **********Mountain Dew's core consumers seem indifferent to such trivial concerns. \"I'm not one of those health nuts who worries about the calories or the caffeine,\" said Marc Ritter, a 19-year-old Indiana University sophomore, who has been downing Dew since the age of 14 and who currently has a case in his closet. \"I want something that does the job on my thirst.\" **********Given that the target is young males, Mountain Dew now makes the openings on some of its bottles a third larger than the norm. That's \"to enhance chugability,\" Mr. Meyers said. \"The idea is: I want it -- now. Instantaneous gratification takes too long.\" **********Another reason for Mountain Dew's popularity has been 30 years of Pepsico's marketing chutzpah. \"If you judge advertising creativity and dollars spent in direct relationship to sales,\" Mr. Meyers said, \"Mountain Dew has to be one of the great campaigns of all time.\" These days, according to analysts, the company spends about $40 million a year to hawk the brand. **********Three cities claim to be the site of Mountain Dew's birth -- Marion, Va., Knoxville, Tenn., and Johnson City, Tenn. Whatever the truth of their claims, it is indisputable that Pepsico bought the brand in 1964. The company gave it national visibility with cartoony depictions of Li'l Abneresque characters decked out as moonshiners. The label actually depicted an outhouse. **********Among Pepsico's slogans through the years -- and who, despite one's best efforts, can forget some of them? -- was the early \"Ya-hooo! Mountain Dew!\" intoned by the original cartoon character Willy the Hillbilly (Ya-hooo was, by Pepsico dictate, always spelled with three o's). That was followed by, among others, \"Get That Barefoot Feeling\" (1969); \"Hello Sunshine, Hello Mountain Dew\" (1974); \"Give Me a Dew\" (1980); \"Dew It Country Cool\" (1986); \"Get Vertical\" (1992); \"Do Diet Dew\" (1992), and \"Been There, Done That, Tried That\" (1993). While a frequently changing slogan can be the sign of a troubled brand, for Mountain Dew the tactic appears to have worked to keep the name fresh in the minds of its target audiences. **********More recently, Mountain Dew has bet its marketing bucks on the \"Dew Dudes,\" that sky-surfing, bungee-jumping, mountain-biking gang of Generation-X grungers. And even more recently, the icon for Dew in television commercials has been the Velvet Fog himself, the 69-year-old crooner Mel Torme. Pepsico is hoping that, for Generation-Xers, he will be the Tony Bennett of soda pop. **********Thanks to this decades-long successful marketing legacy, and the brand loyalty it engendered, Mountain Dew controls 85 percent of the $3.7 billion heavy-citrus market, Mr. Conway said. **********Coca-Cola's Mello Yello is a distant second at about 11 percent; Dr Pepper/Cadbury's Sundrop is at 3 percent and Royal Crown Cola's Kick trails at 1 percent. (An even tinier competitor is a Southern brand called Kickapoo Joy Juice, named after the sobriquet for moonshine in the Li'l Abner cartoons.) **********Mountain Dew is such a category killer -- a product that overwhelmingly dominates its market -- that its competitors are trying to use it as a bull's-eye. \"We are taking on Mountain Dew, head-on,\" said Joe Payne, director of marketing for Royal Crown Cola, which has just reformulated and re-introduced its Kick citrus soda. \"We're a bit meaner, tougher, bolder and, well -- funner.\" **********That is what he says, anyway. And speaking of fun, many industry executives eye heavy-citrus drinks fondly as the most off-the-wall, loosey-goosey part of the beverage business. The intensely competitive advertising climate and the rock-and-roll marketing frenzy surrounding \"neon citrus\" make it \"kind of like the old cola wars,\" Mr. Payne said wistfully. **********Coke, an abysmal also-ran to its archrival Pepsi in neon citrus, is re-introducing its Mello Yello brand, which it has marketed since 1979 but has only managed to place in 60 percent of American markets. The sedate new tag line: \"Let it out!\" **********And for its part, tiny Royal Crown is now doing its humble best to add to the understated elegance of heavy-citrus advertising by marketing its Kick soda as \"the hard-core, psycho, nitro drink in a can.\" **********Mr. Payne sees weakness in Mountain Dew's apparent strength: \"Kids are looking for something they can own -- that's unique to them. They see Mountain Dew as stodgy and old.\" **********It hardly comes as a surprise, then, that Kick has been thumbing its nose, so to speak, at Mountain Dew with print, television and outdoor ads proclaiming: \"Your little sister drinks Mountain Dew.\" **********That has led to a blizzard of complaints against Kick from parents, not to mention little sisters. Royal Crown has thus far stood firm against its detractors. **********But Mr. Swette of Pepsico has a rather direct response to Royal Crown and to Mountain Dew's other competitors. \"Consumers know an imitator,\" he said. \"But they want the genuine article, and they're incredibly loyal to Mountain Dew.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/17/business/company-news-sdl-shares-surge-12-in-initial-public-offering.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1995-03-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 94, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SDL SHARES SURGE $12 IN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; SDL SHARES SURGE $12 IN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING", "body_text": " **********Shares of SDL Inc., which makes integrated circuits and semiconductor lasers, rose $12, to $28, in Nasdaq trading yesterday, after its initial public offering of 2.4 million shares of common stock.

Some wept openly, others sang the old party anthem, and a few leapt on their chairs to throw out their right arms in one last demonstration of the Fascist salute. **********By Saturday morning, the Italian Social Movement -- a party formed in 1946 by Benito Mussolini's last followers -- was gone, replaced by the National Alliance. As an embryonic umbrella organization, the Alliance passed its first test in Italy's elections last spring, with 13.5 percent of the vote. **********\"It was our family,\" explained Antonio Pezzella, a 46-year-old deputy from Naples, as he emerged from the congress hall Friday night with tears in his eyes. \"Today, we are abandoning our fathers' house and moving into our own. Tonight, I thought of my father, and all these emotions came rushing out.\" **********Various events conspired to give birth this weekend to the National Alliance as a full-fledged party, the first mainstream right-wing party to emerge in Italy since World War II, and one that many now consider a formidable contender in its ever-shifting political sweepstakes. **********It took the political upheaval of the last few years, which began with a wave of corruption scandals and ended with the collapse of the old party system. It took Gianfranco Fini, a suave 43-year-old leader who had the diplomatic skills to build a modern party without alienating an old guard still openly nostalgic for Mussolini. Most of all, it took time -- five decades, to be exact, from the time that Italy's last true Fascists were flushed from the Italian political system, leaving behind a troubled legacy that their heirs have only now been able to shake off. **********\"This congress was historic because after 50 years, it was able to resolve the whole Fascist question, which had been open until now,\" said Gennaro Malgieri, editor of Secolo d'Italia, the party newspaper. **********The charter of the new party makes a commitment to democratic values, which, it says explicitly, Fascism had \"trampled underfoot.\" It condemns racial hatred as a \"form of totalitarianism,\" and \"all forms of anti-Semitism even when they are hidden under the sheen of anti-Zionism and anti-Israeli polemic.\" The old anthem, \"Hymn to Rome,\" was replaced by new one, \"Liberty.\" **********In his closing speech to the National Alliance congress today, Mr. Fini again drew the line against any echoes of Fascism. \"Nobody ever again will be able to say that the right is synonymous with nostalgia,\" he said. \"There are no nostalgics here. The nostalgics are those who want to deny the evidence.\" **********Not all the old \"missini\" -- as members of the Italian Social Movement were called for the party's initials in Italian, M.S.I. -- could stomach these changes. Pino Rauti, a 68-year-old \"missino\" stalwart, walked out of the congress Friday in protest against the changes and met today with other disaffected members to discuss the formation of a new party. **********But for most of the approximately 1,600 delegates who gathered this weekend in this spa town, known for its healing waters and gentle hills, the transformation of the old party was a welcome transition that at long last would release them from the uncomfortable associations of the past. **********\"This will eliminate a confusion that had been forced upon us with the purpose of discrediting us,\" said Luigi Natali, an 80-year-old member of the Italian Senate. \"We were falsely called undemocratic.\" **********Yet the definition of the Italian right still remains nebulous for many of its members. When asked to define their beliefs, many revert to formulas that would warm the heart of the Christian right in the United States; \"God, Country and Family\" is the most common. **********But for most delegates, the appeal of the right remains its opposition to the left. \"We are the social right, and we have greater respect for the individual,\" said Stefano Di Magni, a 29-year-old architect from Rome. \"They want a type of Communism, to make all people equal.\" **********The biggest opportunity for the National Alliance -- and its allies in the coalition that governed Italy for most of last year -- comes from the widespread disgust with the political system that governed Italy since World War II. Under that system, the governing centrist party, the Christian Democrats, held onto political power through a series of compromises with the old Communist Party. The result was not only corruption, but also a state administration that became bloated, costly, inefficient and unpopular. **********\"The Italian system after World War II was a system that began with the center and moved to the left,\" said Lucio Colletti, a noted Marxist philosopher at the University of Rome. \"The crisis of the public deficit, of high taxes and bad services has freed up a public opinion that is favorable to the right, as long as it is liberal and constitutional.\" **********As a member of Silvio Berlusconi's Freedom Alliance, which won Italy's elections last spring and governed the country for seven months, the National Alliance, which includes some other small parties on the right, has already succeeded on a national scale. On the eve of the congress, some polls indicated that as many as 17.5 percent of voters supported it -- more than triple the roughly 5 percent the Italian Social Movement used to win in pre-1994 elections. **********The National Alliance continues to have its troublesome elements. Most of the \"missini\" who were giving the Fascist salute on Friday were members of the new party by Saturday. But many observers are convinced that the lure of future political victories will prove stronger than any tugs to the past. **********\"Sentiments have little to do with politics,\" Mr. Malgieri said. \"The Italian right wants to work in an environment with values that are shared by everybody.\" **********Mirko Tremaglia, a former hard-liner who has embraced the new party, said: \"We are not dying. We are alive and we want to win.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/29/business/spending-it-don-t-spend-tax-breaks-before-they-ve-hatched.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1995-10-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1403, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Don't Spend Tax Breaks Before They've Hatched", "print_headline": "SPENDING IT; Don't Spend Tax Breaks Before They've Hatched", "body_text": " **********THOUGH the final terms of the 1995 tax bill won't be known for another month or two, Congress has already taught some investors a costly lesson: a little knowledge is particularly dangerous when it comes to taxes. **********After repeated statements from Republican leaders that taxes on capital gains would be cut retroactively to Jan. 1, 1995, legislators now appear inclined to make lower rates apply only to transactions made much later: probably after Oct. 13, but possibly not until early next year. **********\"They told everybody to go out and sell\" with some assurance of getting the new, lower rate, said Bob Shapiro, national director of tax policy at Price Waterhouse and a former Capitol Hill tax aide. \"I didn't think they'd do this,\" deny lower rates to most people who sold in 1995. **********To be sure, accountants and other financial advisers routinely caution clients to be wary of Congressional whim and never to let tax considerations dictate investment decisions. But that is easier said than done. **********Now, with the passage of its version of the budget bill, the Senate has put the main components of the pending tax legislation into useful focus. It's not necessarily time yet to take action. Still, it probably makes sense to refrain from a few actions, like putting money into an individual retirement account or buying an annuity, for the time being, since all the rules on savings and taxes are up for grabs. New types of accounts and new rules on existing ones could change your way of thinking by early next year. **********In the category of things not worth delaying might be the sale of some financial assets to realize long-term gains, particularly if you're skittish about the financial markets and their increasing volatility. There are savvy ways to do such sales to make sure any future cut in capital gains tax will come your way. **********On saving accounts, capital gains and other central tax issues, the final legislation will no doubt emerge only after a Senate-House conference, an anticipated veto by President Clinton and subsequent negotiations by all. **********There is near unanimity on a few fronts.  C. Clinton Stretch, of the accounting firm Deloitte & Touche, and other tax professionals consider a tax credit for each child a near certainty. The credit, probably $500 for each child under age 18, will probably apply to people under certain income limits and take effect in January 1996. **********Next most likely, many tax advisers say, are a reduction in capital gains taxes and the creation of what the Republicans call American Dream savings accounts, which would provide a tax-advantaged way to save for something other than retirement, say a house or college tuition. **********You will probably be able to exclude from taxation 50 percent of any gains on assets held more than a year. The top rate would drop from 28 percent now to an effective rate of 19.8 percent under both the House and Senate proposals. The provision is likely to kick in Oct. 14, though it might be later this year or Jan. 1, 1996. Indexing assets for future inflation, a provision in the House bill, will probably be dropped, while profits on baseball cards, coins and other collectibles are expected to remain subject to a 28 percent rate. **********David M. Bradt Jr. of Arthur Andersen & Company predicted that the cut would take effect no later than mid-October, but suggested that investors who want to play it safe sell now in such a way that defers recognition of the profits until next year. **********For stocks, which have generated hefty gains for many people this year, the tactic is called shorting against the box, a common way of locking in gains by borrowing and selling the same number of shares you already hold. Sometime next year after the legislation's effective date, you would deliver your stock to the party from whom you borrowed. Not only would your profit be taxed at the new, lower rate, but the tax would not be due until 1997. Why pay now when you can pay later? **********Anyone who sold assets before mid-October of this year, on the other hand, may need to earmark some of the profit for taxes due next spring. **********And anyone with losses on stocks or other investments will want to think about selling them before year's end. This is because both bills call for doubling the amount of losses needed to offset each dollar of ordinary income, up to the $3,000 maximum, effective Jan. 1. **********For real estate, consider tailoring a transaction as an installment sale, with some or all of the proceeds to be paid next year. The risk is that the buyer might become unable to pay or, because of some real or imagined flaw in the property, unwilling to pay. **********Before making such shifts wholesale, remember that under the Senate bill half of all capital gains would be added back to taxable income for purposes of calculating the alternative minimum tax, which trips up many taxpayers. \"Watch out that you don't realize a lot of capital gains only to find out you don't capture it all because you're bumping up against the A.M.T.,\" counsels John A. McGraw, a vice president in the Washington office of Loomis, Sayles & Company, a large investment adviser. **********In theory, a steep cut in the capital gains levy would make some other tax-advantaged products, like individual retirement accounts, less attractive in relative terms. But specialists dismiss the suggestion that taxpayers focus on capital gains instead of I.R.A.'s as wrongheaded. \"Tax-free is always better than taxed at half rate,\" said Mr. Stretch of Deloitte & Touche. **********I.R.A.'s will probably gain wider appeal in new legislation. Both the House and the Senate suggest that nonearning spouses be allowed the full $2,000 deduction for contributions, a perk now confined to the employed. If one spouse works and one does not, the maximum contribution is now $2,250 for the couple. More people are expected to qualify for the I.R.A. deduction because of higher income ceilings. Households could also gain financial flexibility, namely the ability to make penalty-free withdrawals for certain purposes, including medical and college expenses. **********The American Dream savings account, probably taking effect in January, would have no initial tax advantage, but the contributions, unlimited in both House and Senate bills, would compound tax free and could be withdrawn tax free after five years. Earlier withdrawals would be permitted without penalty for designated expenses. **********These accounts are considered so appealing, in fact, that advisers expect a surge of popularity that would come at the expense of the annuity business, which has boomed in recent years as Americans wake up to their long-term retirement needs. **********Annuities, which merely defer taxes on growth until withdrawal and provide no tax benefit for contributions, would become less attractive, Mr. McGraw said, but he added, \"I don't think it would be crippling.\" **********Various other provisions of the House and Senate bills have a most uncertain fate. Some would not merit much financial attention even if the outcome of the legislative marathon were known, because taxpayers can do so little to prepare for them. **********Among these items are a marriage credit of up to $145, credits for adoption and interest paid on student loans, repeal of the 1993 increase in taxation of Social Security benefits, creation of medical saving accounts and an increased exclusion from estate tax. **********So the wisest course seems to be to keep an eye on the general direction of tax policy but avoid being paralyzed by uncertainty. **********\"If there's a valid business or investment reason to do a transaction now,\" said Mr. Bradt of Arthur Andersen, \"I'd be very reluctant to defer doing it for tax reasons.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/04/business/company-news-quaker-selling-a-pet-foods-unit.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Ringer", "pub_date": "1995-02-04", "snippet": "The Quaker Oats Company, continuing to shed nonstrategic food businesses, agreed today to sell its European pet foods division to Dalgety P.L.C. of London for $700 million in cash. \n\nThe sale helps put Quaker on target for selling an expected $1 b...", "word_count": 448, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;\nQuaker Selling a Pet Foods Unit", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;\nQuaker Selling a Pet Foods Unit", "body_text": " **********The Quaker Oats Company, continuing to shed nonstrategic food businesses, agreed today to sell its European pet foods division to Dalgety P.L.C. of London for $700 million in cash. **********The sale helps put Quaker on target for selling an expected $1 billion worth of assets.

Terms of that deal were not disclosed. **********\"It will be interesting to see if Quaker will sell any thing else,\" Mr. McMillin said. One possible divestiture, he said, is Quaker's pet food business in the United States. The $500 million business, which sells dog food under the Ken-L Ration and Cycle brands and cat-food treats under the Pounce label, \"stands all by itself now with the sale of the European business,,\" Mr. McMillin said. **********A Quaker spokesman, Ronald G. Bottrell said: \"There is no indication that we would be selling other parts of the portfolio.

The European pet foods market is about $7.7 billion. **********To help pay for the acquisition, Dalgety announced it would sell its Golden Wonder unit, a maker of snack foods that has been hurt by price competition, and its Homepride Foods business, which specializes in cooking sauces.

The campaign begins in July and runs through the end of the year, timed to peak during the important holiday shopping season. **********Research among consumers has found \"there is really a perception that televised shopping is 'not for people like me,' \" said Fred Siegel, senior vice president for marketing at QVC Inc. in West Chester, Pa. \"But QVC has become so broad-based.\" **********\"While there is high awareness of QVC, it doesn't go much deeper than that,\" added Mr. Siegel, who joined QVC in 1993 after working for the McCann-Erickson New York unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies and the Ketchum Advertising Philadelphia unit of Ketchum Communications. \"Yet once people know about us, they find they like us.\" **********Hence the campaign, which includes television commercials and print advertisements, created in-house; they will run in media time and space that are valued at $10 million to $15 million. The commercials, which will run as a test on broadcast stations in three local markets as well as on cable television, feature QVC employees in departments like customer service and quality assurance and the print ads feature merchandise; both are meant to burnish the image of QVC as much as to sell cubic zirconia jewelry. **********Aha! There's an example of the opinions the campaign is intended to change. \"Less than a third of our air time is devoted to jewelry,\" Mr. Siegel said, \"and less than 5 percent of our jewelry is cubic zirconia,\" the fake diamonds that have come to symbolize the purported downscale appeal of home shopping. **********Jay Coleman, president and chief executive of EMCI, an event marketing company in Stamford, Conn., which signed QVC to sponsor Mr. Black's coming concert tour, said: \"The baggage they have is of being the 'cubic zirconia network,' but QVC has been moving to sell a broad offering of product to appeal to a cross section of the population. Last fall, we produced a show for them, 'Video Game Headquarters,' and their numbers among teens and young adults rose significantly.\" **********The goals of the sponsorship of the Clint Black Summer's Comin' Tour, named for the first single released from his new recording, \"One Emotion,\" is to \"reach out to people who watch the channel,\" Mr. Coleman said, \"and to reach out to potential record buyers who are not necessarily browsing at Tower Records all the time.\" **********QVC has become a sizable seller of recorded music and related paraphernalia; a Father's Day program on Sunday sold Beatles and Rolling Stone merchandise, and acts like Led Zeppelin, Kenny Loggins and Pink Floyd have also been featured. A line of apparel and other items, like a Clint Black signature guitar perhaps, are elements of the QVC agreement to sponsor Mr. Black's 70-city tour from July 4 through December, which Mr. Coleman estimated was \"a low-seven-figures deal.\" **********QVC sought to join forces with an entertainer who Mr. Siegel hopes will help combat, not reinforce, its image woes. That's why the selection of a popular \"new generation\" country performer rather than one who represents the country-music stereotype of, as the song goes, red necks, white socks and Blue Ribbon beer. **********\"In working with Jay, his message was to get a relationship with someone very contemporary,\" Mr. Siegel said, \"and Clint Black cuts across a really wide spectrum.\" Mr. Coleman included Mr. Black on a list of country stars like Garth Brooks, Alan Jackson and Tricia Yearwood who have \"crossed over\" into the mainstream and thereby enhanced their appeal to consumer marketers. **********\"Clint's management company has extensive research on Clint's audience that shows it skews younger, more educated and highly female,\" Mr. Coleman said, \"and the match with QVC is incredible.\" And Mr. Black will also benefit QVC with another constituency, he added, the operators of cable systems; Mr. Black will \"create a commercial about the tour and in major markets will customize it with tags touting the local cable operator.\" **********On the interactive front, QVC, which has an interactive shopping division named iQVC, signed a strategic agreement in May with Microsoft to offer on-line retailing in the fall on the Microsoft Network, scheduled to be introduced with the Microsoft Windows 95 operating system. **********\"It's a different medium,\" Mr. Siegel said. \"The challenge is to develop a service that takes advantage of the medium and addresses how the consumer uses it.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/23/business/voices-viewpoint-creating-gain-without-pain.html": {"writer_name": "Graef Crystal", "pub_date": "1995-07-23", "snippet": "IN his short 15-month tenure as chief executive of the Scott Paper Company, Albert J.

Dunlap has left both cheering and misery in his wake. **********His shareholders couldn't be happier.  Now that Kimberly-Clark has offered to buy out their shares at about $45 each, the value of their investment has tripled in a tad more than a year. But ask his employees how they feel and you may get a different answer; since he took over, some 11,000 jobs have been cut. For that matter, ask how city officials in Philadelphia feel: until Kimberly-Clark came along, Mr. Dunlap had been planning to move the company's headquarters from Philadelphia to Florida. **********The experience at Scott Paper is not unique. A few years back, another chief executive, William A. Anders, was brought in to turn around General Dynamics. When he quit a few years later, shareholders were also cheering while some employees and ex-employees picketed the company carrying signs reading \"We'll work for food!\" Other companies that in recent years have seen a combination of high shareholder returns and declining employment include Harcourt General and Sonat. **********Lately, many companies, responding to intense shareholder and Government criticism, have redesigned executive compensation plans to place much more emphasis on pay for performance. But the performance they have decided to encourage has been, almost uniformly, total shareholder return -- that is, stock price appreciation and dividends. That emphasis has caused some critics of executive pay to contend that chief executives, who always tended to favor shareholders anyway, will now forget about employees entirely. Scott's Mr. Dunlap, for example, stands to reap some $44 million from stock options and free share grants, almost all of which he got as he walked in the door and began slashing jobs. **********If a company emphasizes maximizing shareholder return, does that necessarily result in more employees getting the ax while simultaneously making top executives rich? The answer is a resounding \"no,\" provided that the time window of shareholder return is sufficiently wide. **********I recently looked at the 425 companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index that have been publicly traded for 10 or more years. Then I ran a correlation between 10-year shareholder return and the change in total number of employees in the company. The result: there is a positive and significant relationship between the two series. **********To illustrate, a company whose shareholder return over 10 years ranks it at the 90th percentile (that is, a company that has outperformed all but 10 percent of other companies) will, other things being equal, generate growth in its work force equal to the 74th percentile. **********At seven years, there continues to be a robust relationship between shareholder return and work force growth. But by the time the time window is narrowed to five years, the relationship begins to soften. And it disappears altogether when the time window is either three years or one year. **********So offering incentives for executives to maximize total shareholder return during a sufficiently long period of time -- say, more than five years -- is not only not antithetical to job creation but actually supports it. **********But when the time window is very narrow -- as was the case with Scott Paper and Mr. Dunlap -- anything is possible, including, as in this case, a combination of shareholder exultation and employee lamentation. **********Unfortunately, many companies blithely adopt so-called long-term incentive plans and then gut their very purpose by permitting executives to pull out large sums of cash at early intervals. For example, an executive is granted an option on 100,000 shares of stock at a time when the stock price is selling for $50 a share. He is given the right, but not the obligation, to buy those shares at $50 each during the next 10 years.  Because all the shares are fully exercisable two years after the grant, the executive can take advantage of a short-term spike in his company's stock price and cart off a great deal of money after, say, three years. **********This sort of opportunistic behavior needs to be stopped because it not only is failing its purpose of rewarding for the longer term, it is also breeding unneeded cynicism among the less well-off players in the American economy. **********A better way of handling stock options would be to make no shares exercisable for, say, five years and then make all exercisable by the end of the eighth year. By the same token, grants of other long-term incentives, like restricted (or free) share grants and grants of so-called performance shares, ought to require relatively long periods of time to elapse between grant and payout. **********If these simple prescriptions were followed, executives would then have a true long-term incentive, and the probability of both shareholders and employees winning would be materially heightened."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/09/business/talks-to-acquire-turner-skid-into-a-barrier-john-malone.html": {"writer_name": "Geraldine Fabrikant", "pub_date": "1995-09-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 715, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Talks to Acquire Turner Skid Into a Barrier: John Malone", "print_headline": "Talks to Acquire Turner Skid Into a Barrier: John Malone", "body_text": " **********Negotiations over Time Warner Inc.'s takeover bid for the Turner Broadcasting System have stalled, people close to the talks said yesterday, and several were increasingly doubtful that John C.

Time Warner owns 18 percent. **********The person close to the talks said Mr. Malone was not objecting to just one outstanding issue. \"It is not one thing,\" this person said. \"It is the whole package that he is grabbing. It is very simple. Time Warner and Turner are ready to do a deal and John Malone is not. He is in no hurry.\" **********This source added: \"The talks have not broken down, but they are no more dead or alive than they were three days ago. Something will have to happen or it won't be done in the terms in which it was being discussed.\" **********That comment may indicate that Time Warner has an alternate plan, and indeed there was speculation that Time Warner had changed the proposed terms of the buyout on Thursday in a move that angered Mr. Malone. Liberty executives did not return phone calls yesterday. **********Under the proposed deal, Turner Broadcasting shareholders would get three-quarters of a Time Warner share for each Turner share. **********For Mr. Malone, there are pluses and minuses to going along with the sale of Turner Broadcasting. A sale would give Liberty a profit of about $670 million for its Turner stock. And some media executives argue that it would give Mr. Malone potential power at Time Warner. **********The deal would give Liberty control of about 8 percent of Time Warner's stock, and Mr. Malone could form an alliance with Ted Turner, the chairman and biggest shareholder of Turner Broadcasting, as well as with other big Turner shareholders like Capital Research, an investment management unit of the Capital Group. **********But under the proposed deal, Mr. Malone would lose his control over Turner Broadcasting, a leading supplier of cable programming. **********Assessing Mr. Malone's agenda is never easy. But one person close to the Turner side said yesterday that he thought Mr. Malone actually wanted the deal done, judging by how far the talks had gone and Mr. Malone's intense involvement. \"If he really didn't want it to happen, why would he be negotiating so hard?\" this source said. **********Time Warner's chairman, Gerald M. Levin, is the architect of the proposed Turner buyout. If the deal fell through, it would represent another failed negotiation, since Time Warner has been unable to restructure its relationship with U S West Inc. Mr. Levin has been trying to persuade that regional phone company to swap its 25 percent stake in Time Warner Entertainment for a greater holding of Time Warner's cable businesses. So far, the negotiations have gone nowhere. **********But some Time Warner investors might be delighted to see the purchase of Turner Broadcasting scuttled. Some say it is far too costly for a company already loaded with more than $15 billion of debt. **********For example, Gary Langbaum, manager of Kemper Financial Services' Total Return Fund. has sold the fund's Time Warner holdings. \"They don't seem to care about price and how it affects shareholder value,\" he said yesterday. He did not say how much stock his fund had controlled. **********Turner Broadcasting's class B shares closed yesterday at $29, up 50 cents. Last week, after the proposed deal was disclosed, they had traded as high as $31.875. **********Time Warner's shares closed at $40.50, up 62.5 cents."}}
