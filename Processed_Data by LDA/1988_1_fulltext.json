Rock-throwing Palestinian youths controlled the streets from barricades of rusty auto bodies until the Israeli Army, firing live ammunition, drove them back. **********The P.L.O. in Tunis accused Israel of the assassination that occurred at Mr. Wazir's home in the outskirts of the Tunisian capital early this morning. And that was clearly the assumption among the Palestinians protesting today.  'They Always Blame Israel' **********Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's spokesman, Avi Pazner, said tonight that ''I have no information whatsoever on what happened in Tunis.'' **********''About Palestinian accusations in general, without reference to this affair,'' Mr. Pazner said by telephone, ''it is well known that whenever something happens to one of the Fatah people, they always put the blame on Israel, so their claims are considered automatically irrelevant.'' **********Black mourning banners were stretched across streets in the Gaza Strip and the occupied West Bank, and outlawed Palestinian flags hung from power lines and light poles. It was not immediately known how many people were wounded in the army gunfire, but clearly the number was high. Al Ahli hospital here closed its doors around 2 P.M. because all 50 of its beds were filled with patients with gunshot wounds.  'Total Turmoil' **********''It's by far the worst day yet,'' said Bill Lee, spokesman for the United Nations Relief and Works Administration, which administers the Palestinian refugee districts. ''From one end of the Gaza Strip to the other it was total turmoil.'' **********Palestinians got word of the death of Mr. Wazir on the morning news broadcasts of Radio Monte Carlo, the Arabic-language station. Mr. Wazir, the commander of the military arm of Yasir Arafat's Fatah organization, was cut down in a hail of gunfire in front of his wife and child by a commando squad that stormed his suburban villa near Tunis and then escaped. **********''I heard it on the eight o'clock news,'' said his cousin, Ahmed al-Wazir, who received hundreds of mourners at his home here. ''I felt deep sorrow. But thank God, he was martyred, he was willing to be martyred.'' Israeli Intelligence Blamed **********There was no question in the minds of Palestinians that he had been killed in an Israeli operation, which many said they believed had been carried out by Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency. **********''No one else can benefit from his killing, only Israel and the Zionists,'' said Bassam Shakaa, the deposed Mayor of Nablus, in a comment typical of Palestinian reaction. **********Mr. Wazir had for years been the key Palestinian guerrilla leader dealing with the Israeli-occupied territories, helping to build many of the Palestinian nationalist institutions that form the backbone of the four-month-long uprising. His death was widely viewed as a major blow to the Palestinian movement here. 'The Quiet Man' **********To Palestinians, Mr. Wazir was known as ''the quiet man,'' a technocrat who will be difficult to replace. **********He played a key role in events here as chairman of the Higher Committee for Occupied Territories Affairs, set up by the P.L.O. after internal splits were healed at a unity meeting in Algiers in 1987. The committee was comprised of representatives of seven guerrilla factions that now coordinate with the secret Unified National Leadership that has grown up out of the clashes that erupted in early December. **********Earlier, he had helped to establish the network of local Palestinian nationalist institutions, like the recently outlawed Shabiba youth movement, the universities with their highly politicized student councils, the professional and trade unions and the women's organizations, that form the structure of the protest movement. **********As the Palestinian representative on a joint committee with Jordan, he had directed the flow of ''steadfastness'' money from other Arab states into the West Bank and Gaza Strip. **********The internal rivalries that have plagued the Palestinian guerrillas in the past appear to have been largely buried during the four months of protests here. That would tend to discount the possibility that he was slain in some internecine struggle and lend credence to the suggestions that an Israeli operation was responsible. Particularly Disliked by Israelis **********As Al Fatah's military chief, Mr. Wazir was particularly hated by Israelis because he was responsible for operations inside Israel, which they consider terrorist acts, including the 1978 hijacking of a commuter bus on the coastal highway in which 35 Israelis were killed. There have been a half-dozen attempts in the past four months to infiltrate Palestinian commando squads into Israel. **********Palestinians poured into the streets early this morning after the first news broadcasts, shouting ''We will take revenge!'' The largest turnouts were in the squalid refugee districts crammed in the strip along the Mediterranean. **********By nightfall, five refugee areas, comprising about 200,000 people, were put under curfew. But the army was reportedly having trouble enforcing the curfew, and burning tire barricades were lighting up the sky. **********Today's death toll of 14 brings the Palestinian toll over four months to at least 142 killed by Israeli gunfire or beatings. The previous single-day high was six killed. **********The high casualty figures appeared attributable not only to the widespread, fierce demonstrations, but to a quick use of gunfire by the army. 'Liberal Use of Live Ammunition' **********''There was a rather liberal use of live ammunition today,'' said Mr. Lee, the United Nations spokesman. ''Our people in the field saw troops aiming horizontally into troops of fleeing protesters.'' **********United Nations and Palestinian reports tonight provided the names, ages and locations where the 14 Palestinians were killed. Eight Palestinians, mostly young men, were killed in the Gaza Strip refugee camps of Bureij, Khan Yunis and Rafa and in a small village outside Gaza City. Two men and a woman were killed in the West Bank town of Jenin and a nearby refugee camp; a woman was shot dead in the village of Hable, near Qalqilya; a young man in Qabatiya, and another in Silwad. **********Information on the circumstances was scanty, partly because the Palestine Press Service was ordered closed by the authorities. The service feeds information to Israeli and foreign journalists through a network of local reporters. **********The protests erupted today after a lull of several days, with nearly 5,000 Palestinians jailed, according to army figures, and many refugee camps kept under what has become a near-permanent curfew. **********Hundreds of people gathered at midday at the home of Ahmed al-Wazir, the slain guerrilla leader's cousin and one of the few relatives still here, running the family's Turkish bathhouse, for the traditional Arab wake. **********Women, dressed in black, with their heads covered, gathered in a back room of the house, while across the street in a vacant lot, a tent filled with folding chairs had been set up for the men. Loudspeakers in the minaret of a nearby mosque broadcast readings from the Koran. A black banner hung with a Palestinian flag was stretched across the road, and the house was decorated with funeral wreaths and Palestinian flags. **********''All I can say is that Abu Jihad had been carrying his coffin in his own hands for the past 30 years,'' said Ahmed al-Wazir, whose sister, Intissar, was married to the guerrilla leader, her childhood sweetheart here."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/21/world/anti-contra-drive-ill-fated-shift-in-rebel-tactics.html": {"writer_name": "Bernard Trainor", "pub_date": "1988-03-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 969, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis; Military Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Anti-Contra Drive: Ill-Fated Shift in Rebel Tactics", "print_headline": "Anti-Contra Drive: Ill-Fated Shift in Rebel Tactics", "body_text": " **********The Sandinista offensive last week along the Nicaraguan-Honduran border succeeded in damaging the American-backed rebels because the contras violated a fundamental axiom of guerrilla war by allowing themselves to become a fixed target. **********The offensive stopped short of total success for reasons that appear more political than military. Information on the fighting indicates that the Sandinista operation was carefully planned, professionally executed and, facing only minor opposition, could have overrun the contra headquarters, major ammunition dump and hospital. **********The contras maintained a complex of camps in the Bocay River valley along the Honduran-Nicaraguan border for almost a year. The network was an irresistable target for the Sandinistas. **********Last May, the Sandinistas launched a foray into the same area. In the 1987 action the Sandinistas sought without success to disrupt contra infiltration into Nicaragua. This year, shortages of supplies, caused by the cutoff of American aid, forced the contras to retreat from the interior of Nicaragua to the Bocay area and their supply depot and headquarters in Honduras. In such a fixed position they were vulnerable. Strike Before Rainy Season **********The consolidation of contra forces in the Bocay area provided an opportunity for the Sandinistas to strike a blow against the rebels as they fell back. Such an operation, if successful, would also strengthen Managua's negotiating position in face-to-face talks with the contras scheduled for this week. It was also important to inflict as much damage on the contras as possible before the rainy season, which begins in late May, brings military operations to a halt. **********According to Maj. Roger Miranda Bengoechea, who was a close aide to Defense Minister Humberto Ortega Saavedra of Nicaragua before defecting to the United States last fall, the Sandinistas, while taking part in the Central American peace process, nonetheless planned to weaken the contras by seizing their base camps in the Bocay valley. **********The Bocay area, accessible only by air and on foot, became the main contra base of operations when, at the request of Honduras, the contras moved from Yamales to the border area around San Andres de Bocay, a village adjacent to the Coco River. Aid Cut Off in February **********The importance of the base camp grew when the Feb. 29 deadline for the cutoff of American aid to the contras approached. The contras were forced to stockpile arms and ammunition in a vulnerable area near the border. **********After one of the few contra resupply planes was shot down over southern Nicaragua in January, contras operating in the provinces of Jinotega and Matagalpa began drifting back to the Bocay area for their supplies. The Sandinista commander in the area sent out units to ambush the returning contras and to determine the location of their headquarters. **********The first indication that an offensive was in the making came in late February when large Sandinista troop and supply convoys began to move north to the mining town of Bonanza, where a command post and logistics base was established 30 miles from the border. Another indication of the coming military action occurred in February when Managua released scarce fuel reserves to army use. Ortega Alludes to Offensive **********By the beginning of March, Sandinista reconnaissance, infantry and artillery units were in place in and around the Bocay valley. Additional assault units along with nine Soviet-made transport helicopters were at the Sandinista headquarters in Bonanza. The force totaled at least 4,500. Antonov-26 transports were converted into bombers and began harassing the contras from high altitude. **********The contra leadership and Reagan Administration officials were aware of the impending offensive, but made no public disclosure. On March 8 in a speech in Managua, President Daniel Ortega Saavedra alluded to a coming offensive in the Bocay region. **********The offensive was launched the next day. Sandinista helicopters flying at tree-top level began to shuttle troops to landing zones close to the border. About 500 Sandinistas were landed about 5 miles from the border at the confluence of the Bocay and Amaca rivers. The next day they attacked north to seize the dirt airstrip across the Coco River in Honduras. Other infantry, artillery, rocket and bombing attacks in the Bocay region were underway, but the principal attack was against the airstrip. Contras Quickly Pull Back **********The contras tried to defend some of their positions in Nicaragua, but quickly abandoned them and retreated across the border into Honduras, causing confusion in the contra base camp a few miles northeast of San Andres. **********By last Wednesday the airstrip had been captured and the contras effectively cut off. The Sandinistas controlled the Bocay valley on their side of the border and what few contras remained in Nicaragua were making their way back into Honduras. The Government forces continued bombarding the contra headquarters complex just inside Honduras and advanced through the jungle against feeble resistence. **********The Sandinista offensive disrupted the major contra base camp. It destroyed weapons and ammunition, food, and most importantly denied a haven to contra forces. **********Managua denies its forces launched an attack into Honduras and said the goal of the offensive was only to chase the contras out of Nicaragua. But American officials said that up to 1,500 Sandinistas took part in the attack across the border and that their goal was to destroy the contra base complex. **********The overrunning of the contra camps was clearly within the capability of the Sandinistas. When they halted their offensive on Wednesday, Washington officials attributed the about-face to Mr. Reagan's decision to send American troops to Honduras."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/11/business/dow-gains-836-but-remains-below-2110.html": {"writer_name": "Lawrence Demaria", "pub_date": "1988-06-11", "snippet": "LEAD: Stock prices moved modestly higher yesterday, and the Dow Jones industrial average gained 8.36 points to close at 2,101.71.", "word_count": 711, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dow Gains 8.36 but Remains Below 2,110", "print_headline": "Dow Gains 8.36 but Remains Below 2,110", "body_text": " **********LEAD: Stock prices moved modestly higher yesterday, and the Dow Jones industrial average gained 8.36 points to close at 2,101.71. **********Stock prices moved modestly higher yesterday, and the Dow Jones industrial average gained 8.36 points to close at 2,101.71. **********The key blue-chip indicator again failed to close above the psychologically important 2,110 level.

The results include a reserve of $100 million for additional layoffs and reorganizations that will occur this year. Also included is an additional $35 million reserve to cover losses from an embarrassing computer snafu that has already caused the bank to set aside $25 million in the second quarter. Yearly Loss at $955 Million **********For the year, BankAmerica lost $955 million, compared with a $518 million deficit in 1986, and with a $337 million loss in 1985. The 1987 loss largely stems from BankAmerica's $1.1 billion addition to its reserves for loan losses in the second quarter, primarily because of loans to developing third-world countries. **********The Latin debt situation is the biggest cloud over the bank. While some regional banks have created extra reserves or written off some of their Latin debt - a tacit acknowledgement that the loans will never be repaid - BankAmerica and the major New York-based banking companies have not. BankAmerica's capital structure would be severely weakened if it made such moves. **********BankAmerica's fourth-quarter results were down slightly from the net income of $82 million, or 44 cents a share, reported for the comparable 1986 quarter. However, the 1986 results were buoyed by special gains from the sale of assets that masked an operating loss of about $80 million. **********In the 1987 fourth quarter, the bank estimated its operating profit at about $100 million, up from about $50 million in the third quarter. The figure excludes the special charges for restructuring and for the computer problem, which resulted from complications from new software to maintain accounts. A special gain of $87 million, mainly from the sale of a Swiss affiliate, is also excluded from the operating profit figure. **********''It feels good to have two solid quarters back to back,'' said Frank N. Newman, BankAmerica's vice chairman and chief financial officer. **********Donald Crowley, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in San Francisco, agreed. ''The results continue to show improvement, and they are beginning to make believers out of some of us,'' he said. **********Pacing the improvement were continued declines in loan losses and in provisions for future loan losses. **********The provision for credit losses totaled $137 million in the fourth quarter, compared with $163 million in the third quarter, and with $378 million in the fourth quarter of 1986. Loan losses in the 1987 quarter totaled $128 million, compared with $163 million in the third quarter, and with $371 million in the fourth quarter of 1986. For 1987, BankAmerica's loan losses were $843 million, compared with $1.4 billion a year earlier. More Cost-Cutting Needed **********Perhaps even more significantly, nonperforming assets, mainly loans that are in danger of becoming bad, also declined from the third quarter. But if loan problems are slowly abating, BankAmerica must still cut expenses if it is to become more than marginally profitable, analysts and officials said. **********Mr. Newman, the chief financial officer, declined to say how many jobs BankAmerica was expected to eliminate this year. About $69 million of the $100 million reserve for restructuring is designed to cover staff reductions, primarily an early retirement program at BankAmerica's Seafirst Corporation subsidiary in Seattle and for reductions in overseas operations, he said. **********BankAmerica is expected to eliminate about 5,000 positions this year. Its work force now totals about 59,500, down 18,600 from the end of 1985. While some of the reductions over the last two years have come from the sale of businesses, this year's reductions are likely to come more from layoffs and attrition because the bank's pace of asset sales has slowed. **********The computer difficulty, in BankAmerica's trust department, has already cost $60 million and has brought the resignations of the bank's heads of data processing and of the private banking and trust division. **********Mr. Newman said the $35 million reserve covered overtime fees and compensation to customers for interest not credited to their accounts on time, among other expenses.  BANK OF BOSTON **********The Bank of Boston Corporation yesterday announced a fourth-quarter loss of $41.4 million, compared with earnings of $64.8 million, or $1.03 a share, in the period a year ago. The results reflect a $200 million provision for possible losses on loans to less-developed countries. **********The Boston-based bank holding company said that its net income for 1987 fell to $19.7 million, or 10 cents a share, from $232.8 million, of $3.69 a share, in the previous year.

''The calendar is open and full of dates.'' General Noriega is facing pressure from Washington to leave power, including sanctions that have hurt the economy. General Noriega did not comment on reports that he met this week with a State Department envoy, Michael Kozak, who was in Panama to discuss the general's status.

The service gives credit to the original publications and gets no commercial benefit since it does not charge for translations and transmissions.

The Republic National Bank of New York quoted bullion at $473.75 an ounce late in the day, down $12.60 from Thursday's late price. Gold, silver and platinum futures declined on the Commodity Exchange. **********The bulk of the dollar's gains came in a spurt of activity that followed the release of the November trade data in Washington at 8:30 A.M. The report showed that the deficit fell a sharp 25 percent. **********Later, the dollar dipped briefly on a round of profit taking, but it then rebounded after the release of a report on producer prices that was seen as good news on inflation. **********During Thursday's trading, the dollar had sagged as many traders braced themselves for a deficit figure that some estimates had put as high as $18 billion. The actual $13.2 billion number, therefore, was a welcome surprise, and foreign-exchange experts said the number was likely to ease selling pressure on the dollar, at least temporarily. **********''The market loved it,'' said Paul O'Gara, chief foreign-exchange dealer at Midland Bank in New York. ''This number will certainly help the central banks maintain the dollar in whatever trading range they want.'' **********The reaction to the data was swift. Seconds before the numbers were announced, the dollar was bid in New York at about 1.6300 West German marks, slightly above Thursday's closing price. After the release, there were no offers to trade dollars until the exchange rate had risen to 1.6700 marks. 'A Lot of Buying Going On' **********''That's a 2.5 percent move up without any trading price at all,'' Mr. O'Gara said. ''There was a lot of buying going on.'' **********In late New York trading, the dollar was at 1.6865 marks, a 3.5 percent increase from Thursday's close, and the highest the dollar has been since mid-November. **********The dollar also recorded a sharp gain against the yen. The Tokyo currency market was closed yesterday for a holiday, but in Hong Kong and Singapore the dollar fell as low as 126.02 yen. However, in New York it surged to 131.05 yen moments after the trade numbers were announced. As dealers in New York were leaving for the weekend, the dollar was at 131.00 yen. **********Yesterday's 4 percent rise against the yen put the dollar back at levels seen earlier this month, when the dollar was sent upward on waves of buying by central banks. Some Experts Urge Caution **********While many traders said the trade numbers had improved the market's psychology enormously, other experts were less impressed. **********''These numbers tell me the odds on the dollar spiking down have diminished slightly,'' said Charles Taylor, a vice president in charge of international economics in the Washington office of Prudential-Bache Securities. ''But they don't say much more than that. In the final analysis, $13.2 billion is still a big, big number.'' **********The head trader at a New York bank echoed this sentiment: ''This is not a great number, even if it is better than we expected, and it is only one number. We will need to see some more of them before the dollar can achieve a degree of stability.'' **********Dealers said they were particularly interested to see how Japanese dealers would react to the trade figures when currency markets open in Tokyo on Monday. Based on early information, it seems likely that the dollar will move higher when trading opens in Asia. **********''I understand that a lot of Japanese exporters who had orders to sell dollars when it reached 130 yen have pulled them, hoping for higher levels,'' said James S. Vick, vice president of strategic foreign-exchange trading at the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company. ''For the next few weeks at least, people will be looking for opportunities to buy dollars when the currency weakens.'' **********Such activity would be in decided contrast to tactics that have been in place for much of the last year.

Manuel Antonio Noriega, the military chief and de facto ruler. **********General Noriega is under Federal indictment in the United States on racketeering and drug trafficking charges.

''People are eating away their lifetime savings. We're rotting from the inside.'' That has led to growing fears that Panama's financial hemorrhage may be irreversible.

Many private economists estimate much sharper declines. **********The official unemployment rate, which has ballooned to 18 percent from 10.2 percent at the end of 1986, continues to climb. Private economists say unemployment is now 30 percent or more, perhaps 50 percent, if the severely underemployed are included. **********An increasing number of Panama's poor are being forced out of the city and back to the farm. Private relief agencies report that hunger is growing, while long-time residents say Panama City already is noticeably shabbier. 'We're Getting Pretty Lean' **********They say that the crime rate has jumped and that there is more litter in the streets. Garbage is collected much less frequently, especially in neighborhoods that have been centers of protest against General Noriega. Real estate prices have dropped by 40 percent. **********Dominado Ador Kaiser Bazan, the senior partner in a large construction company and former president of the Contractor's Association, estimated that spending on construction, which totaled $220.5 million in 1987, would drop to $15.5 million this year. **********''So far we've survived on our fat,'' he said. ''But we're getting pretty lean.'' **********The economic decline is perhaps most evident in Panama's financial industry, the regional banking center before the crisis. Deposits and outstanding credit have dropped to about $15 billion from $37 billion at the beginning of last year, according to the Commerce Department. **********About half a dozen foreign banks, including Bankers Trust Company of New York, Republic National Bank of New York and First Chicago Bank, have closed their Panamanian operations. Others are expected to follow. Credit is almost nonexistent.  'We've Gone Back 400 Years' **********Several bankers and economists said the economy is regressing, turning away from modern services and back to such traditional industries as agriculture and fishing. **********''In many ways, we've gone back 400 years,'' said Mr. Arias. ''It's almost a medieval economy. Soon we'll be like any other Latin American country.'' **********The developments have left many middle-class professionals like Juana, the unemployed lawyer, without a useful skill. Noted before the crisis for their lavish life styles, members of the old middle class have been forced to slash their spending, refinance their mortgages and rearrange their lives. **********Many business people and middle-class professionals are surviving only by relying on barter. Several supermarkets, for instance, trade food coupons for computer services. **********''It's getting worse and worse every day,'' said Mr. Arias.

It also looks to be the most leveraged by any standard. **********That is the conclusion to be drawn from comparing the planned $12 billion Kraft deal with previous recapitalizations. And while it is impossible to say that this is as debt-burdended as any recapitalized company will ever get, the limit is surely approaching. For owners of Kraft securities after the recapitalization is completed, the higher level of leverage means more risks. **********Kraft, in announcing the planned recapitalization last Sunday, put the value of its deal at $110 a share, or $20 a share more than Philip Morris is offering for the company. The Kraft plan included $84 in cash and $14 in high-risk, high-yield ''junk bonds.'' Terms of those bonds, known in Wall Street parlance as ''cram-down'' bonds because they are forced on holders rather than being sold in the open market, have not been given. **********Finally, holders will keep their shares, or ''stubs,'' as they are known. Just what they will be worth is unknowable now, although the company put the value at $12. **********How leveraged will that leave Kraft? The company says its debt level will be $12.4 billion. At the $12 price it estimates for the stub, that would make shares in the company worth less than $1.5 billion. Of the total capitalization, 90 percent will be debt and just 10 percent equity. **********That calculation is based on market values as forecast by Kraft. At book value - that is, the value of the company's assets based on historic cost, less the amount of money it owes - the recapitalized Kraft would have a huge black hole where shareholder's equity should be. At the end of last year, it had assets at book value of just $5.5 billion, of which $900 million was good will. Its assets are thus on its books at less than half of the planned debt load. **********In terms of size, the company's negative net worth of more than $6 billion would be extremely large. But the general opinion on Wall Street now is that only accountants care about book value, which can seriously understate the value of such assets as brand names. In any case, all leveraged recapitalizations leave the companies involved with negative book value, so to compare relative levels of equity it is necessary to move to the market- value comparison. **********Most leveraged recapitalizations in the past have emerged with market values of equity of at least 15 percent of total capitalization, considerably more than the level contemplated by Kraft. **********The Kraft equity percentage would fall sharply, of course, if the stub share ends up being worth less than $12. One risk arbitrager, who has been buying Kraft, says he thinks $7 is a more reasonable figure, and Ronald B. Morrow, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, puts the probable value at $4 to $8. ''There won't be very much cash flow left,'' Mr. Morrow said yesterday. ''I've never seen a recap this leveraged.'' **********To offset such high leverage, one would normally expect large asset sales, which could be used to pay down debt. But Kraft says its sales will be limited. Some analysts think it will have to sell more than it currently plans. **********Notwithstanding the high leverage, Kraft's investment banker, Goldman, Sachs, says it is highly confident the deal can be financed, given current market conditions. If it is, and if Kraft decides to stick to its guns regarding only limited asset sales, look for a lot of ''PIK'' paper, short for ''pay in kind.'' In such paper, bonds pay interest not in cash but in more bonds. It is a good way of deferring cash flow problems for years, albeit at a high cost. **********In explaining the reorganization to its shareholders, Kraft's chairman, John E. Richman, said: ''Today's situation is not of our making. Rather, it is the product of current-era investment policies and financial attitudes that favor short-term financial gratification over steady, long-term growth and the need to provide a sound economy for future generations.''

Like Indira Gandhi of India, daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru, she follows the example of a famous father. Like Corazon C. Aquino in the Philippines and Sirimavo Bandaranaike of Sri Lanka, who picked up the cause of assassinated husbands, Ms. Bhutto believes herself to be the avenger of a martyred leader. **********Her father, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was overthrown in 1977 and executed two years later. She has run as her father's daughter, more a Bhutto than a woman to her Pakistan People's Party. Educated in the West **********But Ms. Bhutto, perhaps more like Mrs. Gandhi than other Asian women who have followed fathers or husbands, is a strong, Western-educated politician of skill and experience in her own right. **********And she comes to office in Pakistan - she will take her oath as Prime Minister on Friday - protected by a constitution that while declaring this an Islamic republic does not discriminate against women politically. Ghulam Ishaq Khan, the acting President who appointed her, rejected the advice of conservative Muslim clerics and backed Ms. Bhutto's constitutional right to office, saying that in this matter the realms of theology and government were clearly separate. **********''As the Holy Koran says, put all your trust in those who are competent and deserving,'' Mr. Ishaq Khan said in a nationally televised address to the nation. ''Today is the day to hand over a sacred trust to those who deserve it.'' State of Emergency Lifted **********He also announced the lifting of the state of emergency declared in August, and the resignation of all ministers and presidential advisers connected to the regime of President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq. who was killed in a plane crash on Aug. 17. **********''The new Prime Minister should be able to take up her responsibilities in a completely democratic atmosphere,'' Mr. Ishaq Khan said.  In his speech, Mr. Ishaq Khan, a former Finance Minister and chairman of the Pakistan Senate who was thrust into the caretaker President's job at the death of President Zia, admitted that he would have preferred a broad-based coalition government. **********''But I had no right to make that decision,'' he said, adding that neither Ms. Bhutto's party nor her main rival, the Islamic Democratic Alliance, wanted such a coalition. A 60-Day Test **********Forced to choose, he said he decided that the Pakistan People's Party was more likely to win the backing of the majority in the 237-seat National Assembly. Ms. Bhutto will have 60 days to test her Government in a vote of confidence in the assembly. **********Now Pakistanis, who gave her a cautious plurality rather than the landslide victory she hoped for, will be watching to see if Ms. Bhutto, who is 35 years old, will be able to put the bitterness of the past behind her and concentrate on building a better future. **********Benazir Bhutto, known as Pinkie to her friends and family because of her rosy complexion, was born on June 21, 1953, to one of the wealthiest and most influential families in Sind Province. She has never held a salaried job. Convent Schools and Radcliffe Ms. Bhutto was educated at a series of convent schools in Pakistan, and went to Radcliffe College as an undergraduate in 1969. After her graduation in 1973 with a B.A. cum laude in government, she enrolled at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford University, where she remained until 1977, earning a B.A. in philosophy, politics and economics. **********She returned to Pakistan in June 1977, just before her father, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who had been in office since 1971, fell from power. **********Mr. Bhutto, overthrown in a coup led by his army chief of staff, General Zia, was executed two years later on a conviction of conspiracy in a political murder. **********After General Zia refused worldwide pleas to pardon him, Ms. Bhutto resolved to defeat the man who she says assassinated her father. General Zia's death in August opened the way to the Nov. 16 election that brought Ms. Bhutto to power; she calls his death ''God's will.'' Mother in Parliament **********Ms. Bhutto's mother, Nusrat, was a relatively emancipated woman for her time, the daughter of an Iranian business family. Nusrat Bhutto's strong personality - she is now chairman of the Peoples Party and a member of parliament - has influenced Ms. Bhutto, acquaintances say. But Benazir's most intense, almost blind devotion centered on her father, who involved her in politics from an early age. **********Prime Minister Bhutto was a controversial figure, politically and personally, but Ms. Bhutto will brook no criticism of him, those who know her say. **********The novelist Salman Rushdie, reviewing her autobiography, faults Ms. Bhutto for what he regards as deliberate distortions of history. **********Writing in The Observer of London on Nov. 20, Mr. Rushdie notes the absence in the autobiography, ''Daughter of the East,'' of any mention of Mr. Bhutto's rigging of elections in 1977 and his heavy-handed suppression of nationalists in Baluchistan. Arrested Many Times **********Supporters of Ms. Bhutto say that while she has inherited a large measure of her father's determination - she endured multiple arrests at the hands of General Zia, only to emerge again and again into the political limelight, resigned to the next detention - she has been tempered by her Western education, and by her association with a new political generation in Pakistan and abroad. **********In her autobiography, published last month in Britain by Hamish Hamilton, Ms. Bhutto calls the Harvard years ''my first taste of democracy.'' **********She discarded her modest Muslim Pakistani clothes for jeans. ''I let my hair grow long and straight and was flattered when my friends in Eliot Hall told me I looked like Joan Baez,'' she wrote. **********Ms. Bhutto says she found Oxford less congenial at first. But she stuck it out, and was elected president of the Oxford Union in 1976. An Arranged Marriage **********Ms. Bhutto's Western education during years when the feminist movement was strong, has paradoxically helped her in adjusting to one of her most surprising decisions: her agreement to an arranged marriage. **********When she accepted a proposal from Asif Ali Zardari, another rich Sindhi (with his own polo team), she said that she had learned in the West that marriage and a career - even a political career - could be balanced. When she found the right Pakistani who could accept this view, she was prepared to become an Eastern bride. **********''We were coming into marriage with no preconceptions,'' Ms. Bhutto wrote of her wedding to Mr. Zardari on Dec. 17, 1987, when they were both 34. ''Our love could only grow.'' **********On Sept. 21, 1988, their first child, a son, Bilawal, was born in Karachi.

And a new magazine for older readers certainly challenges the odds in a culture that idolizes youth. **********It will take at least two years before it is clear whether Lear's can be a profitable magazine. But very early indications are that Frances Lear's publication for the woman over 40 has a reasonable chance of succeeding with readers and advertisers. **********One independent observer, John Mack Carter, director of magazine development at the Hearst Corporation, said Lear's had a narrow editorial approach, but its intensity faithfully reflected the obsession and emotion of its editor. ''That never has been a bad editorial proposition,'' Mr. Carter said. ''In a world full of marshmallows, a hard edge gets attention and respect.'' **********The September issue, Lear's fourth, carries 100.03 pages of advertising. That is almost triple the number of ad pages in the issue for summer, which is generally a soft time for magazines, and 24 pages more than in the first issue. The publisher, Michele S. Magazine, said in a telephone interview recently that 30 of the advertisers in the current issue were new. **********''Initially, each advertiser committed for three pages, but we are constantly picking up new advertisers,'' Ms. Magazine said. She apparently feels confident enough about the magazine's future that she is off for a weeklong vacation, her first in quite a while. **********Internal research at the magazine shows that 76 percent of its readers are between 40 and 64 years old. Lear's largest advertising category is fashion, which accounts for 25 percent of ad pages. Although it has not happened often, there have been instances of ads being refused because the models were too young, Ms. Magazine said. **********The second-biggest ad category is cars, which represents 22 percent, and the third-largest is fragrances. But the area where Ms. Magazine is most confident of growth is in financial services. **********A single page in Lear's costs $10,375, which Ms. Magazine said was about $47 per thousand readers. ''Upmarket books tend to charge between $40 and $50 per thousand,'' Ms. Magazine said, ''so we are in the range.'' **********Karen Ritchie, senior vice president and manager of the magazine management group at Lintas USA, a unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, has been buying aggressively for Chevrolet. **********''Lear's has been presenting grown-up women in a positive light,'' she said. ''And they have been delivering way over their rate base.'' **********Rawlee Marcus, senior vice president of media at the Neutrogena Corporation, likes the magazine because it delivers wealthy older readers, who are generally tough to reach. **********Lear's has its critics. David Lehmkuhl, senior vice president of N. W. Ayer, thought the first issue was terrific, but he felt the more recent ones were less ''in touch.'' **********''The second issue seemed to border on an Elle knockoff,'' he said. ''It was too young. Now we are saying: 'Hang on. We have to put a more jaundiced eye to it.' '' **********Ms. Lear, who has the title of editor in chief, acknowledges that she is still jiggering the editorial content. ''After the first issue, we felt we had to make it clearer that the magazine was not just for single women,'' she said. ''We want to make sure that we profile married women, too. The perception was that we were too much for single women.'' **********She is also adding a column called ''Talk/Backtalk,'' which will describe controversies over particular issues. **********Nevertheless, Ms. Lear said that she was running close to her projected four-year start-up budget of $25 million and that she planned to go monthly in March. Circulation growth is ahead of plan, said Marc Liu, the executive vice president of the magazine. **********''We started with 200,000 circulation and increased it to 250,000 in the September-October issue,'' he said. ''Our newsstand is ahead of expected. We sold 80,000 copies last month. And in July we mailed three million promotions and got a 7.5 percent response. Four percent is normal.'' **********In the spring, just before going monthly, Lear's will raise the rate base to more than 300,000, Ms. Magazine said. **********Still, the initial subscription price was $15 for six issues.

Export of the material is strictly limited by the United States. Egypt has been trying to expand its weapons production and exports. **********The wiretaps in which ''the minister'' was mentioned were made in late May and early June. In one exchange involving Mr. Helmy, James Huffman, a marketing representative of Teledyne McCormick-Selph, a military contractor in California, and an Admiral Elgohary, identified in court papers as an official in the procurement office of the Egyptian Embassy in Washington, the three men discussed methods of shipping various substances out of the United States, according to transcripts of the conversation. **********At one point in the conversation, Mr. Helmy said, ''You know the minister wanted the cargo shipped no matter what.'' 'Minister' Mentioned Again **********Later that day, in a conversation with a Col. Hussam Yossef, an Egyptian officer based in Salzburg, Austria, who is identified in the indictment as being in charge of the smuggling scheme, Mr. Helmy complained about a lack of cooperation.

Critics, who call the practice self-referral, contend that questionable services may be ordered, adding to the nation's surging health-care costs and raising concerns about the quality of care received by the patient. ''It puts physicians in an undesirable situation where their economic interest may run counter to the interests of the patient,'' said Dr. Arnold S. Relman, editor of The New England Journal of Medicine. **********The Administration is preparing regulations to enforce two little-noticed restrictions on physician referrals that Congress ordered last year. Congressional committees are working on several other proposals that would curtail certain physician-business relationships. **********Congressional aides have collected examples of investor prospectuses that lure physicians with promises of substantial financial returns from joint ventures and limited partnerships linked to the number of patients they refer to a laboratory or therapy center. **********''There are a lot of slick big-money artists out there, in effect telling doctors, 'You can make $50,000, $60,000, in easy money with no more difficulty than reaching for your prescription pad,' '' said Representative Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon. **********Most doctors have resisted the siren songs. But the self-referrals have become increasingly common as physicians scramble for revenues. ''The oversupply of doctors has created a loss of income, and Medicare has been squeezing them,'' said Seth H. Shaw, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities. **********The American Medical Association generally opposes Federal regulations. But spokesmen for independent clinical laboratories and hospitals argue that the self-referral practices constitute unfair competition. **********''We believe that the criteria for referring patients for home I.V. therapy should be based on quality of service, not financial incentives,'' said Patrick Smith, president of New England Critical Care Inc., which provides home infusion services. **********Doctor-owned ventures can pose ''a potential conflict of interest,'' said Dr. James H. Sammons, executive vice president of the American Medical Association. But he said in an interview that the A.M.A. had adequately addressed the issue through its rules on ethics. **********The medical association's council on ethical and judicial affairs advises such physicians ''to acknowledge that interest to the patient and name the options, if there is some other place to go,'' Dr. Sammons said. Arguing against Government regulations, he added, ''In the real world of American middle-sized towns, there are not that many options.'' **********Nevertheless, moves to restrict physicians' business relationships are advancing: *********** The recently passed law expanding Medicare payments for catastrophic illnesses includes a ban on payments to physicians who refer patients to home infusion therapy companies in which they have a direct ownership interest. *********** Longstanding criminal penalties for kickbacks paid for patient referrals under Medicare and Medicaid have rarely been enforced. But last year Congress added sanctions that would make offenders ineligible for reimbursement. To enforce this law, the Department of Health and Human Services last week completed new proposed anti-kickback regulations. *********** The Senate has passed a bill to regulate clinical laboratories and restrict self-referrals to such labs by physicians. Under pressure from the A.M.A., a similar provision was knocked out of the parallel bill adopted by the House last week. *********** The House Energy and Commerce Committee has passed a bill sponsored by Mr. Wyden that would prohibit physicians from selling prescription drugs at a profit. **********Full-scale studies of the self-referral issue are under way in the General Accounting Office and the Inspector General's office at Health and Human Services. **********The chairman of the House Ways and Means subcommittee on health, Fortney H. Stark, Democrat of California, is sponsoring a wide-ranging bill that would prohibit such referrals with certain exceptions, such as services in a doctor's own office or a group medical practice. **********''The public will not have confidence in the medical profession if a substantial fraction of the nation's physicians are profiting from a web of hidden commercial arrangements,'' Representative Stark said. **********Uwe E. Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University, said: ''The key word in all this is 'trust.' The medical profession must ask itself what it is worth to lose this trust.'' **********But Professor Reinhardt said he doubted that Federal regulations would be effective.

But from the beginning, we knew that we could not send this soldier back to North Korea against his own will.'' **********The case of Mr. Min began in early November 1983, when Mr. Min arrived in Japan after stowing away on the Fuji san Maru 18, a Japanese freighter that regularly shuttled back and forth from North Korea. **********Mr. Min was taken into custody, and apparently the Japanese suspected for some time that he could be a spy. Two weeks later, when the freighter was back in North Korea, several Japanese crew members were seized. Most were released, but two of them, Isamu Beniko, the captain of the ship, and Yoshio Kuriura, the freighter's engineer, were accused of spying, apparently in retaliation for the defection. **********Japan has said that the two were ''perfectly innocent'' and that the charges were trumped up. But late last year the two were convicted of espionage and sentenced to 15 years of labor. 'Uncertain Status' **********Meanwhile, Mr. Min's application for refugee status in Japan was denied, for reasons the Japanese have never made clear. He was kept under close guard, apparently because of fears that North Korean agents might try to kidnap or assassinate him. **********On Friday Japanese officials revealed that they gave Mr. Min temporary release from detention 13 months ago, and that he was now working somewhere in Japan, though under ''uncertain status.'' ''He has now expressed a will to stay in Japan,'' Mr. Tanaka said Friday. ''So he is now free to move about and we have granted him a special residency permit.'' In three years, he said, Mr. Min could apply for permanent residency. **********Officials offered no explanation of why it took five years to decide how to deal with Mr. Min, or why Japan had reversed its earlier decision to deny him refuge. Outside observers have voiced suspicions that Japan feared any action to offer him asylum could worsen the situation of the Japanese hostages. **********For his part, Mr. Min has never appeared before the public, and Japanese officials say they are keeping his whereabouts secret for his own security."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/04/business/advertising-glenmore-consolidates-at-grybauskas-agency.html": {"writer_name": "Julia Siler", "pub_date": "1988-02-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 182, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; Glenmore Consolidates At Grybauskas Agency", "print_headline": "Advertising; Glenmore Consolidates At Grybauskas Agency", "body_text": " **********Glenmore Distilleries has consolidated its advertising business at Grybauskas & Partners Marketing, a Greenwich Village shop that has been serving the Louisville, Ky., spirits company since 1979. **********Roland V.

Other Haitians said the bags contained cocaine. **********Several weeks later, a group of Haitian soldiers, several Colombians and an American returned after midnight with cables and batteries in an unsuccessful effort to recover the plane, which had become disabled. **********These incidents, which United States officials confirmed through a variety of sources, provided some of the best evidence so far of involvement by Haiti's military in the brisk business here of smuggling cocaine from South America into the United States. **********In a news conference Saturday in Miami, Leslie F. Manigat, the deposed President, said it had been his efforts to curb drug trafficking and corruption that led to his overthrow by the army a week ago. Assertion Comes as Surprise **********His assertion came as a surprise to Haitians and foreign diplomats who had been closely following Mr. Manigat's progress during his four months as President. **********They said there appeared to be no question that Haiti, with its hundreds of miles of unpatrolled coast and dozens of remote landing places, had joined other Caribbean islands as a stepping stone to the United States for drug smugglers, and they said that they had repeatly heard that members of the army were involved. **********But they said that until Mr. Manigat clashed with Lieut. Gen. Henri Namphy in a power struggle that broke into the open two weeks ago, the President appeared to have been cautiously avoiding offending the military. **********The Haitians and diplomats said that Mr. Manigat had taken some modest steps to reduce the smuggling of such imported goods as food, household appliances and automobiles, in which the army appears to be heavily involved. But they were unaware of any major effort by him against drug smuggling. He had quietly suggested replacing the police chief, aides said, but had backed off when General Namphy objected. **********His downfall, the Haitians and foreign diplomats said, seemed to have come from miscalculating the extent of his support in the military, coupled with what many soldiers regarded as insults to their institution, including the dismissal and house arrest of General Namphy followed by an attempted sweeping reorganization of the army. **********Haitians and foreign diplomats say it seems unlikely that General Namphy will crack down on the smuggling of drugs and general contraband, which sometimes overlaps. **********On the other hand, General Namphy has never been mentioned as being involved in narcotics trafficking. He has been at odds with the man who is perhaps the key figure in the Haitian drug trade, Col. Jean-Claude Paul, who has been indicted by a Federal grand jury in Miami on charges of conspiring to smuggle cocaine. Eventually, General Namphy is expected to move against Colonel Paul. Whether that would cripple smuggling or create an opportunity for other officers is unclear. Obstacles to U.S. Aid **********The Paul case and drug trafficking in general in Haiti had become an additional obstacle to the restoration of $60 million in direct United States economic aid that was suspended after elections last November ended in a massacre. The first requirement, however, had been progress toward democracy and on that score the military takeover has been an obvious setback. **********United States officials here and in Miami say that Colombian drug traffickers have increasingly turned to Haiti as pressure has been applied to stop smuggling through the Bahamas and the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti. **********It was a confrontation over Colonel Paul that brought the power struggle between Mr. Manigat and General Namphy to a head. The general ordered Colonel Paul to give up command of one of Haiti's two infantry battalions and Mr. Manigat stunned the nation by intervening. **********Mr. Manigat insisted that he had taken a constitutional stand and had not acted in behalf of Colonel Paul.

It accuses them of belonging to a secret leftist organization, Egypt Revolution, a Nasserite group that opposes the 1979 peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. **********In announcing the indictment in Cairo, the chief public prosecutor, Mohammed el-Guindi, said Khalid Nasser, 30 years old, was charged with complicity in organizing and financing the attacks on the Israelis and the Americans. Nasser Name 'Carries Magic' **********The indictment comes at a sensitive time; sentiment about the Israeli crackdown of Palestinian protests in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip is running high. **********In addition, a senior Arab official here said tonight, ''Gamal Abdel Nasser's name still carries magic around here and among all Arabs.'' **********Nasser, who led Egypt from 1952 until he died of a heart attack in 1970, is revered by many Arabs even though he helped bring the Arab countries to their greatest defeat, against Israel in the 1967 war. The defeat resulted in the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza as well as the Golan Heights of Syria and the Sinai Desert. Israel returned Sinai to Egypt under the 1978 Camp David accords. **********Charged with Khalid Nasser is Gamal Shawki Abdel Nasser, a nephew of the late President, and two army officers. **********Several Egyptians said the two Nassers were believed to have taken refuge in Yugoslavia after fleeing Egypt a few months ago as security officials developed the case. Other reports said the nephew was in Britain. Group Acknowledged Killings **********The prosecutor accused the Egypt Revolution group of responsibility for the assassination of an Israeli commercial attache in August 1985, the killing of an Israeli Embassy employee, the wounding of several Israelis in 1986 at Cairo's international book exhibit and the attempted murder of three American security and intelligence officers in their car last May in Cairo. **********Egypt Revolution, whose members were said to include doctors, businessmen and civil servants, took responsibility for all those actions. **********Mr. el-Guindi said the defendants intended to ''assassinate foreign diplomats to show that Egypt was insecure and to undermine relations between Egypt and these foreign states,'' meaning Israel and the United States. **********Unlike Islamic fundamentalists who have carried out several killings of Egyptian officials, Egypt Revolution enjoys a significant amount of sympathy in Egypt and throughout much of the Arab world. **********The group's attacks were seen as legitimate actions against Israel and the United States, which supports Israel, and they were hailed in the Arab press as nationalistic acts against the ''illegitimate'' Israeli presence in Egypt. **********A senior Egyptian Government official said the indictment shows that ''no one here is above the law, despite the highly controversial nature of the case.'' Investigators Were Stymied **********The killings disturbed Egyptian security officials because the attacks had been carried out smoothly and baffled investigators. The investigation made progress last August when one of the defendants told security officers about the group. **********Mr. el-Guindi said no foreign governments were involved in the attacks, although there had been suggestions in the Egyptian press that Libya was financing the Egypt Revolution group. **********Ten members of the group are in custody. Nine defendants, including Khalid Nasser's cousin Gamal, face jail terms if convicted of lesser charges.

The move, which is expected, would make it difficult for giant institutions such as Chase Manhattan, Citicorp and Chemical Bank to expand, according to bankers, their lawyers and analysts. **********Although the new rules will force the giants to reduce their role in United States banking, analysts predicted that the measures would significantly improve the long-term health of the country's banking industry. Many see it as a necessary measure for the giant banks, which are saddled with large third-world loans and other risky commitments. **********''The big banks will be forced to cut expenses, avoid growth with narrow margins and generally run leaner operations,'' said H. Rodgin Cohen, a banking attorney for Sullivan & Cromwell, a law firm in New York. ''Though it might be strong medicine, they undoubtedly will be stronger in 1992 than they were in 1988.'' **********Still, the proposal upsets such bankers as Michael P. Esposito Jr., chief financial officer at Chase Manhattan Bank. ''I am concerned with the competitive aspects of the proposal,'' he said. ''I see the proposal as it relates to most of the money-center banks as constraining the ability to do bank mergers.'' **********Meanwhile, some strong, emerging regional banks, currently so profitable that the Federal Reserve's proposal would hardly affect them, are likely to assume the leading role in bank acquisitions and expansion. Super-regionals, as these banks are known, are primarily situated in the industrial Northeast and Southeast and specialize in making loans to businesses within their regions. Without the burden of raising new capital, they will be free to merge and grow. **********''You are definitely going to see a shift in the banking wealth of this country away from the traditional centers of New York, Chicago and San Francisco to cities such as Boston and Atlanta,'' said Karen Shaw, executive vice president of the Institute for Strategy Development, a Washington consulting firm. ''The super-regionals are the best capitalized, most profitable banks in the country, and the Fed proposal is only going to reinforce that.'' **********Some money-center banks are already cutting back. Chemical Bank recently sold one operation for $30 million, and has made it known that its consumer finance division, the Chemical Financial Service Corporation, is for sale at a price between $200 million and $300 million. **********''The very big banks have got to change the mix on their balance sheets to become more profitable,'' said Edward Crutchfield, chairman of the First Union Corporation in Charlotte, N.C., one of the nation's most profitable super-regional banks. ''And I think the Fed proposal is going to force something that is economically good.'' 12-Nation Agreement The Federal Reserve's proposed capital requirements follow an agreement in December with the central banks of 11 other major industrial nations to establish similar standards for financial institutions. **********For the biggest banks, the new captial guidelines would be onerous for two reasons. First, they measure a bank's assets based on a system that factors the riskiness of its assets into the equation, plus they include certain commitments that do not appear on a bank's balance sheet, but still expose the bank to lending risk. **********Second, the Federal Reserve's new guidelines both redefine and increase the levels of capital that banks must have. In particular, they would require banks to have shareholders' equity -retained earnings plus funds paid in by stockholders - equivalent to 4 percent of their risk-weighted assets. The proposal would also require banks to have a second type of capital - also equivalent to 4 percent of risk-adjusted assets - comprising loan loss reserves, preferred stock and subordinated debt. In total, banks would be required to have capital levels of 8 percent by 1992, up from 6 percent. **********Analysts said the biggest banks might have to raise several billion dollars in capital over the next five years to meet the Federal Reserve's guidelines. More-Promising Outlook **********For the super-regional banks, which have been enjoying record profits in recent years, the numbers look far more promising. According to estimates by Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, which specializes in analyzing bank stocks, only 26 of the 200 largest banks in the United States currently fall under a 4 percent level of shareholder equity to total assets. Those 26 mostly include the money-center banks in New York, Chicago and California, plus troubled banks in the Southwest. **********The investment firm's numbers also show that almost every other large regional bank is above the 4 percent level, with certain institutions like First Union, the PNC Financial Corporation of Pittsburgh and the Banc One Corporation of Cincinnati rising to levels between 6 percent and 7 percent. **********Applying the proposed new capital requirements, only two of the 14 largest banks in the country - J. P. Morgan & Company and the Bankers Trust Company of New York - would be above the 4 percent level. **********Keefe, Bruyette & Woods acknowledges that its calculations are based on the banks' total assets and notes that banks do not release enough data to calculate what their assets would be under the proposed risk-based system. But the firm's analysts say the risk-based numbers, in most cases, would not be much different. A Precious Commodity **********Banks have essentially two ways to acquire other institutions - either by a new stock offering, or a combination of cash and stock. Both kinds of transactions would be hampered by the Federal Reserve guidelines. **********Cash will be a precious commodity to the money-center banks over the next few years, especially since they have experienced huge losses from bad third-world loans. In addition, the Federal Reserve and other regulators are expected to urge these banks to hold onto what profits they do not pay out to shareholders in the form of dividends. **********Acquisitions made by issuing new shares of stock are perhaps even less attractive. In the current stock market environment, most of the money-center bank stocks are very depressed and will likely remain at low price levels until they improve their balance sheets, analysts said. Thus, issuing of more stock would only dilute the existing shares and would be unattractive to any bank to be acquired. **********By contrast, the stocks of the super-regionals are near record highs, giving these banks a huge advantage in the takeover game. Indeed, the outstanding stock of Suntrust Banks Inc. of Atlanta, Ga., a $26 billion banking company, is worth more than all the outstanding shares of Chase, the nation's second-largest banking concern with assets of almost $100 billion. Future Financial Health **********But for Federal Reserve officials and some analysts, the future financial health of the big banks will outweigh their ability to expand. They argue that the regulators have provided ample time to reach the new levels. **********''The good news is that there is a phase-in period,'' said James McDermott, bank analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. ''That should give managements of even the weakest banks enough time to meet the Fed's new levels. But it will not give them much room to do deals.'' **********Nevertheless, despite complaints of existing competitive disparities, many analysts describe the Fed's action as a landmark proposal, especially since the central banks of 11 other nation's agreed to the same approach to regulating their banks. **********''The global approach is terrific,'' Mr. McDermott said. ''There may be bumps. Big banks might not be able to get bigger. But this is a valid attempt to level the playing field.''

The greater the internal budget deficit, the lower the rate of national savings and the greater the dependence on foreign capital. **********The persistent United States budget and trade deficits have lessened the ability of the nation to control its economy and hampered its leadership of the non-Communist world. Among American politicians and economists alike, there is now a consensus that to remedy the nation's external weakness the structural budget deficit must be reduced, and if possible eliminated, in the next four or five years. **********But there is no consensus on how to do it. The conflict between Republicans and Democrats on that issue has been widened by Vice President Bush's pledge not to raise taxes, while Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts has left open the option of raising taxes if expenditures cannot be cut enough to close the budget gap. Mr. Dukakis asserts he would raise taxes only ''as a last resort,'' but said in an interview with Business Week, ''No serious candidate for the Presidency can guarantee that he wouldn't raise taxes.'' **********Mr. Bush portrays the Dukakis position as a ''fundamental'' difference with his own and apparently means to make his no-tax-increase pledge the centerpiece of his conservative campaign, following the strategy President Reagan devastatingly used against Walter F. Mondale in 1984. This week President Reagan gave strong support to Mr. Bush's assault on Governor Dukakis as a high-taxing, high-spending liberal who had just approved tax increases in Massachusetts. **********Highly sensitive to the way Mr. Reagan used the tax issue to crush Mr. Mondale, the Dukakis camp was in a state of anxiety this week on how to parry the Republicans' attack. Until now Mr. Dukakis has been vague on how he would eliminate the budget deficit. He has said it would be irresponsible for him to get too specific before gaining the Presidency. **********Mr. Bush has been more specific. He would balance the budget in the next four or five years by a ''flexible freeze'' on expenditures, holding the growth of aggregate spending to the rate of inflation while rising revenues gradually eliminate the deficit. ''Flexible freeze'' means increasing some Federal programs, like education, while cutting others - as yet unspecified. Mr. Bush has said he would not touch Social Security and would allow military spending to rise only enough to keep pace with inflation. **********According to the Bush projections, this plan would reduce the budget deficit, which has been projected by the Congressional Budget Office at $134 billion in 1993 under current policies, to just $16 billion in that year, with savings of $58 billion coming from holding the growth of domestic spending down to the inflation rate and savings of about $60 billion coming from an assumed drop in Federal interest payments. **********Critics of the Bush plan are calling it the return of ''Rosy Scenario'' - the term disclosed by David A. Stockman, the first director of Mr. Reagan's Office of Management and Budget, for the original high-growth, no-recession projection underlying the Reagan plan to balance the budget while cutting taxes and rapidly raising military outlays. Instead of achieving budget balance, the United States has had the biggest string of peacetime deficits in its history, raising the national debt from $1 trillion in 1981 to more than $2.5 trillion now. **********Mr. Bush's advisers insist that their long-term budget-balancing plan is not based on rosy assumptions, noting their use of the Congressional Budget Office's projections, which, they say, are ''less optimistic'' than those of the Reagan Administration. The budget office's projections have the unified budget deficit, including the partly offsetting Social Security surplus, declining from $167 billion in the fiscal year 1990 to $134 billion in 1993. **********But Richard N. Brandon, staff director of the Senate Budget Committee, contends that the budget office's projections are based on overly optimistic assumptions: first, that there will be no recession for the next five years; second, that military spending will be held to zero real growth with no existing strategic plan to hold the Defense Department down to that level; third, that there will be no extra spending for unanticipated developments, where such spending has averaged $15 billion a year for the last 10 years. **********Mr. Brandon estimates that under present policies the non-Social Security deficit will persist at more than $220 billion for the next four years and that, correcting for the optimistic assumptions, the overall structural deficit will remain at about 4 percent of the gross national product. **********The assumption by Mr. Bush that about $60 billion of the budget deficit in 1993 will be eliminated by the drop in interest payments, as a result of the financial markets' acceptance of the credibility of his budget-balancing plan, raises doubts. For one thing, the persistence of internal and external deficits in the next few years will swell the volume of Federal debt on which interest must be paid; President Reagan's fiscal year 1989 budget projects net Federal interest payments rising from $135 billion next year to $141 billion in 1991. **********With the economy continuously growing, efforts to keep the dollar stable are likely to keep interest rates high or raise them higher. But if the dollar does fall further to keep the trade deficit shrinking, financial markets would anticipate even stronger upward pressure on interest rates. **********The markets, and the rest of the country, are still looking for a credible plan to balance the budget -from both candidates."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/29/business/business-people-ashton-chief-is-positive-despite-a-product-delay.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-09-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 434, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ashton Chief Is Positive Despite a Product Delay", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Ashton Chief Is Positive Despite a Product Delay", "body_text": " **********The Ashton-Tate Corporation has confirmed that shipments of the latest update of its flagship product, dBase IV, will be further delayed.

For example, the offered rate for three-month bank deposits in London, the world's largest wholesale deposit market, rose to about 8 1/4 percent from 8 1/8 percent. **********In the domestic market, interest rates on overnight bank loans in the Federal funds market, a closely watched barometer of Federal Reserve policy, have averaged about 7 3/4 percent in the last two days, up from a 7.59 percent average in the week ended Wednesday. Overnight Rate of 30% **********Because the overnight rate traded as high as 30 percent late Wednesday, some analysts estimated the Fed was less generous in providing reserves to the banking system than expected. They added that the Wednesday level was not typical because it was the end of a bank reserve accounting period, when the funds rate is often volatile. **********Late yesterday the Fed reported that reserves were so scarce in the two weeks ended Wednesday that bank borrowings at the Fed's discount window averaged more than $1.3 billion, up from an average of about $520 million in the previous six weeks. **********''We expect funds to trade between a low of about 7 5/8 percent and a high of about 7 3/4 percent,'' said William S. Coleman, manager of the Treasury securities trading at Drexel Burnham Lambert Government Securities. If the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market stays at that level, he said, rates on other short-term issues, due in two years and less, would tend to rise. Treasury Issues Are Mixed **********The 8 percent Treasury notes due in two years were offered yesterday at 99 17/32, down 2/32, to yield 8.26 percent. Among longer maturities, the 9 1/8 percent Treasury bonds due in 2018 were offered at 99 18/32, up 2/32, to yield nearly 9.17 percent. **********Many analysts had previously estimated that the overnight funds rate would average about 7 1/2 percent or 7 5/8 percent after the Fed's late June adjustment. But they noted that it often takes a few weeks for the Fed's intentions to become clear, especially when financial conditions are clouded by unusual flows of money near the end of the second quarter. **********Looking beyond the discussions about a 7 1/2 or 7 3/4 percent Federal funds rate, many economists and investors are convinced that it is only a matter of time before the Fed raises short-term rates further. **********Some economists noted that the economy is likely to grow in the second half at a rate that would exceed the rate suggested by the Fed's real G.N.P. growth projection of 2 3/4 to 3 percent from the fourth quarter of last year. Growth Estimated at 4% **********Assuming a 3.3 percent growth rate in the second quarter, the economy has grown at a 4 percent rate over the past four quarters, ''and is not likely to slow to the 2.2 percent rate in the second half that would be consistent with the Fed's projections,'' said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank. **********''If the economy grows faster than the Fed deems appropriate to keep a cap on inflation, then it's a good guess that they will tighten policy in the future,'' Mr. Fine said. **********In the corporate market, investment bankers familiar with the ''junk bond'' market are busy finding ways to create silk purses from sows' ears by packaging pools of the low-quality junk bonds into new securities with higher credit ratings. **********Douglas Watson, director of Moody's Structured Finance Group, said in an article published yesterday that the growing volume of repackaged junk bonds would tend to help issuers of those securities. Increased demand for the junk issues after they are repackaged as higher-quality issues could attract many new investors and could help reduce the junk bonds' interest rates relative to other kinds of bonds. Packages of 'Junk Bonds' **********The Moody's report estimated that about a fifth of the $150 billion junk bond market might be packaged for resale as higher-quality, investment-grade issues. Moody's has so far assigned ratings from Aaa to Aa-3 to eight packages of junk bonds, totaling $1.1 billion. **********A new variety of security will probably be introduced this summer, secured by the cash flow of interest and principal payments from a pool of junk bonds, Mr. Watson said. The securities will be offered with senior and subordinated classes, with the senior securities backed by insurance. As an alternative, the new securities could be offered with multiple classes like collateralized mortgage obligations. Another new variety of security would use excess interest from a pool of junk bonds to create a reserve fund that would be available to pay off investors. **********Mr. Watson warned that in the case of new securities based on analysis of cash flows ''the default risk is very significant because substitutions of good collateral for bad are not typically contemplated.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/30/business/gnp-rate-up-to-2.6-in-quarter.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-11-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 746, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "G.N.P.

The inflation rate was also revised upward. **********Meanwhile, the rise in after-tax corporate profits in the July-September period was much smaller than in previous quarters as costs climbed more rapidly than the prices that companies were able to obtain for their products. **********The latest reading on the gross national product - the value of the goods and services turned out by the economy - was at the low end of expectations. For some economists the report confirmed the belief that the economy, albeit quite strong during the summer, has slowed. Analysts Split on Outlook **********''It's likely to be weaker in the fourth quarter than in the third,'' predicted Michael P. Daly, economist for the Cigna Corporation. Imports remain very high, he said, and ''the investment boom is beginning to slow.'' **********But other analysts, focusing on heftier increases in personal spending than first estimated, forecast continued healthy G.N.P. growth. **********''You're going to get good consumption spending in the months ahead,'' said James S. Fralick, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. He added that business activity might well be too rapid ''for an economy that's close to full employment.'' **********While there was little surprise in the latest data on inflation - the G.N.P. fixed-weighted price index rose at a 5.1 percent annual rate during the third quarter instead of the 4.9 percent reported last month - analysts noted that this was substantially higher than the 3.6 percent recorded for 1987. Report on Jobs Awaited **********The Federal Reserve, it is widely believed, is poised to tighten credit further to keep inflation in check if Friday's report on jobs in November shows another big gain. **********In raising its estimate of the third-quarter G.N.P. by four-tenths of a point, the Commerce Department said the biggest positive factors were an extra $3.2 billion of personal consumption spending and an extra $2.9 billion in business inventories. The biggest downward revision was $3.3 billion in governmental purchases, with another $300 million coming from the amount by which higher imports exceeded higher exports. **********Today's report also disclosed that the department had reduced to $12.8 billion from $13 billion the value of crops and animals lost from the summer drought. Since it left unchanged the amounts allocated to the second and third quarters, this means $6.8 billion is being assigned to the current quarter instead of $7 billion as previously indicated. **********Purchases of durable goods, today's report also showed, fell $1.1 billion in the quarter instead of rising $400 million, in contrast to a $9.5 billion increase in the second quarter. Producers' durable equipment rose $4.9 billion instead of $5.2 billion, far below the second quarter's $15.7 billion rise. **********The G.N.P. implicit price deflator advanced at a 4.7 percent rate in the third quarter, a rate that was higher than the 4.4 percent estimated last month but below the second quarter's rate of 5.5 percent. The implicit price deflator is a less precise inflation gauge than the fixed-weighted index because it reflects changes in the composition of output as well as in prices, Below Previous Results Corporate profits, which were not previously estimated, compared unfavorably with second-quarter results by all four measures. Profits from current production fell $2.8 billion, or nine-tenths of 1 percent, in the third quarter to a rate of $323.7 billion after rising by 3.3 percent in the second quarter. **********Profits before taxes rose six-tenths of 1 percent, compared with a 6.9 percent gain in the second quarter, while after-tax profits rose two-tenths of 1 percent following an 8.9 percent advance in the second quarter. Current-production cash flow, meanwhile, fell seven-tenths of 1 percent compared with a 1.4 percent gain in the second quarter. **********''The decrease in unit profits reflected smaller increases in the prices corporations received than in the unit costs they incurred,'' the Commerce Department said. ''Both labor and non-labor unit costs increased.''

The Senate upheld the veto on June 8 when its vote of 61 to 37 fell short of the two-thirds required to override it.

But it was attacked in the President's veto message as something that could ''harm U.S. grain producers.'' **********Senator Dole, who is from a major grain-growing state, said it was essential to ''get the ethanol provision out of it; otherwise there's not going to be a trade bill.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/14/business/credit-markets-small-movements-for-bond-yields.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1988-03-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 895, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Small Movements for Bond Yields", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; Small Movements for Bond Yields", "body_text": " **********While economic statistics have moved from signs of strength to weakness like a playground seesaw, investors and traders have been content to stand by idly and watch bond yields move in a very narrow range. **********At 8 1/2 percent last Friday, the yield of the 8 7/8 percent Treasury issue due in 2017 was at the upper end of a narrow range of about a quarter percentage point that has prevailed since late January. The 8 1/4-percent level touched briefly in February followed weak employment statistics and a smaller-than-expected trade deficit. **********Last week's peak of about 8.56 percent followed the release of much stronger employment statistics for February. But last Friday's announcements of weaker-than-expected retail sales in February and an unexpected decline in the Producer Price Index brought the bond yield back down to 8 1/2 percent. Conflicting Views on Trade Data **********This week's most closely watched economic statistic is likely to be the January merchandise-trade data, due to be released Thursday, which analysts expect will show a deficit of about $13 billion. How the bond market will react to the trade data is a tricky issue, with enough conflicting views to perhaps restrain any sharp move. **********The issue confronting analysts in bond and currency markets is the extent to which the reduction in the trade deficit from the record $17.6 billion in October is a trend or merely a seasonal improvement. The trade deficit measured by the volume of goods imported and exported began falling a while ago, but signs of a smaller deficit measured by nominal dollars have been elusive. The fundamental problem, analysts said, is that the decline in the dollar the last few years has stimulated American exports but has not led to a big slowdown in demand for imports. **********Even if the deficit is shrinking in terms of the dollar flows reported monthly, economists are unsure whether the decline will be great enough to mollify international investors. **********Robert Chandross, chief economist in New York for Lloyds Bank, noted that even if the balance of payments declines this year, as he expects, to $135 billion, from $159 billion, ''the magnitude of the deficit, and the amount of dollars foreigners will be accumulating is still large enough to suggest further modest declines in the dollar.'' Some See Further Drop in Dollar **********Predictions of further declines in the dollar may be one reason why private foreign investors have been wary of the American bond market even though the dollar has rebounded from its lows at the end of the year and has been relatively stable for nearly three months. **********Demand for Treasury notes with maturities of from two years to seven years has been strong from foreign central banks, but some analysts are worried about how the market will fare once the buying by central banks stops. **********Among institutional investors, the mixed signals from the economy have been enough to dampen their demand for additional long-term issues. But a continued low level of inflation has kept alive hopes for lower interest rates and encouraged them to continue holding notes and bonds bought in recent months. 'Inflation Still Looks Low' **********''I'm still in a bullish mode, even though the market has gone through a little correction from the highest levels of February,'' said Steve Smith, a bond portfolio manager at Provident Capital Management of Philadelphia. ''Inflation still looks low, and with wage costs rising by less than 3 percent, it does not seem likely to increase much.'' **********Mr. Smith added that the bond market also stands to benefit in a variety of ways once the stability of the dollar has become widely recognized.

So along come a far-reaching scientific advance making possible supereconductivity at economically feasible high temperatures - what W. Bruce Merrifield, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Productivity, Technology, and Innovation, calls ''one of the most significant commercial developments ever'' - and what happens? The White House and Department of Energy quickly organize an impressive national conference on two months' notice and millions of dollars are quickly reallocated to superconductivity research. In addition, patent and antitrust advantages are proposed and half a dozen national labs begin looking to promote government-business research efforts. And in the Senate, Senator Daniel P. Moynihan, Democrat of New York, proposed committing $300 million to developing a magnetically levitated train based upon this technology. **********How is corporate America repsonding? By and large, with very tentative interest. Of course, a few companies, such as I.B.M., A.T.&T.;, and Perkin-Elmer, are pursuing research and development to perfect the materials and processes that create high-temperature superconductivity so that electricity can be passed without resistance. But many others are taking ''a wait-and-see attitude.'' According to a survey by the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment, American industry in general is doing far less than the Japanese to commericalize this new technology. The major Japanese corporations are reported to have filed more than 2,000 superconductivity-related patent applications around the world in the last eight months. **********These numbers become more impressive when one begins to do some calculating. It costs about $20,000 to file each international patent application. With 2,000 patent applications filed, Japanese corporations have invested more than $40 million on filing fees alone. **********And that is just the tip of the iceberg. Japanese corporations have been pouring millions into research and engineering and are already boldy announcing new superconducting products. Fujikura, Sanyo and Sumitomo, for instance, have each announced production of high-temperature superconducting wire; Hitachi has developed an opticial device. **********These are just a few of the initial commercial products announced in the newly developing high-temperature superconductivity area - and they are arriving much sooner than many American experts have predicted. A dozen other blue ribbon Japanese companies have announced products in various stages of development - from ship propulsion systems to new medical instruments and ultra-fast computer elements. And this comes as several major American companies are dropping out of the superconductivity race. (Researchers at one company that is considering bowing out of the race are working on projects on their own time, without company financing.) Clearly, the Japanese are taking to heart their own predictions that high-temperature superconductivity will turn into a $20 billion to $34 billion annual market by the year 2000. **********But they are doing more than that. They are seeking to control - through patents, aggressive product development and marketing - as many aspects of superconductivity as possible. **********Their main competition in the United States seems to be coming from an assortment of young companies that have sprung up over the last year or so. These are companies with names like American Superconductor, Conductus, Superconductive Components and others, which are devoting scarce resources to developing new products and applications. **********The situation is the classic one that has troubled large-scale American industry since World War II. Major American corpporations are inclined to emphasize short-term gains or savings over long-term research. **********Government officials are pushing beyond their traditional myopia to emphasize long-term results. Academics are already seeing concrete evidence of the shift in attitude. **********A well-known researcher in superconductivity who has applied for Federal funds observed: ''I make sure in my funding proposal to mention the threat from Japan right in the first paragraph. And I keep mentioning it throughout the proposal. I figure that each mention of Japan is worth about $10,000 of additional funding.'' **********THE main difference in the superconductivity area compared with previous American debacles in such industries as autombiles and semiconductors is that the Japanese are no longer content to imitate and improve on existing products. Now they want to innovate. **********And they are being very public with their intentions. Normally secretive about new products and processes, major Japanese companies have been boldly announcing developments. It's almost as if they are thumbing their noses at American corporations and challenging them to match their progress. But American corporations remain eerily silent, either because they don't want to tip their hands or because they have nothing to announce. **********Assuming that the latter explanation applies, it's still not too late for American industry to break with its traditional emphasis on the short term and get to work to stake out serious claims in superconductivity. The fact that 16 major American corporations sent delegates to the White House Conference on Superconductivity last July indicates that there is some measure of interest. **********Corporate officials must face the reality of the Japanese challenge. They must monitor Japanese developments by keeping tabs on patent applications in countries where they are made public, like West Germany, Britain, Belgium and Greece. And they must come up with their own patentable processes and devices by committing themselves to the long haul in superconductivity. **********Failure to develop a significant American presence in the emerging superconductivity industry deals a serious, perhaps crippling, economic blow to this nation. Our Government is doing its share. This time American corporations have no one to blame but themselves. The window of opportunity is open; it will slam shut in a very short time."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/08/business/advertising-people.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1988-04-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 62, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; People", "print_headline": "Advertising; People", "body_text": " *********** Karen Kaczmar and Dennis F.

''The disclosed information has been of the type that can provide a company with an unfair advantage over its competitors and/or the Government.'' Confidential Information **********A ''substantial portion'' of the information disclosed as part of the purported scheme was classified or confidential, said the document, which was filed by the F.B.I. to support a search warrant for the offices of a senior official of McDonnell Douglas. **********Law-enforcement officials said that several similar documents had been filed in courts throughout the country as part of a major bribery investigation of officials at the Pentagon and major military contractors. **********The document focused on Melvyn R. Paisley, the Navy's former chief of research and development, who resigned from the military last year to open a private consulting company in Washington. He has recently worked for McDonnell Douglas. **********In a statement tonight, a McDonnell Douglas spokesman, James Reed, said, ''We are not aware of any improper request by the company to Mr. Paisley or any improper activites by Mr. Paisley on behalf of the company.''

Data Called Extremely Important **********The law-enforcement officials said the information that might have been provided to the company by Mr. Paisley could have been enormously important to McDonnell Douglas in its efforts to obtain Government contracts. **********The F.B.I. document, which was apparently unsealed by mistake by court officials, sought a wide variety of files from McDonnell Douglas's headquarters in St. Louis, including all contracts and payment records relating to Mr. Paisley's work for the company in the last year. **********It also sought documents relating to the work of James A. Lyons, a retired Navy Admiral who was commander of the United States Pacific fleet and who, the F.B.I. said, had worked for McDonnell Douglas from December 1987 to 1988. Mr. Lyons's home telephone was not answered late tonight. **********Admiral Lyons and Mr. Paisley were close aides at the Pentagon to the former Navy Secretary, John F. Lehman. **********A senior Federal law-enforcement official said today that Mr. Lehman was not a subject of the investigation. Mr. Lehman did not return telephone calls seeking comment.

Little, the vice chairman of government business, and James Caldwell, the vice president of international marketing for the company's aircraft division. **********Mr. Reed, the McDonnell Douglas spokesman, said the company was ''in the process of assessing the documents served on the company and producing the information requested by the Government.'' **********''It is apparent at this time that much of the information sought by the Department of Justice was information properly supplied to the company and its employees by D.O.D. to assist the company in carrying out its responsibilities as a contractor to the Government, or information generated by the company to assist the Government in its management of procurement activities,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/04/business/futures-options-profit-taking-hits-copper-but-price-outlook-is-strong.html": {"writer_name": "H.

Although metals analysts did not rule out further profit taking today by nervous traders and speculators, they said the shrinking global supply of copper should bolster prices until well into 1989. **********A major sign that copper is in short supply is the ''backwardation'' pricing structure that has developed on the Commodity Exchange in New York, the largest metals market. Backwardation occurs when the price of the nearest delivery contract costs more than more distant contracts. **********Yesterday, for example, the exchange's spot November copper delivery closed at $1.50 a pound, down 3.5 cents on the day, while the price of the next delivery month, December, fell 3.10 cents, to $1.432.

Cardillo, metals analyst at Josephthal & Company. ''We may even see some more profit taking Friday, but unless the economy tumbles into a recession in the next few months, the copper market should remain strong for some time.'' **********How strong was detailed by Frederick R. Demler, metals economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert, who pointed out that domestic industrial copper users normally keep an inventory-to-consumption ratio of about 7 to 1. ''At last count, the users had only a three-week supply of copper,'' he said. **********Some of yesterday's nervous selling may have been prompted by the sharp drop in Commodity Exchange copper stocks, Mr. Demler said. **********''The open interest in just the near December Comex delivery tells us that the ratio of contracts to underlying metal has widened to 33 to 1 from 6 to 1 a year ago,'' he said. ''We know a lot of copper users holding December contracts who want and will stand for delivery of the metal from those who sold them the contracts.'' **********Meanwhile, the global supply of copper continues to shrink because of strikes in Peru, a major producer. And the copper output of Zambia and Zaire, which are even more important copper producers, has been slashed by floods and the deterioration of those countries' mining operations because they lack the hard currencies needed to buy replacement machinery and parts, Mr. Demler continued. **********''Despite the 22 percent increase in domestic copper output by farsighted mining companies in the first nine months of this year, it has not kept pace with the increased global demand for the metal, particularly from Japan and other Asian countries,'' Mr. Demler said. ''Domestic copper production would have been even higher, except that for years the mining industy has been discouraged by repeated forecasts of an impending recession.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/09/business/sec-offers-margins-plan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-07-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 243, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "S.E.C.

Letter From Shevardnadze **********But in an attempt to allay concerns raised last month by Mr. Nunn and other members of the Armed Services Committee about the treaty's application to futuristic weapons, Secretary of State George P. Shultz obtained a letter last week from Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the Soviet Foreign Minister, stating the Soviet position. Mr. Shevardnadze's letter said the Soviet Union shared the Administration's view that such weapons were banned under the treaty and concluded by saying that ''the definitive view of the Soviet side'' is that the ban applies to medium- and shorter-range missiles, ''however equipped, nuclear or any nonnuclear.'' **********Upon receipt of the letter, the Administration and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which recommended approval of the treaty on a 17-2 vote last month, considered the matter closed.

Traders' Assumption **********Immediately after the Fed's most recent tightening move, its third in as many months, analysts and traders assumed that the Fed was sticking to the cautious approach to monetary policy to which it has adhered since the start of the year. The analysts and traders assumed that the Fed had nudged the funds rate upward by 25 basis points, or 25 one-hundredths of a percentage point, to a trading range of 7 1/4 percent to 7 3/8 percent. **********But getting a clear reading on where the central bank wants the funds rate to settle often takes several days, and some experts said later that the Fed might have been more aggressive this time. **********''It is clear that the Fed made two earlier tightening moves of about one-quarter of a point each'' in the Federal funds rate, said Richard M. Kelly, president of Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a primary dealer in Government securities. **********''This more recent tightening move is likely to have been at least that large, and may be larger still,'' Mr. Kelly said.

If the funds rate has been increased by that much, it is quite likely we will see short-term interest rates rise.'' Narrower Yield Differential **********On Friday the Fed indicated to traders that 7 1/2 percent could well be the level at which it wants the funds rate to trade. At midday, with funds trading at slightly above that level, the central bank entered the market and added reserves to the banking system. **********''I think it is quite obvious they are indicating that there is a cap on the funds rate at 7 1/2 percent,'' said Anthony L. Karydakis, a money market economist at Mitsubishi Bank Ltd. **********As Mr. Kelly suggested, the yield differentials between short-term notes and Treasury bonds have been narrowing for some time. **********At the end of last week, yields on the two-year Treasury notes stood at 8.22 percent, compared with yields of 9.32 percent on the Treasury's 30-year bond. **********By contrast, at the start of the month, the yields on two-year notes stood at 7.80 percent and the yield on the 30-year bonds were 9.15 percent. Employment Data Due Friday **********Aside from rising in response to a Fed policy that may be firmer than had been perceived, short-term rates could well move higher still if the employment report for May, scheduled for release on Friday, shows continued strength in the labor market. **********Economists expect the report to show an increase in payroll employment of 200,000 to 225,000 workers. And figures for wages, as well as hours worked, will be closely scanned for signs of continued strength in the economy. **********A report of strong employment could also force the Fed to tighten rates again, and another tightening move would almost certainly prompt commercial banks to raise their prime lending rate above 9 percent, to perhaps 9 1/2 percent. **********''If the employment numbers imply another strong gain in personal income and industrial production, I think the Fed will tighten,'' said Dana Johnson, chief money market economist at the First National Bank of Chicago. Analysts Are Divided **********Further tightening could come in the form of a rise in the Fed's discount rate, or a further hike in the Fed funds rate. At the end of last week, analysts were divided over which course the central bank might choose. **********''We think the Fed will raise the discount rate if they are given cause by either the upcoming employment report or by figures released later in June on producer prices and trade,'' said Robert M. Giordano, a partner and co-director of economic research at Goldman, Sachs & Company. **********''They will have to do it in the next few weeks, if they do it at all, because it is doubtful they would want to raise so conspicuous a rate before Alan Greenspan delivers his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony in July, or in the run-up to the Presidential election.'' **********Mr. Kelly at Aubrey G. Lanston said: ''The spread between the fund rate and the discount rate is not unusually high. The Fed may raise the discount rate, but only as a following action and after market rates have adjusted to a higher level of fed funds trading.'' **********Away from the Government bond market, dealers of tax-exempt municipal bonds are bracing this week for the heaviest amount of new debt issues in more than two months. Municipal Bond Issues **********As in all fixed-income markets, the volume of new municipal issues is well below year-earlier levels. However, in spite of the lack of supply, traders and analysts are not sure how the more than $1.5 billion worth of bonds scheduled to be sold this week will be received. **********''This is something the whole market has been waiting for,'' said Neal Atterman, vice president and manager of municipal bond research at Kidder, Peabody & Company. **********With the recent rise in interest rates and the possibility of another, some traders were cautious about what sort of interest rate it will take to sell the new supply. **********Mr. Atterman indicated that demand for the issues could be strong. **********''We know that some of the institutions in the market like bond funds have lots of cash on hand,'' he said. ''And over the last three weeks individual retail interest has been very, very strong.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/13/business/company-news-ford-taps-taiwan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-10-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 146, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ford Taps Taiwan", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Ford Taps Taiwan", "body_text": " **********The Ford Motor Company began exporting its Mercury Sable to Taiwan, making it the first car Ford has exported to that country.

There is concern that large cable companies may be gaining excessive power to influence program distribution. **********Only a handful of communities offer residents a choice of cable services, and outdated regulations serve to perpetuate monopoly franchising, said Alfred C. Sikes, Assistant Commerce Secretary for communications and information. 'Marketplace Solutions' **********''Let's get more competition so we can have marketplace solutions and not Government regulatory solutions,'' Mr. Sikes said. His agency is responsible for developing information and communications policy. The report was the Reagan Administration's first review of the cable television industry. **********The head of the Federal Communications Commission praised the report's conclusions, which generally propose the same deregulatory course the commission has followed during the Reagan Administration. **********''Competition and open entry regulate best,'' the F.C.C. chairman, Dennis R. Patrick, said in a statement. ''They guarantee responsiveness to consumer demand and are the most effective safeguards against market power.'' **********The National Cable Television Association called the report ''interesting reading,'' but disagreed with some of its recommendations, including a proposal that would give telephone companies more freedom to provide services for cable television in local areas. 'Video Dial Tone' **********The report says allowing phone companies to provide ''video dial tone'' would allow anyone, including movie studios, sports organizations and broadcasters, to lease video channels to distribute programs to subscribers. **********The report recommends elimination of a law that permits local phone companies to lease channel capacity only to cable companies that have a local franchise. But it also recommends no change in the laws that prohibit phone companies from owning cable systems. **********The cable association says the proposal would put franchised cable companies at a disadvantage. These companies, which pay a portion of their revenues to local governments, must meet community requirements. **********''We don't want someone out there competing with us when they don't have the same requirements imposed on them as we do by the cities,'' Lynn McReynolds, a spokeswoman for the cable association, said. **********The report also recommends eliminating a regulation that prohibits television networks from owning cable systems. The report said national programming and advertising have become more competitive since the ban was imposed in 1970. Investigation Is Proposed **********In addition, the agency recommends that the F.C.C. investigate concentrated ownership in the cable industry and consider taking steps to limit cable ownership. **********Cable television is available to about 80 percent of American homes. About half of them, an estimated 42.7 million, subscribe to cable. **********The report noted that Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's largest cable company, which owns or controls systems with about 10 million subscribers, has seen its share of the market grow from 9.1 percent in 1983 to 23.4 percent last year. The company's share more than doubled from 1986 to 1987. **********The second-biggest cable company, American Television and Communications Corporation, owns or controls systems with about 4.4 million subscribers; Continental Cablevision Inc. is third, with 2.2 million subscribers; Cox Cable Communications and Storer Communications have about 1.5 million each, and Warner Cable and Comcast Cable Communications each has about 1.4 million."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/28/business/cigna-names-chief-executive.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-07-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 175, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Cigna Names Chief Executive", "print_headline": "Cigna Names Chief Executive", "body_text": " **********The Cigna Corporation, the insurance and financial services company based in Philadelphia, said yesterday that it had named Wilson H.

He figures that by buying good-quality dull stocks - those small, obscure ones that nobody pays much attention to - you can make thrilling amounts of money. ''The duller a company appears on the surface,'' he said, ''the more invisible it becomes and thus the greater the opportunity. I like to be the only guy in town looking at something.'' **********In his continuing pursuit of dullness, he has become convinced that there is no duller investment right now than small over-the-counter stocks. **********Mr. Shorts runs the Over the Counter Securities Fund, which puts the money of thousands of small investors in O-T-C stocks. It might not have been the thing he would have most wanted to do last year. Since that mid-October day when the skies fell, he said, ''small companies have been death warmed over; being that my fund is heavily invested in small stocks, I was death warmed over, too.'' In the closing months of last year, his fund fell by 25 percent. **********But that was last year. He's pleased to see that the O-T-C has gotten duller and duller. Even stocks that used to be pretty interesting are now insufferably dull. ''Since Oct. 19, a lot of not-so-dull merchandise got hammered,'' Mr. Shorts said. ''So some stocks that were exciting are just as good values as the dull stocks. I suppose you could say the definition of dull has been broadened. There's incredible dullness everywhere.'' A growing number of individuals - newsletter writers, traders and money managers like Binkley Shorts - have been frothily promoting the fact that, after years of dismal performance, the O-T-C has become a vast Filene's basement with prices slashed in almost every department. ''We haven't seen values like this since 1982 or 1974,'' said Robert J. Flaherty, the editor of OTC Review, a monthly magazine devoted to coverage of over-the-counter companies. ''And it's when people don't want stocks that you should buy them.'' **********Like many others, however, Mr. Flaherty isn't convinced that market has hit bottom. Nonetheless, he did put a straw hat on the cover of his January issue to drive home the point that O-T-C stocks are like ''straw hats in January - bargains.'' The tricky question, though, is: When will summer come for the O-T-C so investors can wear those hats? **********The O-T-C is the place where big dreamers like to bet their small dollars and then hang on for the ride. If you're a bank, a pension fund or a widow or orphan, you put your money into the New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange. In years when the stock market chooses not to self-destruct, you take your 10 or 15 percent return and your predictable dividends and you sleep well. But if you're one of those devilish characters who like to roll the dice, you head for the over-the-counter market. There, you dream of 100 percent-a-year returns - and sometimes get them. Sure, the market whips up and down a lot, but that's part of the fun. If the players on the Big Board are sometimes pictured as pinstriped members of a smoking club, then the O-T-C players might be seen as affiliates of a hot rod league. **********IN actuality, the O-T-C is not so much a market as a catch-all definition. Any public company that doesn't trade on a listed exchange like the New York Stock Exchange trades over-the-counter. The National Association of Securities Dealers, the policing arm of the over-the-counter market, operates the electronic Nasdaq National Market System, which gives last-sale information on some 5,500 over-the-counter stocks. Prices for an additional 11,000 stocks are listed in the Pink Sheets, published daily by the National Quotation Bureau. (You really have to watch yourself with them. Securities officials say that it's not uncommon for brokers and company officials to gull investors by fraudulently hyping the prospects for some of these smaller stocks.) Then there are probably another 10,000 to 30,000 harder-to-find issues, most of which trade in rather folksy fashion. ''A friend of mine a few years ago incorporated a company and asked me if I wanted to buy five shares,'' said an official at Nasdaq. ''That's technically an over-the-counter stock.'' **********To get onto Nasdaq, a company must satisfy certain requirements, such as boasting a sufficient amount of assets and shareholders. A company must meet more stringent requirements to list its stock on the American Stock Exchange, and even tougher ones to make it onto the Big Board. A good many companies, though, prefer the over-the-counter market, even though they've got the financial muscle to go elsewhere. Nasdaq estimates that 2,100 of its stocks meet the Amex rules and 1,000 of them are solid enough for the New York Stock Exchange's. **********Unlike the better-known, listed exchanges, the O-T-C has no paper-strewn trading floor and no specialists - the buyers and sellers of last resort - who the other exchanges use to try to keep their markets orderly and liquid. Rather, trading gets done by computer and over the phone. The ease of buying and selling is largely facilitated by 545 firms that choose to make markets in O-T-C stocks. **********Though the O-T-C offers some familiar and stable faces - Apple, Intel, Microsoft - its backbone is thousands of emerging companies with funny names whose products may one day change the world or change nothing. Lots of them can be had for a few dollars a share, and their prices can gyrate at blistering speeds. **********The October savaging, however, has convinced many investors - both individuals and institutions - that even if the ride leads anywhere, they'll be so rattled by the time they get there that it won't have been worth it. Thus many less lustrous O-T-C stocks have hardly been trading at all - what professionals call ''trading by appointment only.'' Nasdaq volume in January slackened to an average of 123.3 million shares a day, compared with last year's average of 149.8 million. Many stocks are showing wider than normal gaps between the bid and ask prices. ''I find a lot of fear out there,'' Mr. Flaherty said. ''I've talked to companies which put out earnings that they think will cause their stocks to double and nothing happens. Zero. There's fear.'' **********LIKE the moon and so many things in life, the O-T-C tends to follow cycles. That's apparent to Keith Miller, who spends a good deal of his time studying the O-T-C market as a research associate at Salomon Brothers. His graphs show that for years at a stretch O-T-C stocks will rise faster than those on the New York and American exchanges. Then they will spend years trying to keep up. **********Between 1964 and 1969, O-T-C stocks handily outperformed listed ones. From 1969 to 1974, they dramatically underperformed them. Then, driven by the sizzling performance of technology stocks, they rose until they hit a peak in the summer of 1983. From then through the end of 1987, the listed companies have had the upper hand. (To be sure, O-T-C heavyweights such as Apple and Intel trade more like listed companies than their smaller brethren.) To get a feel for just how dismal most O-T-C stocks have fared recently, Mr. Miller did a particularly illuminating little exercise. He found that if you invested $100 million at the end of 1986 in all of the stocks in the Nasdaq 100, weighting your investment according to the market capitalization of the various companies, you would have made a profit of $11 million at the end of 1987. However, if you removed four stocks from that group - Apple, Intel, Microsoft and Food Lion - you would have made nothing. ''I think that is pretty shocking,'' Mr. Miller said. ''It shows that it's a very skewed market.'' **********Part of the reason is that a lot of foreign money has poured into the stock market, but foreigners like well-known, large companies with names they are likely to have heard before. Much of the takeover activity in recent years has been big companies swallowing big companies, unlike past eras, when big companies stalked small O-T-C companies, driving their prices up. Ever since October, moreover, the number of companies going public (they usually start their lives on the O-T-C) has slowed practically to a standstill, reducing the amount of new opportunities in the over-the-counter world. **********''A lot of investors this year will seek refuge in the large capitalization stocks, and I wouldn't be too optimistic about the smaller capitalization issues,'' Mr. Miller said. ''I wouldn't say, 'Don't put your money in the over-the-counter market.' There are opportunities there - but they're mainly in the large capitalization issues. The small stocks are for people who are really courageous.'' **********Similarly, Mary Farrell, an analyst at Paine Webber Inc., believes that the O-T-C is too risky for short-term trading. She said that the O-T-C has increasingly become a two-tier market, one tier composed of large capitalization stocks that trade almost like Blue Chips and a huge second tier of smaller stocks that are attracting less and less interest, especially since October. **********This second tier, she said, has lost investment money to foreign markets and new products like index funds. Many individuals, moreover, now invest in mutual funds rather than directly buying stocks. These funds mostly buy larger O-T-C stocks. If the total number of investors in the O-T-C market keeps falling, she said, then the two tiers of the market could drift further and further apart. **********Still, she said that patient investors - those who are going to buy stocks and hold onto them for a couple of years - could reap substantial gains from O-T-C companies. ''If you take a two-year time horizon,'' she said, ''then I think there are some outstanding values to be had.'' **********PETER DAPUZZO always seems to be doing four things at once even if he's doing nothing. Maybe it's because he's usually looking one way and talking in another direction. He calls himself an ''over-the-counter baby.'' He's been active in the over-the-counter market since the early 1960's, starting when he was 17. He was a clerk for Carl M. Loeb Rhodes & Company. Back then, the firm communicated buy and sell orders with other brokerage offices around the country by Morse code. ''I can still hear all that click-click-clicking,'' Mr. DaPuzzo said. **********The O-T-C has been good to Mr. DaPuzzo. He now runs Shearson Lehman Hutton's mammoth O-T-C desk. Of firms that deal with the public, no one makes markets in more over-the-counter stocks than Shearson. Its 65 traders, 36 bunched around the New York desk in the World Financial Center, handle 2,750 companies. **********Last October was pretty rough on Mr. DaPuzzo. In his 20-plus years in the business, he said he has had losing months only three times - and never a deficit of more than a couple of hundred thousand dollars. In October, he said, Shearson's O-T-C desk lost something approaching $10 million, though it still managed to produce a profit for the year. **********On Oct. 19, Mr. DaPuzzo recalled walking among his traders, seeing teary eyes and ashen faces. **********In the past few months, Mr. DaPuzzo has done a good deal of worrying about the market he loves. It's hurt him that a few of his favorite stocks have decided to leave. The gravest loss was Genentech - the fifth most active O-T-C stock last year - which is to begin trading on the Big Board shortly. It made its decision prior to the October massacre, wanting to be the first biotech company to be listed on the Big Board. Its departure has been mourned by O-T-C traders, as if a favorite son had joined the Marines rather than stay with the family carpet business. For weeks, rumors circulated among O-T-C traders that Apple, another darling of the market, was deserting, but it has stayed put. **********''To lose big companies,'' Mr. DaPuzzo said, ''would send the O-T-C back to what it was 20 years ago - small, struggling companies.'' **********Last year, 114 O-T-C stocks went to the New York or American exchange, up from 88 in 1986. Nineteen of them left in November and December. **********What's more, many market makers have lopped off some of the stocks they make markets in. Nasdaq stocks are supposed to have at least two market makers, and several stocks left for the American Stock Exchange because they were down to one or none. According to Nasdaq, the number of market-making positions at the end of September 1987 was 44,147. At the start of this year, it was 41,285. Shearson itself, in the wake of the crash, has stopped making markets in some 100 stocks. (The E.F. Hutton acquisition, though, added 200 to its roster.) Needing to trim their costs, Wall Street firms have also laid off thousands of employees. Among these are a goodly number of securities analysts. A shrunken analyst community has meant that many smaller stocks are no longer tracked by experts who write reports about them and make their names known among investors. **********The ramifications of these developments have been readily felt by Mike Murphy, who publishes the California Technology Stock Letter and runs a technology fund made up mostly of O-T-C stocks. He thinks 1988 will be a good year for many technology stocks. But he acknowledges that it's hard work trafficking in the O-T-C marketplace. ''The market's not very liquid,'' he said. ''Most of the dealers don't have much inventory and aren't interested in having any. So they can't make a bid. While I'm talking to you, we put in a sell order on a stock that the quoted asking price was 15 1/2 and we ended up selling at 14 7/8. There's been a widening of spreads since the crash.'' **********How long can it take to sell something? **********''A long time,'' Mr. Murphy said. ''You can literally sell no more than 1,000 shares a day of a lot of stocks. The liquidity is much worse. Any O-T-C trader will tell you that.'' **********Volume has been well below what Shearson had been accustomed to, but when Mr. DaPuzzo looks at the available evidence on some of the stocks, he can't believe that it won't pick up. Last year, some companies were selling at 20 times their earnings; now they're trading at 10 to 12 times earnings. **********''So we think they're going to turn around and have their day in the sun,'' he said. ''Much of the risk is out of them. They're ready to go.'' **********Still, he knows how anxious investors get. ''We've got to do things to calm people,'' he said. ''Even I don't like to see the volatility. It makes me nervous and insecure, and I'm a professional. I like to buy a stock and see it inch up or inch down - not go up or down six points in a day.'' **********AS the president of N.A.S.D., Joseph Hardiman knows how big an enemy anxiety is. ''This marketplace is primarily a market of the individual investor,'' he said. ''To the extent that the individual is frightened and sitting on the sidelines is troublesome to us.'' **********Since the crash, Mr. Hardiman and the rest of the N.A.S.D. board have made some quick adjustments to quell investor unease. He said that visits have been made to the chief executives of the large Nasdaq companies to comfort them and persuade them to stick with the market. ''From our conversations,'' he said, ''we don't think there's a problem.'' **********Last month, the N.A.S.D. board approved steps to stabilize prices for large orders and discourage market makers from walking away from trading, as some did during the collapse. One new rule: market makers who suspend trading for any but a small group of reasons will be barred from doing business on the small-order execution system for 20 business days. **********THE expectation is that the changes will go into effect in a couple of months. If they do what they're designed to, Mr. Hardiman feels that confidence will come back. ''We've taken some important first steps,'' he said. ''I think there's some more confidence-building to be done.'' **********How does he think O-T-C stocks will do this year? **********''Oh, I don't know,'' he said. ''I'm not a market predictor. I think the index will fluctuate in a very narrow range. Given it's an election year, I think it may be up slightly.'' **********Money managers, meanwhile, stare at their computer screens, watch the prices and try to decide. Buy. Don't buy. **********Ray Kurtz, whose Kurtz Capital Management firm manages about $120 million, half of it sunk in O-T-C stocks, said, ''My message - and I'm really pounding the table on it - is that for guys my age, and I'm 56, this may be the best opportunity we'll ever have in our lifetime to buy small-capitalization stocks.'' **********Not that he thinks making money will be a cinch. Like a lot of O-T-C investors, Mr. Kurtz was dismayed at the market-making that went on during the week of Oct. 19. ''I've been an investor in O-T-C stocks for 10 years,'' he said. ''and I've been through four down periods, and never before have I experienced such illiquidity. Stock bids moved down without there being any trades. We found that time and time again. The threat of a trade was lowering bids.'' **********But he likes what he sees now. ''We think we can make a good case,'' he said, ''that the small stock will have a strong demand on the buy side for the next two years.'' **********Some money managers are less effusive. Jerry Jordan, who manages $1.3 billion at Hellman, Jordan, owns just one O-T-C stock - St. Paul Companies, an insurance firm - and he would happily sell it except the price is so low. In January, he sold his two other O-T-C stocks, Apple and Intel. **********What does he think of the O-T-C? ''It's cheap, as everybody will tell you, if the economy is O.K.,'' he said. ''If the economy is not O.K., it's not so cheap.'' **********He's not persuaded that the worst is over. ''People don't understand how bad things can get on the down side,'' he said. ''With all the leverage in our economy, with bigger quality companies selling cheaply, people don't have to take a chance now.'' **********CHARLES ALLMON is also wary. Some 80 percent of the money he manages is sitting in cash. He doesn't think there are bargains to buy. He's waiting for prices to fall further. **********Mr. Allmon, who two decades ago was the picture editor of the National Geographic, produces a newsletter (pictureless) called Growth Stock Outlook. He has demonstrated a knack for discovering little stocks with big potential. In addition, he manages more than $425 million, two-thirds of it in the over-the-counter market. ''I think O-T-C stocks are fairly priced,'' he said. ''They're not bargains. They're fairly priced.'' He hasn't bought much of anything this year, though he did a lot of buying in November and December. His wallet is ready, if prices slip some more. **********''In the long run, this is the market where you always get your best gainers,'' he said. ''This is where the gold is. But you have to know your way around. These things can blow up in your face at any time. The market is like walking through a minefield. And they've added some mines.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/17/world/canada-s-biggest-paper-crusading-to-defeat-trade-treaty-with-us.html": {"writer_name": "John Burns", "pub_date": "1988-11-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1216, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Canada's Biggest Paper Crusading To Defeat Trade Treaty With U.S.", "print_headline": "Canada's Biggest Paper Crusading To Defeat Trade Treaty With U.S.", "body_text": " **********When negotiations for the Canadian-American free trade agreement were nearing conclusion in Washington last year, Canada's chief negotiator astonished reporters on a Washington street with a sudden tirade directed at a correspondent for The Toronto Star. **********''The Toronto Star, that rag,'' the negotiator, Simon Reisman, shouted at Bob Hepburn, the newspaper's correspondent in Washington. ''That damn thing is a very poor excuse for a newspaper, and I have no respect for it or you.'' As he stormed off, the negotiator turned and yelled: ''You know what you are? A hack!'' **********What particularly irked Mr. Reisman was a question that suggested that he was preparing major changes in a 1965 automobile trade pact, which established a form of open market between Canada and the United States. But underlying the anger he expressed was the perception that The Star, the country's largest-circulation newspaper, has made a crusade of defeating the current agreement. An Election, and a Referendum **********When Canadians vote in their general election on Monday, they will be deciding, among other things, whether or not the agreement is to be ratified by their Government. And whether electoral victory goes to the ruling Progressive Conservatives, who support the agreement, or to the Liberals or New Democrats, the two opposition parties that oppose it, will be heavily influenced by the voting pattern in southern Ontario, where about five million of Canada's 26 million people live. **********It is in this area that The Star is circulated, mostly around Toronto, Canada's biggest and richest city, which alone accounts for 33 of the 295 parliamentary seats. Hardly anybody involved doubts that there will be celebrating in The Star's steel-and-glass skyscraper along the shores of Lake Ontario if the Conservatives go down to defeat. **********For three years, since the trade negotiations began, and with increasing insistence since the accord was signed in Washington 13 months ago, The Star has used its news columns as well as its editorial pages to spell out the case against it. Day after day, its front page has been a display case for arguments that the agreement threatens Canada's sovereignty and exposes it to ''economic integration with our southern neighbor,'' in the words of a front-page editorial today. **********''With our hearts and our votes, Canadians will decide next Monday the very future of our country. Nothing less. For this is more than an election; it is a referendum on what Canada will be,'' the editorial said. **********It added: ''If the anti-free-trade vote is split, votes will be wasted, and the Tories and their fateful deal might win. So, if you're against this deal and want to maintain the country we know and cherish, the only choice is to vote Liberal.'' Unbalanced Coverage **********It is not unusual for Canadian newspapers to run front-page editorials. But what has differentiated The Star's coverage has been its habit, acknowledged by its editors, of giving far more prominence on its news pages to the case against the trade pact than to the case for it. The tendency has been so marked that Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, the Conservatives' leader, frequently cites the newspaper in campaign speeches as an example of the powerful interests aligned against him. **********During the election campaign, the tendency has been less noticeable than in preceding months, at least on the newspaper's front page - a shift some attribute to criticism from big-business advertisers and readers. **********But a random survey, during the week of May 30 to June 5, showed that of news articles on free trade, 15 were generally hostile to the agreement, 3 were in favor of it and 8 were generally neutral. A similar ratio prevailed among letters to the editor, with 7 against the agreement and 3 for it. **********While the newspaper's critics have been angered by what they regarded as an effort to mold readers' views, some have also acknowledged that The Star has gone further than any other paper in the country to explain the complexities of the trade deal, which runs to 1,125 pages of legal script. This is partly a question of available space, since The Star, which carries as many as 6 editorial sections in its weekday editions and 11 on Saturdays, has been able to devote more room to the issue. Point Man in Coverage **********But the intense coverage of free trade also owes much to the driving energies of David Crane, the paper's economics editor. His recent efforts included a special four-page Sunday section, written with another reporter, that offered an overview of all the major issues in the controversy, with prominently displayed arguments for and against the accord. **********Over all, though, the coverage has been hostile to the agreement, and Mr. Reisman, the trade negotiator, has not been alone in striking back. **********John Crispo, a University of Toronto professor of management who has accused The Star of ''telling bare-faced lies'' about the accord, caused a contretemps when he was invited to lunch at the paper. **********After Mr. Crispo told Beland J. Honderich, the paper's publisher at the time, that he was ''a propagandist masquerading as a publisher,'' Mr. Honderich responded that he couldn't imagine why The Star had even invited him. According to Mr. Crispo, he closed the exchange by dropping a $5 bill on the table. ''I don't want anybody to say that you bought me lunch,'' he reportedly said. **********Mr. Honderich, who relinquished the publisher's post in September to become chairman of the Torstar Corporation, owner of the newspaper, has acknowledged that its antagonism to the free trade agreement has affected its news coverage. But the 69-year-old executive, a beekeeper's son who started as a teen-age copy boy on a provincial newspaper and rose to reporter at The Star and later its editor and part-owner, said in an interview during the summer that he felt The Star had ''nothing to apologize for.'' Strongly Nationalist Stands **********''Whether it's overt or not, I think newspapers have a bias,'' he said, ''and I think it's better that people should know it.'' **********As publisher, Mr. Honderich said he considered it his duty to insure loyalty to the credo established by the newspaper's founder, Joseph B. Atkinson, which he described as that of producing a newspaper for ''the little people'' - those without the wealth or influence to be heard in public debate. Also, Mr. Honderich said, a paper that maintained a strong nationalist stand. In the 1920s and 1930s, that orientation caused The Star to agitate against some Canadian links with Britain, the former colonial power. **********In recent decades, many of its campaigns have been directed against the gradual tightening of ties to the United States. Mr. Honderich, who maintains an apartment in Palm Beach, Fla., said that it was a matter not of being anti-American, but of seeing the need for protecting Canada's distinctiveness. **********''I have great admiration for the United States,'' he said. ''I just happen to prefer our system.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/09/business/task-force-ties-market-collapse-to-big-investors-program-trades.html": {"writer_name": "Nathaniel Nash", "pub_date": "1988-01-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1832, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Task Force Ties Market Collapse To Big Investors' Program Trades", "print_headline": "Task Force Ties Market Collapse To Big Investors' Program Trades", "body_text": " **********A handful of the nation's largest money management firms, using two types of computerized trading, were mostly responsible for the October stock market collapse, a Presidential task force said in a report today. **********The report, from the Presidential Task Force on Market Mechanisms, blamed the automatic trading programs of the firms for generating huge sell orders that culminated in a 508-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Oct. 19 as more than 600 million shares changed hands. **********''Program trading, on auto-pilot, produced an enormous amount of volume during that time,'' the panel's chairman, Nicholas F. Brady, said at a press briefing at the White House. Regulations Proposed **********The report, which has received a cool reception from the White House, also proposed regulations to cope with the new dynamics in the nation's capital markets and to avoid a repeat of Oct. 19. It proposed that one agency, the Federal Reserve Board, be responsible for this regulatory oversight.  [ Excerpt from summary of the report, page 38. ]  The commission, however, apparently backed away from a radical proposal to impose limits on the daily price movements of all stocks. **********The report's conclusions -essentially placing the blame on the new trading techniques developed and used by only the biggest money managers for pension funds and other large institutional investors - are bound to prove controversial. While those conclusions agree with those of some analysts, they sharply contradict some other studies. Huge Amounts Involved **********The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, for one, has discounted assertions that such trading made the market's plunge even worse. It has contended that stock index arbitrage, one of the computerized trading strategies cited in the report, accounted for only 7 percent of the stock sell orders on Oct. 19. **********Specifically, the Brady Commission said the use of both index arbitrage and portfolio insurance pushed the market down. With both techniques, computers can generate trades that result in orders to sell huge amounts of stock under certain circumstances. **********Portfolio insurance is used by the largest money management firms, like Wells Fargo Investment Advisers, Leland O'Brien Rubinstein and Chase Investors, to protect paper gains or offset losses on the stockholdings of their clients. In index arbitrage, computers take advantage of tiny discrepancies between stock index futures - which represent a basket of stocks - and the stocks themselves. **********In its report, the Brady commission said: ''Reactive selling by institutions, which followed portfolio insurance strategies and sought to liquidate large fractions of their stockholdings regardless of price, played a prominent role in the market break.'' **********''The formulas used by portfolio insurers dictated the sale of $20 billion to $30 billion of equities'' from Oct. 14 to Oct. 20, the report added, noting that the demand to sell so much stock in such a few days was bound to send the stock market plummeting. **********The Brady commission repeatedly stressed concern about this large concentration of trading potential that results from portfolio insurance. Importantly, however, its report does not recommend any curbs on computerized stock trading. **********Though portfolio insurance was designed to protect an investor's stock profits, the markets' inability to liquidate such large positions quickly during the market plunge meant that investors lost much of their profits and the infallibility claims of portfolio insurers were generally discredited. As a result, use of portfolio insurance is said to have diminished somewhat. Sensitive Times Cited **********The Brady commission's report also noted that, though index arbitrage did not account for the kind of volume in trading some experts believed, such trading was generated at particularly sensitive times during the market's downward spiral, significantly worsening the drop. **********Since the October stock plunge, the use of index arbitrage has not receded too much. Today, in fact, as the Dow plummented 140 points, investors said much of the decline was exacerbated by the use of index arbitrage. **********In calling for revamped regulation of the markets, the task force's primary argument is that the stock, options and futures markets can no longer be considered separate markets. Rather, they constitute one unified market in which price swings in one sector immediately affect prices in another. The panel argues that these developments have made the current fragmented regulatory structure of the Federal Government out of date. 'In Fact One Market **********''The simple conclusion is that the system grew geometrically with the technological and financial revoluton of the 1980's,'' the report said. ''Many in government, industry and academia failed to understand fully that these separate marketplaces are in fact one market. **********Thus, the commission recommended that regulation be much more centralized, and it nominated the Federal Reserve Board as the most appropriate central body. Though it considered the Treasury Department to supervise coordinated regulation of financial markets, the Treasury's political ties to incumbent administrations augured against its assuming such a role. **********''We think this is the right way to go,'' Mr. Brady said, ''because the Fed has the clearest view of the financial flows in the system, which was seriously threatened in October.'' Neutral Greenspan Statement **********But the Fed, according to Administration officials, has been very dubious about assuming such a role. And indeed, a very neutral statement by the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, appeared to reflect that stance. **********''I look forward to reading it in detail,'' Mr. Greenspan said about the Brady Commission's report. **********Moreover, at the White House briefing, Mr. Brady conceded that the Fed's chairman had not agreed to accept the proposed role. **********But Mr. Brady, the head of the brokerage firm of Dillon, Read & Company and a former United States Senator, insisted that the market needed a dominant regulatory body - preferably an existing agency rather than a new bureaucracy - to enact and oversee the recommendations. Details of Proposals **********As expected, the study advocated several steps to unify the nation's capital markets, including establishing consistent margin, or down payment, requirements for purchasing all financial instruments; creating a single clearing and settlement system for all stocks, bonds and futures, and engineering a kind of ''circuit breaker'' mechanism that would halt trading in certain stock and futures instruments when selling pressure gets too intense. **********Mr. Brady, a Republican who is a friend of Vice President Bush, backed away somewhat from reports circulating within the Adminstration earlier in the week that his commission supported daily price limits on all stocks. Indeed, the report left the commission's conclusions on price limits vague. **********In the briefing, he said the commission's final position was that existing trading halts on stock and limits on price fluctuations on futures had to be coordinated more closely at the least so that one market would not continue to trade while another market was closed down. Caution in Congress **********Congressional reaction to the report was cautious. Though some lawmakers hailed the efforts of the Brady Commission, they also acknowledged that the recommendations were fraught with political pitfalls. **********''I think it's obvious that such recommendations are going to bring attacks from various interest groups,'' said Representative John D. Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. **********Moreover, the the White House is concerned that the commission's recommendations are too intrusive and would give the Fed much too much power over the nation's economy and markets. **********Publicly, Administration officials say they want to wait to see what other studies produce. But privately they voice some alarm at the recommendation to give the Fed more power and any hint of coordinating price limits on stocks. Opposition to Price Limits **********In the investment community, the panel's recommendations on price limits and trading halts in securities stirred strong reactions. **********''I would be against it,'' said Donald Marron, chairman of Paine Webber Group Inc. ''This is the heart of American capitalism and we've built up the notion of a continuous market. Any artificial limits to realizing the ownership of securities hurts the whole process and is not a good idea.'' **********Despite the likely inaction of the Congress and the White House on the recommendations by the commission, its conclusions about what caused the market collapse are perhaps the most insightful to date. Though a number of other studies are being conducted by the C.F.T.C., the S.E.C. and the New York Stock Exchange, the Brady Commission's report has been considered to be the most impartial. **********In its analysis of the October crisis, the report traces the beginning of the crash to Wednesday, Oct. 14, the day the Government announced an August trade deficit $1.5 billion larger than anticipated. High-Volume Selling **********That, plus a proposal in Congress to eliminate the tax advantages of hostile takeovers, generated high-volume selling, particularly of potential takeover stocks. That pushed prices down a record amount with the Dow Jones industrial average falling 95 points. **********Such a large decline caused both portfolio insurance and index arbitrage selling, the report said. With portfolio insurance, a declining stock market will spur computers to generate orders to sell futures contracts linked to the stocks. The idea is that the cash eventually raised from the futures will offset, at least partly, the declines in stock prices. **********The Oct. 14 decline continued in the Tokyo and London markets, so that on Thursday morning, the New York markets ''were greeted with heavy selling by portfolio insurers.'' The reaction began in the futures markets, where stock index futures sold at a larger discount to the underlying stocks, and spread to the stock market. Though stocks began to recover toward the end of the day, in the last half-hour of trading, a combination of portfolio insurance and index arbritrage pushed the Dow down 57 points. Pressure Quickly Transmitted **********Friday trading was quiet until 11 A.M., when futures selling by portfolio insurers picked up significantly. That pressure was quickly transmitted to the stock market, leading to a 108-point drop in the Dow. **********But though portfolio insurers had been active in the market, the amount of stock their programs mandated they sell was not sold. According to the Brady report, ''models dictated that, at a minimum, $12 billion of equities should already have been sold'' by Friday's close. ''Less that $4 bilion had in fact been sold.'' **********Moreover, a number of mutual funds were also confronted with the need to sell large amounts of stocks as well. Thus, when trading began on Monday, Oct. 19, more than $8 billion in stock was poised to be sold. **********Thus, the report contends, Monday's disaster was unavoidable, with sell orders triggering even more selling by portfolio insurers and index arbitragers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/01/world/anti-mafia-drive-loses-a-key-man.html": {"writer_name": "Roberto Suro", "pub_date": "1988-08-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 570, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ANTI-MAFIA DRIVE LOSES A KEY MAN", "print_headline": "ANTI-MAFIA DRIVE LOSES A KEY MAN", "body_text": " **********Italy's top anti-Mafia prosecutor has unexpectedly quit his post, joining a protest by Sicilian law enforcement officials who have accused the Government of hindering their efforts to fight organized crime. **********In a letter made public Saturday night, the prosecutor, Giovanni Falcone, asked to be transferred immediately from Palermo, Sicily, citing ''omissions and inertia in the repression of the Mafia phenomena that are before everyone's eyes.'' **********''What I feared has happened,'' Mr. Falcone wrote in the letter to the magistrates council looking into the charges.

Very Sensitive Time **********The charges of obstructions of justice come at an especially sensitive moment, because the first trial focusing on Mafia ties to major political figures is scheduled to begin in September, and investigators have been widely reported to be making progress in a further inquiry of the Mafia's ties to politicians and government officials. **********An official of the magistrates council, which is the Italian judiciary's self-governing body, said today that several other magistrates in the anti-Mafia office headed by Mr. Falcone have also asked to be moved to other posts. **********Participants in the council meeting refused to make any public comment today, but a number of magistrates and political figures asked Mr. Falcone to reconsider his request. **********While few specific charges have been made in public, Mr. Falcone and his colleagues have complained of a ''demobilization'' by the Government in the fight against the Mafia, which has seen some investigative bodies fall into disorder because of personnel changes and an overall lack of support. Charges of Incompetence **********Mr. Falcone stated in his letter that he has radical differences with Palermo's chief investigating magistrate, Antonio Meli, who opposes the idea of creating prosecuting teams specalized in Mafia fighting such as the one led by Mr. Falcone. Mr. Meli was chosen over Mr. Falcone as chief magistrate last January on the grounds of seniority. **********Charges of incompetence and lack of interest in the Mafia fight surfaced 10 days ago, and a series of Sicilian magistrates joined the protest, changing the character of what began as a constrained judicial controversy. **********Mr. Falcone developed into a national hero in recent years as he came to represent Italy's willingness and its ability to combat the Mafia. Today, after his request for reassignment, a variety of politicians from different parties demanded action by Parliament and the Cabinet. **********The first accusations against the Government came from Paolo Borsellino, chief prosecutor in the Sicilian town of Marsala, who stated in an interview published by the Rome daily La Repubblica July 20 that Mr. Falcone's team of Mafia investigators was being deliberately broken up and that police agencies on the island lacked resources and leadership. **********''We risk creating a dangerous vacuum,'' said Mr. Borsellino.

Amid the courage of those who endured everyday life under Stalin, Sergei is confronted with his own weakness. **********The movie, which premiered this week in Moscow, is called ''Mirror for a Hero,'' and it could hardly come at a better time for Mikhail S. Gorbachev. **********The generational bitterness aroused by Mr. Gorbachev's campaign against Stalin has emerged as a potent force in the resistance to his domestic political program and a central element in the recent public clash over ideology. **********''Mirror for a Hero'' is the first film to deal directly with the resentment of older citizens who feel the attacks on Stalin are implicitly attacks on them, and with the contempt felt by many of their children for the country's cruel past. 'Tribute to Our Parents' **********''It's a kind of tribute to our parents who lived through that time,'' said Vladimir Khotinenko, the 36-year-old director, who says he undertook the movie as an apology to his own father. **********''They lived and worked and even managed to find happiness, regardless of all that happened,'' Mr. Khotinenko said, in a telephone interview from the southern Soviet city of Baku, where he was presenting his movie at a film festival.

'Abstract Moralizing' Assailed **********An article last month in the newspaper Sovetskaya Rossiya, which was widely interpreted as an anti-Gorbachev manifesto, played heavily on this theme, assailing the attacks on Stalin as ''abstract moralizing by people far removed both from those stormy times and from the people who had to live and work in those times.'' **********The Communist Party newspaper Pravda, in a strongly worded rebuttal widely believed to have been ordered by Mr. Gorbachev, said the anti-Stalinist campaign must continue.

It was shown Monday night in a special screening for Moscow artistic and literary unions, and opened to the public Tuesday in one of the city's largest theaters. Son Versus Father **********The movie begins in 1987, introducing two characters instantly familiar to Soviet audiences - the jaded, ironic Sergei and his father, a principled, slightly romantic old man. Sergei considers his father a fool for his prattle about honor and values. The father scolds the son for not believing in anything. **********Walking through the city park, Sergei and an older friend are suddenly transported back to 1949, the year of Sergei's birth, in a hardscrabble coal-mining town. **********There the two men live one day, then wake up to relive the same events over and over again: a hellish shift in the treacherous mines, an encounter with Sergei's pregnant mother, a payroll robbery, a drunken revel. **********Sergei takes it as a lark, until in the end he sees his father dragged away by the secret police for protesting conditions in the mines, and is himself caught up in the terror. **********His friend Andrei, meanwhile, relentlessly plots to change the course of events. Each recycled morning, he tries to close a mine he knows will be the scene of a catastrophe 30 years later, and each morning he is told, ''In 30 years, other people will have to answer for that, but today we have our own concrete problems.'' Individual Responsibility Stressed **********''The main purpose of the film is to show that each person is responsible for those specific things within his control, not for all the senseless things around him,'' the director said. ''If everybody is responsible, that means nobody is responsible.'' **********Stalin is offstage, his influence sketched in small details like the look of terror in a woman's eyes when she is caught stealing a piece of firewood, the relentless pressure from Moscow to step up coal production for the country's industrial machine, or the chilling ovation from the suffering townspeople when the tyrant's name is invoked at a rally. **********Mr. Khotinenko said he had been criticized for not dramatizing more forcefully the terror, the camps and the arbitrary executions, but he said that was not his purpose. **********''We have all the information about the horrors of that period in the newspapers every day,'' he said.

Shadrack, executive vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, indicating that the Fed was likely to object to the payment of special dividends to Irving shareholders as part of an acquisition. Some Shift of Momentum Seen **********A $10 special dividend is a key element of Banca Commerciale's offer, which was endorsed Tuesday by Irving's board. Bank of New York had included a special dividend as a sweetener in an earlier proposal that was contingent on completion of an immediate merger with Irving. It has no such provision in its current bid but had said yesterday, prior to receiving the New York Fed's letter, that it might revive the earlier bid if Irving would drop its opposition to a merger.. **********The court decision left the door open for Bank of New York to seek control of Irving, provided it can obtain permission from the Federal Reserve Board. But Justice Herman Cahn left other Irving defenses intact, most notably the protection of a New York statute that would prevent a full merger of the banks for at least five years. **********''This shifts some momentum back to the Bank of New York,'' said Mark Alpert, an analyst who has followed the takeover battle for Bear, Stearns & Company. Bank of New York's Next Step **********Bank of New York said it would now seek permission from the Fed to extend its tender offer for a minimum of two-thirds of Irving's shares for 60 days. The Fed's current deadline for the acquisition is Saturday. **********Analysts said the Fed was unlikely to deny the request but that questions remained about what kind of control the Fed would accept if a full merger were not possible in the near term. **********Irving said it would appeal Justice Cahn's ruling and would continue to back the Italian bank's offer. Discrimination Found in Defense **********Justice Cahn's decision barred Irving from enforcing a so-called poison pill on the ground that it illegally discriminated between different groups of shareholders. The measure, known as a ''flip-in,'' would allow Irving to respond to any acquisition of 20 percent of its shares without the board's backing by issuing millions of shares to the rest of its shareholders at what amounts to a 50 percent discount, provided the acquiring company was unable to complete a merger. **********Because a New York statute bars any bank that acquires control of another from completing a hostile merger for a period of five years, the flip-in would automatically come into play if Bank of New York accumulated the 20 percent stake. Bank of New York has said the flip-in would make its takeover effort prohibitively expensive. **********While granting a preliminary injunction against the flip-in, Justice Cahn sided with Irving on two other disputes. He denied Bank of New York's request that Irving's board be compelled to waive the five-year protection against a hostile merger in the New York statute. He also declined to rule on a defensive measure Irving's board adopted in November that would allow its shareholders - if a hostile merger were completed - to buy Bank of New York shares at the 50 percent discount, a provision known as a ''flip-over.'' **********Both the flip-in and the flip-over would allow the acquisition of $400 worth of stock for $200. Shareholders' Standpoint **********Yesterday's court ruling may ultimately help define the options open to Irving's shareholders. It did nothing, however, to help them compare the value of the bids from Bank of New York and Banca Commerciale, and the Fed's letter seemed likely to bring more confusion. **********The Banca Commerciale offer endorsed Tuesday by Irving's directors was valued by Irving at a minimum of $79.50 a share. The Italian bank improved its earlier offer - $80 a share for about 51 percent of Irving's stock and a $10-a-share special dividend for the remaining 49 percent - by adding warrants to purchase new shares. For each four shares of stock they hold, Irving shareholders would receive one warrant, exercisable anytime in the next seven years at $65 a share. **********Because of Banca Commerciale's large size, an Irving spokesman said, it is possible the Federal Reserve may ultimately rule that it is capable of paying a special dividend without impairing its capital base. **********Irving had said that Banca Commerciale's new offer was contingent on Irving's poison pill remaining intact. An Irving spokesman said last night that this limitation had not been activated by the court ruling on the flip-in, which had been regarded as an amendment to its basic defenses. Valuation Contested **********Bank of New York, the investors backing it, and some analysts have agreed that Irving's valuation of the bid overestimated the value of the warrants and the likely trading price of the 49 percent of Irving shares Banca Commerciale would not acquire. **********But Bank of New York's latest bid is also difficult to value because it is tied to the fluctuating price of the bank's shares. The offer consists of 1.575 Bank of New York shares for each Irving share and $15 cash, or roughly $70.90 a share at yesterday's stock prices. **********Irving shares fell 87.5 cents in trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, finishing at $70.50 a share. Bank of New York's shares, which are also listed on the Big Board, fell 62.5 cents a share, to $35.50. **********Both the court ruling and the Fed's letter came after the close of trading."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/04/business/company-news-schwab-sets-cuts.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-06-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 160, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Schwab Sets Cuts", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Schwab Sets Cuts", "body_text": " **********The Charles Schwab Corporation is temporarily cutting management salaries and encouraging employees to take time off as part of a plan to reduce operating costs by 10 percent because of a slowdown in the brokerage business.

As a young Army officer in the mid-1960's, Senator Pressler had been involved in a United States aid project that provided small American water pumps for irrigation.

Shortly before that, Baker & McKenzie, the mammoth Chicago firm with more than 1,000 lawyers, established offices in Budapest and Barcelona. And Kelley Drye & Warren has hired a New Delhi lawyer to serve clients with Indian interests. **********While a decade ago the talk in the law business was the establishment of national practices, many major partnerships have become more ambitious and are now going overseas. **********These are some of the reasons for the global push: *********** American law firms are scrambling to serve the foreign businesses that have emerged as major forces in the United States in the securities and real estate markets as well as in corporate takeovers. *********** Respectful of the securities expertise of American lawyers, foreign governments have been tapping them to structure the large stock sales that have accompanied spinoffs of government-owned businesses. Sometimes those offerings are also made through American exchanges. *********** International arbitration aimed at resolving disputes out of court has been rising with the surge in foreign trade and business dealings. *********** Tough foreign restrictions that made it difficult for Americans to practice abroad have eased in the last year, enabling Americans to hang out shingles in countries ranging from Japan to the Soviet Union. Following the Money **********For the most part, law firms are following their American corporate clients abroad. ''The clients are operating more and more globally and we're following them,'' said Isaac Shapiro, head of the two-year-old international practice group at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, New York's largest firm. **********With the rise of foreign cities as major financial centers, American law firms are finding that they can no longer afford to serve their clients from bases in the United States. ''Geographically, we and others have been moving to where the money is, which means London, Paris and Tokyo,'' said James B. Hurlock, the managing partner at White & Case, which has nine offices abroad. **********Although the practice of international law dates back centuries, in recent times one fundamental change has emerged: American lawyers are rapidly becoming involved in more deals that used to be the sole domain of foreign counselors. **********In one sign of the times, two Manhattan law firms have been involved in the fight for Societe Generale de Belgique, the large Belgian conglomerate - even though the battle has had little connection with the United States. **********At pivotal points in the fight, Carlo de Benedetti, the Italian industrialist, has relied on a team headed by Herbert Lobl from Davis, Polk & Wardwell. **********Walter W. Oberreit, a partner at Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton, along with others from Cleary's Brussels office have served as advisers to Societe Generale. The contest has generated a total of more than $5 million in billings for the two firms. Special Expertise Seen **********By all accounts, the European clients turned to American lawyers because Europe has not seen a hostile takeover quite like this one. **********But there are other signs of an unusual American presence in what not long ago had been the exclusive domain of foreign lawyers. Again, the reason is the perception that the Americans can offer expertise that foreign firms cannot. **********A number of American firms, for instance, are profiting by moves in foreign countries to encourage the privatization of major industries. In Turkey, a recent $18 million securities underwriting for Teletas, a communications equipment manufacturer, was structured by the New York firm of White & Case, which maintains offices in Ankara and Istanbul. About 40,000 Turks hold Teletas stock, making it the most widely held company in that country. **********Two recent large Spanish securities offerings - one involving the largest electric utility company and the other the largest telephone corporation - have been handled by Davis, Polk. And an offering in connection with the privatization of a French telephone company was assisted by lawyers from Shearman & Sterling. **********''American lawyers have an historical perspective and know-how from experience that puts them ahead of many foreign lawyers,'' Mr. Shapiro said in reference to takeovers. He noted that in Japan and France, the majority of the advocates have historically been barristers who try cases in court and have not had extensive experience in structuring deals. A Warning on Quick Growth **********Despite the new opportunities, some in the profession warn that firms must be careful not to expand too quickly. Some firms have made that mistake. For instance, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett of New York closed offices in Singapore and Hong Kong because there was not enough business. And some wonder whether there will be enough in Tokyo. Even though most offices are less than a year old, many lawyers are already predicting a retrenchment. **********On the other hand, Baker & McKenzie, which has the largest presence abroad, has experienced little difficulty. In the last three years, the firm has opened eight offices in foreign cities, including Cairo; Canton, in China, and Valencia, Venezuela. Its Budapest office now has 25 American, European and Asian clients. **********The firm has 43 offices in 26 countries, and of its 1,086 lawyers, only 319 are in the United States. Last year, according to partners, it earned $86 million, up 18 percent from 1986, on revenue of $196 million. Robert W. Cox, chairman of Baker, said the firm expects that revenue this year will be more than $250 million - double that of just three years ago. Largest U.S. Firm in Tokyo **********Baker & McKenzie established a presence in Tokyo in 1963, where its practice grew by incorporating local practitioners who could appear in the Japanese courts. It is now the largest American firm in Tokyo, with more than 20 lawyers. **********Two dozen or so other American firms have opened offices there within the last year, after Japan eased restrictions on foreigners. American lawyers are also eagerly watching developments in China, where officials are considering changes that would make it easier for foreigners to practice there. **********In Japan, most American lawyers cannot advise clients on Japanese law, but they can now advise them on the laws of other countries. And with Japanese companies and investors pouring vast sums into the purchase of American assets and establishing operations in the United States, there has been a surge in business. With the weak dollar fueling the rush, European companies have also been snapping up American assets. Focus on U.S. Takeovers **********James B. Sitrick of Coudert Brothers, one of the oldest and largest international practices, said: ''In the 1950's, our business abroad was almost entirely American clients with French and European interests. Now it is largely the other way around.'' **********For the first quarter of 1988, there were 114 deals of more than $1 million in which foreign companies completed takeovers of American businesses, according to Mergers & Acquisitions magazine of Philadelphia. Those deals totaled $8.7 billion. For the corresponding period last year, there were 81 deals, valued at $10.7 billion. **********Meanwhile, many other large deals are pending or recently completed in which American lawyers advised the foreign acquirer. **********Sullivan & Cromwell represented the Hachette Group of France in its two pending publishing deals: the $448 million acquisition of Connecticut-based Grolier Inc. and the $712 million purchase of Dimandis Communications. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz advised Bridgestone of Japan on its $2.6 billion acquisition of the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company. Cravath, Swaine & Moore helped the Campeau Corporation, the Canadian developer, win the battle to acquire Federated Department Stores. And Willkie, Farr & Gallagher has been representing Banca Commerciale Italiana of Milan, which is trying to beat out the Bank of New York to buy control of the Irving Bank. Realty Ventures, Too **********Europeans and Asians are also looking to invest in real estate ventures in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and elsewhere. All of these deals require American counsel. Lawyers at Coudert Brothers, for instance, said they have expanded their real estate department to five partners and fifteen associates from three associates a year ago. **********In one of its largest deals, Coudert recently represented the Sumitomo Life Insurance Company in a transaction involving a $300 million convertible mortgage with Olympia & York for a building at 425 Lexington Avenue in Manhattan. **********Broken deals are also accounting for an increasing share of revenues at many firms. International arbitration has grown sharply as a way to resolve disputes between companies of different nationalities. The arbitration has displaced litigation in many instances. In so doing, it has enabled American lawyers to take a role in cases in which they would normally be excluded because of rules in many foreign jurisidictions that limit litigation to local counsel. **********''Clients like it because it's quicker, it's cheaper and it's confidential,'' said Mr. Hurlock of White & Case, in comparing arbitration with the courts. **********Joseph T. McLaughlin, a litigator at Shearman & Sterling, added: ''Most people outside of the United States are terrified of the American courts. To them, the buzzwords for what the courts mean here are Texaco and Pennzoil.'' **********A lawyer at one major international firm, who is a specialist in arbitration and asked not to be identified, said revenues from such practices at the largest partnerships now typically account for 5 to 10 percent of overall billings.

The new withholding provision is an attempt to catch up with the tax evaders. **********The combination of higher interest rates in other currencies, notably the dollar, and the Government's planned withholding policy has caused a record net capital outflow so far this year of almost 60 billion marks ($32 billion), according to Karl Otto Pohl, president of West Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank. **********This is in contrast to an inflow during the first six months of last year of 19 billion marks ($10.2 billion). Helping Drag Down the Mark **********The flight of capital caused by the withholding provision has helped drag down the mark, and to compensate, the Bundesbank has been forced to increase interest rates. In turn, according to economists, these increases threaten to slow economic growth just as it shows signs of picking up. **********Mr. Pohl is among those who have expressed concern at the outflow, especially its weakening effect on the value of the mark. **********''We are not so much worried about losing capital as such - we can afford to - but at its effect on the mark,'' one Bundesbank official explained. **********Recognizing strong consumer demand, Bonn has recently increased its growth estimate this year to an inflation-adjusted 3 percent. But analysts regard the Bundesbank's recent series of interest rate increases as detrimental to sustaining a strong economic growth rate, so a 3 percent growth rate seems unlikely to continue into 1989. Bankers Oppose Tax **********The Bundesbank and commercial banks have tried unsuccessfully to dissuade Bonn from introducing the withholding tax on the ground that the effects of the investors' negative view of it would far outweigh the 3.5 billion marks ($1.9 billion) of extra revenue that the Government hopes to gain by tightening its tax-collection system. **********But Gerhard Stoltenberg, Finance Minister, insists that the withholding measure will go into effect. **********At a news conference late in August, Mr. Pohl said that the fears the central bank had expressed over the withholding tax's detrimental effect on the value of the mark had been ''clearly exceeded.'' The capital outflow, in his opinion, had reached a point where it was dragging down the mark and raising the specter of imported inflation. **********He pointed out that in the past seven months the mark had fallen 16 percent in value in relation to the dollar and 4 percent against the currencies of West Germany's 14 most important trade partners. Such a depreciation, he added, was not justified by fundamental economic data. Special Lure of Luxembourg **********Commercial bankers have been particularly concerned that the withholding tax will make West Germany and Frankfurt, its banking hub, less attractive as a financial center, driving foreign and domestic investors elsewhere. **********Luxembourg, in particular, has benefited from the outflow. In the first quarter of this year West German savers made deposits there totaling 2.8 billion marks ($1.5 billion), compared with less than 240 million marks ($128 million) in the final quarter of 1987. **********''I feel like offering the West German Finance Minister a case of champagne,'' said one Luxembourg banker. **********Several leading West German banks have sent letters to clients suggesting they make appointments to discuss their savings. Upon arriving at the bank, the saver is asked in a hushed voice whether he or she is aware of the implications of the withholding tax. Advice for Bank Customers **********The bank representative, making clear that the bank has no wish to encourage tax evasion, then suggests transferring domestic mark savings into a withholding-tax-free Luxembourg investment fund, which includes a range of European and other leading currencies, or a mark-denominated Eurobond issue offered by the bank. **********As a result, in the first six months of this year there was a surge of deposits in specially established Luxembourg investment funds to 6.3 billion marks ($3.4 billion), or more than 10 times more than the money placed in domestic securities. **********The Bundesbank has described demand for the new investment funds, which are managed by the Luxembourg affiliates of West German banks, as ''tumultous.'' **********West Germans invested more than 27 billion marks ($14.4 billion) in fixed-rate paper in the first five months of this year. Of this, 17.2 billion marks ($9.2 billion) went into foreign-currency bonds and 3.4 billion marks ($1.8 billion) went into mark-denominated foreign loans. Foreign Loans Called Risky **********But the Bundesbank believes that investors may have underestimated the exchange risk involved in choosing foreign-currency loans with high interest rates.

Seven parties have expressed interest in acquiring Rogers, and it is expected to go for a near-record price: probably in the area of $2,400 a subscriber, or more than $1.2 billion. **********For some smaller cable systems, buyers have recently paid as much as $3,000 a subscriber, or more than three times as much as the $900 that was the going price five years ago. Several Reasons for Rise **********There are several reasons for the significant increase in the prices being commanded by these businesses. Deregulation has allowed cable operators to raise the rates they charge subscribers without facing intervention by municipalities. Lower interest rates have helped make the financing of cable acquisitions easier, added Paul Kagan, who heads Paul Kagan Associates, a research firm. **********Additionally, the availability of more programming networks increases cable's attractiveness. As these cable networks become financially stronger, they can buy better programming. The more sophisticated the offerings, the more the cable operator can give potential subscribers. **********What is more, there is talk in the industry that the competition for cable companies might increase, and with it the bidding prices. In recent weeks reports in the industry have surfaced that Pacific Telesis Group, the San Francisco-based telecommunications company, may join with United Artists Commmunications Inc. to bid for Rogers Communications, a subsidiary of Rogers Telecommunications Ltd., based in Toronto. **********Until now virtually all the bidders for cable companies have been other cable operators, eager to take advantage of the economies of scale and management expertise that cable ownership afforded them. The entry of telecommunications companies like Pacific Telesis could dramatically change the picture. **********Lee Cox, group president for diversified companies at Pacific Telesis, would not comment specifically on the reports, but he said he thought that strong cash flows and rising subscriber interest make ''plain old vanilla cable'' a very good business. Regulatory Obstacles **********But there are serious regulatory obstacles, particularly for the Bell operating companies. All telephone companies, including the independents, are forbidden by Congress and the Federal Communications Commission to provide cable services in their telephone service area. **********Some independent phone companies, like the Centel Corporation, own cable systems outside their service area. But the Bell operating companies are forbidden to provide ''information services,'' which include cable TV, anywhere in the United States. That ruling was made by Judge Harold H. Greene of Federal District Court in Washington during the breakup of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. **********Pacific Telesis and any other Bell operating company would therefore need Judge Greene's approval for such an acquisition. Obtaining a waiver on this ruling would also require the consent of the Department of Justice. **********Jay Ricks, a cable expert at the law firm of Hogan & Hartson in Washington, said no Bell company has yet applied for such a waiver, so there is no precedent. **********But the fact that Pacific Telesis is considering such a complex undertaking demonstrates that the existing technology is attractive, said Gordon Crawford, a cable analyst at Capital Guardian Research Group. ''If Pac Tel thought that the state of the technology would make cable TV obsolete in the next few years, they would not be willing to consider the purchase.'' Questions on Fiber Optics **********There has been talk that fiber-optic technology will one day provide an alternative to cable technology. But Mr. Cox said fiber optics are extremely costly and not an alternative in the near future. He said it was unlikely that the telephone companies would be anything more than buyers for existing cable systems, at least for the next decade. **********For the near term, most analysts think that cable has unfettered growth opportunities. Thus buyers are willing to pay increasingly high prices. **********If Pacific Telesis should go forward with United Artists in an attempt to get into the cable business, sources familiar with the talks say, United Artists, which is 67 percent owned by Tele-Communications Inc., might be the one to make the bid. It would then sell off some of the assets to Pacific Telesis if the telecommunications company gets a waiver."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/08/business/tax-accord-by-arco.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-10-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 172, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tax Accord By ARCO", "print_headline": "Tax Accord By ARCO", "body_text": " **********The Atlantic Richfield Company said today that it had agreed to pay $172.3 million to the Alaska Department of Revenue, which will substantially resolve a 10-year tax dispute over oil and gas production income from the company's Prudhoe Bay and Cook Inlet operations. **********ARCO, based in Los Angeles, said the company's 1988 profits would not be affected by the settlement because of previously established reserves to cover the dispute. **********The settlement leaves unresolved two disputed points relating to the years 1978 through 1981 that have a potential tax cost of $57.3 million for ARCO.

A year later he bought back control of United Artists for about $370 million. United Artists in turn acquired most of the MGM assets for $300 million, leaving Mr. Turner with the MGM film library. **********Now it seems Mr. Kerkorian would like to sell his MGM/UA Communications Company again. Early last month, the Los Angeles-based company said it had received inquiries about a possible takeover, and Mr. Kerkorian said he was considering the sale of all or part of his controlling interest in MGM/UA. Skepticism on the Street **********So far, however, no offer has been announced, and on Wall Street skepticism is growing about whether there are serious bidders. ''The question you have to ask is why hasn't a firm offer come through yet, '' said David Londoner, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder & Company. **********Indeed, finding a buyer this time may be tough. Under MGM/UA's chairman, Lee Rich, the company is beginning to do well. It reported a $2.5 million loss on sales of $339 million for the six months ended Feb. 29. That compared with a loss of $14.3 million on sales of $237 million in the comparable 1987 period. **********But rebuilding a troubled film company like MGM/UA requires a large investment and takes years to pay off. 'Starting to Get on Right Track' **********''MGM/UA is finally starting to get on the right track,'' said Harold Vogel, an analyst at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. ''But it will take quite a while for it to be reflected in earnings.'' **********MGM/UA, unlike some of its rivals, has not been consistently successful with its movies. Its earnings potential has been damaged by the fact that it does not own many of the valuable ancillary rights to its films. For example, it does not own the home video rights to many MGM/UA feature films. **********Mr. Rich, the former president of Lorimar Inc. who was considered the main force behind that company's success in television, took over MGM/UA two years ago. **********Since joining the company, he has faced the challenge of revamping MGM/UA's film operation and starting a television production division virtually from scratch. **********That requires a tremendous amount of capital. As Mr. Vogel put it: ''Without a mega-hit, it takes a while to turn the ship around. You're revving up a film production operation. It eats up cash while the cash flow generated from that production comes back much more slowly.'' **********Although cash from box-office receipts comes in as soon as a film is released, revenues from many of the other markets, like television, trickle in years later. **********Before its 1981 acquisition by MGM, United Artists had licensed the foreign video rights to its films through 1990 to Warner Brothers Inc. for $60 million. It also licensed the domestic video rights to its past and future films to CBS/Fox Video, a joint venture formed in 1982 by CBS Inc. and the 20th Century Fox-Film Corporation, for $43 million. Deal Renegotiated **********But after the merger, MGM/UA renegotiated the deal and agreed to license rights to only half of the future United Artists and MGM films to CBS/Fox. In 1984 the company sold German television rights to its films. **********Mr. Rich recalled his frustration upon discovering the various deals that MGM/UA had negotiated. ''It was like stepping on a carpet and a bubble came up,'' he said. ''Then you stepped on another bubble and three more came up. Not really important things, but very annoying things.'' **********Home video rights are particularly crucial to profitability. Mr. Londoner, the analyst, said the home video market represented about 20 percent of a film's revenues. ''They have given away half of their rights so their revenues are 10 percent lower than they would be otherwise,'' he said. ''The profit margins at a typical film company in a reasonable year average less than 10 percent. If you start out by giving that away, your chances of making money are very small.'' **********At Universal Pictures, the film division of MCA Inc. that has been doing poorly, executives recently decided to release ''E.T.: The Extraterrestrial'' on home video cassette. MCA is expected to get at least $90 million in video revenues from ''E.T.'' High Level of Debt **********MGM/UA also has a high level of debt. Under Mr. Rich, United Artists spent $300 million to acquire MGM assets, including its theatrical production and television production operations, the MGM trademark and home video operations. **********To finance those repurchases, United Artists raised $400 million in long-term subordinated debentures. An additional $200 million in bank debt was used to spur the film and TV operations. **********As a result, the company's debt is twice its equity and it has heavy interest expenses. That means its ability to borrow is constrained and it has to keep film-production costs down if it is to release as many films as other studios. The average film costs $20 million with advertising costs of about $6 million. $11 Million Per Film To control MGM/UA's budget, Mr. Rich has adhered to a strategy of spending an average of $11 million a film for its 17 releases in fiscal 1988. **********Even with those limitations, MGM/ UA has had its share of hits. ''Moonstruck'' just won three Academy Awards, the first MGM film to do so in about 15 years, Mr. Rich said. The film, which cost $11 million, has taken in about $70 million at the box office, of which MGM/UA keeps about half. The film has taken in $15 million overseas. In this case, MGM/ UA does own video cassette rights, which Mr. Rich thinks will generate $20 million in revenues. **********A number of other films, including ''Living Daylights,'' have done well. But as is the case at every studio, there have been failures - among them ''Fatal Beauty,'' an action-adventure film released last October. **********And MGM/UA has taken some big risks. For example, ''Willow,'' the new George Lucas film released on May 20, cost $40 million. While it opened well at the box office, reviews have been mixed and industry experts are uncertain about whether the film will continue to do well in the face of competition from two films of rival studios that opened over the Memorial Day weekend: ''Rambo III'' and ''Crocodile Dundee II.'' **********''We only put up $20 million'' for ''Willow,'' Mr. Rich said, noting that Mr. Lucas put up the balance. ''In exchange we have domestic and foreign theatrical rights as well as TV rights.'' Mr. Rich added that the company has already recouped $17 million in advances and guarantees from theater owners. **********But while the company maintains it has little at risk, it must pay for having prints made and for advertising, which could cost $8 million or more. Strides in Television **********Mr. Rich has made enormous strides in reviving MGM/UA's television operations, said John Olds, an analyst at Paul Kagan Associates, a media research firm. **********MGM/UA has ''thirtysomething,'' an hour-long comedy-drama that has been on television for one year, and ''In the Heat of the Night,'' a new hour-long action show, has just been signed for a second year. And the company has received eight orders for new pilots next fall. The MGM/UA also has two promising series - ''Group 1 Medical'' and ''Twilight Zone'' - that it made for local stations, a burgeoning business. Stations reaching at least 70 percent of the television audience in the United States have agreed to carry the series, guaranteeing that they will begin this fall. **********While Mr. Rich has put the company on track, the big question is whether its prospects have sufficiently improved for a buyer to be willing to pay the $22 to $30 a share that Mr. Kerkorian is rumored to be seeking. **********Mr. Kerkorian, whose worth was estimated at $950 million last year by Forbes magazine, already has made a fortune buying and selling MGM/ UA in an era when the value of media properties has soared. Today MGM/ UA's stock is trading at $17, which would make Mr. Kerkorian's block worth about $680 million. Value of Company Varies **********While Wall Street analysts vary widely in their estimates of MGM/ UA's value, they agree it is not worth more than $22 a share and may be worth as little as $15. **********''The UA library has the James Bond films, the Pink Panther films and some other good titles,'' said one analyst, who requested anonymity. ''But unless MGM/UA consistently comes up with hits, the value of the library deteriorates.'' **********Analysts think that Mr. Kerkoshould try to attract a foreign manufacturer of audio-video laser disk players, a home-video technology under development. Such a manufacturer might be eager to find films to play on its machines and could afford to pay more because of the weak dollar."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/07/business/company-news-catalyst-gets-bid-by-pickens-s-son.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-07-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 155, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Catalyst Gets Bid By Pickens's Son", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Catalyst Gets Bid By Pickens's Son", "body_text": " **********The Catalyst Energy Corporation, an independent power producing company that owns or leases generators, said yesterday that it had received a bid of $10.75 a share from Thomas B.

RJR Nabisco issues have fallen much more sharply, as much as 15 points, or enough to raise yields by nearly two percentage points. **********''We had thought companies the size of RJR Nabisco were above the level that was at risk,'' said William Budd, a bond portfolio manager at Favia Hill & Associates Inc., an investment advisory firm. ''But this puts a definition on what issues might be at risk.'' **********Mr. Budd said the takeover risk for high-quality industrial bonds might encourage some investors to buy speculative-grade ''junk bonds,'' whose credit quality is already low. **********After selling many industrial bonds earlier this year, Mr. Budd said he was focusing on ''yankee bonds'' (issues of foreign governments or agencies sold in the United States), mortgage-backed securities and utility bonds.

Troubles Exacerbated by Crash **********It also found that the financial difficulties were exacerbated by the stock market crash last October. The report also noted that during the period under study the London markets were deregulated and became one of the most competitive and highly volatile in the world. The global market crash occurred during that period. The G.A.O. said one bank official described the experience in London as ''learning to sail in a hurricane.'' **********The study by the independent investigative arm of Congress is certain to be used by some members of Congress to argue that banks should be given only minimal new underwriting powers and that the institutions need much closer supervision. **********''This study foreshadows the threat to our banking system if banks are allowed unfettered entry into our domestic securities markets,'' said Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat from Massachusetts and chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance, who requested the study in December and released it today. Expanded Powers Debated **********For months the House and Senate have been debating whether to give commercial banks new powers to underwrite securities, a step that could effectively repeal the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933. That act separated the banking and underwriting industries. **********Led by the nation's largest banks, the industry has contended that other, less regulated competitors, such as brokerage firms and insurance companies, have chipped away at banks' basic business of lending to companies and consumers and that the banking industry needs new sources of business to remain profitable. **********But opponents of bank expansion have argued that securities underwriting and other new businesses pose excessive risks to the banking system and that if any new powers are given, they should be modest and tightly regulated by Washington. **********But bankers contend that they are capable of coping with a volatile securities market and they point to the London experience as proof that any losses can be contained. **********''If viewed as a test case, it's significant that banks have weathered one of the worse crashes in history without lasting problems or major losses,'' said Mary-Liz Meany, chief spokeswoman for the American Bankers Association, who said that the industry group had not seen the G.A.O. report. **********The debate is soon to heat up, as Congress tries to reconcile differences between a Senate-passed bill that gives very broad new powers to banks and a House-passed bill that places severe restrictions on any expanded powers. Study Will Be Part of Herings **********The G.A.O. findings will be the subject of hearings by the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, headed by John D. Dingell, Democrat from Michigan and one of the most outspoken opponents of big-bank expansion into underwriting. Mr. Dingell often notes that his father, then a member of Congress, helped pass the Glass-Steagall Act. **********But in the end, Mr. Dingell might feel compelled to compromise with Senator William Proxmire, Democrat from Wisconsin and the outgoing chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, and architect of the Senate bill that effectively repeals Glass-Steagall. **********Mr. Dingell hopes that this week the full House will pass tough legislation cracking down on insider trading of securities. But Senator Proxmire had hinted that he might insist on linking passage of the insider trading bill to passage of a banking bill that is acceptable to him. Losses in Eurobond Operations **********In the G.A.O. study, the agency said that about 50 American commercial banks operate in London, and ''18 of them engage in at least a minimum amount of underwriting and trading.'' Most are large banks, the report said, and 16 are considered either money-center banks or super-regional banks. **********Some of the losses, most of which occurred in Eurobond operations, required infusions of capital from the parent holding company. The G.A.O. noted, however, that ''the losses and internal control problems did not threaten the worldwide operations of any of these banking institutions,'' **********''It is important to note that foreign and United States investment banks as well as foreign commercial banks were also hard hit'' during that time, the report said. **********The agency did not release the names or statistics on the individual banks it studied."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/15/business/currency-markets-dollar-in-another-decline-weeklong-momentum-cited.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Fuerbringer", "pub_date": "1988-10-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 503, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dollar in Another Decline; Weeklong Momentum Cited", "print_headline": "CURRENCY MARKETS; Dollar in Another Decline; Weeklong Momentum Cited", "body_text": " **********The dollar continued its steady decline yesterday and some traders said it might take central bank intervention to stop the fall. **********The weeklong drop leaves central bankers with the problem of how to allow some depreciation of the dollar without letting the situation get out of hand.

There are 281 savings institutions in Texas and 488 in the region. **********Rising numbers of foreclosures, cases of fraud and mismanagement, and high vacancy rates in commercial properties all contributed to a loss of more than $5 billion for Texas's savings industry in 1987. **********Texas's ''troubles represent about half of our problems nationwide,'' Mr. Wall said in an address to 1,900 business leaders at a luncheon in Dallas. Three Groups Considered Mr. Wall, the industry's chief regulator, was named to the post by President Reagan in July. He said proposals to consolidate all the weak units in Texas into one giant savings institution had been rejected. The new units, he said, would be divided into three groups according to the amount of their assets: $800 million or less, $800 million to $2.5 billion, and more than $2.5 billion. **********The industry's insurance arm, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, will have $8 billion available for closing or merging savings institutions this year, Mr. Wall said. **********''That is as much money as we can appropriately put to work and manage in a straightforward way,'' Mr. Wall said. Some industry analysts believe it may take $50 billion to solve the national industry's problems, but Mr. Wall told reporters that estimate was meaningless. **********Last year, regulators resolved the situations of 48 troubled institutions, with a combined $10.8 billion in assets.

Manuel Antonio Noriega. **********''There is no credit in Panama - not for agriculture, not for anything,'' said Reinmar Tejeira, whose 2,000-acre family-run rice farm in the western province of Cocle is one of the largest in the country. The average Panamanian rice farm is a tenth the size. **********With the rainy season about to begin, Mr. Tejeira would ordinarily be preparing the soil to plant a new crop about now. But he lacks the $500,000 he needs for seed, fertilizer, herbicide, fuel and salaries and the banks are still not dispensing cash, either for loans or simple withdrawals, because of the cash shortage caused by United States economic sanctions. **********This week, Mr. Tejeira has tentatively decided to lay off his 50-member permanent staff and close the farm, although he is considering an 11th-hour plea from the workers to keep them on a two-days-a-week schedule. Planting Decisions Delayed **********But he said it is possible that Tesko Farm, once closed, will not reopen. **********''I'm up a creek,'' said Mr. Tejeira, a ruddy-faced soil specialist, educated at Ohio State and the University of Florida, who, apart from his Spanish-accented English looks like he could have just climbed off a tractor in Iowa. **********''Let's assume, just for the sake of argument, that I suddenly discover I can get the money,'' he said. ''A rich uncle tells me, 'I can bail you out.' Now - am I crazy enough to do it?'' **********Mr. Tejeira, who also grows such cash crops as tomatoes, melons and okra, may have one of Panama's biggest, most modern farming operations, but he is not alone in his predicament. There are perhaps 400 other privately owned, mechanized farms in Panama, and virtually all have put off a decision on planting because of the bleak financial and political picture, according to bankers and agricultural experts. **********Mr. Tejeira said he had heard of only one major farmer in the entire country - a potato grower - who was daring enough to begin planting preparations in the current political and financial atmosphere. **********Another major farmer, who asked that his name not be used, said, ''My personal feeling is that unless Noriega leaves we're all finished.'' Livestock Growers in Trouble **********The farmers running big operations here are numerically in the minority. The majority of Panama's estimated 10,000 farmers run tiny operations, tending their livestock and crops manually, without the benefit of advanced machinery or the need for large bank loans. All told, about 35 percent of Panama's 2.2 million people are involved in agriculture. **********Livestock growers are also in trouble. Poultry farmers, for instance -there are three major producers in Panama, and many smaller ones - have been struggling to find ways to cover feed costs. The soybeans and corn used in chicken feed are not commercially grown in Panama and must be imported at considerable expense. **********Last month, during an abortive nine-day general strike by businessmen that included the seven major supermarket chains, the big poultry farmers were drowning 20,000 chicks a day rather than spend money to feed them, according to a strike organizer. **********''They're operating on a day-to-day basis,'' a Panamanian banker said of the poultry farmers. ''The feed situation stabilized a few weeks ago. But they're getting worried again.'' **********The only segment of Panamanian agriculture that remains unaffected by the crisis is the cattle industry, about which Mr. Tejeira, who has a doctorate in soil chemistry, is also knowledgeable, as part-owner of a cattle ranch. **********''Once you're established, you don't have to do much with cattle,'' he said, explaining that in Panama cattle tend to their own needs, grazing and reproducing without interference or overhead. Expensive American beef-production techniques - feedlots, antibiotics and antificial insemination - are not used here. **********As for his rice, Mr. Tejeira says he is still selling off a large inventory of warehoused stock from last season, ''so we're getting some cash.'' He figures it will last until August. **********But if he is unable to get his new seedlings started before the end of Panama's three-month rainy season, which is expected to begin any day now, it will be too late to plant and he will have nothing to market next year. **********If that fate befalls the majority of Mr. Tejeira's fellow farmers as well, financial experts say, the Noriega Government will inevitably begin importing basic staples such as cheap rice, undercutting Panamanian growers and effectively administering the coup de grace to private agriculture. **********''Once you open the door to imports,'' another rice farmer said, ''then all the corrupt people are going to take over the market.'' **********The farmer, who cited his family's safety as he asked that his name not be used, said the kind of corruption he was talking about was recently on display in the flour industry. **********On March 26, Government riot troops known here as Dobermans seized the inventory of country's two largest flour mills, the Panamanian-owned Harina de Panama and another company partly owned by General Mills, an American company. **********The two companies had donated the 1.3 million pounds of flour to Caritas, the Roman Catholic relief agency, to be distributed to the poor, but the troops took it to Government warehouses, where officials said it would be sold at fair market prices to bakers to help ease food shortages. **********''They took the flour to allocate it, all right, but there was a black market,'' the farmer asserted. ''Some of those guys took some of the flour and sold it on the side. So now you hardly see any flour around. I think sooner or later, there's going to be no flour, stolen or unstolen.'' **********Mr. Tejeira said he knew of only three areas of legitimate commerce in Panama that were still operating at anything approaching viable levels: the food industry, the fuel industry and the home-video business. **********''I guess people are desperate for diversion these days,'' Mr. Tejeira said. ''I was just talking to somebody who owns a videotape store and he told me he's doing beautifully.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/23/business/phoning-irs-with-tax-queries-39-of-the-replies-may-be-wrong.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Pear", "pub_date": "1988-02-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1166, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Phoning I.R.S.

Gibbs, is prepared to testify to a lower error rate, about 25 percent, according to documents provided by the tax agency today to the House Ways and Means Committee. **********That error rate is based on the agency's own audit. The agency's data, which are based on a larger survey, may be more valid than the G.A.O.'s, although that is not at all certain. **********Mr. Gibbs said that, when the tax agency found its employees giving out inaccurate information, it quickly passed the word to managers of its telephone assistance sites ''so that corrective action can be taken.'' This usually results in additional training. Increase of 16 Percent **********The telephone assistance program is more important than ever because most provisions of the monumental Tax Reform Act of 1986 take effect this year, and the Internal Revenue Service expects to field 26 million telephone inquiries, up 16 percent from last year. **********The 1986 tax law changed 2,000 subsections of the tax code and required revision of more than 200 forms. Even some tax accountants and lawyers have had problems adjusting. **********Representative J. J. Pickle, the Texas Democrat who is the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee's Subcommittee on Oversight, said he was ''seriously troubled'' by what appeared to be ''a marked decline in the accuracy of taxpayer assistance'' provided by the Internal Revenue Service. **********This year's G.A.O. survey was requested by Mr. Pickle and by Representative Doug Barnard Jr., a Georgia Democrat who monitors the Internal Revenue Service as chairman of a subcommittee of the Government Operations Committee. The accounting office has not measured the accuracy of information provided to people who seek assistance in person at Internal Revenue offices. **********Copies of the testimony were obtained in advance from a member of Congress who wanted to focus attention on the hearing and the problems it will explore. **********Jennie S. Stathis, associate director of the general government division of the General Accounting Office, said the tax agency ''did a commendable job'' in trying to prepare its employees and the public for the 1988 filing season. ''Walk-in and telephone assistance has been meeting taxpayer demand in terms of quantity,'' she added. ''But preliminary results of test calls by I.R.S. and us indicate that I.R.S. assisters need to improve the quality of their responses to taxpayer questions.'' Program Cuts Rejected **********The revenue service has had a telephone assistance program for more than two decades. In an effort to save money, the Reagan Administration tried to cut the program in the early 1980's. But Congress rejected the proposals, and tax officials now support the program on the ground that it facilitates voluntary compliance and increases the accuracy of returns. **********One question asked by the G.A.O. in its survey this year was, ''Can I take a deduction for a contribution to an Individual Retirement Account?'' **********Other questions involved the use of part of a home for business purposes, the special additional exemption that was formerly allowed to elderly taxpayers and reimbursement by an employer for certain business expenses. Answers Are Not Simple **********The answers to the questions are not simple because they depend on many considerations. The I.R.S. personnel are expected to probe and elicit relevant facts that will permit them to give complete, accurate answers over the telephone. **********If, for example, a taxpayer had an adjusted gross income of $60,000 last year and was covered by a retirement plan at work, could a deduction be taken for a contribution to an I.R.A.? The correct answer is no. But the General Accounting Office sometimes received incorrect answers. **********Many of the people who answer telephone inquiries for the tax agency are seasonal employees. They receive training from the Internal Revenue Service and have access to reference manuals at their desks. **********The front-line personnel who have the first opportunity to answer taxpayers' questions were paid $6.35 to $10.29 an hour last year, according to a G.A.O. report. They refer troublesome questions to more experienced employees, who were paid hourly wages of $7.92 to $13.99, the report said. Waiver of Penalties Studied **********Wilson Fadely, an Internal Revenue spokesman, quoted tax officials as saying they probably would not impose penalties on taxpayers who could demonstrate that they had relied on incorrect information from the tax agency. He added, in answer to a question, that whether interest could be waived was being looked into. But he said the Government had no legal authority to waive the liability for taxes. **********Tax officials said it was unclear how a taxpayer might prove there was a reliance on incorrect information provided by telephone. They said they were concerned that taxpayers might call over and over until they got the answer they wanted for a particular question. **********The tax agency plans to make 20,000 calls to test the accuracy of information being provided by its employees over the telephone. Through Feb. 12, it had placed 4,500 calls. It says that 74.8 percent of the inquiries were answered correctly. **********The lowest accuracy rate, 69.3 percent, was in the North Atlantic region, which covers New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine. #73.6 Percent Mid-Atlantic Rate The mid-Atlantic region, covering New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia and the District of Columbia, had an accuracy rate of 73.6 percent. **********The proportion of questions answered correctly in other regions was: Southeast 78.9 percent; Central 77.9 percent; Midwest 76.7 percent; Southwest 73.7 percent, and Western 72.8 percent. **********Commissioner Gibbs expressed concern that taxpayers were postponing the filing of returns more than in previous years. As of Feb. 12, the Government had received 16.9 million individual tax returns, a decrease of 9.7 percent from the comparable point last year. Mrs. Stathis said a possible reason for the delays was that some I.R.S. offices had temporarily run out of certain forms and publications. **********Such spot shortages may create ''anxiety and frustration on the part of taxpayers,'' defeating the Government's efforts to encourage early filing, she added."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/06/business/what-s-new-in-collectible-cars-an-influx-of-new-money-revs-up-the-market.html": {"writer_name": "Warren Berger", "pub_date": "1988-03-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 411, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "An Influx of New Money Revs Up the Market", "print_headline": "WHAT'S NEW IN COLLECTIBLE CARS; An Influx of New Money Revs Up the Market", "body_text": " **********At least 300,000 people in the United States collect old cars for love or money or both. And while the number of collectors is increasing by 5 to 10 percent a year, the real growth in the collectible car market is measured in dollars. This year, participants estimate that up to $500 million will change hands at auctions and private sales. **********Dollar volume at collectible car auctions has skyrocketed recently, even though the increase in the number of transactions has been moderate. Over four days in January, the annual Barrett Jackson Auction in Scottsdale, Ariz., sold $26 million worth of vintage cars, a 50 percent increase from the 1987 event. Similarly, Kruse International, the largest auctioneer in the field, saw sales rise to $150 million last year - double the volume of five years ago. **********Rising car values are partly tied to the fall of the dollar, which has lured foreign investors to the market. Perhaps more significant was the October market collapse. ''Quite a few people took their money out of stocks and began investing in cars,'' said Bob Hall, an editor with Old Cars Weekly. ''With more money coming into the market, cars, in general, became more valuable.'' **********Cars that are ''classics'' - vehicles made between 1925 and 1948, according to the Classic Car Club of America - are bringing in the highest bids, with some selling for more than $1 million. But the hottest cars are those from the late 1950's and early 1960's. ''These were the cars that people from that generation dreamed about as they were growing up,'' said Von Reese, who has an auction company in Austin, Tex. ''Now that they have money, they're willing to pay any price to get those cars.'' **********Those 25-year-old collectibles may not be as classy as the classics, but they have one major advantage: Owners can drive them around.

In fact, there is growing reason to think that the stock plunge may actually protect the nation from a dollar crisis that would cut deeply into income and employment. **********The post-crash decline in personal consumption (and mirror-image rise in savings) could not have been better timed to carry the economy through the last months of the Reagan Administration without an inflationary crunch and the serious threat of a currency crisis. No conceivable run of luck, though, will enable the next Administration to restore the trade balance without breaking the political stalemate over Federal deficit reduction. **********The continuing threat to the economy is a flight from the dollar, set off by a loss of confidence in America's will to repay its foreign debts. Such a flight would drive up interest rates, pushing the economy into recession. Hence the collective sigh of relief when December's figures showed a second straight monthly decline in the trade deficit, to $12 billion. **********But progress on the trade deficit is relative. As Stephen Marris, a researcher at the Institute for International Economics, glumly notes, the restoration of balanced trade still requires the United States to increase exports or reduce exports by about $150 billion annually. Add the $50 billion trade surplus needed to repay the accumulated foreign debts with interest over the next decade, and the swing needed to balance the trade accounts is closer to $200 billion, or about 5 percent of national output. **********Nobody expects the United States to close this 5 percent gap overnight. But there is a vague consensus that it will be hard to persuade foreigners to accept i.o.u.'s in dollars at anything close to current exchange rates unless the trade figures show steady progress toward balance over the next four or five years. **********At first glance, a corresponding $40 billion to $50 billion improvement in 1988 seems an easy target for American companies seeking to regain market share from foreigners. David Morrison, an economist at Goldman, Sachs, estimates that, at current exchange rates, American-made goods are about 20 percent cheaper on world markets than they were in 1980, when the trade accounts were last balanced. But the fact that the United States is again competitive does not guarantee that the production capacity will be available to increase sales. **********Two big bellwether industries, chemicals and paper, are already operating at full steam to meet domestic and foreign orders. And with much of the rest of the economy operating near capacity, it will not be possible to export more (or import less) unless some Americans tighten their belts. Don't look to Washington for the belt-tightening: the post-crash budget pact, unveiled with such drama in November, does nothing more than eliminate projected growth in the Federal deficit. **********That's where the ''luck'' of the stock market crash fits in. During the first three quarters of 1987, consumers dug deeply into their wallets to finance those higher-priced Toyotas and VCR's. Personal savings fell to a record low of 2.7 percent, less than half the average of the 1970's. But after the stock collapse, the savings rate rebounded to 4.9 percent. If consumers remain equally cautious this year, Mr. Marris estimates, about 1.5 percent of G.N.P., about $60 billion, will be available to reduce the trade deficit. Thus far, they seem to be cooperating: housing starts fell sharply in January. **********Even if the higher savings rate holds up and the monthly trade deficits fall, there is no guarantee that the currency markets will behave. All bets are surely off, said Georges de Menil, senior editor of Economic Policy, a European journal, if Congress passes protectionist legislation. Open trade, he argued, ''goes right to the heart of prosperity in the postwar period.'' Remember, too, that once the $60 billion is fully absorbed in the trade accounts, America will still be stuck with an annual trade deficit close to $100 billion, plus interest on net foreign debt exceeding $500 billion. **********Might the free market again save Washington from the consequences of budget paralysis? Another serendipitous boost in private savings could free the productive capacity needed to maintain the trade momentum. There is no reason, though, to think that individuals or corporations will dovetail their savings habits to the requirements of foreign creditors. A deliberately induced recession or a miscalculation by the Federal Reserve would also accomplish the job. But that would be equivalent to destroying the village in order to save it. **********In the best of plausible worlds, then, the new President will have one more chance to break the budget deadlock before foreign holders of dollars run out of patience. The unanswered question is whether he will have the economic insight or political savvy to exploit the opportunity."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/29/world/israeli-diplomats-arrive-in-moscow.html": {"writer_name": "Bill Keller", "pub_date": "1988-07-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 745, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ISRAELI DIPLOMATS ARRIVE IN MOSCOW", "print_headline": "ISRAELI DIPLOMATS ARRIVE IN MOSCOW", "body_text": " **********An Israeli consular delegation arrived in Moscow tonight, expressing high hopes that the visit would lead to a resumption of diplomatic relations, which were severed 21 years ago. **********''We're finally here,'' the head of the delegation, Meron Gordon, said during an airport meeting with reporters. **********''This is the first step in, we hope, a process that will eventually lead to full normalization of relations between the two countries,'' he added, speaking in Hebrew and then translating his own statement into English. **********The six-member team is the first official Israeli delegation to visit since Moscow severed relations because of the Arab-Israeli war in 1967.

''The ones I have in my stomach are very big.'' **********Mr. Gordon said the delegation would meet with Jews who have been denied permission to leave the Soviet Union. **********''It is my understanding that, at the moment, diplomats of various embassies see almost everybody,'' he said.

The Delegation's Plans **********Mr. Gordon said the Israeli diplomats will study how visas are issued to Soviet Jews who wish to visit or emigrate to Israel. The Israeli visas are now processed by the Dutch Embassy. **********They also plan to inspect the vacant Israeli Embassy building, a yellow, stucco-walled compound on Bolshaya Ordinka Street, which the Dutch have maintained for Israel since its ambassador and other diplomats were expelled in 1967. **********Mr. Gordon said the delegation has no plans to begin enforcing Israel's new policy to prevent Soviet Jews who emigrate on Israeli visas from going to the United States instead. **********The Israeli Cabinet has voted to require that Soviet emigres exit through Rumania, where they would have no opportunity to obtain United States entry permission. Most emigres now go to Vienna, where fewer than 10 percent continue to Israel. A Matter for a Higher Level **********Some Soviet Jews have feared that the arrival of the delegation would mark the beginning of the visa restrictions. **********But, Mr. Gordon said, ''I believe that this is a matter that will be decided on a much higher level than ours.'' **********The Soviet Union has begun a delicate courtship of Israel, hoping to increase Moscow's influence in the Middle East without compromising friendships with Arab countries. **********Mr. Gorbachev has said the absence of Soviet-Israeli relations is ''not normal.'' Moscow has dropped its longstanding condition that Israel surrender all Arab territories captured in 1967 before restoration of diplomatic ties could be considered. **********The Israelis who arrived today entered Moscow through the V.I.P. lounge of Sheremetyevo Airport here.

''When I need it fast, I come here,'' she said. A few hours later, she returned to pick up pictures she wanted to have before leaving town the next morning. **********Because of people like her, lacking time but needing pictures, the number of so-called one-hour photo processing shops is growing rapidly nationwide, spawning a fundamental change in the $4.5 billion retail photofinishing industry. And the increasing availability of smaller and cheaper automated film-processing machines is likely to continue the trend, according to people in the industry. **********''It's blossoming like crazy,'' said Lydia Wolfman, author of the Wolfman Report on Photographic and Imaging Industry in the United States, an annual publication. ''It's such a convenience for people to drop it off and in one hour get good prints. It's a big part of the industry now.'' Industry Born in the Late 70's **********The one-hour movement was born in the late 1970's, when mini-labs, relatively small machines that allow rapid photo development in small quantities, became available. **********Mini-labs now account for a third of the photofinishing industry, and some experts think they will continue to proliferate, capturing about two-thirds of the market. Others think their spread will slow but that more large retailers will add them. **********Indeed, the K Mart Corporation equips selected stores with mini-labs. A host of camera shops is beginning to offer mini-lab services. And Moto Photo Inc., a large mini-lab owner and franchiser, is negotiating with a restaurant chain about combining fast prints with fast food. #14,700 Units Operating By 1980, 600 were operating. Spurred by further technological advances, the figure had risen to about 14,700 at the end of last year, according to the Photo Marketing Association, which tracks the industry. **********The shops can be found in malls, shopping centers, train stations and even newsstands. ''There's definitely a trend,'' said Thomas Podgorski, vice president in charge of marketing at CPI Corporation, a St. Louis-based chain of one-hour shops. **********In pre-mini-lab days, people would typically take their film to a drugstore, grocery store or camera store and wait several days for their prints. While they waited, the film was delivered to an outside lab, developed en masse with thousands of other rolls and rushed back. 'An Instant-Gratification Society' **********Mini-labs, however, allow owners to develop and process film themselves. The key advantages, owners of one-hour shops said, are speed and convenience. ''We live in an instant-gratification society,'' said J. William Byrd, who owns five Moto Photo franchise shops in Atlanta. ''We want things now. The one-hour, on-site lab can provide that.'' **********Owners of one-hour shops also said customers have the advantage of dealing directly with the people who will develop their film. Because the film never leaves the premises, it is less likely to be lost. **********In years past, mini-labs had a reputation for low-quality prints. But executives in the industry said quality had improved in recent years. In an October 1987 study of the photofinishing industry, Consumer Reports ranked mini-labs that used chemicals, paper and other accessories sold by the Eastman Kodak Company of Rochester the highest in picture quality. The two chains of one-hour shops that were included in the study, CPI and Fox Photo, finished fifth and 11th, respectively, in a field of 18. **********Others in the study included large wholesale photofinishing firms and mini-labs that use other brands of equipment or chemicals. The newer ''washless'' mini-labs that use a dry chemical process finished near the bottom. One-Hour Shops Charge More **********One-hour shops generally charge several dollars more to develop a roll of film than the average wholesale operation does. At 1 Hour Foto in Manhattan, customers pay $10.90 for the development of a 24-exposure roll of film and one set of prints. At Mystic Color Lab, a large mail order concern based in Mystic, Conn., the charge is $5.95, although the customer must wait several days. **********Indeed, although mini-labs took in 33 percent of the $4.5 billion that American consumers spent in 1987 to develop film, they handled only 29 percent of the total film volume. **********In this increasingly competitive business, three companies operate large chains: Moto Photo owns or franchises 252 shops; CPI owns 250, and Fox Photo, a San Antonio-based concern now owned by its management after a leveraged buyout from Kodak last year, owns 215. Independents Are the Real Force **********But the real force in the business is that of the mom-and-pop operators, who seem to be opening shops in every neighborhood. ''Where's the competition?'' Mr. Podgorski mused. ''It's on every street corner.'' ''You've just got to find an area where there's not already two or three of them sitting next to each other across the street,'' said Francis A. Hince, owner of Phototek, an independent one-hour shop in Atlanta. **********The rise of the one-hour shops stems in part from the relative ease with which they can be started. **********Owners of one-hour shops said mini-labs could be bought for between $30,000 and $125,000. Most mini-lab manufacturers - the largest include Copal Systems Inc. of Plymouth, Minn.; the Noritsu American Corporation of Buena Park, Calif., and Kodak - also allow people to lease mini-labs. Factors in Profitability **********The profitability of each shop depends on many factors - real estate costs, financing costs, labor costs and local competition. But Michael F. Adler, chief executive of Moto Photo, said that under ideal circumstances a shop could remain in the black by processing 25 to 30 rolls a day. **********A mini-lab can be operated by one person, but space is a key requirement. Most mini-labs take up between 50 to 60 square feet of floor space. Next-generation mini-labs are likely to be smaller. It is expected that they will eventually fit on a table top and be even easier to operate. **********''The technology is getting even more sophisticated,'' said Ted C. Fox, director of marketing research for the Photo Marketing Association. ''The amount of operator input has shrunk over the years.'' Nevertheless, the three large chains said that well-trained operators for the machines continue to be a key factor for success. Challenge to Rest of the Industry **********Mini-labs are seen as a growing challenge to the well-established wholesale photo processors. Of course, established players are surely unwilling to surrender the market. And after all, not everyone needs prints within an hour. **********Kodak, long the standard bearer of wholesale labs, has been aggressively strengthening its photo-processing operations with a string of acquisitions, including the American Photo Group, an Atlanta-based company, in September for an undisclosed amount. **********In December, Kodak announced a joint venture with Fuqua Industries, the Atlanta-based owner of Colorcraft, to run a new company that will include 94 wholesale labs, representing a significant new force in the game. 'Enough Business for Everyone' **********Though it does not own one-hour shops, Kodak markets its own mini-labs and sells a wide range of equipment to mini-lab operators. **********''We don't see these things as mutually exclusive,'' said Ronald C. Roberts, a spokesman for Kodak, adding that he saw ''a strong and growing market'' for wholesale labs. **********Indeed, one bit of news that is heartening for everyone in the photo business is that Americans are taking more pictures. In 1987, American consumers bought about 710 million rolls of film, 13 percent more than they did in 1986. **********Mr. Fox of the Photo Marketing Association said, ''With that type of a market there's enough business out there for everyone.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/10/business/advertising-britain-s-no-1-shop-created-bsb-dorland.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1988-03-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 848, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; Britain's No. 1 Shop Created: BSB/Dorland", "print_headline": "Advertising; Britain's No. 1 Shop Created: BSB/Dorland", "body_text": " **********SAATCHI & SAATCHI is merging the Backer Spielvogel Bates and Dorland Advertising offices in London to form BSB/Dorland.

It was accompanied by the text of a speech made yesterday in London by Maurice Saatchi, chairman of the holding company. **********In addition to the merger, Mr. Spielvogel said, he has establishsed a European agency group with London as the keystone. He says it is the largest group in Europe, and he has set up a worldwide management committee with himself at the head. **********Dorland, with billings of about $350 million, has been an independent agency within S.&S., reporting to Mr. Spielvogel, since October. Its chairman, Michael Bungey, will become chairman of BSB/Dorland, while Tony Dalton, chairman of Ted Bates, London, billing about $150 million, will become deputy chairman. **********''The reason for the merger is that if you want to be an important international agency you have to have major resources in New York and London,'' Mr. Spielvogel said as the breakfast guests filed out of the dining room and headed to work. ''And London will be especially important in 1992 when the European tariff barriers come down and Pan European marketing becomes a reality.'' **********To prepare for that he has set up a European management group, with Mr. Bungey at its head. His two deputy chairman will be Stanley Bendelac, chairman of Grupo Bates, Madrid, and Mogens Holten, chief executive of Ted Bates, Copenhagen, who will head the Scandinavian region. **********Mr. Spielvogel said he was heading for the Pacific Basin next week to visit Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and Southeast Asia. Backer Spielvogel Bates, which has 106 offices in 46 countries, already has agency affiliations in the region and is looking to build that into equity positions. ''The Pacific Basin is going to be a scene of great growth,'' he said. **********The new worldwide management committee listed by Mr. Spielvogel does not include Donald M. Zuckert, president and chief operating officer, who was chief executive of Ted Bates Worldwide before it merged with Backer & Spielvogel last year. He was on the Colorado ski slopes yesterday.

There were remarks by Mr. Saatchi, the chairman. Among the things he noted were these: *********** Saatchi agencies now place 20 percent of all television advertising in the United States. *********** In the last decade the number of multinational agencies has shrunk to eight, from 12 (with Saatchi companies being two of the survivors). *********** The eight remaining multinational agencies have 20 percent of the market, while the original 12 had only 12 percent a decade ago. **********Referring to when European tariffs will disappear, he said that ''1992 will find us with communications market leadership in at least six of the major European markets.'' **********With Mr. Spielvogel on the Avenue magazine panel were Robert L. James, chairman of McCann-Erickson; Allen Rosenshine, president of the Omnicom Group; Burton Manning, chairman of J. Walter Thompson, and William E. Phillips, chairman of the executive committee of the Ogilvy Group. They answered questions from Mrs. Price and her guests. Some of the most interesting responses came when she asked what is the biggest problem in client-agency relationships. **********''It is the friction caused by compensation,'' Mr. James said. ''The 15 percent commission needs something better, but nobody's found it yet.'' **********Mr. Rosenshine agreed with that assessment, adding, ''And agencies have to be able to convince clients that advertising works and that there is a specific return on an advertising investment.'' **********''We have to establish a value to what we're doing,'' Mr. Manning said. **********And when it comes to compensation, Mr. Phillips noted, ''clients increasingly want to negotiate.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/25/business/trucking-s-new-labor-problem.html": {"writer_name": "Agis Salpukas", "pub_date": "1988-07-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1205, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Trucking's New Labor Problem", "print_headline": "Trucking's New Labor Problem", "body_text": " **********Larry A. Myers's aim as the director of recruiting for the Jones Motor Group is to find enough new truck drivers to support the company's ambitious growth plans. But his real problem is simply keeping up with the turnover in Jones's current pool of 350 drivers. **********In fact, Mr. Myers said, the six recruiters scouring the country for him will have to find about 400 drivers this year just to stay even. And they will have to do it on a shoestring because the bitter competition that has characterized the interstate trucking industry since deregulation in the 1970's forces Jones Motor to keep a tight rein on wages and benefits. **********Trucking industry executives say that the rapid driver turnover reflects growing discontent, not just with wages but also with working conditions. Longer hours, tighter scheduling and stricter enforcement of traffic laws are driving long-time truckers out of the business. Shrinking Pool of Workers **********At the same time, there is a shrinking pool of workers ready and able to replace the older drivers in an age in which everything, including the trucks themselves, is getting more sophisticated. **********''We're going to have to get better people at a time when there will be fewer of them,'' said Thomas J. Donahue, the president of American Trucking Associations, a trade group. **********Industry officials estimate that there are about 2.5 million truck drivers, including 1.8 million or so who drive large trucks. About 70,000 long-distance drivers, or about 4 percent of that group, quit between 1984 and 1986, an industry survey reported. Studies project that tougher testing and new laws to catch drivers who have piled up traffic violations by carrying licenses from several states will cut the available labor pool by 10 percent during the next two years. **********Mandatory screening of drivers for drug or alcohol abuse could eliminate another 10 percent. A recent survey for the Regular Common Carrier Conference, an industry trade group, found that 36 percent of the drivers admitted that they had driven under the influence of drugs and that 18 percent had driven under the influence of alcohol. Higher Prices Are Seen **********Truck industry officials say the declining number of truck drivers will eventually lead to higher shipping prices that would be felt throughout the economy. The nation's 4.1 million trucks haul about 80 percent of the supply of basic items like food, furniture, appliances, plastic goods, lumber and wood products, sheet metal and cable. **********Trucking executives say that thousands of rigs are already parked in trucking-company lots across the country because the companies cannot get enough drivers. Some industry surveys indicate that 90 percent of the long-distance trucking companies have experienced trouble recruiting drivers. **********So far, however, companies that rely on trucks to ship their products say there are still enough drivers and trucks in the industry that they have been able to avoid delays. Since deregulation undermined the ability of major trucking concerns to limit competition, the number of interstate carriers has more than doubled, to 37,000. **********''I don't know of any shipment that has been delayed,'' said Richard Haupt, the director of transportation and traffic at the Ford Motor Company. But Ford does not expect that to last. ''There are some problems coming up,'' he said. **********Low wages are one reason for the declining number of drivers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the average truck driver's wages rose 20 percent from 1979 to 1986, compared with a 50 percent increase for all jobs. But that figure disguises the replacement of tens of thousands of union jobs with nonunion labor, resulting in lower income for many longtime drivers. **********In interviews, some owner-operators, who own their trucks and generally lease their services out to companies, said that they had been earning about $60,000 a year or more but now often make $40,000 to $50,000. And regular drivers who had been earning from $30,000 to $35,000 say their wages have also fallen, to about $25,000. Cutbacks in Teamsters' Contract **********Last May, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents a declining portion of the drivers, narrowly approved a new contract calling for wage and benefit increases of about 10 percent over three years. Under the contract, new drivers start at 85 percent of the full scale. The contract, however, allows for wage cuts of 15 percent for financially troubled companies. **********However, drivers say, they are more discouraged by the working conditions than the wages. The truck driver's image has changed radically from the days when he was considered the king of the road, filling the citizens band radio waves with earthy chatter. **********''He used to be the good guy who helped someone in trouble on the road,'' conceded Mr. Myers of Jones Motors. ''Now he can't afford a half hour to change someone's tire.'' 'It's a Gypsy Life' **********Twenty-hour days of driving are not unusual for owner-operators, said Corda Arrigo, owner of the New Jersey trucking concern Bramac Inc., during a recent run with an 18-wheel truck full of soap products from Passaic, N.J., to Maryland. **********''It's a gypsy life,'' said Jim Barkley recently before bedding down in the back of his cab at a truck stop just off the New Jersey Turnpike in Bordentown. He planned to drive 10 hours after sleeping, rest another 8 hours, and then drive 10 more to reach Kansas City, Mo. Drivers may spend months on the road between visits home. **********In addition, the truckers say, the pressure to meet schedules often forces them to sidestep regulations, from speed limits to record-keeping requirements. And, even though many concede that road checks by transportion officials are necessary to get unsafe equipment and drivers off the road, they feel harassed when caught in them. Risks for Drivers **********Bob Miller, who drives a large tanker truck for Horst Milk Transfer in Pennsylvania, recalled that he had recently been pulled over at a checkpoint and given a $67.50 fine for not wearing his seat belt and not having his log book in order. **********Driving also entails a number of risks that can occur without warning. Bob Daubert, who has been a trucker for 14 years, said that his motor recently caught on fire while he was on the George Washington Bridge. He and his partner had their own extinguisher and they were able to put out the fire before the motor was ruined. But the truck in which he invested $15,000 now needs repairs. **********The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that the demand for additional drivers will grow by about 1.3 percent a year through the turn of the century - requiring a 20 percent increase in the current labor pool. That estimate is based on past growth trends, which includes drivers who use lighter-weight vehicles and concentrate on local runs."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/16/business/savings-unit-takeover.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-09-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 124, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Savings Unit Takeover", "print_headline": "Savings Unit Takeover", "body_text": " **********The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said today that it had arranged the acquisition of the insolvent Coosa Federal Savings and Loan Association of Gadsden, Ala., by the Birmingham-based Secor Savings Bank.

An omnibus commercial. Sort of an in-unity-there-is-strength kind of thing. **********The crux, of course, is the vehicle. It is a melding that must be done smoothly or the networks and stations might not accept the advertising because they are wary of this sort of thing. After all, an omnibus commercial might cut into sales of television time. **********The creative staff of Kornhauser & Calene, under the direction of the agency's vice chairman, Dennis Barham, has come up with a dandy solution for a number of household products put out by the Boyle-Midway division of the American Home Products Corporation, the major client. **********It has produced filmed 30-second home-improvement seminars conducted by the TV personality Bob Vilas in which he not only mentions and shows the products but also suggests new uses for them. A double play: the products are introduced to the consumers who are unaware of them and, more importantly, new uses are suggested to viewers who already have the products at home. **********Mr. Vilas speaks with some authority on home improvements. He is the host of the television program ''This Old House'' and an author of home- improvement books. **********One spot features Zud Cleanser and 3-in-1 Plus oil and another features Plasticwood, Old English Scratch Cover and Easy Off Mildew Stain Remover. A third has the same product lineup as the second except it substitutes Easy Off Oven Cleaner. **********Mr. Barham said the advertising has just about completed its test-market runs in Alabama and Ohio where the spending on TV time has been running at a national rate of $4 million to $5 million. The test-market advertising has been placed by the John F. Murray Advertising Agency, American Home's in-house media operation. Carol Emerling, spokeswoman for American Home, said Murray had no trouble buying time for these commercials despite the multiplicity of brands. **********Already in national use is an omnibus commercial that the agency made for the Arm & Hammer line of baking-soda-based deodorant products from the Church & Dwight Company. The 30-second spot uses an animation format to promote the use of carpet and room deodorizers as well as an air freshener. ''Freshen everything under the roof with Arm & Hammer,'' is the line. **********''When it is not a very big brand, it's a way of making the money go further,'' said Mr. Barham, nodding knowingly to Lisa DuBose, a fellow Briton and executive vice president/ creative director. **********Mr. Barham has been at Kornhauser & Calene for a year, during which time he and the 12-person creative team have turned out new advertising for every client of the $120 million agency. **********For Anacin-3, another brand from American Home, the agency has a different campaign for different parts of the country. One is, ''When you can't take 5, take 3.'' The other is, ''When pain hits you with the old 1-2.'' **********Even more exciting is what the agency has accomplished for the National Westminster Bank U.S.A., which has 140 branches in the New York area. It has set up a reparations system for customers. A complaint about a discourteous teller will bring an on-the-spot payment of $5 when the complaint is verified.

Could Mr. Allan, a professor at Brooklyn Law School, quickly draw up a power of attorney permitting a third party to withdraw cash from the man's bank account? **********While the urgency was unusual, the underlying concern is a common one - and becoming more so as people live longer and with the rising incidence of such diseases as AIDS and Alzheimer's. ''When the average person becomes disabled, mentally or physically, he or she needs someone to manage their funds and pay the bills,'' said Edward Pennfield, a lawyer with Lane & Mittendorf. For many people, the power of attorney can be an invaluable planning tool. This power is a written contract that gives a designated person, called the agent, the right to act on behalf of the person who is granting the power, called the principal. **********Unless it is created because of a sudden crisis, a power of attorney is often drawn up along with a will as part of an individual's overall estate plan. ''I uniformly recommend it for clients aged 60 or older because that is the danger zone,'' said Julian S. Bush, a senior estate partner with Shea & Gould. A power of attorney is equally advisable for younger clients, Mr. Bush said, but he has found they often resist giving up power over their assets. **********There are different types of powers of attorney - all of them revocable. A limited power of attorney covers specific matters or a given time period. A lawyer might be granted the power to close a real estate transaction, for example, or to pay bills and make bank deposits while a client is traveling abroad. A general power of attorney authorizes the agent to act in connection with all of an individual's business or financial affairs. However, the general power lapses if the principal becomes incapacitated or mentally disabled -just the time when it is likely to be needed most. To remedy this omission, the so-called durable power of attorney has been created and is now recognized in some form by all 50 states. This power makes provision for the possibility of mental or physical incapacity. It is called durable because it remains effective for as long as the principal lives, no matter what his condition is, unless that person specifically revokes it. **********Some states - including New Jersey, but not New York or Connecticut - have laws authorizing a ''springing'' power of attorney, so named because it springs into action when the principal becomes incapacitated. But the springing power often presents problems because of difficulties in proving incapacity, said David P. Callahan, a lawyer with Whitman & Ransom. ''An institution may require direct evidence of incapacity, such as a doctor's letter,'' he said. ''Or they may even say, 'Get me a court order.' '' The durable power, in contrast, ''confers immediate authority, then goes on to say it shall survive incapacity.'' **********But even armed with a valid durable power of attorney, an agent may face opposition from financial institutions. Banks, insurers and brokerages often prefer that customers use their own power-of-attorney forms, and as a practical matter, lawyers often suggest that clients sign them in advance. ''If they don't, we will fight with the broker and bank to get the durable power of attorney recognized,'' Mr. Bush said. ''But it is expensive for the client and takes time.'' **********An important emerging development, Mr. Bush noted, is that powers of attorney often include provisions for the agent to make decisions as to the nature and extent of medical treatment for the person granting the power. ''This could be a separate document,'' he said, ''or it could be added to the regular power of attorney,'' along with other special provisions - which might include giving the agent access to safe-deposit boxes or the power to sign tax returns or deal with retirement plans. **********In selecting a person to receive a power of attorney, honesty and good judgment are prime considerations. ''You needn't choose a financial wizard,'' Mr. Pennfield said. ''It's best to pick a trusted friend or family member - someone who has a basic knowledge of financial affairs who is in regular contact with you and knows your wishes.'' If there are divisions within the family, a lawyer or an accountant might be a better choice. In any event, make sure the person chosen is willing to accept the responsibility. **********Even though powers of attorney are revocable, many healthy people remain reluctant to assign such broad authority to another person, said Peter J. Strauss, a New York estate lawyer. Elderly individuals often worry about the risk of theft and fraud - with some reason, because abuses have occurred. But that possibility can by forestalled, Mr. Strauss said, by thoughtful selection of the person to whom the power will be given and by placing the executed power of attorney with a lawyer, for use only when the need arises. Another alternative is to appoint multiple agents to act jointly. **********Mr. Allan, the law professor, knows firsthand that people sometimes take advantage of the elderly or the ailing. When he drew up the emergency power of attorney on behalf of the AIDS patient at St. Vincent's, he specified that the money in the man's bank account would be delivered in the form of a check payable to the patient.

While the mood was decidedly bearish, dealers noted that sellers were almost as scarce as buyers. **********Early in the session the market had little response to a report that the Consumer Price Index had risen four-tenths of 1 percent in April. The figure was in line with expectations. **********After lunch, prices dropped sharply in the thin market after officials announced that the Federal budget surplus in April was roughly $5 billion below the $19 billion that many economists had expected.

Given the high cost of holding large positions, many speculators and short-term traders decided to liquidate their positions yesterday.  Commodity Prices Rise **********Mr. Sullivan also said that soaring commodity prices were raising fears of another round of inflation, the bane of investors in fixed-income securities. **********Yesterday the closely watched Commodity Research Bureau index of futures prices, which covers 21 basic food and industrial raw materials, jumped 1.86 points, to 246.11, on a 1967 base of 100.

Under Britain's unwritten constitution, the sovereign does not comment on matters of political controversy. Other members of the royal family, although not bound by the constitution, usually accepted this restraint voluntarily. But Prince Charles, as he approaches his 40th birthday next November, has grown increasingly defiant of the tradition of royal detachment and increasingly outspoken, particularly on the issues of architecture and inner-city redevelopment. **********Conservative legislators have been saying privately for some time that the Prince, with his advocacy of restraints on developers and of a caring, interventionist government role in urban policy, was on a collision course with Mrs. Thatcher and her free-market ideas. Prince Charles has also been critical of government environmental policy on matters like pollution of the North Sea. **********Mr. Tebbit is the first major politician to bring these conflicts into the open. Asked if the Prince's concern for the poor and unemployed was irritating to Conservative ministers, he said: ''Well, they're matters about which we are all greatly concerned, but I have to say I suppose the Prince of Wales naturally feels extra sympathy toward those who've got no job, because in a way he's got no job and he's prohibited from having a job until he inherits the throne.'' **********Asked if it might be dangerous for a member of the royal family to voice opinions, he said: ''I think there could be if he went too far. As I say, if he advocated a Socialist solution, a Labor Party solution, then that would begin to get dangerous. But I think he's a sensible young man. Young man. Here we are, you see, we're talking about him as though he were a very young man, and he's 40, and yet he's not been able to take responsibility and authority for anything, and I think that's really his problem.'' **********Politicians and commentators were split on whether Mr. Tebbit was putting a shot across the Prince's bow on Mrs. Thatcher's behalf.

The result is that reserves against possible losses earmarked for the developing-country debt stands at about 25 percent of the total, compared with 50 percent at many regional banks. Signal to Investors **********Some analysts see the higher level of reserves at the regional banks as a form of muscle flexing, a signal to investors that they can stand the big hits against their earnings and shareholders' equity. **********But yesterday's reports showed that some of the nation's strongest and best capitalized banks are also reluctant, or see no reason, to increase their reserves beyond the levels established in the second quarter. Those additions to reserves caused most of the biggest banks to report losses for the full year. **********J.P. Morgan & Company, widely recognized as the strongest and most profitable of the nation's major banks, for example, did not increase its reserves for third-world loans in the fourth quarter despite such moves by some large non-New York banks. These included the Bank of Boston, the Security Pacific Corporation of Los Angeles, Wells Fargo & Company of San Francisco and the two biggest Chicago banking companies, the First Chicago Corporation and the Continental Illinois Corporation. **********''We think that our reserve level is appropriate,'' said a Morgan spokesman. **********While some bankers and analysts see the failure to increase reserves as a sign of financial weakness, others see it as a realistic approach by banks that are firmly committed to the international arena, including to Latin America. **********Citicorp, for example, which led the move to increase reserves agains third-world loans last June, said yesterday that it ''has a long-term commitment to its international business.'' It added that its ''current posture is both adequate and appropriate given the continued developments in the area.'' **********James J. McDermott Jr., senior vice president of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, a securities firm that specializes in bank stocks, said, ''The New York response to the regional increases in their reserves has been to charge down or swap out of their third-world loans.'' **********It is possible that one New York banking company, the Bankers Trust New York Corporation, which is expected to report its earnings today, will break ranks and substantially increase its reserves.  Citicorp **********Citicorp reported fourth-quarter net income of $642 million, or $1.89 a share, up from $306 million, or $1.01 a share, in the comparable period of 1986. But the sharp rise was attributed largely to a $469 million pre-tax gain from the sale of a condominium interest in Citicorp's headquarter buildings in mid-town Manhattan. **********For the year, Citicorp reported a loss of $1.138 billion, compared with net income of $1.058 million, or $3.57 a share, in 1986. The 1987 loss was the result of the bank's decision in the second quarter to set aside $3 billion in reserves against its loans to third-world countries. When he announced the decision to establish the reserve against the developing-country loans, John S. Reed, Citicorp's chairman, said that the loss would be offset in part by gains from sales of assets, such as that from the sale of parts of its headquarters during the fourth quarter. **********The bank said that if it had not established the $3 billion reserve and had not made special sales of assets related to that decision, Citicorp would have earned $1.157 billion in 1987. **********Like other large banks, Citicorp's earnings were hurt by Brazil's failure to pay interest on its loans during the year, which Citicorp said reduced its net income by $200 million. **********Over all, however, analysts said that at first glance Citicorp seemed to have had a good fourth quarter. ''Operating earnings were stronger than expected,'' said Lawrence W. Cohn, bank-stock analyst for Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner & Smith. Mr. Cohn said there were signs that quality of Citicorp's loans had improved.  Chase **********The Chase Manhattan Corporation, corporate parent of the Chase Manhattan Bank, yesterday reported net income of $154 million for the fourth quarter, down 2.5 percent from the $158 million reported for the fourth quarter of 1986. Per-share earnings dropped to $1.66 from $1.79. **********The latest quarter's earnings were bolstered by an after-tax gain of $39 million as the result of the sale of real estate in Japan. Largely offsetting that was a reduction in after-tax net income by $31 million ($55 million before taxes) as a result of the failures of Brazil and Ecuador to pay interest on their loans through much of 1987. **********For the full year, Chase reported a net loss of $895 million, as a result of its decision in the second quarter to add $1.6 billion to the loan-loss reserve to cover possible losses on loans to Latin American countries. **********Chase said that, excluding the special reserve, and the related tax benefits, it would have had $555 million in net income in 1987, or $6.03 per share, down $30 million, or 5.1 percent, from the $585 million earned in 1986. Per-share income that year was $6.63. The decline was more than accounted for by the missed payments by Brazil and Ecuador, which the banking company said cost it $126 million after tax. **********The company added $130 million to the loan loss reserve in the fourth quarter, and wrote off $128 million in loans against it.  J. P. Morgan **********Net income at J. P. Morgan & Company, the holding company of the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, rose 17.9 percent in the fourth quarter, to $224.1 million, from $190.1 million in the comparable period of 1986. On a per-share basis, Morgan's net income climbed to $1.21, from $1.02. **********For the entire year, Morgan's net income plunged 90.4 percent, to $83.3 million, from $872.5 million in 1986. Per-share earnings dropped to 39 cents, from $4.74. The decline was attributed to an $875 million addition to reserves for loan losses that was made in the second quarter, mainly because of the company's loans to financially troubled third-world countries. **********Like other large banks, Morgan's traditional business of taking in deposits and making loans became less important to its earnings. Indeed, for the first time, its net-interest income, at $386.9 million, dropped below its non-interest operating income, at $387.4 million, even before the $30 million provision to the loan-loss reserve, which reduced interest income by that amount. **********An important element in Morgan's fourth-quarter earnings strength was a record $89.1 million pretax profit in foreign-exchange trading activities, up from $53.2 million in the 1986 period. Income from its trust and agency activities climbed sharply in the fourth quarter, to $133.5 million on a pre-tax basis, from $91.1 million. Other operating income, mainly fees and commissions, including those from Morgan's growing corporate-finance activities, rose to $149.6 million, from $129.8 million in the fourth quarter of 1986.  Manufacturers Hanover **********As the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation announced last week, its fourth-quarter net income dropped to $22.7 million, or 18 cents a share, from $75.4 million, or $1.57 a share, in the comparable period of 1987. The reduction was attributed to special charges of $117 million, of which $82 million was related to such ''restructuring'' costs as dismissing 2,500 employees, and closing some businesses and curtailing others. The bank said it expected these moves to increase earnings by $95 million a year this year and in the future. **********Yesterday's release presented the earnings in far greater detail. It showed, among other things, that the company's fourth-quarter income was substantially bolstered by one-time factors that amounted to $37.6 million after taxes. **********These included a gain of $23.5 million on the sale of a 20 percent interest in Banco Manufacturers Hanover (Portugal), and a gain of $14.1 million from the sale of aircraft previously on lease to corporate customers. **********As at other major banks, foreign-exchange trading revenues rose sharply, to $26.4 million, from $4.6 million in the fourth quarter of 1986. Bond-trading profits and commissions rose to $28.4 million from $17.2 million. **********For the full year, Manufacturers Hanover reported a loss of $1.14 billion. In 1986, the company earned $377.2 million, or $7.99 a share.  Wells Fargo **********Wells Fargo & Company announced yesterday that its fourth- quarter earnings rose 42 percent, to $111.2 million, or $1.95 a share, from $78.4 million, or $1.36 a share, in the period a year ago. The results include a special addition of $39 million to the allowance for losses in loans to developing countries. **********However, the San Francisco-based bank said that its net income for the full year of 1987 fell 81 percent, to $50.8 million, or 52 cents a share, from $273.5 million, or $5.03 a share, in the previous year. The decline reflected the special additions, Wells Fargo said.  Security Pacific **********The Security Pacific Corporation reported yesterday a fourth-quarter loss of $39.4 million, compared with net income of $124.3 million, or $1.15 a share, for the period a year ago. The results include a $350 million loan-loss provision for developing-countries' debt. **********The bank holding company, based in Los Angeles, said that its earnings declined 97 percent for last year, to $15.7 million, or 1 cent a share, from $455.1 million, or $4.23 a share, in 1986. The 1987 results include a total of $908 million in additional loss provisions for loans for debt to developing countries.  First Republicbank **********The First Republicbank Corporation said it lost $347.8 million in the fourth quarter, mainly because of the unabating decline in Texas real-estate values. In the same period a year ago, the bank-holding company earned $9.1 million, or 26 cents a share For the year, First Republicbank lost $656.8 million, the biggest annual loss ever posted by a Texas banking institution, compared with a profit of $54 million in 1986.  Mellon **********Mellon Bank, the Pittsburgh bank whose longstanding loan problems led to a management shake-up last year, said it lost $234 million in the fourth-quarter, compared with net income of $15 million, or 42 cents a share, in the 1986 period. **********The loss reflected some restructuring costs, as well as the bank's decision to increase its provision for credit losses. The bank is saddled with not only problem third-world loans, but also sour energy and agricultural loans. **********For 1987, the company posted a loss of $844 million, compared with a profit of $183 million, or $6.20 a share in 1986. **********The company said its provision for loan losses in the fourth quarter was $308 million, compared with $99 million in the quarter a year earlier."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/27/business/advertising-people.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1988-01-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 34, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; People", "print_headline": "Advertising; People", "body_text": " *********** Marilyn Fisher, director of broadcast services, has been promoted to senior vice president at Lowe Marschalk."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/10/world/excerpts-from-report-on-waldheim.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-02-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 937, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Text", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Excerpts From Report on Waldheim", "print_headline": "Excerpts From Report on Waldheim", "body_text": " **********Following are excerpts from the conclusions to a report, made public today, by a commission of historians on President Kurt Waldheim's wartime record, as translated by The Associated Press from the German: **********The individual sections of the commission's report deal with Waldheim's staff activities in Yugoslavia and Greece . . . . **********As a second lieutenant in West Bosnia, Waldheim found himself in direct proximity to criminal actions, especially in Banja Luka, where he must have had knowledge of the way the 1C Unit worked there. **********. . . As a first lieutenant in Athens, Waldheim knew about the practice of deporting Italian prisoners - internees - to Germany in September 1943, that is, at a time when between the German Reich and the Kingdom of Italy there was no declared state of war. **********. . . Altogether a picture emerges of a varying proximity, varying with the different posts held, to measures and commands incriminating under military law. **********With these statements the question of Waldheim's guilty conduct in the war is not finally answered.  Human-Rights Violations **********In general a certain guilt could arise just from knowing about the violations of human rights in the place where a person was stationed, if the person concerned - out of lack of strength or courage - violated his human duty to take steps against injustice. Such measures, whose injustice must have been and indeed was recognized, were in particular the great number of excessive reprisals, the extermination or deportation of large sections of population, in particular the merciless deportation of all Jewish groups, and also the ''special treatment,'' i.e. the execution of Allied commando troops and the sending of women, children and old men to concentration camps. **********More grave than the idle acceptance of such violations of human rights was the assistance in those cases in which various grades of participation could be established: such existed, for example, in the consultative support of repressive measures, in the form of reports about the enemy camp which were connected to ''purges.'' **********In looking at the question of how much one must speak of Waldheim's joint guilt in war crimes, one should proceed from the fact established several times in the report that in his staff functions in the Balkans, despite his low rank, he was much more than just a second-rank ''desk officer.'' Even though, as a subordinate in staff positions he had no executive powers, he was excellently informed about the events of the war thanks to his education, his knowledge and as a result of the glimpses which he gained as a translator in decisive events of the command, and especially from his activity in the central intelligence service of his army group, and his physical proximity to the events.  Knowledge of Situation **********From a considerable number of situation reports and war diary entries, which he either wrote himself or which crossed his desk, and especially in connection with the discussion of those situation reports which he many times presented in high-level meetings in his army group, he obtained a deep and comprehensive insight into the situation on the fronts and in the Balkans. **********Even if his personal influence on the decision procedure of the supreme command has been somewhat exaggerated by his opponents and on the other hand far too belittled by his defenders, Waldheim was often present in these important meetings, assisted in them and was therefore one of the staff members who was especially well informed. Thus his general insights were comprehensive. They related not only to tactical, strategic and administrative orders, but in some cases also included actions and measures which contradicted military law and the principles of humanity. **********The commission made an effort to understand Waldheim's conduct in the situation in which he had to fulfill his military service . . . . Thereby, there were a series of decisive factors to consider: **********Until very recently, Waldheim repeatedly referred to the fact that he was bound during his military time as a soldier to the command of the unlimited fulfillment of military duty. Independent of the content of an order, he saw in the fulfillment of an order a binding principle to which he had to submit. **********The commission could not follow this justification in the cases named. Legal practice in postwar years about the war, in particular in the Nuremberg trials, has decisively and on several occasions established that even in war a military command does not have unlimited validity. **********. . . Whoever carried out commands against the law or helped in their execution violated generally valid norms of law even in the time of World War II, and therefore made himself jointly responsible for the injustice. **********. . . On the credit side, Waldheim had only extremely modest possibilities for resisting the injustice . . . For a young staff member, who had no power of command on the army group level, the practical possibilities of opposing action were very slight and in all probability could scarcely have led to a tangible result. **********. . . Such steps on Waldheim's part have not become known. **********. . . The document proves, moreover, one more time that Waldheim was in the picture about reprisals. **********. . . In many points, Waldheim's presentation of his military past is not in harmony with the results of the work of the commission. He tried to let his military past pass into oblivion and, as soon as this was no longer possible, to make it harmless."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/06/business/icahn-linked-to-talks-on-a-texaco-bid.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Cole", "pub_date": "1988-12-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 767, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Icahn Linked To Talks on A Texaco Bid", "print_headline": "Icahn Linked To Talks on A Texaco Bid", "body_text": " **********Oil industry experts said yesterday that Carl C. Icahn, chairman of Trans World Airlines, might become part of a major new takeover battle for Texacok Inc. **********The experts, who declined to be identified, said Mr. Icahn and another party were involved in early talks on a deal. If a new takeover were tried, they said, stockholders could be offered at least $60 a share, or close to $15 billion, for the company, the nation's third-largest oil producer. **********The deal under discussion would eventually give Mr. Icahn the opportunity to sell his 14.8 percent stake in Texaco, according to executives familiar with the discussions. Mr. Icahn, one of the nation's best-known corporate raiders, owns about 36 million Texaco shares, bought at a cost of $34 apiece, or $1.2 billion. If he collected $60, he would show a profit of $936 million. **********''I don't believe it,'' an executive close to Texaco remarked. ''But it sounds like Christmas for Icahn.'' **********Wall Street professionals also said they found such a deal difficult to believe. Nevertheless, Texaco stock advanced 75 cents, to $47.75, with more than 880,000 shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Accumulation of Texaco Stock **********USA Today reported yesterday that Mr. Icahn had been approached by an unidentified party interested in buying his Texaco stake. The newspaper also said that someone, possibly the same party, was accumulating Texaco stock. **********Mr. Icahn and Texaco both declined comment on the report, but officials close to Texaco said they understood that no one had yet approached the company about anything dealing with such a project. **********Last May, Mr. Icahn offered to pay Texaco shareholders $60 a share for the 85.2 percent that he does not own. Texaco attacked the bid as part of a plan to put pressure on management and questioned whether he could finance the deal. **********To show good faith, Mr. Icahn offered to pay stockholders a $300 million penalty if he failed to raise the financing. But a month later he conceded defeat in a proxy fight to oust Texaco's top management after Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, which he thought would back him, voted instead for Texaco. **********As currently envisioned in what is thought to be a fluid situation, Mr. Icahn would retain his 14.8 percent Texaco block while his proposed partner would build a separate block approaching 8 or 9 percent. The two, consequently, would own close to 23 or 24 percent of Texaco's shares. **********Mr. Icahn's proposed partner is believed to have about 3 or 4 percent of Texaco at this point, possibly meaning that he would have to get more from stockholders or in the open market. **********Part of the plan apparently provides for Mr. Icahn's partner to sell both Texaco's 50 percent interest in the Caltex Pacific Corporation, owned jointly with the Chevron Corporation, and its 78 percent interest in Texaco Canada. **********Texaco is currently trying to sell its Canadian interests, valued by John S. Herold Inc., the oil appraisers, at $3.5 billion. Texaco has said that it is not interested in selling Caltex, valued on Wall Street for at least as much, but Mr. Icahn's partner is said to be thinking of selling it, too, possibly to a foreign oil company. **********As a result, an estimated $7 billion of the $15 billion cost would come from the sale of two big Texaco divisions, thus meaning that the roughly $8 billion balance would have to come from the partner and outside lenders. **********Experts familiar with the project said that about $2 billion would come from the partner, leaving only $6 billion to be raised. They said most of that would possibly come from a leveraged buyout fund. **********All of the logical players interested in Texaco have been eliminated for one reason or another. T. Boone Pickens, who showed interest earlier, is considering running for governor of Texas next year. Kohlberg, Kravis, the leveraged buyout firm, is considered a friend of Texaco. Alan Bond, the Australian executive, appears to be interested in Texaco Canada but is thought to be more interested in liquidating his assets than acquiring more. **********Texaco has already said that it hoped to sell $5 billion in assets and then distribute $1.7 billion of the total in 1989 through a share buyback or other shareholder distribution."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/28/world/soviets-press-offer-on-disputed-radar.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Lewis", "pub_date": "1988-09-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 732, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Soviets Press Offer on Disputed Radar", "print_headline": "Soviets Press Offer on Disputed Radar", "body_text": " **********The Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, today enlarged on an offer by Moscow to turn a disputed Soviet radar into an international space research center by inviting the United States to do likewise with two American military radar stations. **********Mr. Shevardnadze told the General Assembly that the United States should transfer American radars in Greenland and Britain to a new international space organization so that they could not be used as early-warning elements in a defensive system against missiles. **********The Reagan Administration had no immediate comment. The White House seemed likely to reject the proposal to alter the role of its two radars, just as it turned down Moscow's earlier offer to turn the Soviet radar, at Krasnoyarsk in Siberia, into a reserch center. **********In his address to the General Assembly, Mr. Shevardnadze asked for a special meeting of the five permanent Security Council members to discuss what he said were violations of the Geneva peace accords on Afghanistan, and he called for the United Nations to play a greater role in promoting peace, disarmament and the environment. Stronger Security Council **********He called for a strengthening of the Security Council, for new curbs on the spread of missile technology and sales of conventional arms, and for the creation of a monitoring and verification agency to oversee compliance with disarmament accords. He also called for summit-level meetings to discuss world environment questions. **********The Foreign Minister hinted after his speech that Moscow might slow the withdrawal of its forces from Afghanistan because of what it considers violations of the Geneva peace accords. **********He told reporters that the Soviet Union had ''completed the first stage'' of its withdrawal by removing half of its soldiers from Afghanistan by Aug. 15, as provided for in those accords, but had ''not yet begun the second stage.'' **********Asked whether the Soviet Union would complete its military evacuation by Feb. 15, as foreseen in the agreement, the Foreign Minister said: ''We'll wait and see. There have been violations of the agreement.'' Offer by Gorbachev **********Mr. Shevardnadze's call for the United States to put two of its radars under international control follows an offer this month by Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, to adapt the disputed Soviet radar in Siberia for peaceful space research and to hand it over to an international space organization that Moscow wants to set up. **********The Reagan Administration contends that the Krasnoyarsk radar violates the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty because it is not on the periphery of the Soviet Union. It has rejected the Soviet offer to devote the radar to international research and it insists that the radar be dismantled. **********Mr. Shevardnadze did not condition the Soviet offer to put the Krasnoyarsk radar under international control on an American agreement to hand over its two radars to the proposed space organization. The radars are the Thule station in Greenland and another radar at Fylingdales Moors, on the Yorkshire coast in northeast Britain. **********After reiterating the Soviet offer on the Krasnoyarsk radar, the Foreign Minister said the Soviet Union ''would like to call upon the Government of the U.S. to follow that example and thus put to rest our concern with respect to U.S. radars in Greenland and Britain.'' Afghan 'Violations' **********On Afghanistan, Mr. Shevardnadze said the Geneva accords were followed by ''a nonstop production line of violations.'' He said those included Pakistan's continuing supply of weapons and training to the Afghan guerrillas. **********The Foreign Minister said the permanent members of the Security Council - Britain, the Soviet Union, France, China and the United States - should meet with the Secretary General and representatives of Pakistan and the Afghan government to review compliance with the accords. **********Those accords call for an end to outside interference in Afghan affairs. But the Soviet Union asserts the right to continue military supplies under its existing agreements with what it regards as the rightful Government of Afghanistan.

He gave the company 90 days to return the equipment to the plant. **********The company transferred shipping and packing operations from Duluth to Orangeburg last year. **********Officials of the union representing Diamond workers applauded the ruling.

The Communist authorities' reaction has been to ask, ''But is it art?'' **********The group's leader, a 35-year-old former art student named Waldemar Fydrych, who draws inspiration from Dadaist theory and Buddhist writing, insists it is. But he also says it is a mirror, held up to illuminate the foibles, blemishes and absurdities of Communist society. **********The authorities were at a loss for a reaction when Orange Alternative marked the 70th anniversary of the Russian Revolution last fall by staging a mock battle between cardboard cruisers, appropriately named Potemkin and Aurora, in the Swidnicka pedestrian area of central Wroclaw. A Stage Battle on the Front **********When the ships were gone, youths wearing Russian cavalry caps and calling themselves Budyonny's Riders, for the Bolshevik marshal, raced to the scene on wooden hobby horses. The police, baffled by the subtle mockery, arrested 150. Budyonny commanded the First Cavalry Army from 1919 to 1924 and took part in the failed campaign in 1920 in which the Poles drove back the Russians. **********On March 8, to mark International Women's Day, members of Orange Alternative paraded with large sandwich boards resembling sanitary pads, a scarce commodity in Poland. The signs bore the words: ''In the Spirit of Peace. Pershings, No. Sanitary Pads, Yes.'' **********The authorities arrested Mr. Fydrych, who was freed only after dozens of Polish artists and intellectuals, including the film director Andrzej Wajda, appealed for his release. **********A few days ago Orange Alternative marked Children's Day, another Communist fete, by masquerading as dwarfs and distributing more than 2,000 hand-sewn dwarf caps to shoppers. The authorities, evidently testing a new tactic, did not interfere. **********In a drab apartment on the edge of town, Mr. Fydrych's closest lieutenants, workers and students in their teens and 20's, wearing faded jeans and worn sweatshirts, surrounded the leader they fondly call ''the major.'' (When Mr. Fydrych reported for induction in the 1970's he wore the uniform of a major in the 13th Uhlan Regiment, a Polish unit with strong traditions.) Why Dwarfs? **********Sipping tea, the lanky and boyish-looking Mr. Fydrych recalled his early fascination with the symbolism of dwarfs. As an art student in the 1970's, he saw Wroclaw caught up in the enthusiasm of the Solidarity movement, which came to symbolize for many Poles the possibility of change. **********When the Solidarity labor organization was crushed by martial law in 1981, blotches of paint on walls and houses covered Solidarity graffiti. **********''I was caught by the spots on the walls,'' Mr. Fydrych said. ''I am an art historian, and I was looking at those blotches of paint. Some were geometrical, just forms and shapes, but all possessed a plastic quality. The whole of Poland was covered with spots, and I began, as I looked, to see dwarfs in those spots.'' **********''This was probably the most adequate form I knew to show my attitude toward the grotesque affair that martial law was,'' he added. Loosely paraphrasing the Communist theoretician, he said, ''After all, it was Marx who said that the last phase in every historical development is comedy.'' **********Mr. Fydrych's dwarf symbolism has made a box-office hit of a current film, ''Kingsajz,'' by the director Juliusz Machulski. The film describes a gnome kingdom in which evil leaders repress the diminutive population. A Bad Review From the Party **********Not everyone is laughing. At the Wroclaw Communist Party headquarters, the propaganda chief, Stanislaw Pelczar, sees the Orange Alternative as a handmaiden of the remnant of Solidarity that is vigorous in the region, organizing workers and printing underground literature. **********''Their aim is to provoke,'' he said, ''and they view themselves as a service organization for Solidarity.'' **********To the people who help Mr. Fydrych stage the street happenings, he is a radical thinker, a bit of an artist and philosopher, and a gadfly who can make police chiefs quake. Local artists say he is brilliant in organizing the happenings amid police harassment. **********''We have great respect for them,'' Andrzej Jackiewicz, a local painter, said of Orange Alternative. ''Their idea is to come out into the world, to show the world its most hidden corners.'' **********In May the Roman Catholic Church opened a Wroclaw art gallery under its auspices to a display of Orange Alternative art, which included works like a dozen or so old television sets in a heap of ashes. **********''Kurt Vonnegut used to say his novels reflected life in a kind of crazy mirror,'' Mr. Fydrych said. ''Here you have a situation where the mirror need not be very crazy.'' **********''Take the Elwro factory here,'' he went on, discussing a local computer plant. ''Not long ago they invited some Chinese, high Communist functionaries, so the Government's unions told the workers to come in on their day off, to impress the visitors. Then, to make the thing more beautiful, they set up mock-ups of computers, because they do not produce enough of the real thing.'' The Origin of Orange **********''You can only describe this in artistic categories,'' he said. **********Mr. Fydrych first gave the name Orange Alternative to a counterculture newspaper he edited in the early 1980's.

Jordan, the president and chief executive of the nation's eighth-largest utility, Houston Industries Inc., is pushing into new areas with faster growth potential. **********Last week, the company made its biggest move yet when it agreed to buy the United States cable-television systems of Rogers Communications Inc. for $1.27 billion. The price for the system, which has about 525,000 subscribers, equals about $2,500 a subscriber, higher than most recent deals. The purchase bolsters Houston's position in the cable industry, since it is already co-owner of Paragon Communications, a Denver system with 670,000 subscribers. **********While utility industry analysts endorse the company's efforts to broaden its operations, some contend that Mr. Jordan is paying too much at a time when cable prices are soaring. **********An analyst in New York at Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc., Fulton S. Holmes, said the company's non-utility units had contributed little to earnings during the last two years. In 1987, 94 percent of its $435 million in earnings came from its electric utility, the Houston Lighting and Power Company. Its non-utility operations include energy properties, a coal distributor, a financial concern, a maker of lighting products, and Paragon, which is half owned by Time Inc. The cable unit has had losses of $17 million since it was acquired in 1986 for close to $500 million. **********Some Texas consumer groups also oppose the deal, saying the company should not make purchases while planning to seek an increase in electricity rates. ''Using earnings to lower rates is not an option,'' a company spokeswoman said in response, adding that regulations permitted utilities to earn a fair rate of return. **********Mr. Jordan was not available for comment. The 55-year-old Corpus Christi, Tex., native has headed Houston Industries since 1977. He joined the company as a power consultant in 1956, two years after receiving an industrial management degree from the University of Texas. In 1969 he received a degree from the South Texas College of Law.

Indeed, they say that because of a combination of abundant funds at lending institutions and a sharp drop in the demand for housing, consumers should now be able to find some of the best mortgage deals in years. **********Moreover, just last week Freddie Mac said it would begin making a secondary market for a popular new kind of adjustable-rate mortgage that allows the home buyer to convert to a fixed-rate loan. Fannie Mae had already made a similar announcement. The move should make these convertible mortgages more available. **********The layoffs will have ''no impact at all'' on the availability of mortgages, said Len N. Druger, vice chairman of Citicorp Mortgage Inc., the nation's largest mortgage lender and a Citicorp subsidiary. **********The easiest way to understand how the secondary market for residential mortgages fits into the total housing finance picture is to begin with a potential home buyer searching for a loan. The purchaser has the choice of applying to a thrift institution; a commercial bank; a mortgage banking concern, such as Citicorp Mortgage, or another source such as a credit union, state housing agency or life insurance company. **********After the consumer gets the mortgage and closes on the house, the lender either keeps the loan in its own portfolio or combines it with similar mortgages and sells the package of loans to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. The cash the lender gets from these two quasi-government corporations enables it to make more home loans. Because Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac do their own borrowing at lower rates than private lenders, consumers benefit from slightly lower rates as well. **********Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac repackage most of the loans into securities - called mortgage-backed securities - that can be bought or sold just as easily as stock in any blue-chip company. **********In 1986, about 70 percent of all residential mortgages were sold in the secondary market, but that fell to only about 30 percent in 1987, said Leland C. Brendsel, president of Freddie Mac. The major reason for the decline is that most of the new mortgages and refinancings in 1986 were fixed- rate, while last year most were adjustable-rate mortgages (or ARM's), and lenders usually retain ARM's in their portfolios. ''At least three-quarters of all fixed-rate home loans are sold in the secondary market, whereas less than 20 percent of all ARM's are sold,'' Mr. Brendsel said. **********Lenders want to hold on to ARM's because they provide protection from fluctuations in interest rates. Conventional mortgages provide no such protection. If rates rise, lenders are stuck with low-yielding loans at a time when they must pay higher rates to attract new deposits. But pension funds and life insurance companies, the big buyers of mortgage-backed securities in the secondary market, are not as sensitive to short-term fluctuations as banks and other lenders are. **********Even though Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac together buy more than $200 billion worth of home mortgages a year, there are limits on how much they can underwrite. The biggest loan they can buy, under current Congressional guidelines, is $168,700; the average size of the loans they purchased in 1986 was about $62,000. While the Government-mandated ceiling may be more than adequate to cover the size of loans needed to finance a home in many parts of the country, it falls short in New York and some other metropolitan areas. **********That's where investment bankers come in. During the last few years, such firms as Citicorp, Merrill Lynch, Salomon Brothers and Goldman Sachs have created a secondary market in the private sector for ''jumbo loans'' above the Government limit by repackaging and selling mortgage-backed securities of their own. ''Mortgages of $168,700 to $500,000 - that's what's being securitized by the private secondary market,'' said Mr. Druger of Citicorp Mortgage. **********Just as lenders can sell a mortgage loan in the secondary market, so too can they sell the ''servicing'' of that loan, or the administrative task of collecting monthly payments from the borrower and remitting property taxes and other payments from escrow funds to the appropriate authorities. Neither Fannie Mae nor Freddie Mac services mortgages, so lenders either sell that job to private-sector companies such as Citicorp Mortgage or they keep it themselves and earn a fee if they have already sold the mortgage. **********Consumers typically have no reason to know if their mortgages have been sold in the secondary market because such sales have no impact on the day-to-day handling of their loans. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac do require, however, that consumers be informed of the sale if they ask. **********By contrast, consumers have a great interest in knowing whether the servicing of their loans has been sold since they would need to send their checks to a new organization or location. Sometimes the transition is bumpy. **********THE most common problem is that the borrower is not told of the change. The borrower may only learn of it when he or she receives warnings of delinquency despite having made timely payments to the original lender, said Warren Lasko, executive vice president of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America. A second common problem is that the servicing firm does not make necessary tax payments. **********''Notices may be sent out late, or not at all, and borrowers may not be given a complete explanation'' of the new procedures, Mr. Lasko said. **********The association issued servicing guidelines in response to a rising tide of complaints a few years ago, when huge numbers of new mortgages and refinancings were being issued. **********Among other things, the guidelines provide that the old servicer of the loan inform borrowers of the transfer; that the new servicer give borrowers clear and timely notice of the new place where payments are to be made, and that the new servicer maintain a toll-free number or one location where consumers can make complaints. **********''It's still an issue,'' said Mr. Lasko, but the servicers ''have gotten much better.'' If you have a problem that is not resolved after talking with the servicing company, contact your state legislator, he suggested. He noted that many states have taken an interest in this area, and that lenders are eager to forestall any new regulation. If a legislator questions them about the servicing of a loan, he said, ''any lender will stand up and salute.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/22/world/in-seoul-show-and-tell-on-chun-rule.html": {"writer_name": "Seth Mydans", "pub_date": "1988-11-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 889, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "In Seoul, Show and Tell on Chun Rule", "print_headline": "In Seoul, Show and Tell on Chun Rule", "body_text": " **********''You, as a witness to history, have the obligation to tell only the truth,'' a questioner told a former official as he took his seat, hands trembling visibly, at a televised parliamentary hearing.

Justice must be seen to have been done without upsetting the tenuous balance of current politics. **********But as the hearings continue, Mr. Chun's fate has become only one element in a broader drama. **********''The most important issue at this stage for Korea is, I think, cleaning up the past,'' said Lee Shin Bum, an opposition member of Parliament who will testify this week about his own imprisonment by the Chun Government. **********''It is like all the dirt has been piled up and needs to be cleaned away before you can talk about the future in any real sense,'' he said. ''The hearings are having a revolutionary impact on the people.'' First Round of Hearings **********The first round of hearings, earlier this month, explored corruption and an apparent plan by Mr. Chun to perpetuate himself in power after formal retirement through the use of a publicly funded political institute. **********Most gripping at those sessions was the unrepentent appearance of the former chief of Korea's security services, Chang Se Dong, a man whose name was familiar to all Koreans but whose face they had rarely seen. **********Last week, and again later this week, the hearings are examining one of the key elements of Mr. Chun's rule, the suppression of a popular uprising in 1980 at Kwangju at which hundreds of protesters were killed. **********Although Mr. Chun's men, including the former Defense Minister, Choo Young Bok, denied it, much of the testimony indicated that the killings may have been a premeditated attempt to consolidate political power for the ruling military group. **********''It was a coup,'' a young Korean journalist said.

With the scanner and Omnipage, the deposition is fed into the computer in much the same manner as copies are made on a copying machine - lift the lid, place the paper face down on the scanning bed, adjust the lightness and darkness settings if necessary and hit the button. The scanner creates an electronic image of the page that is stored in the computer's memory. Using the word processing software's search functions, the lawyer can bring each pertinent reference to the computer screen at the touch of a button. The reference can be clipped and pasted electronically into another document and printed in seconds. Should the lawyer or the client want it boldfaced and expanded to 24-point type, that's no problem. **********Omnipage will also be of interest to companies that consume vast quantities of paper, like insurance companies, or any involved with forms processing or text storage. It has the potential to capture unimaginable volumes of what Lawrence G. Miller of Caere calls ''economically disenfranchised information'' - text that is currently uneconomical to type into the computer. **********The process starts with the scanner, which recognizes patterns of light and dark and converts these patterns into a screen image, or map, of black and white dots, known as bits. A page of these dots can be sent over telephone lines and reconstructed at the other end. That is the essense of facsimile machines. The technology cannot, however, distinguish between text and graphics. **********OMNIPAGE works with the scanner to analyze the patterns of light and dark dots, recognizing some patterns as letters, some as numbers and some as graphic images. That is an astonishing feat, considering the different type styles, type sizes and type faces used in publishing. Some optical character readers, known as O.C.R.'s, can read a limited number of fonts, sometimes only one. One O.C.R. may read standard typewriter text, perhaps 10-point Courier from an I.B.M. Selectric, but if the document is created on any other machine the user is out of luck. Multi-column documents? Forget it. The document winds up as a maelstrom of garbage electronic characters that are useless to the computer operator. **********Using advanced character recognition algorithms, Omnipage can read virtually any font, including headlines up to an inch tall, photo captions and body text. In a demonstration at the Macworld exposition, a page from a magazine was selected at random, placed on the Apple Scanner and converted to a text file by Omnipage with 100 percent accuracy. In subsequent tests it showed a consistent accuracy of at least 95 percent. It even sorted out a welter of dollar signs, S's and 5's in a single financial document and preserved the data in columns that could be transferred directly to a spreadsheet. **********The goal of Omnipage's developers was for their product to be able to take any document, pump it through any scanner - Omnipage currently supports the Apple Scanner, the Hewlett-Packard Scanjet and the Canon IX12 - and allow the document to be edited on powerful personal computers. These include PC's or PS/2's with 80386 chips and at least four megabytes of memory, or similarly configured Macintosh's. (The PC version of Omnipage will be available next month as a software and plug-in board combination, selling for $1,995.) **********TO date, this kind of scanning capability has been available only on advanced document processors like those made by the Palantir Corporation of Santa Clara, Calif., and Kurzweil Computer Products Inc., of Cambridge, Mass. These are many times the price of Omnipage and the Apple Scanner. (To be fair, both Palantir and Kurzweil produce industrial-strength systems, sold with powerful work station computers that improve speed and resolution.) Both companies are reported to be working on lower-cost PC versions that will be ready in coming months.) Caere is a private company founded in 1973 and until this month it was little known in the PC world. That is certain to change, especially as it links its fortune to such major companies as Apple."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/26/world/a-plane-crash-in-peru-kills-12-in-the-andes.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-10-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 169, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Plane Crash in Peru Kills 12 in the Andes", "print_headline": "A Plane Crash in Peru Kills 12 in the Andes", "body_text": " **********A state-owned airliner carrying 65 passengers and a crew of 4 crashed today high in the Andes, killing 12 people, including one American, and injuring 56, airline officials said.

London's streets are right at capacity, but no plans exist to build major new routes. There is no room left, the department says. **********''London has been full since the Romans,'' said Peter Bottomley, the Government's Minister for Roads and Traffic. ''It was full during the time of Elizabeth I. I always thought that the Pilgrim Fathers left to escape the traffic. London was jammed 100 years ago when the Underground was being built; it was the reason why the Underground was built. It was jammed between the wars, and it's full now.'' **********''What's changed,'' he said, ''is that we've got intelligent traffic lights, which give our existing roads 20 percent more capacity.'' **********Does that sound like a clever reason for not building any new roads? It is. ''I started saying five months ago that traffic in London moves faster than in any other city in the world,'' Mr. Bottomley said. ''I have no idea whether it's true.'' **********''We've got proposals for putting existing roads below ground, to improve things for the thousands of households living on the busiest routes who are crucified every day by the traffic,'' Mr. Bottomley continued, ''But there hasn't been much new road building in London, and there won't be.'' **********The last major divided highway, the 110-mile M25 beltway ringing Greater London, has created as much new traffic as it has diverted from existing roads, and it is generally regarded as a congested nightmare. It was designed to handle up to 75,000 vehicles a day, but most sections have been clogged with more than that ever since they opened several years ago. **********Washington bars single-passenger cars from some of its highways during rush hours, and some European cities either ban all vehicles from the center of town, or let them in only on alternate days to reduce congestion. Not London. **********''Traffic volume is self-leveling,'' Mr. Bottomley said. And Government show that just about as many vehicles, about 100,000 an hour, came into London in the morning rush in 1972 as did last year, and that rapid transit and rail commuting has increased sharply since 1982. **********This may simply prove that some London drivers are even smarter than their traffic lights, which can sense from the number of cars arriving at major intersections how to alter the pattern to let more of them through, but cannot decide to leave the cars at home in the garage in the first place. **********''Eighty percent of the people who work in the City have cars,'' Mr. Bottomley said, referring to the financial district. ''But 80 percent come in to work by train.'' British Rail carries the dominant share of passengers into the city from outside, and last year it carried so many passengers, the most in 17 years, that the Transport Minister, Paul Channon, said recently that he was thinking of ways to sell it back to private investors in the 1990's. **********London Transport, which runs the capital's still-nationalized rapid transit services, carried 798 million passengers last year, up from 498 million six years ago, and expects traffic to grow by a 30 percent more over the next 10 years, said Neil Garrie, a spokesman. Mr. Garrie said the Underground system would operate at a profit if it were not for the $500 million a year it invests in new equipment and construction to handle an expected extra load. **********All this takes the pressure off the London roads, in which only $175 million will be invested in the next year, according to Mr. Bottomley. What also helps is that in England, there are only 383 vehicles per thousand people, compared to 748 in the United States. **********To make more efficient use of the existing London roads, the Department of Transport is experimenting with a computer guidance system called Autoguide that could eventually help motorists anticipate and go around traffic jams and congestion."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/12/business/business-people-rite-aid-head-taking-advantage-of-the-market.html": {"writer_name": "Andrea Adelson", "pub_date": "1988-10-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 430, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rite Aid Head Taking Advantage of the Market", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Rite Aid Head Taking Advantage of the Market", "body_text": " **********Sentiment might be expected to play a role in the latest investment move by Alexander Grass, chairman and chief executive of the Rite Aid Corporation. **********Earlier this week, Mr. Grass disclosed that he had agreed to help a management group that wants to take Super Rite Foods Inc. private.

The jury found that the disease had been caused by super-absorbent tampons made by Playtex. Other Awards Also Sizable **********Among the other cases that the Court declined to review were two involving awards of $5 million and $3.5 million. The Court had been holding these cases on its docket for many months, awaiting the outcome of a case it finally decided two weeks ago. **********One legal expert said today's actions indicated that the Court would avoid deciding whether the Constitution limits punitive awards unless a conflict develops among lower courts. **********So far, no lower court has upheld the arguments raised by several businesses in recent years that some punitive damage awards violate either the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of ''excessive fines'' or the requirement of due process of law in the Fifth and 14th Amendments. **********On May 16, in the closely watched case of Bankers Life & Casualty Co. v. Crenshaw, No. 85-1765, the Court declined to rule on the issue of punitive damages although it had heard arguments on it. **********Instead, in upholding a $1.6 million punitive damage award against the insurance company for ''bad faith'' in rejecting a Mississippi man's $20,000 insurance claim for the loss of his leg, the Court said the defendant had not raised its constitutional argument with sufficient clarity in the Mississippi courts to warrant consideration in the Supreme Court. Signal to Lower Courts **********The Court's actions today confirmed indications in the May 16 decision that the Court wants the issue to be considered more fully in the lower courts. **********The Supreme Court dismissed some of the eight appeals today ''for want of a substantial Federal question'' without implying whether this meant that the majority was inclined to doubt that the Constitution imposes any curbs on punitive damages. In other cases the Court simply declined without comment to grant ''certiorari,'' or full review. **********Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia, who noted in the Bankers Life case that they believed the Constitution curbs punitive damage awards to some degree, dissented from the Court's refusal to hear some of the cases disposed of today. **********Some companies have urged the Court to rule that the Eighth Amendment (which the Court has never applied in a noncriminal case) bars any award of damages in a civil case that exceeds the maximum criminal fine established by the state legislature or Congress for the conduct in question. The maximum fines for many actions that give rise to personal injury suits are often in the neighborhood of $500. Other arguments for curbing runaway awards of punitive damages have been based on the requirement of due process of law. **********The more significant punitive damage awards that the Court declined to review today included these: *********** In Playtex Holdings Inc. v. O'Gilvie, No. 87-1021, a Federal appeals court upheld the jury's award of $10 million in punitive damages against the maker of Playtex super-absorbent tampons in a suit by the family of Betty O'Gilvie, a mother of two children. She died in 1983 of toxic shock syndrome, a disease caused by bacteria in the vaginal tract. Playtex was ordered to share the ''compensatory'' damages of $1.5 million and to pay all of the punitive damages. Playtex based its Supreme Court appeal on what it called the unconstitutionality of the punitive damage award but apparently did not raise the issue clearly in lower courts. *********** In Ohio Casualty Insurance Co. v. Downey Savings and Loan Association, No. 87-159, the California Court of Appeal affirmed a $5 million punitive damage award against the insurance company in connection with its alleged failure to pay on a fidelity bond claim filed by the bank as a result of an alleged criminal fraud by one of the bank's branch managers. *********** In Atlantic Richfield Co. v. Nielson, No. 87-1196, the California Court of Appeal affirmed a $3.5 million punitive damage award in connection with alleged misrepresentations by the oil company in its dealings with a gas station dealer. **********Justices O'Connor and Scalia dissented from the Court's refusal to hear the latter two cases. **********Among the other actions announced by the Court today were the following:  Cable Broadcasts **********The Court refused without comment to hear appeals by broadcast industry groups, public television stations and others that sought to resurrect the 1986 version of the Federal Communications Commission's ''must carry'' rule, which required cable television systems to carry local broadcast signals for five years. **********The Court declined today to hear four separate appeals. Those brought by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the National Association of Broadcasters and the Association of Independent Television Stations Inc. were, respectively, Nos. 87-1506, 87-1510 and 87-1551. The fourth appeal was Office of Communication of the United Church of Christ v. F.C.C., No. 87-1487.  Ethanol Tax Credits **********The Court unanimously struck down an Ohio law that awards tax credits for each gallon of ethanol sold as a component of gasohol by fuel dealers, but only if the ethanol is produced in Ohio or in a state that grants similar tax advantages to ethanol produced in Ohio. Ethanol is usually made from corn. In a challenge brought by a gasohol producer in Indiana, the Court ruled that the Ohio law discriminates against interstate commerce in violation of the Constitution. Justice Scalia wrote the opinion. (New Energy Co. v. Limbach, No. 87-654.)  Natural Gas Pricing **********In a decision that Federal regulators says could save consumers $100 million a year, the Court ruled by 8-0 in the Government's favor and against the position of natural gas producers in a complex gas pricing dispute involving interpretation of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. It overturned a Federal appellate decision supporting higher prices for certain categories of gas. Justice William J. Brennan Jr. wrote the opinion. Justice Byron R. White did not participate. (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission v. Martin Exploration, Nos. 87-363 and 87-364.)

Taking nothing at all was not an option. **********''Wherever you go, the church has some role; it has always been true and probably always will be,'' Miss Gentile, 17 years old, said. ''I felt like protesting.'' That, she explained, was how she ended up in a once-a-week economics class. **********But to a 16-year-old schoolmate, Veronica Cutolo, a weekly dose of religion made sense. ''I'm not really sure about the existence of God, but I think that in this class I can find some answers,'' she said. ''At least, I might find out why other people believe.'' **********So she sat attentively at Liceo Mamiani one recent Saturday morning as a priest, the Rev. Angelo Arrighini, roamed a field of subjects from the newly discredited Shroud of Turin to satanic cults, with occasional detours into questions such as whether Jesus's hair was long or short. 'Tradition of This Country' **********It was not his intention to teach Catholic doctrine, Father Arrighini said. ''What I try to do,'' he said, ''is simply to show how Catholicism is part of the historical and cultural tradition of this country.'' **********The very existence of his course was proof enough. **********Four years ago, the Vatican and Italy's Government signed a revised Concordat that ended Catholicism's status as the state religion. But today, the two sides continue to wrestle with the problem and their relationship. The focus of the dispute, early in the new academic year, is the court-ordered ''religion hour,'' a contentious issue embroiling students, parents, teachers, school administrators, religious groups and politicians. **********Under the old Concordat, concluded between Pope Pius XI and Mussolini in 1929, classes in Catholic doctrine were compulsory in state schools unless students or parents asked for exemptions. The changes made in 1984 were intended to make such instruction voluntary. Choice Is Mandatory **********That is not exactly how things have worked out, however. In a recent ruling, a high-level court, the Council of State, interpreted the new agreement to mean that all students from nursery school through high school are obliged to take either a weekly hour of religious instruction or an alternative of some sort. The point was that they had to choose something. **********The practical result is that 90 percent of Italian public-school students continue to receive religious education, from Catholic priests selected by the church and paid - as all priests are -by the state. Some students actively prefer the religion hour, or their parents do. But many are also responding to group pressure, or to the imperatives of tradition, or to the fact that some schools, especially in more remote districts, offer no desirable alternatives. **********''Many of them are so disenchanted, they simply don't care,'' said Luigi Covatta, an Under Secretary in the Ministry of Public Education. ''They're not afraid of one hour of religion, so they take it. But it's not important to them.'' **********Even so, Protestant and Jewish groups protest what they regard as the preservation of the special status of Catholicism, whether or not it is called the state religion. Lay political parties, including some that belong to the five-party governing coalition, complain that at least a third option should be added - that of taking no course at all. Avoiding Temptation **********That idea hardly appeals to church leaders, who assume that most students would simply stay away. ''Even I as a Catholic boy would have gone home,'' said Msgr. Cesare Nosiglia, an official of the Italian Bishops' Conference. ''One less hour of school is a temptation that's too strong.'' **********The church's concern is underlined in schools that provide genuine alternatives to the religion hour. At Liceo Mimiani, for example, students may choose among courses in economics, music, law and computers. One consequence is that barely half the students signed up this term for religion classes. **********Despite the fact that organized religion has fallen on troubled times in Italy - surveys show, for instance, that only 25 percent of Catholics attend Sunday Mass - the cultural grip of the church remains formidable. In overwhelming numbers, Italians continue to be baptized, married and buried by priests. **********''It's still a Catholic country; that's the reality,'' said Carlo Cardia, a lawyer who sits on a church-state commission that deals with Concordat questions. Mr. Cardia typifies the tug-of-war within the Italian soul. He is a Communist. Yet on the wall behind his desk hangs a large oil portrait of the Magi adoring the infant Jesus. Asked to reconcile the apparent contradiction, he shrugged. **********The new system is a challenge for priests as well. They must figure out how to teach the basics of their faith and yet not disaffect parents who want catechism kept out of public schools. Under the old Concordat, priests had a captive audience, if often an indifferent one. Now, the assignment is tougher, says the Rev. Gianni Todescato of Santa Chiara Church in northern Rome. **********''If we don't live up to students' expectations,'' he said, ''we will lose them.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/31/world/arafat-restates-his-interest-in-international-conference.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-10-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 137, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Arafat Restates His Interest In International Conference", "print_headline": "Arafat Restates His Interest In International Conference", "body_text": " **********The chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Yasir Arafat, reiterated in an interview released today that he was prepared to participate in an international peace conference with the Israelis. **********Mr. Arafat, in the article in Time magazine, also repeated his stated willingness to negotiate on the basis of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, which call for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the occupied territories in return for Arab recognition of Israel's right to exist within secure and recognized boundaries.

''Child Shot Dead By Recruiter; New Victim of Ferocious Army Manhunt'' was another. **********Friday's issue of La Prensa carried photos of Managuans picking through a garbage dump. The photos were said to reflect ''the hopelessness, hunger and misery that Nicaraguans are living through in these golden days of revolution.'' **********When La Prensa reopened in October after 451 days of forced closure, Government officials urged its editors to be constructive and responsible. But if they hoped the paper would evolve into a voice of moderation and compromise, they were mistaken. Its criticism of Sandinista rule has been harsh and unrelenting. **********La Prensa not only covers the national political debate, but is an active and highly partisan participant. As at crucial moments in the past, it has abandoned objectivity to become a crusading anti-Government voice. 'The C.I.A. Newspaper' **********The Sandinistas rarely miss a chance to denounce La Prensa as a mouthpiece of reaction. President Daniel Ortega Saavedra regularly refers to it as ''the C.I.A. newspaper.'' **********A commercial now being broadcast on Government television shows footage of La Prensa's publisher, Violeta Chamorro, interwoven with scenes of suffering war victims. The clear implication is that La Prensa is responsible for killings committed by United States-backed contra guerrillas. **********Sometimes the Sandinistas confront La Prensa even more directly. On Thursday afternoon, several thousand workers at state-owned factories were brought to the paper's office in Managua to stage a noisy protest. They shouted for ''people's power'' and declared their willingness to die to defend Sandinista rule. **********There were loud protests from public figures in Latin America and Western Europe when La Prensa was shut in June 1986. The paper had played a key role in the overthrow of the Somoza family dictatorship, and its assassinated editor, Pedro Joaquin Chamorro Cardenal, has posthumously acquired the status of a secular saint. **********La Prensa, which last month observed its 62d anniversary, waged journalistic war on the Somozas for decades. After the killing of Mr. Chamorro in January 1978, La Prensa became a strident opposition broadside, much as it is today, urging Nicaraguans to defy the regime. **********Although La Prensa's staff and management is quite different from the group that was in charge during the 1970's, the paper's symbolic importance has not diminished. **********''No matter how wild La Prensa becomes, the Sandinistas really can't close it down again because they would be condemned around the world,'' said a South American ambassador. ''La Prensa knows this, so it feels able to publish anything at all.'' 'Visceral Enemies' **********Bayardo Arce, a member of the National Directorate who is among those responsible for Government policy toward the press, said La Prensa would remain open even though it is run by ''visceral enemies of the revolution.'' **********''I have never read a single article in La Prensa that recognizes anything good about the Government,'' Mr. Arce said in an interview last week. **********''La Prensa embarks on campaigns around whatever issue it thinks can be used to erode the strength and moral standing of the regime,'' Mr. Arce said. **********''The contras want to get their people out of jail, so La Prensa is pushing for amnesty. The contras don't want us to be able to defend ourselves, so La Prensa attacks the draft law. And now that we have had to adjust our economy in order to survive one more year of Reagan, La Prensa is trying to incite resistance to our new economic laws.'' **********''These people are speaking on behalf of Reagan and the counterrevolution,'' Mr. Arce concluded with a shrug. ''They are doing a job that has been assigned to them.'' U.S. Government Contributions **********The National Endowment for Democracy, an agency of the United States Government, has been contributing money to La Prensa for several years. Contributions now total about $7,000 monthly, according to Jaime Chamorro Cardenal, the paper's principal editor. **********''The Sandinistas say we take American money in exchange for printing what the Americans want, but it isn't like that,'' Mr. Chamorro said in an interview at his office. ''All the money we receive is legally registered and comes through the Central Bank.'' **********Mr. Chamorro is a leader of the Conservative Party, and several reporters on La Prensa's staff also work with opposition political groups while not on duty at the paper. They consider their political and journalistic work to be virtually inseparable. **********Mr. Arce himself was a reporter at La Prensa in the late 1960's and early 1970's, but while working there he was a clandestine member of the then-illegal Sandinista Front, using his journalistic cover for revolutionary ends. **********''We don't foment discontent,'' Mr. Chamorro said. ''We just report what happens. If the Government allows freedom of the press, then it has to live with the consequences.'' **********''La Prensa doesn't attack the contras,'' Mr. Chamorro said. ''We are totally opposed to the system being imposed on Nicaragua, and we are fighting that system as civilians. The contras have been a vital factor. If the contras didn't exist to pressure the Sandinistas, this newspaper would not be publishing today.'' **********No Awards for Quality Like the two pro-Government papers, Barricada and Nuevo Diario, La Prensa concentrates on news that carries the correct political message, and often publishes broad charges without clear evidence. None of the three journals is likely to win any awards for quality. **********Despite its militant ideological position, La Prensa does at times cooperate with authorities. **********When Maj. Roger Miranda Bengoechea defected from his post in the Defense Ministry in October, the world press headlined his revelations about global aspects of Sandinista policy. But he also brought a wealth of inside gossip which has been eagerly devoured by Nicaraguans. He named three women with whom he said his former boss, Defense Minister Humberto Ortega Saavedra, was maintaining romantic relationships. **********All three are well known in the small Managua social circle, and all have been living with prominent Sandinistas.

PROCLAIMS PALESTINE TO BE AN INDEPENDENT STATE; HINTS AT RECOGNIZING ISRAEL", "body_text": " **********Yasir Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, early today declared the establishment of an independent Palestinian state as part of a broad political program that recognizes Israel, at least implicitly, for the first time. **********In a speech to the Palestine National Council, the parliament in exile of the Palestinian movement, Mr. Arafat declared, ''The Palestine National Council announces in the name of God, in the name of the people, of the Arab Palestinian people, the establishment of the state of Palestine in our Palestinian nation, with holy Jerusalem as its capital.'' **********He did not indicate the borders of such a state, although he said a 1947 United Nations partition plan, which provided for a Jewish state and an Arab state in Palestine, still offers a basis for ''international legitimacy.'' Israeli Opposition Expected **********The state envisioned by Mr. Arafat is assumed to include the West Bank of the Jordan River and the Gaza Strip, which are occupied by Israel, and the Arab sector of Jerusalem, which Israel considers its own. Thus, the announcement was mainly a political declaration of hope and intent without immediate practical meaning. **********All Israeli governments have rejected the idea of a separate Palestinian state, and Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir is considered certain to scorn the announcement. A Palestinian declaration of independence, Mr. Shamir said Monday before the announcement, would ''change nothing in our country or in the territories.'' Reward for Uprising **********Late Monday, the Israeli authorities tightened security in the occupied areas in case of violent demonstrations hailing the announcement of a state.  [ In Washington, officials said the United States rejected such a Palestinian declaration, saying the conflict in the Middle East must be resolved through negotiations between Israel and its neighbors. Page A6. ]  The announcement by the Palestinian council had been anticipated for months. Leaders of the Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza have demanded the gesture in recognition of their 11-month-long insurrection, in which at least 276 Arabs and 10 Israelis have died. **********The move also comes three and a half months after Jordan renounced all claims to administer the affairs of Palestinians under Israeli occupation and left it to the Palestine Liberation Organization to determine their future. **********Mr. Arafat read his declaration in a festive atmosphere - one of cheering and singing - on the third day of a meeting of the Palestine National Council in a huge conference hall on the outskirts of Algiers. After his 20-minute speech, which was written by the Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish, the audience stood while a band played the Palestinian anthem and uniformed men slowly raised the Palestinian flag. **********On Monday night, the council voted to endorse a crucial resolution adopted in 1967 by the United Nations Security Council that recognizes the sovereignty of all states in the Middle East, an implicit recognition of Israel, council members said. **********By a vote of 253 to 46, the council approved its political platform making the Security Council document, Resolution 242, the main basis for an international peace conference. Such a move had been resisted until now by the P.L.O., whose charter called for the destruction of Israel. Publication of the political program adopted by the council is expected in Algiers later today. **********The United States has long refused to negotiate with the P.L.O. until it accepted Resolution 242 and a supplementary document, Resolution 338, adopted in 1973. Washington also insists that the P.L.O. explicitly recognize Israel's right to exist and renounce terrorism. **********The emphasis on an international conference and the seeming acceptance of an Israeli state alongside a Palestinian state - rather than the destruction of Israel - was regarded by delegates here as a victory for Yasir Arafat's dominant Fatah wing of the P.L.O., which has often been at odds with hard-line groups. **********Palestinian leaders said they would move quickly to form a provisional government that can negotiate the borders and the status of their declared state. **********They called for an international conference that would settle the 40-year-old conflict between Palestinian Arabs and the Israelis. Two-State Arrangement **********Senior Palestinian leaders said the declaration, in calling for a two-state arrangement, implicitly recognizes the right of Israel to exist and that it had the support of the great majority of their followers. ''Basically, the general trend and the overwhelming majority is going with the line calling for peace and a two-state solution,'' said Bassam Abu Sharif, a senior adviser to Mr. Arafat. **********He said that the matter of the borders of the Palestinian state just declared here would be left to ''a peace conference.'' Wide Recognition Expected **********Mr. Abu Sharif said he expected perhaps as many as 100 Arab, African, European and Asian countries to extend diplomatic recognition to the Palestinian state. At the moment, 102 nations recognize the P.L.O. as a liberation movement, allowing its representatives diplomatic status in their capitals. **********The Algerian Foreign Minister, Col. Boualem Bessaieh, said his country would be the first to permit an embassy for the Palestinian state. **********Ambassadors in Algeria were invited Monday night by callers identifying themselves as representing the ''Palestinian embassy'' to come to a celebration after the declaration of independence. The United States Ambassador here, Christopher Ross, received an invitation but did not attend. American officials are forbidden from meeting with P.L.O. officials. **********Palestinians said the declaration of independence is to be the start of a peace campaign that will be outlined later today in a political program describing the P.L.O.'s conditions for peace with Israel in exchange for a nation they can call their own. **********Salah Khalaf, known as Abu Iyad, the second-ranking official in Mr. Arafat's Fatah movement, said in an interview here Monday that the Palestinian leadership felt it had to move now to take advantage of a relaxation of tensions between the superpowers and their apparent intention to settle a number of regional crises. Reason for P.L.O.'s Timing **********Mr. Khalaf also cited the apparent victory in the recent Israeli elections of an inflexible coalition of the Likud party and religious parties, andthe ascent in Gaza of an Islamic fundamentalist movement of Palestinians opposed to all negotiations. Given that conjunction of hard-line influences, he said, the P.L.O. leadership estimated that it had six months to gain what many Palestinian leaders here refer to now as ''international legitimacy.'' **********To achieve this legitimacy, members of the Palestine National Council were still debating a political program to be unveiled today. It is intended to establish specific Palestinian ideas on how to seek peace, they said. ''We are entering the peace process with this program,'' said Ahmed Abdul-Rahman, a P.L.O. spokesman. **********Among the principal points of the political program are these: *********** The P.L.O. is committed to pursuing a peaceful solution to the conflict with Israel on the basis of Resolutions 242 and 338. *********** The P.L.O. will negotiate with Israel in the context of an international peace conference that will be held on the basis of Israel's acceptance that Palestinians have political rights, and are not to be treated as mere refugees. *********** The P.L.O. retains the right to resist Israeli occupation inside occupied territories, but it rejects all forms of terrorism. It will do so ''in accorance with United Nations resolutions.'' These resolutions on terrorism have tended to uphold the right of liberation movements to resist occupiers. *********** The relationship between the Palestinian and the Jordanian people should be based on the principle of a confederacy after the two people freely agree to it.

He did not care much for railroads, mining companies or big banks, either, but he held a special place in his spleen for big-city newspapers, including his two hometown competitors. **********The owners of metropolitan dailies were asking Congress for a law that would allow them to combine their business operations into monopolistic enterprises that would cut costs and raise prices - as long as they maintained separate news staffs and published two distinctly different newspapers. The sponsors of the legislation called the proposed law the Newspaper Preservation Act. **********''That's the wrong name,'' Mr. Cervi testified before Congress. ''You ought to call it the Millionaire Crybaby Publishers Bill.'' **********Mr. Cervi lost his battle and died a few years later. The law passed easily. Now, the issue has come back to Congress in the form of a proposed amendment that would expand the 1970 law to aid some of the wealthiest newspaper companies in the United States, among them the Gannett Company, the Hearst Corporation, Cox Enterprises Inc. and Knight-Ridder Inc. **********This time, the exemption would come in the form of an amendment to the 1970 law that would allow newspapers covered by joint operating agreements to enter new fields of publishing in their hometowns. **********The four sponsors of the current proposal come from areas served by daily newspapers that have combined their business operations: Howard M. Metzenbaum of Ohio (Cincinnati), Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii (Honolulu), Jake Garn of Utah (Salt Lake City) and Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia (Charleston). **********Senator Inouye said the measure would allow the joint enterprises to engage in the kind of ventures that all other newspaper companies may legally pursue - while retaining their unique power to operate jointly under the 1970 act. It would be a way to allow ''independent and competing newspapers to remain in business,'' he said, without making them ''second-class citizens.'' **********Opposing the proposal is a coalition of small dailies and weeklies represented by the National Newspaper Association and the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies. Many of these small papers distribute publications, either a neighborhood newspaper or an advertising circular, to virtually every home in their area. The metro dailies rarely reach even half of those homes, unless they also distribute free circulars there. **********The smaller papers think the amendment would wipe out what competition exists in many cities to benefit some of the biggest players in the industry. **********Newspaper publishing, by and large, ranks as one of the most profitable industries in the United States, along with pharmaceuticals, oil, mineral extraction and broadcasting. **********It has not always been so. At the turn of the century, many cities had as many daily newspapers as they now have radio stations. However, rising production costs, union intransigence and management ineptitude led to the collapse of many of them. **********When newspaper companies compete in a town, the battles always play out in the public square, in full view of readers, politicians and advertisers. When one paper fails, many old friends join the funeral procession. **********The long decline of the metropolitan daily press may leave the mistaken impression that the industry is struggling. Individual papers may falter, either killed by competition or merged into a sister publication put out by the same company, but newspaper companies have done well in recent years. **********Whatever the reasons for adopting the Newspaper Preservation Act 18 years ago, the business has changed since then. **********Before 1970, the collapse of an aging daily often left a community with only one newspaper voice. Today, metropolitan areas have dozens of publications - from tiny urban weeklies to giant suburban dailies - fighting to be heard and scrambling for advertising. **********Joint operating agreements are still in effect in 19 cities. As a method of reviving dying publications, the law has worked wonders. ''The papers with joint operating agreements have done very well financially,'' said Robert Picard, a professor at Emerson College in Boston and author of ''Press Concentration and Monopoly.'' ''Daily newspapers earn an average of about 19 percent on sales, more than double the average for other manufacturing businesses, and the companies with joint operations earn about twice what other papers earn.'' **********But the law did not grant the operators of joint facilities complete license to roam. Those who benefited could use their protection only to publish conventional paid-circulation newspapers. That is the portion of the law they now seek to amend. **********While the monopolies flourished, so did others that took advantage of the changing economics of publishing. Hundreds of new newspapers have sprouted in cities and suburban areas. **********Metropolitan dailies in many cities have responded to the competition with new publications of their own. Some publish zoned editions with news and advertising tailored to certain neighborhoods. Others distribute what they call ''total market coverage'' products, often a sheet with a few old articles from their life style pages wrapped around a package of pre-printed advertising circulars. **********But the J.O.A. papers, as they are called in the industry, are barred from expanding from their protected base. **********''Let's hear it for free enterprise,'' said Bruce B. Brugmann, editor of The Bay Guardian in San Francisco, and a leading critic of the new proposals. The Guardian, a free-distribution weekly, operates in the same market as the San Francisco newspapers, the morning Chronicle and the afternoon Examiner, which combined their business operations in 1965, five years before the law was passed. **********''If they want to compete, we'd be happy to go head to head with them,'' Mr. Brugmann said. ''But they ought to give up their special monopoly protection. They ought to move into separate buildings with separate printing plants and separate sales and distribution staffs.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/28/business/executive-changes-409788.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-07-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 274, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Executive Changes", "print_headline": "Executive Changes", "body_text": " **********American Express<ei Travel Related Services Co., a subsidiary of American Express Co., named Kenneth I.

About $600 million of that amount would be financed by the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, said Mark G. Solow, senior managing director of the bank. Management Likely to Stay **********Although the deal does not specifically provide for Best's management to remain, Robert E. R. Huntley, the company's 59-year-old chairman and chief executive, said in a telephone interview that ''my intention and expectation is that Best Products will continue to be managed by the present management.'' **********Asked earlier if management would remain, Leonard P. Shaykin, a managing partner of Adler & Shaykin, said in a separate interview, ''Yes, we certainly hope so.'' **********Best also agreed to pay Adler & Shaykin a $25 million consolation fee and up to $7.5 million in expenses if the deal does not go through. **********After the deal was announced, Best's stock jumped $6.125, to $26.875 a share, with more than 4.3 million shares changing hands.

Wall Street professionals speculated that Service might have tried to buy Best. Service executives once tried to buy their own company but backed out when shareholders filed suits contending that the price was too low. **********Mr. Huntley of Best said its directors had begun an intense review of the company's options six weeks ago and eventually invited a number of buyout concerns to look at the books. He said that Best had received five bids, with four from ''leveraged buyout type'' companies. He declined to identify the bidders. **********In addition to speculation that Service may have made an offer, other bidders are believed to have included the Wesray Capital Corporation of New York and the Momentum-Schiedler real estate group of Hawaii. **********Two months ago, a Manhattan buyout fund, Prospect Group Inc., said it owned 9.9 percent of Best and might seek control. It is unclear whether it made an offer. As a major stockholder, it would have to file disclosure papers if it made such an offer. **********Best said in its announcement of the deal that the terms called for a ''fully financed'' tender offer to stockholders to begin promptly. It said its directors had approved the offer unanimously. **********Prospect Group is thought to be likely to tender its stock to Adler & Shaykin. The Lewis family, headed by Sydney Lewis, 68, who founded Best, is also expected to tender its stock. Mr. Lewis and his wife, Frances, 65, control 2.2 percent of the stock. Their daughter, Susan L. Butler, 38, controls seven-tenths of 1 percent. **********Best, based in Richmond, operates 194 stores in 27 states plus Best Jewelry, a 30-store chain that sells fine jewelry and giftware. $4 Million Loss in Quarter The company reported in August that it lost $4 million in its second quarter, compared with a $3.2 million deficit a year earlier. Best earned $30.5 million in the 1987 fiscal year, in contrast to a loss of $25.6 million a year earlier. **********Adler & Shaykin already controls six companies with combined sales of $1.5 billion; with Best, revenues would rise to $3.5 billion. Among other Adler & Shaykin deals, it bought The Chicago Sun-Times for $145 million in 1986; Joy Technologies, the world's biggest underground mining company, for $750 million in 1987, and Wherehouse Entertainment, a leading music retailer, for $200 million last February.

Move Is Widely Supported **********The action, which has wide support in both Congress and the industry, came today when the three-member board of Freddie Mac voted unanimously to eliminate the restrictions on the transfer of Freddie Mac stock as of Jan. 1. The Freddie Mac board is the same as the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates the savings and loan industry. **********As recently as last January, Freddie Mac stock was being traded among savings and loan institutions through designated dealers at around $50 a share. But as debate over permitting public ownership of the stock heated up in recent weeks, the stock rose above $80 a share. **********Today, the stock traded at $100 a share, but trading was suspended in anticipation of the Freddie Mac announcement. The shares, which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, do not trade every day. Price Seen as High as $150 **********Some analysts predict the stock will trade as high as $150 a share. If the stock indeed reaches $150, that would represent a paper increase on the books of the nation's savings institutions equivalent to $1.5 billion. That in turn raises the net worth of the industry. When trading to the public becomes possible on Jan. 1, the savings units could either continue to hold the unrestricted stock in their capital accounts or sell them to the public. **********In large part, the action was precipitated by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican who in June introducted legislation that would have eliminated the ownership restrictions on Freddie Mac stock. A Senate Banking Committee vote on the D'Amato bill was scheduled for July 27, but the issue is now moot. **********''I'm delighted,'' Senator D'Amato said. ''The stock can now find its true value, and you now have an infusion of new capital into the thrift system.'' **********Leland Brendsel, president of Freddie Mac, said, ''I think the actions by Senator D'Amato proved to be a catalyst that led to the board's actions today.'' **********Danny Wall, chairman of both Freddie Mac and the bank board, had been under pressure to approve such a plan without going through the arduous and time-consuming legislative process. Strained Relationships **********The action was welcomed by the industry, with some predicting that it could begin to improve somewhat the recently strained relationships between the bank board and top industry officials. **********For the last six weeks, the agency and Mr. Wall have come under considerable criticism for proposing to extend a costly, extra deposit insurance premium on the industry through the end of 1998 - a kind of tax the bank board has levied on the healthy savings and loan institutions to give it more resources to shut down more than 500 ailing ones. **********Theo H. Pitt Jr., chairman of the industry's largest trade association, the United States League of Savings Institutions, had called the extension of the special assessment ''vampire economics.'' **********Industry officials noted, however, that the $1 billion to $1.5 billion of new capital that the Freddie Mac stock would inject into the industry would be far from enough to restore health. Yet they added that given the fact that the industry capital levels were currently very low, the new value of the stock would add as much as 20 percent to the tangible net worth of the industry. **********Under the plan, Freddie Mac will offer to exchange one share of the current restricted stock for one new share of unrestricted stock. For such an exchange the savings and loan institutions will pay the agency $7 a share. The exchange fee will net Freddie Mac $105 million. **********The exchange offer will expire on Nov. 30, after which any share not traded in will continue to be subject to the current transfer restrictions. **********As of Jan. 1, the shares will be able to be sold to the public and the maximum number of shares that can be held by a shareholder will be raised to 600,000 from 150,000. **********Wall Street experts predict there will be ample investor interest in the Freddie Mac stock. Created in 1970 **********Freddie Mac, which has become the subject of such intense speculation, was first created by Congress in 1970 with the mandate of attracting more funds into home mortgage lending. The agency essentially buys mortgages from savings and loans, packages them into securities and sells them to the investing public. This process permits savings units to sell off unwanted mortgages, giving them more flexibility to make more mortgage loans. **********Last year, Freddie Mac posted profits of $301 million and paid dividends totaling $18.12 a share to its preferred stockholders. To date, Freddie Mac has bought and sold more than $300 billion in mortgages."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/30/world/soviet-president-gorbachev-offers-some-new-politics-few-doubt-he-intends-lead.html": {"writer_name": "Bill Keller", "pub_date": "1988-06-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1074, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis; News Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Soviet President?; Gorbachev Offers Some New Politics And Few Doubt He Intends to Lead", "print_headline": "A Soviet President?; Gorbachev Offers Some New Politics And Few Doubt He Intends to Lead", "body_text": " **********Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, has offered his people the design for a prodigious new political contraption, and few doubt that he intends to be its driver. **********The proposal he outlined Tuesday in his opening speech to a national Communist Party conference is a blueprint for a new Soviet government, headed by a president - almost certainly President Gorbachev - who would hold real power over domestic and foreign policy. **********Nor is there much mystery about what he is up to. **********Mr. Gorbachev evidently hopes to free himself from the constraints imposed by his more conservative colleagues in the Communist Party leadership and by the balky party bureaucracy, who are widely accused of hampering the economic and social restructuring Mr. Gorbachev calls perestroika. A Balancing Act **********But as with his jerry-built economic machine, which is now faltering from early design flaws and an unexpectedly rough road, the question is whether Mr. Gorbachev can fully control what he has set in motion. **********Mr. Gorbachev's design for a new government is an elaborate balancing act between party control and popular democracy. **********He proposed a huge new super-legislature, called the Congress of People's Deputies, composed of 1,500 delegates elected in districts nationwide, with 750 additional seats allotted to Communist Party committees, trade unions, artistic organizations and others. **********This congress would in turn select a standing legislature of 400 to 450 members, and a president to oversee it. An Ally Remains Coy **********Mr. Gorbachev, who is General Secretary of the party, has not said he wants the new post of President, and his close Politburo ally and propaganda chief, Aleksandr N. Yakovlev, was coy on the subject. **********''I do not favor prophecies of any sort,'' he said at a news conference on Tuesday. ''We will wait and see.'' **********But no one watching Mr. Gorbachev dominate today's proceedings, or listening to the rapturous tributes of some delegates, harbored serious doubts. **********''I am for giving this General Secretary full presidential powers,'' said Yuri D. Chernichenko, an official of the Soviet writers' union and a delegate, stressing the word ''this'' and seeming rather baffled that anyone would bother to ask. Exception Urged for Gorbachev **********Mr. Gorbachev's personal stature was evident in the thunderous applause when Mikhail A. Ulyanov, a delegate who is the captivating actor best known for his portrayal of Lenin, pleaded for just one exception to a strict 10-year limit on official service. Mr. Gorbachev alone, he said, should have 15 years. **********''It's a social revolution going on, and we should not change horses in midstream,'' he declared. **********By assuming the role of President, Mr. Gorbachev would be able to claim a mandate not only from the party but from the society at large. **********The added authority would, perhaps, make it easier for him to present his programs without first whittling them to fit the consensus view in the party's ruling Politburo. **********As President, he would also stand astride a newly fortified network of elected people's councils. These bodies, known as soviets, are supposed to be transformed from puppets of the Communist Party into genuine law-making and administrative powers, accountable to the public and armed with the money to back up their authority. To Supplant Party Apparatus **********Mr. Gorbachev has clearly calculated that the soviets would supplant the entrenched party apparatus that now rules Soviet life down to the shop floor. He counts on the soviets being more responsive to his calls for cutting red tape and rewarding local creativity. **********Approval of Mr. Gorbachev's plan at the party conference looked so certain that delegates spent little time today addressing the substance of his grand scheme. Only two relatively peripheral issues prompted any controversy: the question of whether officials should be limited to 10 years or 15, and the role of local party bosses in the soviets. **********Mr. Gorbachev, probably in a concession to those who fear too much dilution of the party's power, suggested that local party leaders automatically be nominated to head the local government councils. **********But the Soviet leader has seen that it is easier to win general approval for grand ideas than to make them work. A 70-Year Resistance **********In his speech Tuesday, Mr. Gorbachev acknowledged that his economic plan was badly bogged down. He admitted that his original proposals to free industry and farming from central control were too timid. The programs have become entangled in bureaucratic resistance and a lack of initiative bred by 70 years of orders from the top. **********The political restructuring he proposed is in large measure an attempt to kick the economic program to life. **********Yet remaking a government is an ambitious project, one likely to take years. First there will be studies to flesh out the details of a plan that is full of blank spots. Then there are laws to be enacted, constitutional amendments to be approved, new electorial procedures to be invented and elections to be organized. **********Major philosophical questions have still been left unresolved, including what role will be allowed for political organizations outside the Communist Party in promoting candidates for office. Food Shortage Problem **********During this time Mr. Gorbachev will be simultaneously preoccupied with tinkering his economic program back to life, and trying to solve the food shortages that have become the most acute public grievance he faces, not to mention conducting his foreign policy. **********As with his economic program, he can expect to face resistance and bureaucratic subterfuge, if not outright political opposition. **********Many of his supporters say they wonder how soon the public will lose patience with persistent food shortages. And the next phase of his economic program includes some measures that will tax his popularity, especially his vow to end the system of subsidized prices. **********Not for the first time, Mr. Gorbachev is charging ahead on a risky course, trusting in his own ability to make the necessary adjustments as he goes. **********For Soviet citizens, the inauguration of President Gorbachev would be a reminder of how much their country's near future still rests on the shoulders of one man."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/12/world/beijing-journal-to-fail-is-human-to-get-into-a-university-divine.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Gargan", "pub_date": "1988-07-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1130, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Beijing Journal To Fail Is Human, to Get Into a University Divine", "print_headline": "Beijing Journal To Fail Is Human, to Get Into a University Divine", "body_text": " **********A bell rang. Then, like coal rumbling down a tin chute, the slap of sandals and scuffle of sneakers grew to a low roar and the school's doors banged open, spewing out a torrent of teen-agers with faces furrowed in worry. **********Sun Xiaojun popped out of the stream of students and ran her left hand through her pageboy haircut. **********''I think I have a lot of problems,'' she said, ''a lot of problems.'' **********Miss Sun, and 43,260 other graduating high school students in Beijing, were in the midst of a three-day examination that would determine whether they would be admitted to college. Indeed, across China more than 2.7 million young people were hunkered down at classroom desks last week to take the national college admissions test. One in four will succeed. #16,144 to Be Accepted Du Ming, the deputy director of Beijing's Office for Higher Education Admissions, said the city has already determined that 16,144 students, a shade more than a third of those who attempt the exam, will be given places in universities. **********''Beijing, because it is a city, is different from the countryside,'' Mr. Du said. ''The teachers and methods are better here so more will pass here than in rural parts.'' **********Over three days, for two and a half hours in the morning and again in the afternoon, the students struggled with seven subjects, from Chinese to mathematics, politics to foreign languages. Those who aspire to careers in the sciences and engineering are tested in their areas, and in chemistry, biology, and physics; those lured by the humanities are required to take examinations in history and geography. **********None of the tests are easy, the students and Mr. Du agreed. **********A passage from the Shiji, by the second century B.C. historian Sima Qian, tested knowledge of classical prose. Stylistic problems in ninth-century Tang poetry rattled memories, and a famous line from one of China's 20th-century writers, its phrases jumbled, could be unraveled only by those who could read the complexities of meaning, not just the surfaces of words. An Essay on 'Habits' **********Then students were asked to write an essay, no more than 600 words, on the subject of xiguan, or habits. There were no clues, no hints at what to pen, just the word ''Habits.'' Many students froze. **********Those who tackled geography were queried on the economic similarities between Singapore and Switzerland, the number of daylight hours in London and Sydney at the winter solstice and the name of Africa's most populous country. The students were asked to name the principal crops of the middle and upper Yangtze River. **********And they were asked what the main problem in developing agricultural land was, whether it was opening new land near the sea, repairing irrigation dikes, reclaiming desert lands or maintaining consistent yields on existing farmland. **********If the students were baffled by the question, it was not surprising, Mr. Du said. ''I don't know the answer either,'' he admitted. ''I suppose it's maintaining yields, but I'm not sure.'' What Did Comrade Deng Say? China's ideological colors formed the core of the test on politics. **********''What,'' the students were asked, ''did Comrade Deng Xiaoping say about preserving political stability?'' Mr. Deng, China's senior leader, shared the exam page with Zhao Ziyang, the party's general secretary, as well as recent moments in the history of the Communist Party. **********Students needed to know the nature of ''national monopoly capitalism,'' the difference between concrete and abstract labor and how to explain the phrase, ''Gold and silver naturally are not money, but currency is naturally gold and silver.'' **********Every student had to sit for a foreign language exam, in English, French, German, Japanese, Spanish or Russian. The tongue of choice, according to Mr. Du, was English. **********Of the language of Chaucer and Shakespeare and Joyce, China's high school students were quizzed on pronunciation (Does ''now'' rhyme with ''show'' or ''cow?''), complicated grammar and reading comprehension. There was composition, too. This year's task was to compose a letter to the British Broadcasting Corporation, one of the most popular shortwave radio stations in China. **********''There are no perfect scores,'' Mr. Du said. ''It's all too hard for that.'' A Veil of Secrecy **********A committee of professors from China's universities prepares the entrance exam every spring in secrecy, Mr. Du said. ''We used to send all the professors off on vacation until the students had finished taking the test,'' he said. ''Now we just make them promise not to say anything.'' **********But the printers who man the presses that produce the examinations are not so lucky. ''The printers have to stay in the factory dormitories after the test is printed,'' he said. ''When its over, they can go home.'' In Beijing, 71 schools and auditoriums were designated as testing sites. Test monitors stood at the front of each room, and hallways were patrolled by teachers with yellow and white badges. Anxious parents lurked outside, some chatting, others pacing the pavement littered with cigarette butts. **********For China's high school students, these three days are the days that will determine their future. Passage means admission to college and opportunity. Of the country's children who start first grade, perhaps 2 percent will attend college. 'I Did My Best' **********A college education, at the worst, means life behind a desk in some obscure Government office. At its best, it can mean a chance to do advanced research, to teach at a major university, to help run new enterprises, to rise through the party and Government bureaucracy, to travel abroad. **********Failure does not necessarily mean oblivion. Young people are permitted to retake the exam each year until they reach the age of 25. Most who fail the first time try once or twice more, Mr. Du said. After that, they become too discouraged. **********Mao Zhaohui seemed flustered as she trudged out of the examination hall at the People's University High School. At 20, she said she was taking the test for the second time. ''Mathematics is the hardest,'' she said. ''I've been preparing for the whole year. I'm hoping I do better this time.'' She trooped off. **********Behind her, Miss Sun's post-exam anxiety vaporized in a bubbly laugh. ''I'm not really so concerned,'' she said. ''I've been working hard all year. I did my best, so I should make it.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/20/business/company-briefs-009788.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-06-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 265, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Avondale Industries, Boston, a shipbuilding and machine tools concern, said it had received a $177 million contract to build two oilers for the Navy. *********** Boeing Co., Seattle, said it had received a $125 million order for four jetliners from Bavaria Fluggesellschaft, a West German lessor of aircraft to commercial airlines. *********** Chemical Waste Management Inc., Oak Brook, Ill., said it had reached an agreement in principle to acquire a 49 percent stake of Brand Companies Inc., Park Ridge.

The purchase is Nomura's first major investment in a United States partner, and it could give many of Japan's biggest industrial groups a pipeline for buying American and European enterprises. **********''We are not sure yet what the numbers will be,'' said Yoshiji Fukushima, Nomura's executive vice president, when asked how much his clients were willing to invest in the United States. Shift in Japanese Strategy **********That sentiment reflects a major change in Japanese strategy. Though cash has become one of Japan's biggest exports, Japanese companies have been cautious about the direct takeover of American concerns, preferring less obtrusive investments in Treasury notes, hotels, Park Avenue apartments and Hawaiian golf courses. But in the last few months, with the yen strong and Japanese economic ambitions growing, the appeal of American corporations has proved irresistible. **********More than any other player here, Nomura has emerged as a symbol of a Japan that is awash in money and desperate to find a way to invest it. **********Nomura's 15,000 employees underwrote $22.6 billion of securities in Japan's market alone last year, arranged the financing of $20 billion more overseas and earned profits of $2.1 billion. Seemingly unfazed by the October stock market crash, Nomura officials boast that the company achieved its biggest volume of retail securities sales in its history on Oct. 20, the day after the collapse. Analyst's View of the Deal **********''The only wave they have missed so far is mergers and acquisitions,'' said Ron Napier, who follows Japanese securities firms for Salomon Brothers here. ''And Wasserstein & Perella is the pure play to make if you are serious about making acquisitions.'' While other Japanese institutions have taken stakes in securities houses like Goldman, Sachs & Company and Shearson Lehman Hutton, neither of them focuses on acquisitions. **********Officials of the Yamaichi Securities Company, Japan's fourth-largest brokerage house, agreed Tuesday night to invest $100 million in a fund managed by the Lodestar Group, another small American firm specializing in mergers and acquisitions. Yamaichi also bought a 25 percent equity interest in Lodestar for an undisclosed sum. **********Last summer the Nikko Securities Company, the third-largest dealer in Japan, invested $100 million in a leveraged buyout fund run by the Blackstone Group, a New York investment banking firm. **********For Bruce Wasserstein and Joseph R. Perella, the alliance with Nomura appears to be a coup. Since they defected from First Boston, where they had built up Wall Street's largest mergers-and-acquisitions department, the two men have been involved in about 15 deals worth $19 billion, including the Campeau Corporation's $6.6 billion acquisition of Federated Department Stores. Others Said to Be Interested **********Mr. Wasserstein said at a news conference today that Wasserstein, Perella had made the first approach to Nomura but that a number of other Japanese securities houses, which he declined to name, had also sought to invest in the firm. **********Mr. Perella said the deal with Nomura ''reinforces the permanence that Mr. Wasserstein and I set to achieve with our firm,'' and he added, ''We don't expect a lot of our competitors on Wall Street to like it.'' **********Japan'a finance ministry, seeking to deflect additional tension over trade, has quietly urged Japanese companies to go slow with overseas acquisitions. Senior finance ministry officials indicated Tuesday night that they were not involved in Nomura's decision. **********Nomura officials described the arrangement - in which the companies will swap several senior officers - as promoting ''cross-border investment'' among Japan, the United States and Europe. **********But the Nomura officials left no doubt today that they expected all the actions to be in one direction: Japanese yen buying American companies. They sidestepped the delicate question of whether they would engage in hostile takeovers - a practice that Japanese securities firms have largely shunned. Blurring of Distinction Seen **********''When we established our own mergers-and-acquisitions department in New York, we had a basic concept that we would not be engaged in hostile M.&A.,'' Mr. Fukushima said. ''As of now, we are maintaining that same approach. In New York, however, the distinction between hostile and friendly takeovers has been very much blurred.'' **********Under the terms of the agreement, Mr. Wasserstein said, Wasserstein & Parella remains ''completely operationally free'' of Nomura. **********''The key question is whether Japanese firms will use this as a conduit'' to make hostile acquisitions,'' Mr. Napier said, adding, ''So far, the evidence is that they probably will not.'' **********Most major corporate acquisitions by the Japanese have been friendly. Japan's Bridgestone Corporation took over the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company this year, stepping in to rescue Firestone from a hostile bid made by Pirelli S.p.A. The Sony Corporation purchased CBS Records in an amicable agreement with CBS Inc. In Silicon Valley, most of Japan's corporate acquisitions have involved smaller companies, usually those in need of cash or technology. An Eye on Trade Imbalance **********Moreover, Nomura's traditional clients - companies like Sony, the Toyota Motor Corporation, the Toshiba Corporation, Mitsui & Company and the Tokyo Electric Power Company - are conservative and seek to avoid blame for Japan's huge surplus in trade with the United States. While they might invest in leveraged buyout funds or take equity positions in major American companies, some experts doubt that they would pursue the kind of takeover techniques that brought fame to Mr. Perella and Mr. Wasserstein.

Oliver Wendell Holmes **********Many investors knew fear for the first time on Oct. 19, 1987, when the Dow Jones industrial average plunged a whopping 508 points. The magnitude of the losses suffered by millions of Americans spurred them to a new caution. Growth took second place to safety, and investors moved into more conservative investments while spreading the risk by diversifying. **********As a result, a strategy long used by institutions, known as asset allocation, is suddenly enjoying widespread popularity among individual investors. Some do their own allocating; others are turning to professionals to do it for them. In either case, the rationale is to control their financial affairs better by reducing the possibility of an overwhelming setback when one or two investments go bad. **********Asset allocation can have a significant impact on investment results, as Bailard Biehl & Kaiser, a San Mateo, Calif., money management firm has shown. The firm's BBK Index compounds the average annual return of stocks, bonds, real estate, international securities and cash. For a period of more than 22 years through the third quarter of 1988, it showed an annualized return of 10.1 percent, compared with 8.8 percent for the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks. Even in 1987, the year of the crash, the BBK Index rose 8.6 percent, compared with 5.3 percent for the S.& P. But while superior performance is part of the attraction, it is by no means the primary goal of this technique. Safety has been the watchword of 1988. **********Leilani Ponzi and her husband, Eugene, of Northbrook, Ill., self-employed sales representatives in their 50's, allocate their pension plan assets in accordance with market conditions. ''I'm trying to lower the volatility and risk,'' she said. ''I even did pretty well in 1987 because I was mostly in cash,'' she added. **********Philip Thomas of Huntington, L.I., a 69- year-old retired businessman, is taking a similar investment route. Currently his financial assets are split three ways - 70 percent bonds, 10 percent stocks and 20 percent money market instruments - because ''we chose a more conservative approach.'' **********Also known as asset mixing, asset allocation is the planned process of distributing investments among available categories, either according to an established, fixed formula or with reallocations in keeping with changes in the economy. Proponents see it as a tool for limiting risk, while at the same time providing competitive returns. **********''It's the buzzword of the moment,'' said Madeline I. Noveck, president of Novos Planning Associates of New York, and Northeast regional director of the Institute of Certified Financial Planners. ''By using different categories which correlate negatively in their performance, you can plan for the unexpected.'' **********''It's very difficult to pick winners and losers specifically,'' added Randy Neumann, a certified financial planner in Saddle Brook, N.J. ''But if you have a diversified base of assets, and the investments are of good quality, over the long run it's hard to lose money.'' **********Asset allocators, whether individuals or professional services, in effect create an all-weather portfolio, often in the form of mutual funds, intended to turn in good results in both bull and bear markets. The purpose is to offset declines in the value of one segment with advances in another. **********The sorts of assets used in such a mix typically include domestic and international common stocks, domestic and international bonds, money market securities, precious metals and real estate. As Robert E. Lewis, managing director of the Atlanta securities firm of Marshall & Company, put it, such spreading of assets ''makes an awful lot of sense.'' **********Gerald W. Perritt, president of Investment Information Services of Chicago, said that one way investors could do this would be by putting together a portfolio of mutual funds that could satisfy each asset class. ''Five years ago, individual investors didn't have an opportunity to do this, because you didn't have international bond funds and other kinds of funds,'' he said. **********Also bringing this technique to the investor's attention has been the increasing realization that investment results are driven primarily by the asset allocation decision. ''For most portfolios, selection of the asset mix is the single most important determinant of long-term investment performance,'' noted William G. Droms, professor of finance at Georgetown University. **********The asset allocation concept, moreover, allows for differences in the percentage devoted to the various classifications, based on personal and family requirements. ''Using a broad range of assets gives you more opportunity to tailor your asset mix to meet your needs,'' said Peter M. Hill, executive vice president of Bailard. **********The way that the best asset mix can be developed is the same for everyone, regardless of the goals set. T. Rowe Price, the Baltimore-based mutual fund management company, has a worksheet that divides this process into seven steps: *********** Define your financial goals clearly by outlining what you want your money to do. *********** Set your time horizons as short-term (up to 2 years), mid-term (2 to 5 years) and long-term (5 years or more). *********** Consider your personal risk profile as either a more conservative or less conservative investor. *********** Find the investments that match your goals, taking into account the trade-offs you have to make. *********** Analyze your current asset mix and see how it compares with the appropriate investments. *********** Check your diversification, keeping in mind that the greater your resources, the easier it is to achieve. *********** Rethink your investments periodically, since asset allocation is a lifetime process. **********''This takes an awful lot of the emotion out of dealing in the marketplace,'' said Robert A. Leo, executive vice president of Shearson Lehman Hutton. ''It makes you look at what your objectives are.'' **********Take the case of a double-income couple in their 30's, now accumulating funds for a down-payment on a house in two to three years. Most financial advisers believe that in such a situation, the young couple should concentrate on short-term securities, rather than risking their assets on long-term securities that might have to be sold when interest rates are up - and, as a result, the value of these assets are down. Charles G. Hughes Jr., a Bay Shore, L.I., financial planner and chairman of the Institute of Certified Financial Planners, suggests that the couple place at least 40 to 50 percent of their available funds in cash or cash equivalents, such as bank certificates of deposit or money market funds. An additional 10 to 15 percent could be invested in growth-oriented mutual funds that have shown the ability to withstand the pressures of a declining market. He cited the Strong Investment Fund or Mutual Shares Corporation as possibilities. And he added that the remainder could go into fixed-income funds with a moderate maturity -one of the Scudder Target or Benham Target Maturities funds, for example. **********''Investments go into favor and out of favor,'' Mr. Hughes said. ''Proper asset allocation can balance the risk.'' **********A family thinking ahead about saving for a college education for their children in, say, 10 or 12 years, has a longer time horizon. In addition to the assets already put aside, there may be new discretionary money available in each of those years that can supplement the investments made when the financial plan is established. **********Joel S. Isaacson, manager of personal financial planning of Weber Lipshie & Company, a New York certified public accounting firm, recommends that this family purchase bonds - Treasuries, municipals or zero-coupons. If the family can add about $100 a month to its investment program, half could go into United States Savings Bonds and the other half into one of the new all-weather mutual funds that are willing to perform somewhat below the averages in an up market so that they will do somewhat better than the averages in a down market. **********''You won't have the sexy gains of having everything in the right assets at the right time,'' said Mr. Isaacson. ''But you'll be spreading your assets and letting the law of averages take precedence.'' **********For a man and woman in their mid-50's who are planning to generate income for retirement at 65, different investment factors come into focus. ''There are two cycles: economic cycles and life cycles,'' said Ralph J. Presuti, first vice president of Advest Inc., a securities concern with headquarters in Hartford. ''The closer you are to your ultimate goal, the less you concern yourself with economic cycles and the more with your own life cycle.'' **********Even at the point of retirement, though, some experts believe that equities should continue to be used in the overall asset allocation procedure.

But when a leader of the powerful oil workers union made those charges recently, he was assumed to be acting not as a whistle-blower, but out of a desire for immediate political gain. **********Late last month, a member of the Mexican Congress, Adolfo Barrientos, took the floor to accuse Mario Ramon Beteta, former director of Petroleos Mexicanos, the state oil company, of ''treason to the President and robbery of the nation.'' Mr. Barrientos, one of the most influential figures within the 210,000-member union, belongs to the Institutional Revolutionary Party, as does Mr. Beteta, who is now Governor of the state of Mexico, which adjoins but does not include Mexico City. **********As oil workers in the gallery chanted ''To jail! To jail!'' Mr. Barrientos charged that Mr. Beteta had engineered a questionable 1985 deal in which a politically connected shipping company bought a pair of Yugoslav oil tankers and leased them to the state oil monopoly, widely known as Pemex. **********He also said the shipping company, with no physical assets or capital of its own and ''without ever having even operated a motorboat,'' had been awarded the contract without public bidding because Mr. Beteta and other prominent political leaders stood to profit handsomely. A Vendetta Is Alleged **********Mr. Beteta has denied the accusations as ''unjust and unfounded,'' arguing that the union has engaged in a vendetta against him because he ''injured group interests'' during his tenure at Pemex. But he has declined to specify which of his actions may have offended the union. **********The accusations themselves are not new, having first been made in 1986 by a left-wing opposition party and dismissed as unfounded after a brief investigation. But their revival by an apparently discontented faction of the ruling party, known as PRI, has been interpreted here as a union power play designed to wrest a variety of concessions from the party. **********Mexican political analysts and diplomats say the real target of the union's denunciation is not Mr. Beteta but President-elect Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who takes office Dec. 1. Mr. Salinas has long had a tense and combative relationship with the union and with the man who has headed it for more than 25 years, Joaquin Hernandez Galicia, known as ''La Quina.'' **********''This is La Quina's way of reminding Salinas that these questions are not closed, but only on hold,'' a foreign expert on the Mexican oil industry said. ''He wants Salinas to know that he can cause a lot of problems if his demands are not met.'' **********Those demands, Mexican and foreign analysts also said, are not exclusively economic. The union is also said to want veto power over whomever Mr. Salinas chooses to head Pemex and a commitment that the new administration will not break up Pemex into several independent companies, a widely rumored action that could threaten the union's hold on oil production here. Union Also Called Vulnerable **********The Oil Workers Union, whose members are responsible for the production of the 2.5 million barrels a day that last year earned Mexico a vital $8.5 billion in foreign exchange, has itself repeatedly been accused of corruption. **********As Budget and Planning Minister for the outgoing President, Miguel de la Madrid, Mr. Salinas played a role in ending a longstanding practice of granting half of Pemex contracts to the union, which then subcontracted them at a profit. He is also said to have blocked union efforts to win control of Pemex's shipping and other lucrative activities when a ''Mexicanization'' program was announced in 1985. **********When Mr. Salinas's name appeared as a possible successor to Mr. de la Madrid, Mr. Hernandez fought energetically to steer the PRI presidential nomination elsewhere. **********Almost six years ago, accusations of fraud in another oil tanker transaction were made against another director of Pemex, Sen. Jorge Diaz Serrano, shaking the Mexican political establishment to its foundation. At Mr. de la Madrid's behest, Mr. Diaz Serrano was stripped of his congressional immunity, arrested, convicted of bilking Pemex of $34 million, and served five years in prison before being released in July. **********This time, however, the likelihood of an immediate political scandal appears to be far less. Mr. de la Madrid has made a widely publicized appearance with Mr. Beteta, in which he described the Governor as ''a patriotic, efficient and honest public servant'' and dismissed the accusations against him as slander."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/09/business/in-quotes.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-10-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 98, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "IN QUOTES", "print_headline": "IN QUOTES", "body_text": " **********''There have been many managements in the past who have taken the same rationale as Pillsbury and ultimately couldn't produce on it.

Iron city!'' - built in the first fever of Stalin's industrialization campaign and still reckoned the world's largest steel producer in the days of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader. **********Today Stalin's city of steel is Mr. Gorbachev's heritage, a decrepit giant coughing its poisons into the air of the Ural Mountains and defying the economic good intentions of perestroika. **********Here in the Russian rust belt, a visitor fresh from the heady political circus of Moscow finds a sobering dose of the realities Mr. Gorbachev is up against in his attempts to revive the torpid Soviet economy. **********To be sure, Mr. Gorbachev's policies have meant startling changes for this working-class city of 430,000. **********The city newspaper has grown bolder, writing about fatal accidents in the steel plant and about the local history of Stalin's terror, subjects that were untouchable not long ago. **********There is a daring bit of nudity in the play about prostitutes on the stage of the Metalworkers' House of Culture, a surge of anti-Stalinism in the movie theaters. **********People can now buy $2.80 pork kebabs or $650 custom-chiseled marble tombstones from independent vendors, a product of Mr. Gorbachev's move to open the way to private enterprise.  In a Bleak Landscape, Stirrings of Change **********A more striking symptom of the Gorbachev revolution is an independent political group that gathers each Thursday night at the corner of Marx and Gagarin Streets to rally for cleaner air by way of cutbacks in production at the local steel mill. **********The group is grudgingly tolerated by local officials. **********But so far, the citizens of Magnitogorsk say they have seen more glasnost than perestroika, more openness than economic revival. Life is more interesting, but not more satisfying. **********Meat, sausage, butter, sugar and vodka are rationed. Nearly a quarter of the city's population languishes on a waiting list to get into the monotonous concrete apartment blocks that line the outskirts of the city. **********Worst of all, the steel mill itself, like much of the musclebound Soviet industrial economy, has become an albatross. The local iron ore is depleted, the technology outmoded, and the public increasingly alarmed by pollution and disease rates that, thanks to glasnost, are listed monthly in the newspaper. **********''Pittsburgh 20 years ago,'' was the verdict of Robert Barry, deputy director of Voice of America, who grew up in Pittsburgh, when he visited Magnitogorsk for the opening of an American technology exhibit last month. **********The city was flung up on an empty steppe in the 1930's, a crash project of Stalin's first five-year plan. **********The site, where the eastern slope of the Ural Mountains levels out, literally on the divide between Europe and Asia, was chosen because of a rich lode of iron ore - the Magnetic Mountain that gave the city its name - and because it was far from any threat of invasion.  Industrialization On the Grand Scale **********They built the plant big, in the prevailing spirit of gigantism that has only recently come into question. Today the plant's output of 16 million metric tons of steel a year is equal to the output of America's three largest steel mills. **********John Scott, an American who worked as a welder on the project, recalled the terrible, primitive conditions of the city's birth in a book called ''Behind the Urals.'' **********''Money was spent like water, men froze, hungered and suffered, but the construction work went on with a disregard for individuals and a mass heroism seldom paralleled in history,'' he wrote in late 1941. **********But among the workers of Magnitogorsk the consoling memory of a time when things were much worse, the pride in shared sacrifice, is increasingly less vivid. **********''It's been our place in history to build a new country, to build a new society, and we always worked without thinking of ourselves,'' said Valery N. Kucher, editor of the daily Magnitogorsk Worker. ''But a time came when it was right to start thinking about ourselves.'' **********Like many cities outside Moscow and Leningrad, Magnitogorsk issues monthly ration coupons for staples: 2.2 pounds of meat per person, 2.2 pounds of sausage, 6.6 pounds of sugar, 1.1 pounds of butter, and, since the vodka distillery was converted to a mayonnaise factory at the start of Mr. Gorbachev's anti-drinking campaign, one pint of vodka. Cheese is so scarce the authorities do not bother to ration it. **********Residents resent the shortages, but they say that under the rationing system, at least the need is shared fairly. **********Moreover, most workers eat one meal a day in a factory cafeteria, and can often buy extra groceries there. **********Housing is a more bitter complaint. The wait for an apartment is typically 10 years, and city officials estimate that 100,000 people are on the list. At least half of them now live in communal housing with other families. **********''Life here is no fountain,'' said Vladimir N. Lupachev, 27 years old, who graduated from the city metallurgical institute with an engineering degree but decided instead to seek his fortune selling tombstones. **********He makes up to $1,280 a month, and his enterprise makes him a de facto part of the Gorbachev restoration. Only, he says, there is not much to spend it on. **********The romance of the steel plant has also waned.  Giant Steel Mill: A Tarnished Symbol **********Before Rima Dyshalenkova, a feisty local poet, became disgusted by the pollution and moved 150 miles away to Chelyabinsk, she wrote of the noxious domain of coke ovens and blast furnaces as ''our provider and destroyer.'' It is a common sentiment. Someone in almost every family works at the plant, and virtually everything else in town exists to serve the factory and its work force. **********The aging, open-hearth furnaces that made the steel for every second tank and every third shell sent to the front in World War II now produce steel of such low quality, one plant official says, that it is no longer suitable for the armaments industry. Most goes to make autos and agricultural machinery. **********The plant is clearly inefficient, requiring 60,000 workers to turn out its 16 million tons. The most modern American steel mill, according to industry experts, produces 8 million tons with only 7,000 workers. **********Industrial accidents killed 14 people last year, according to Tamara V. Popeta, the deputy chief doctor at the medical clinic serving the factory. The fatality rate is about double that in the American steel industry. **********The plant's colorful, malodorous emissions are the first thing residents of the city apologize for when meeting a visitor.  The Deadly Air: High Disease Rates **********The Magnitogorsk Worker periodically publishes a table of air quality statistics, and they are grim. This summer the air has contained nine times the legal maximum level of benzene and three to five times the legal maximum for sulphur compounds. **********The rates of heart, lung and respiratory diseases are far above the national averages, especially among children - and the data are said to show things are getting worse, not better. **********Local environmentalists say they have seen official data showing the life expectancy in Magnitogorsk is only 52 years, far below the national average of 69. Officials in Moscow declined to make their figures public. **********At the steel plant, Polish and Soviet workers are now installing a modern electric converter to replace the open hearths that are still used in 60 percent of Soviet steel mills. A second converter is to be completed by 1995. **********''By the year 2000, you won't see this smoke,'' said the mayor, Mikhail M. Lysenko, a blunt-spoken former steelworker, waving a hand at the fumes visible, and smellable, through his office window a mile from the plant. **********But a group of American steel experts who toured the plant Aug. 2 were skeptical that Magnitogorsk's salvation is at hand. **********Even with the new technology, the vast plant will still employ so many coke ovens and furnaces to make the raw pig-iron for the converters that, barring enormous investment in clean-up technology, the worst of the pollution will continue, the Americans said. **********The Americans also questioned whether the plant will ever make economic sense. **********Magnetic Mountain is almost wholly depleted and the plant now imports ore from Kazakhstan, 300 miles away. **********''They're in a remote location, 1,200 miles from the sea,'' said Robert D. Pehlke, a professor of engineering at University of Michigan, who toured the plant last week. ''So how are they going to be competitive? You have to wonder if this is economical.'' **********The bookkeeping of a planned economy in which energy, raw materials and transportation are heavily subsidized, makes it virtually impossible to answer that question. **********The new political group, Forward Movement of Perestroika, argues for cutting steel production by 25 percent, closing the least efficient and worst polluting ovens, and slowing the pace of work to improve quality. It contends that this can be done without layoffs. **********The local newspaper, initially sympathetic, has lately disparaged the group as impractical and demogogic. A cut in steel production, the newspaper scoffs, will lead to social disruptions still unthinkable in this society.  Obstacle to Change: Bureaucracy's Needs **********Any notion of cutting output also will run up against the Ministry of Ferrous Metals, which, despite a pretense of decentralization, still runs the plant through state steel contracts amounting to 98 percent of its business. **********The Soviet Procurator-General, Aleksandr Y. Sukharev, who is responsible for enforcing environmental laws, complained in an interview in the weekly tabloid Nedelya that even his own attempts to shut down offensive coke ovens in polluted cities have met the ministry's fierce resistance. **********''There is no way out,'' said Viktor M. Svistunov, a plant official. ''This is a planned system, and we've got to provide other enterprises with raw material.'' **********One hears approximately the same sense of resignation, but with a more cynical edge, at a tavern across town from the factory, the kind of bar where workers order pints of murky beer four at a time and down them quickly. **********''We had some Japanese here,'' said Vadim, who works in the rolling mill at the plant. ''We said, 'Tell us, how far behind are we?' They said, 'Forever. You're behind us forever.' '' **********Asked about Mr. Gorbachev's calls for more democracy and local autonomy, workers smirk and roll their eyes. **********''Listen,'' confides Aleksandr, a driver. ''You have a Mafia. We have a system of princes.'' **********Passivity, bewilderment and pessimism about the economy abound. **********Citizens interviewed in their homes and workplaces during a five-day visit were more likely to predict economic stupor than success for Mr. Gorbachev. **********This attitude - perhaps as much a legacy of Stalin as the steel mill - annoys Mr. Kucher, the editor, who sees in it perestroika's real enemy. **********''Everybody is still waiting,'' he said, ''to get their orders.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/21/business/business-people-tate-lyle-official-seeks-hometown-support-for-bid.html": {"writer_name": "Julia Siler", "pub_date": "1988-04-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 444, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tate & Lyle Official Seeks Hometown Support for Bid", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Tate & Lyle Official Seeks Hometown Support for Bid", "body_text": " **********On the eve of Staley Continental Inc.'s response to an unsolicited takeover bid by Tate & Lyle P.L.C., Neil M.

After his visit, The Decatur Herald and Review said last week in an editorial that ''no one in Decatur should have any quarrel'' with what Mr. Shaw plans to do.

Tate & Lyle also disclosed its intention to sell Staley's food services business, a key part of Staley's recent effort to diversify away from corn processing. **********The bid for Staley is the first Mr. Shaw has been involved in since becoming chairman of Tate & Lyle two years ago.

Official Calls Report 'Lies' **********The report relies on interviews with former residents of North Korea, tourists, defectors, and published accounts in a range of foreign languages because North Korea would not allow researchers to enter the country, which is sealed off from most non-Communist visitors. The report draws a portrait of a rigidly stratified society in which all people are judged by their loyalty to the North Korean leader, Kim Il Sung. It indicates that any opposition, however mild, brings reprisals that range from forced labor to long imprisonment to torture. And all recreational and cultural activities center around a Kim Il Sung personality cult, the report says. **********In a letter sent to the groups after reviewing the draft report, Pak Gil Yon, North Korea's representative to the United Nations, where the country has permanent observer status, condemned the report as ''full of lies and fabrications defaming our country.'' **********The report says all North Koreans are unofficially divided into at least three groups, which determine where they live, their housing, food rations, clothing, degree of medical care, luxuries like appliances or travel, and how they are treated if they commit crimes. **********The most privileged people, who are allowed to live in Pyongyang, North Korea's modern and clean showcase city, belong to the ''core'' who are perceived to unswervingly support the state.

According to the report, North Korea has built an extensive surveillance network of agents and informers that reaches into every workplace and residential community.

In one Paris McDonald's, raw french fries were stored next to trash bags on the basement floor. To enter the McDonald's near the Gare St. Lazare, customers had to pass through the arcade of a porno movie theater. At a McDonald's on the Champs-Elysees, not only was the company's name misspelled out front, but the frying oil was the color of crankcase oil and open cans of insect spray stood atop boxes of Big Mac sauce. **********''They were really disgusting,'' said Thomas Allin, the head of development for McDonald's Europe who was called in to turn around its French operations. ''The only thing those restaurants had in common with other McDonald's was the name they had outside the door.'' **********In fact, the company was so upset that it sued to oust the Paris franchisee and have all the McDonald's in Paris closed. The company fought - and won - a four-year legal battle, and today, McDonald's has re-established itself as one of the most popular fast-food chains in France. One sign of its recovery, was its opening last month of a handsome 400-seat restaurant on the Champs-Elysees - a glamorous world that it had been shut out of for five years. Moreover, the company, unaccustomed to being an also-ran, is now vowing that it will become No. 1 in fast food in France before the end of this year. It is now second, behind Quick, a French chain with an English name. **********''They're a little irritated by that,'' said Georges Plassat, president of Quick France. **********Being first is a matter that goes far beyond ego. France is key to McDonald's European strategy; the land famed for its two hour six-course lunch is largely untapped for fast-food companies. McDonald's has 67 restaurants in France, far behind the 270 it has in Britain and the 270 it has in West Germany. McDonald's hopes to have some 270 restaurants in France, too, in the next 5 to 10 years. Not only that, fast food represents only 4 percent of commercial meals eaten in France, compared with 12 percent in Britian and 40 percent in the United States. **********''France is still early on McDonald's curve because of all the problems with their franchisee,'' said John Rohs, an analyst with Wertheim Schroeder in New York. ''McDonald's feels it is a market that offers considerable opportunity.'' **********Growth abroad is critical to McDonald's as the American fast-food market matures and competition intensifies, not only from other hamburger makers but also from pizza and taco shops. ''International is one of the key growth areas of the future,'' said James Cantalupo, president of McDonald's International. ''And we're off to the races in France.'' **********McDonald's is already posting a faster rate of growth overseas than in the United States. While 24 percent of McDonald's 10,100 restaurants are outside the United States, about 40 percent of the 500 restaurants McDonald's opens each year are overseas. That should rise to about half soon. **********As for the potential of Western Europe, Mr. Cantalupo pointed out that while its population is 45 percent larger than that of the United States, ''we have only one-tenth the number of restaurants in operation there.'' **********But becoming No. 1 - and turning France into a nation of burger eaters - will not be easy. McDonald's must contend with the snobbism that many people in the land of foie gras and Michelin guides feel toward burgers and shakes. And then there is the question of whether the suave, sophisticated country that produced Coco Chanel, Jean-Paul Sartre and Charles de Gaulle - who rose in popularity each time he thumbed his nose at the United States - can embrace Ronald McDonald and Happy Meals for kids. **********''For many French people there is an association that good food is French and fast food is American and foreign and bad,'' said Michel Crozier, a leading French sociologist. **********But the company is making progress. It has largely overcome the dismal image left by its former franchisee, an image that was so bad that assistants to the Mayor of Paris warned the heads of the city's 20 arrondissements to beware of McDonald's opening in their neighborhoods. **********Yet a revitalized McDonald's faces stiff competition from other chains - not only from its perennial rival, Burger King, but also from Quick and Freetime, another aggressive French hamburger company. In addition, France's 86,000 traditional cafes and bistros, while down from 200,000 in 1960, may rise to the fast-food challenge by zipping up their menus. And there are fast-growing companies that sell fast-food a la francaise, such as the Croissanterie, which offers sandwiches on a croissant. **********But at McDonald's headquarters in Oak Brook, Ill., company officials say the biggest obstacle to growth in France is the tightness of the real estate market. That, they say, is the reason McDonald's France, which last year had revenues of $102 million, plans to add 15 restaurants a year, down from 23 last year. McDonald's officials complain that it takes years and the wealth of Louis XIV to get good sites; some industry officials estimate McDonald's had to pay more than $6 million to take over the lease for its new Champs-Elysees restaurant, its 32d in the Paris area. **********Although some competitors predict McDonald's will lose money on its Champs-Elysees site because the lease is so expensive, Philippe Hersant, a restaurant analyst with GIRA, a French agribusiness consulting firm, said, ''The world's leading fast-food chain just has to have a restaurant on the Champs-Elysees. It's a symbol for the French market.'' **********McDonald's has recovered in Paris by following the tried-and-true formula it has used around the world. ''We're trying to use the McDonald's system of doing things, and we've tried to add a French flavor to it,'' said Robbin Hedges, the 34-year-old Virginian who is president of McDonald's France. **********McDonald's has added a number of French twists. It adds less sugar and more mustard to its salad dressings to accommodate the French palate. It serves beer and Evian mineral water at its French restaurants. Since the French are fond of Sunday family dinners, McDonald's has made a big pitch to families, giving gifts to children on Sunday. **********In France, it is a different crowd that eats fast food than in the United States. Fast-food resturants began as roadside eateries in the United States. But in France, most McDonald's and other fast-food chains are located in the cities. In the United States, everyone from schoolchildren to stockbrokers seem to gobble fast food; in France, it is popular among a more sophisticated crowd, many of whom first sampled it while abroad. **********French blue collar and factory workers seem to eschew fast food in favor of the hundreds of unpretentious cafeterias in shopping centers and on superhighways. And many workers, including white-collar employees, prefer France's often subsidized company canteens. **********''You don't find any blue collar workers or peasants in fast-food restaurants in France,'' said William Moore, president of Freetime, the French burger chain. ''For them, being in a fast-food restaurant is a little like being on the moon.'' **********From McDonald's perspective, those differences are welcome. ''McDonald's doesn't want to be seen as a world brand, it wants to be seen as part of a local market,'' said Mr. Allin, the McDonald's Europe official. ''McDonald's is not a multinational company. It's a multi-domestic company. The goal is to localize it as much as possible.'' **********For McDonald's, the comeback here has been all the more impressive because of its early problems. **********The man who represented McDonald's past was Raymond Dayan, a Moroccan who opened the first fast-food restaurant in France in 1972 after obtaining the McDonald's franchise for the Paris area. **********His 12 restaurants ran into serious trouble in 1977 when a team of McDonald's inspectors said he failed to meet company standards for quickness, service and cleanliness. The next year McDonald's sent another team of inspectors with French court-appointed officials, who snapped photographs of dog droppings in the stores and found Mr. Dayan's stores charged for catsup and hid straws behind the counter. **********Mr. Dayan, who now lives in the United States, said in the litigation that McDonald's inspections were a pretext for abrogating the franchise agreement, maintaining that it felt it was not obtaining sufficient royalties from him. **********Nevertheless, Judge Richard L. Curry of Illinois Circuit Court ruled in 1982 that McDonald's had the right to take away his franchise, stating that the company was acting to ''rid itself of a cancer within its system before it grows and further infects'' other stores. The judge added: ''Its price for disassociation from Dayan will be to turn its clock back 10 years and be forced to start anew in Paris.'' **********Indeed, McDonald's did disappear from Paris for more than a year. To re-establish itself, the company decided it had to project French style and class. In 1984, when McDonald's opened the first restaurant in its second French incarnation, it set up shop in a handsome turn-of-the-century building on one of Paris's grand boulevards. **********''The biggest thing we have had to overcome was getting consumers to accept us again,'' said Mr. Hedges, head of McDonald's France. ''We have had to show we're not the McDonald's of the past.'' **********McDonald's problems were a mixed blessing for its competitors. On one hand, McDonald's woes created a negative image for fast food in France and slowed efforts to wean French people from their bistros and croques monsieurs. On the positive side, said Mr. Moore of Freetime, ''It provided a good opportunity for all competitors to make mistakes. If McDonald's was there, the margin for error would have been greatly reduced.'' **********In developing their post-Dayan strategy, McDonald's officials quickly focused on the family. Traditionally, children hated stuffy French restaurants as much as the restaurants hated having the children.''When we started positioning ourselves, there was no other restaurant in France that went after families,'' said Mr. Allin, who succeeded Mr. Dayan in Paris. ''It was a no-brainer.'' **********Other fast-food chains have adopted different strategies. The largest, Quick, which grew rapidly in 1986 when it purchased 20 former McDonald's restaurants from Mr. Dayan, has 81 outlets; its sales last year were $114 million. It hopes to stay ahead by putting in shopping center parking lots. **********Freetime, with 44 restaurants and sales last year of $70 million, attracts a young adult crowd and has added a French touch with such items as a ''longburger'' - a rectangular hamburger on a baguette-like bun. And, there's Burger King with 15 restaurants in the Paris area and 1987 revenues of $30 million. Burger King emphasizes new products such as the Bahama, a hamburger with a slice of pineapple, and the Cheyenne, a hamburger au poivre, that is, with green pepper sauce. **********Fast food here is not cheap. In the view of the industry consultant, Mr. Hersant, French fast food is not such a bargain - a Big Mac, small French fries and milk shake cost 30.5 francs or about $5.25 while the same meal in New York would cost $4.30. Executives in the French fast-food industry acknowledge that French prices are higher than American prices because of higher labor and real estate costs and an 18.6 percent value added tax. **********Meanwhile, many food critics and restaurateurs fret that the increasing popularity of fast food will ultimately render the French pallate less sophisticated - and thereby undermine France's tradition of haute cuisine. **********But McDonald's executives say such worries are overblown. ''Our message is we're a new choice on the market; we're another alternative'' said McDonald's Mr. Allin. ''We're not trying to replace French cuisine. That's not possible.''

Both, essentially, are creations of 20th century technology. Both have played an enormous role in shaping our view of the world. And both live or die on their ability to tap into the mysterious power of image. **********Yet, for all their affinities, the alliance between advertising and photography has traditionally been an uneasy and grudging one. The grudge, said Robert Sobieszek, Director of Photographic Collections at the George Eastman House in Rochester, has been carried on mainly by critics and aestheticians who ''regarded advertising work with an attitude somewhere between disdain and antipathy.'' **********Sean Callahan, editor of American Photographer magazine, puts the matter even more bluntly. ''There was never a feeling that these pictures were worth the paper they were printed on,'' Mr. Callahan said. ''They were turned out to go with a campaign - and when the campaign ended, they were thrown in the trash.'' **********In terms of the marketplace, the anti-advertising bias never made a great deal of sense. Almost from the start, advertising provided photographers with their most reliable and lavish paychecks. In a single day, more people might see a picture used in a popular ad than would visit all the world's photography galleries in a year - or possibly ever. And as time passed, the boundaries between ''commercial'' and ''fine art'' photography have become increasingly blurred. Modern masters like Irving Penn, Richard Avedon and Hiro move easily and frequently from one realm to the other. **********Today, critical attitudes seem to be catching up with reality. ''The Art of Persuasion,'' at the International Center of Photography Midtown, 77 West 45 Street, from March 19 through May 7, gives evidence of the change. In this exhibit, of which Mr. Sobiezek is the curator, advertising pictures, including the ones shown here, are presented as serious examples of the creative spark that results from the collision of craft and commerce, the wedding of image to message."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/26/world/pope-urges-help-for-quake-victims.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Haberman", "pub_date": "1988-12-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 766, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "POPE URGES HELP FOR QUAKE VICTIMS", "print_headline": "POPE URGES HELP FOR QUAKE VICTIMS", "body_text": " **********Pope John Paul II delivered a Christmas appeal today for more aid to Armenian earthquake victims and for intensified scientific research in the battle against AIDS. **********The Pope issued the plea in his annual Christmas message, ''Urbi et Orbi'' - to the city and the world -and he later offered brief season's greetings in 45 languages. **********As usual, John Paul spoke from the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica, overlooking thousands of people who jammed the immense square. **********They were a mixture of the deeply pious and the merely curious. They were also a fraction of the Pope's true audience, for his remarks were carried in live and delayed broadcasts to millions of television viewers in 50 countries. For the first time, the Vatican said, the Christmas message was transmitted live to the Soviet Union, as was the midnight Mass that the Pope had celebrated earlier today. A Practical Theme **********In the 10 years that he has led the world's 850 million Roman Catholics, John Paul has struck various Christmas themes. Sometimes he has been political, sometimes pastoral, sometimes mystical. Today, his comments were practical and largely unadorned. **********''The poor,'' he said, ''under every label, old and new, have a place in the mystery of Christmas: those suffering and dying of hunger, the rejected, the disinherited, refugees, the victims of hatred, of wars, of natural disasters.'' **********He said he specifically had in mind the victims of this month's devastating earthquake in Armenia, who are ''now mourning their loved ones buried under the debris, keeping anxious watch at the bedside of the injured in hospitals, or struggling against the cold and the bad weather, without a roof under which to seek shelter for themselves and their children.'' **********''In this tragic hour,'' he said, ''may they experience the understanding and support of people of good will. ''May the world see an increase of the generous reaction which has mobilized governments, organizations and individuals in a wonderful chain of solidarity.'' 'Do Not Lose Hope' **********Moving to another dominant global issue, AIDS, John Paul said of its sufferers: ''I think of them all, and to all of them I say: Do not lose hope.'' **********Victims of acquired immune deficiency syndrome battle not only sickness, he said, but also ''the mistrust of a fearful society that instinctively turns away from them.'' **********''I invite everyone to take up the tragic burden of these brethren of ours,'' he said, ''and, as I assure them of my deep affection, I exhort scientists and researchers to increase their efforts to find an effective treatment for this mysterious illness.'' His desire for a cure was ''the hope that I lay at the crib of the newborn Saviour,'' he said. **********It was not the first time that the Pope had spoken emotionally about AIDS. On his United States trip last year, he hugged a 4-year-old victim in San Francisco, and declared that God loves AIDS sufferers ''without distinction, without limit.'' He has authorized an international conference on the disease to be held next year at the Vatican. **********John Paul, wearing vestments of gold and white, delivered his message after celebrating a Mass inside the basilica, his third within 12 hours. Earlier, he had presided at the traditional midnight Mass and at services after dawn in his private chapel. No Political Statements **********There were no overtly political statements from the Pope, who two days ago had received Yasir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and asserted that Israelis and Palestinians had ''an identical fundamental right to their own homelands.'' **********Twice, as he emerged onto the balcony and as he left, he was applauded by the multinational crowd. Some people drifted toward the center of St. Peter's Square as he spoke, to study a Nativity scene with life-size figures. **********Among them was an Italian girl of 4 or 5, who sat on a railing that surrounded the creche. She seemed troubled when the Pope retreated into the basilica, and asked her parents where he had gone. **********To distract her, the girl's mother urged her to look at St. Peter's bells, which had just begun to peal. The girl did, and she reacted openly the way many of those around seemed to feel within, clapping her hands in delight as the ringing swept across the square."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/22/business/key-rates-969788.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-01-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 196, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "KEY RATES", "print_headline": "KEY RATES", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/05/business/company-news-new-bausch-shield.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-02-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 174, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Bausch Shield", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; New Bausch Shield", "body_text": " **********Bausch & Lomb Inc., based in Rochester, said marketing of the first collagen corneal shield, which would deliver medication to the eye without blocking vision, would begin immediately, after approval last week by the Federal Food and Drug Administration.

''We always try for 20 minutes,'' a medic said. ''Usually, it doesn't work.'' **********Then, as relatives bustled the body away so that the Israeli Army could not claim it, another battle started around the hospital itself, besieged by Israeli soldiers, and Mr. Baw's brief claim on attention became no more than a statistic in an afternoon filled with statistics. **********The 22-year-old Palestinian died from a bullet that pierced his heart; he was one of three dead recorded by nightfall in another day of protest and violence in Israel's occupied territories. Death Toll Put at 72 **********The violence today, almost three months after the start of what Palestinians call the ''uprising,'' was timed to protest not just Israel's occupation, but the newest peace effort by Secretary of State George P. Shultz. **********The killings brought the death toll from beatings and gunfire to 72, apart from other fatalities with more ambiguous causes, like asphyxiation by tear gas that complicated existing respiratory ailments.

And secondly, we have shown that we want something for ourselves.'' **********This village, Halhul, lies 15 miles south of Jerusalem. A main highway fringed with shuttered stores runs through it, and the authorities want to keep it safe from rock-throwers. How the Battle Began **********After prayers in the mosque today, however, about 100 young Palestinians waving the red, white, black and green flag of the Palestine Liberation Organization advanced down a hill toward the road and faced their adversaries, a half-dozen Israeli soldiers with shields and rifles and tear-gas launchers. **********At first, it seemed there might be a stalemate - as there had been earlier in a similar protest at Beit Omar, when the two sides exchanged taunts and obscenities before the rocks and bullets began to fly. **********Then, at Halhul, Israeli reinforcements arrived and an advance began, pushing the Palestinians back toward the mosque with bursts of tear gas and gunfire. The soldiers wove through littered streets and olive groves and some of their adversaries fell, like Mr. el-Baw and Jemel Tewfik, 22, who took a bullet in his thigh. Relatives rushed him to the Alia hospital in Hebron in a small, white van. **********And then, as burning tires in many places in the area sent black smoke toward the sky, the battle seemed to shift to the hospital, where the youthful foot-soldiers of the struggle formed more barricades to prevent the army from taking the dead or identifying the wounded. Tear Gas Wafts in Hospital **********The army advanced up the rock-strewn hill leading to the hospital. Their foes hurled a barrage of stones, and rolled two bright yellow garbage dumpsters down toward them. And there was bedlam within, too. **********Four more of the wounded came from the battle outside, one with a finger missing, others unable to breathe because of tear gas fired in canisters of American manufacture. The army ringed the hospital while the retreating Palestinians hurled rocks over the hospital roof at them, eliciting tear gas and bullets in return. **********A French freelance photographer, bleeding and muttering about a ''bomb'' that had hurt him, fell into the emergency room, to be treated for a head cut. And the young men in their black-and-white head-dresses, faces swathed, came in, too, to grab and beat a man they called a spy or collaborator, while the doctors tried to look after the wounded. **********Outside a rifle cracked and another offered the duller sound of a tear-gas canister being launched from its barrel. The gas wafted into the hospital. Soldiers Advance **********The soldiers advanced toward the homes behind the hospital where their foes had taken refuge, and clambered their way through the groves, firing as they went until the stones stopped, two hours after they started. **********More wounded came in: Maher Sadi, 20, delivered by the soldiers with a neat, red hole in his chest, and Feras Soheir al-Sharabati, 15, with a bullet that entered in the lower abdomen and exited through his buttock. **********That left only the mopping-up. Six prisoners, hidden in sweaters pulled over their faces, were marched away, while Palestinian men pushed Palestinian women out of the hospital to keen and wail for them. **********The jeeps withdrew from the hospital courtyard, and the siege was lifted at 4:32 P.M., after soldiers came to the hospital door with clubs and ordered the women back inside. A quiet settled on the highways. **********In Halhul, a tire burned in a side road, and black smoke billowed. **********Out on the highway where it all started four hours earlier, a hurled rock smashed through the windshield of an Israeli car with yellow license plates.

Brookhurst paid an average price of $22.79 a share. **********The partnership will urge Zenith's management to take actions that would ''enhance stockholder value,'' Mr. Abelow said. One such action, he said, would be for Zenith to sell its money-losing consumer electronics division. **********Zenith, based in Glenview, Ill., had revenues last year of $2.3 billion. Its consumer electronics division makes color television sets, video recorders and other video products. Zenith is the only remaining American-owned manufacturer of color television sets. **********In recent months, Zenith has come under pressure from the investment community to sell its consumer electronics division. Zenith's sales of consumer electronics items were $1.1 billion in 1987, down 9 percent from the previous year, and operating earnings fell by $51 million from 1986. **********Battered by fierce pricing pressure from Asian competitors as well as falling demand, the division had a $19 million loss in the first quarter of 1988, compared with a $10 million loss for the period a year ago. Computer Unit Flourishing **********Analysts believe the company could earn as much as $3 a share this year if the division was sold, largely on the earnings strength of its flourishing computer systems and components group. **********If Zenith fails to take the steps recommended by the group, Mr. Abelow said, the partnership may try to gain control of the company through a bid or by electing representatives to the company's board. In its filing, the partnership said it did not consider itself a passive investor. **********However, there is ''not a high degree of probability'' that the group will make a bid for the company, Mr. Abelow said, adding that his group had no intention of eventually operating Zenith. **********Some analysts suggested that Brookhurst Partners might be trying to put the stock ''into play.'' That means creating a situation in which a company is rumored to be a takeover target, resulting in a quick rise in its stock price. Such action might also draw out the interest of other potential buyers. **********''With the stock as high as it is, I'm sure the arbs - including this latest group - are putting it into play,'' said Paul Valentine, an analyst with the Standard & Poor's Corporation. ''The stock has had a terrific move.'' Stock Rises to $29.25 **********Zenith's shares rose 87.5 cents today, to $29.25, more than 50 percent higher than they stood on April 25, when the group began buying Zenith stock at $18.50 a share. Based on an average price of $22.79 a share, the value of the Brookhurst Partners' position has already advanced nearly $12 million. **********''We are not in the stock for a quick run,'' Mr. Abelow said. ''Our analysis, and the available public information, leads us to believe Zenith's stock is undervalued. Our goal is to meet with Mr. Pearlman, and try to explain where the values are in the company, and discuss how to unlock them.'' Jerry K. Pearlman is Zenith's chairman and chief executive. **********Mr. Abelow said he telephoned Mr. Pearlman Tuesday evening to request a meeting. But he said Mr. Pearlman declined to schedule such a meeting. **********Mr. Pearlman declined to be interviewed, and a Zenith spokesman declined to comment on the partnership's stake. **********Zenith may be responding to pressure to sell. Last week, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represents 4,000 Zenith workers in two consumer electronics plants, said the company had invited bids for the troubled division with a deadline of last Friday. **********Earlier this month, the company said that it was continuing to explore all options to improve corporate profitability. Some of those options involve discussions with other companies regarding its consumer electronics business, Zenith said. **********Mr. Abelow and Mr. Ihasz are co-managers of Abelow Ihasz & Company, a New York investment firm. Mr. Abelow is a former managing director of the First Boston Corporation in charge of its proprietary trading; Mr. Ihasz directed the floor trading operations of Ivan F. Boesky & Company in the late 1970's before founding N. L. Ihasz & Company in 1982. **********Abelow Ihasz engages in risk arbitrage, as well as other types of investments in stocks. Risk arbitrage is a financial transaction based on buying or selling stock in connection with corporate mergers, acquisitions, recapitalizations and restructurings. **********Arbitragers, for example, may buy the stock of a company that they believe is vulnerable to takeover, in hopes that a raider will emerge and drive up the price.

But the Supreme Court then ruled that jurisdiction in the case, at least in terms of the welfare of Juliana, rested with the federal court in the Moron suburb that had awarded custody to the Fontanas. **********But the Moron judge had resigned shortly after the decision about Juliana, and when the Supreme Court sent the case back there, a different judge was on the bench. Judge Alejandro Sanudo accepted the genetic evidence that Juliana had been born to Liliana Fontana and Pedro Sandoval but ruled that she belonged to the Trevinos now, with visiting rights for the biological grandparents. Demonstrators at Court **********Ruben Fontana stood outside the courthouse with a poster of his daughter Liliana all day Aug. 28 as the judge deliberated and, when he heard the decision, called Judge Sanudo ''an accomplice of the dictatorship.'' **********He was backed by several hundred demonstrators from human rights groups, including the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, the group that searches for children who were born in captivity or kidnapped along with their parents during the military era. The genetic bank of the Grandmothers organization established the link between Juliana and the Fontana and Sandoval families. **********Judge Sanudo waited until almost dawn the next day, when many of the demonstrators had left, to have the police escort Juliana to a waiting car to take her to the Trevinos home. **********But the issue is not over. The Grandmothers group, which represents the Fontanas, plans to appeal the decision to a higher court. The Trevinos plan to proceed with their challenge to the genetic evidence - on the basis of the four-month difference between Juliana's believed birth date and the probable date that Liliana would have given birth. Counted Among Kidnapped **********Until she was returned to the Trevinos, the Grandmothers counted Juliana as the 48th child kidnapped or born in captivity between 1976 and 1978 who had been restored to the natural parents or other surviving family members. The organization is searching for at least 150 other such children. **********The drama of these children and their families became known around the world through the movie ''Official Story,'' which won the Academy Award for best foreign film in 1986. **********Unlike the fictional situation in the film, in which the adoptive father was a collaborator of the former military regime and apparently knew the enfant girl had been born in prison, the Trevinos had no known ties to the military Government and followed normal adoption procedures. **********Judge Sanudo said he was influenced by the fact that ''the Trevinos always acted in good faith.'' He said, ''They were not participants in the kidnapping and it was they who began the search for the biological parents.'' Decided on Testing **********The Trevinos said in an interview that they had known that ''horrible things'' occurred in the mid- and late-1970's but had not realized that babies had been taken from mothers at birth until the writer Ernesto Sabato made the accusation at a news conference in the early 1980's. **********Later, after the Grandmothers had established the genetic bank, the Trevinos decided for ''reassurance'' to have Juliana tested, without telling her why. **********The genetic bank analyzes certain molecules in each person's blood that are passed from parents to children. In this case, blood samples were studied from the parents of both Liliana Fontana and Pedro Sandoval, brothers and sisters of the dead couple, the two sons of Pedro Sandoval by a previous marriage, and Juliana herself. **********Dr. Ana Maria Di Lonardo, director of the genetic bank at the Durand Hospital, which tested Juliana, the Fontanas and the family of Pedro Sandoval, would not discuss the specific case but insisted on the near infallibility of genetic analysis. Margin of Error Discussed' **********''It is true that in these studies we speak of statistical probability,'' she said, ''but when we reach a probability of 99.99 percent, the margin of error is almost nonexistent.'' **********Both families have tried to keep Juliana from public view since the controversy arose, but each has asserted that she is, or was, happiest in its care. What's Best for Her?  But Juliana's situation, unlike that of other children found by the Grandmothers so far, has raised public debate in Argentina about whether the child's interests are served by immediately handing him or her over to blood relatives not known to them. **********Dr. Horacio Repetto, a prominent Buenos Aires pediatrian, said: ''Beyond the biological question, I think it is necessary to think about the person. No one is taking into account the personal situation. There is a total dehumanization in all of these cases.'' **********For the Trevinos, the ''nightmare is over'' now, but the Fontanas said the day after losing Juliana that they were ''too tired and anguished'' to speak."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/04/world/israeli-army-decides-to-deport-9-arabs-in-wake-of-rioting.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Friedman", "pub_date": "1988-01-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1430, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Israeli Army Decides To Deport 9 Arabs In Wake of Rioting", "print_headline": "Israeli Army Decides To Deport 9 Arabs In Wake of Rioting", "body_text": " **********The Israeli Army announced today that it would permanently expel nine Palestinian nationalists arrested during the riots of the last three weeks. **********The army accused the nine of being the ''chief instigators'' of the recent unrest and called them senior organizers for the Palestine Liberation Organization or Moslem fundamentalist groups in the occupied territories. **********It could take up to a month before they are actually forced to leave Israeli-controlled territory because they have the right to appeal the decision in the Israeli courts. **********Shortly after the decision to expel them was announced, an Israeli soldier who had been sent to quell a demonstration outside Jerusalem shot a 25-year-old Palestinian woman to death. **********The woman, Haniya Suleiman Zarawneh, was shot in the chest as she was hanging laundry in her front yard in a Palestinian refugee district of Al Ram, on the main highway about five miles north of Jerusalem. **********The Israeli soldier was apparently firing his rifle in an uncontrolled manner as he chased stone-throwing Palestinian youths through the village. One bullet hit the Palestinian woman and two bullet holes were found in the door to her house. The army suspended the soldier and his platoon commander while military policemen investigated an apparent violation of orders that bar troops from opening fire unless their lives are in danger. **********Miss Zarawneh was the 23d Palestinian shot dead by Israeli troops since demonstrations in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza began on Dec. 9. **********The Israeli Government decided to expel the nine Palestinian nationalists despite repeated warnings from the United States not to take such a step because it would further inflame the situation and might complicate relations between Israel and Egypt. **********Reacting to the American pressure, Prime Minister Yithzak Shamir declared Friday: ''It is impossible to dictate to someone from afar how to defend oneself against anarchy, riots and attacks on the state. It seems to me that the American public needs to understand the problems of a democratic state defending itself against anti-democratic elements that want to destroy it.'' **********It is not clear into which neighboring country Israel will try to expel the nine. Egypt and Jordan have said they would refuse to accept anyone expelled by Israel. In the past, most expulsions have been to Jordan and southern Lebanon. #100 Released From Jail At the same time as it announced the expulsions, the Israeli Army said it was immediately setting free about 100 other Palestinian demonstrators from the West Bank and Gaza who had been arrested. The army spokesman said they had given ''assurances that they would not return to their evil ways.'' **********More than 1,000 Palestinians have been detained by the Israeli Army since Dec. 9. About 80 have been tried in the Israeli military courts and sentenced to prison terms ranging from one to eight months. **********In Al Ram, the Israeli Army spokesman said, about 20 Palestinian boys gathered along the road this morning and began pelting Israeli cars with stones. **********An Israeli Army patrol arrived and a soldier began chasing the youths from the highway into the jumble of houses that make up the neighborhood. **********Residents in the village told reporters later that a lone Israeli soldier was chasing a boy between the houses and firing his rifle at the same time. One bullet hit Miss Zarawneh, who was not involved in the demonstration. **********After the killing, residents of the area began rioting, burning tires and throwing stones. A large force of Israeli soldiers wielding night sticks and firing tear gas restored order. 'Not According to Regulations' **********Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, the military commander for the area that includes the West Bank, rushed to the scene to calm residents of the area. He told reporters that the shooting ''was not according to regulations'' and that the ''military unit was not acting as it should have acted.'' **********The shooting showed once more how explosive the situation remains in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, even though the army had declared the area ''quiet'' as a result of the presence on the streets of hundreds of extra Israeli troops. **********The nine Palestinians ordered expelled by Israel were all described by the army spokesman as ''leading activists and organizers involved in incitement and subversive activity on behalf of the terrorist organizations.'' **********Most of them, the army said, were former prisoners who had served long jail sentences for ''terrorist activity and incitement'' but had not been deterred by their previous jail terms. Some had been set free from prison as a result of a prisoner exchange in May 1985 between Israel and the Palestinian guerrillas. **********There was no way to independently confirm the army's accusations, particularly since the army describes as ''terrorist activities'' virtually any Palestinian nationalist organizing, whether violent or just political, that supports the P.L.O. **********The army identified the nine Palestinians as Furayj Ahmad Khayri, 39, vice-chairman of the Palestinian engineers' union in the Gaza Strip; Adil Nafa Hamad, 27, from the Kalandia refugee center in the West Bank; Husam Uthman Mohammed Hadar, 26, of the Balata refugee center near Nablus; Bashir Ahmad Khayri, a 45-year-old lawyer from Ramallah; Jamal Mohammed Jabara, 28, from the Qalqilya refugee center in the West Bank; Mohammed Abu Samara, 26, a student at the Islamic University of Gaza; Khalil Kuka, a 39-year-old teacher in Gaza and a leader of a local Moslem Brotherhood fundamentalist organization; Hasan Ghanim Abu Shakra, 37, a prominent religious fundamentalist from Khan Yunis in the Gaza Strip, and Jibril Mahmud Rajub, 34, a Palestinian journalist from the West Bank village of Dura and the author of a book on conditions in Israeli jails. **********Officials here said the nine were being expelled under provisions of a law that was adopted in 1945 under the British Mandate and was kept by Israel when it declared its independence in 1948. The law permits deportations for the purposes of ''securing the public safety, the defense of Palestine, the maintenance of public order or the suppression of mutiny, rebellion or riots.'' **********This appeared to be at variance, however, with a statement by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres in an interview on American television today. He said the expulsions were being ordered under Jordanian laws in use in the West Bank, rather than Israeli law, which he said does not permit deportation. A Right of Appeal **********The nine have the right to appeal their expulsions to an advisory committee headed by a military court judge. If that fails, they can go to the Israeli Supreme Court. The appeal process could take as much as a month. **********Of 22 Palestinians ordered expelled since August 1985, 19 had their appeals rejected and three are still pending. **********The Israeli radio asked Yosef Ben-Aharon, the director general of the Prime Minister's office, what would happen if no Arab country accepts those to be expelled. **********''I trust that the Israeli Army and the Defense Minister will find a place,'' he said. ''If there is a decision to expel, we will find a place.'' **********Asked why the army could not try the men and imprison them if they are found guilty, a senior army official said expulsions were the best deterrent to anyone who might be thinking of becoming a Palestinian nationalist organizer. He said putting these men on trial would also have endangered Palestinian informers and jeopardized some intelligence-gathering methods.  Peres Defends Expulsions **********WASHINGTON, Jan. 3 - Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of Israel defended the decision today to deport the nine Palestinians, saying it was proper under the laws that govern the occupied West Bank. **********''The Israeli Government or the Israeli Army is operating under two different laws: the Israeli law that does not permit deportation, and the Jordan law, which recognizes deportation as a very important punishment,'' Mr. Peres said on the ABC news program ''This Week.'' He was in Jerusalem and was interviewed from here via satellite. **********Mr. Peres said that since Israel does not permit capital punishment in the occupied territories, ''the most we can do is to deport in accordance with the law of the land, the law of the West Bank.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/26/business/the-media-business-advertising-klp-group-strengthens-operations.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1988-07-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 689, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; KLP Group Strengthens Operations", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; KLP Group Strengthens Operations", "body_text": " **********KLP GROUP P.L.C., a London-based international network of sales promotion companies, yesterday completed takeover deals in New York and San Francisco.

Bruce Crawford, who has been general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, is returning to the ad agency business as president and chief executive of Omnicom. He succeeds Allen G. Rosenshine, who will step down to resume the BBDO Worldwide chairmanship. **********Both men are going back to careers they loved but left. **********Mr. Rosenshine, who is 49 years old, joined Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborne in 1965 and rose from junior copywriter to president within 15 years. He became chairman of BBDO Worldwide in 1985 when Mr. Crawford left for the Met. **********When BBDO, Needham Harper Worldwide and Doyle Dane Bernbach decided to merge a year later, Mr. Rosenshine, who had been a strong manager, was the natural choice to direct the new holding company. **********But at heart Mr. Rosenshine, a man whose reserved exterior masks a droll wit, remained an agency man with a creative soul. Charles G. Crane, a communications industry analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities, recalled serving with him on a recent panel sponsored by the Association of National Advertisers. **********Mr. Crane said Mr. Rosenshine nodded in his direction, noted with mock displeasure how often he had to deal with the likes of Mr. Crane and said: ''My true love is copywriting. In my heart I am a copywriter.'' **********In a weekend interview, Mr. Rosenshine said: ''My instincts and my gut and my upbringing in this business were with clients. The opportunities to deal with clients from the Omnicom position were limited. I wanted to be part of the process again - the marketing communications process, agency-client relationships.'' **********Mr. Crawford apparently did not harbor an overt desire to come back. ''I certainly never believed honestly that I'd ever return to advertising,'' he said this weekend. ''But I never thought I'd go to the Met and be general manager. I'm not one of these people with a calendar of how I'll lead my life.'' **********But it was Mr. Crawford, now 59, who built BBDO into an international powerhouse. During his term as chief executive, from 1977 to 1985, the agency's billings quadrupled, to $2.5 billion. He acquired some two dozen foreign agencies and a slew of specialty communications firms with expertise in direct marketing, financial services and promotion. **********These areas are the basis of Omnicom's future. Last year the holding company's overseas revenues grew more than 20 percent, or more than twice as much as domestic growth. This year's pattern is the same. Diversified Agency Services, the Omnicom network of specialty communications agencies, is also considered a key to the company's growth. ''The next phase will be much more oriented toward developing the networks' client services in a competitive way,'' Mr. Rosenshine said. **********But in the eyes of many, Diversified Agency Services has not been efficient. Even Mr. Crawford said, ''It does suggest a grab bag.'' **********Mr. Crawford's coming home will enable him to complete the task he started - building a global company able to offer a vast array of integrated marketing services - on a greater scale than he could have at the time he left. This is grand opera. **********And while it would be wrong to suggest that Mr. Rosenshine is returning to light opera, he is getting what he acknowledges was a recently denied wish: to sing in the chorus again."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/25/business/company-news-sale-of-real-estate-by-first-interstate.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-02-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 176, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sale of Real Estate By First Interstate", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Sale of Real Estate By First Interstate", "body_text": " **********A subsidiary of First Interstate Bancorp said it had put up for sale $165 million worth of property, or about 24 percent of its portfolio of nonperforming real estate assets.

Bond investors feel this will force the Federal Reserve to stimulate the economy by pumping more reserves into the banking system. **********In theory, the increased reserves would cause interest rates to decline and push up the prices of existing debt. As it is, interest rates have plunged this week, despite the Fed's less-than-accommodating posture.

''But don't expect the Fed's Open Market Committee, which meets next Tuesday, to do more than just tilt in favor of easing credit.'' **********Aside from political considerations in this Presidential election year, Mr. Kellner continued, ''the Fed can't just press buttons to stave off an economic downturn.'' He added, ''At best, the Fed can only directly influence short-term rates, and the bond market knows this.'' **********As far as the length of a recession, Mr. Kellner forecast the following scenario for the year: **********''The growth rate of the gross national product in the first quarter should slow to 3.4 percent from 4.2 percent in the last quarter of 1987. The growth will slow to 2.3 percent in the second quarter, 1.1 percent in the third and seven-tenths of 1 percent in the final three months of 1988.'' **********Jonathan B. Greenspan, chief government securities trader at the Aegis Capital Management Corporation, agreed that the behavior of the bond market this week confirmed this gloomy scenario, saying that ''it made believers out of the dwindling ranks of bearish fund managers.'' **********''What particularly impressed many today was the lack of profit taking for the weekend or the usual position balancing by major institutions before a refunding,'' Mr. Greenspan noted. ''While business activity overall was only moderate, there was a generous flow of positive news to encourage buyers. This included a firmer dollar, a huge 3 percent drop in gold bullion prices and a crumbling of the prices of many basic food and industrial commodities.'' 90-Day Bills at 5.63% At the short end of the Treasury market, the discount rate on 90-day bills fell five basis points, to 5.63 percent; the companion six-month issue lost four basis pounts, at 6.02 percent, and the one-year bills were down six basis points, to 6.23 percent.

And it seems there are few mechanics who can determine the cause. The General Motors Corporation, which has 11,000 dealerships, has only one expert, Frank Pavlovcic, in all facets of vibration problems. **********But now, using artificial intelligence technology, Teknowledge Inc., a software company based here, has created a program that will give any service technician Mr. Pavlovcic's knowledge and diagnostic technique. Called an expert system, the software employs the same method of diagnosing problems by analyzing a vibration that Mr. Pavlovcic (pronounced pav-LO-sic) developed at General Motors' Noise and Vibration Lab in Detroit. **********As automobiles have become more sophisticated, the problems confronting mechanics have become more baffling. Industry sources say the available diagnostic tools, which typically can only report malfunctioning electronic parts, have lagged behind the development of the electronics in cars. **********The newest diagnostic systems, however, take a step forward, incorporating an expert's ability to analyze symptoms and recommend specific tests and repairs. **********Besides the G.M. system, the Ford Motor Company is testing an expert system in some dealerships for the Lincoln Continental. And such computerized mechanic's aids are likely to become more common in years to come. **********To develop the General Motors program, which should reach dealers and independent service operators this summer, Teknowledge brought Mr. Pavlovcic to Palo Alto for two weeks of brain-picking. Using what they call a ''case-directed method,'' company specialists worked to transfer to floppy disks not only Mr. Pavlovcic's skills, but also the logic and rules-of-thumb he uses to solve problems. **********''People look at a situation and form an idea that eliminates other ideas,'' said Lee Sigler, a product manager at Teknowledge. ''We find even with experts in very complex fields that there really are a very few patterns that they follow.'' **********Instead, it directs a mechanic through a series of questions and an-swers, suggesting tests and proce-dures, and analyzing results until it arrives at a conclusion. Although it can interpret data from a reed ta-chometer - tuning fork-like device that detects the frequency of vibra-tions - it also comfortable with subjective terms that a customer might use, such as ''buzz'' or ''boom.'' **********''Given the same information, its reasoning processes are the same as mine,'' Mr. Pavlovcic said. ''I know exactly what the machine is going to do next.'' Because the machine never forgets, and is never tempted to take shortcuts, Mr. Pavlovcic said it had shown him up on occasion. **********Although the program is largely self-explanatory, vibration problems are complex and relatively rare, so mechanics may need some initial training, he added. **********Given that instruction, ''you can take a mechanic with minimal experience and, by using the CAMS system, put the kind of knowledge at his disposal that a mechanic with 20 years' experience has,'' said Anthony P. Molla, technical editor of Chilton's Motor/Age, a trade publication. But he added that the program's tutorial approach was ''a double-edged sword.'' He said, ''For an experienced mechanic the process will actually slow him down.'' **********But the inclusion of rapidly changing sophisticated technology in automobiles is ending that. An intermittent circuit in a computerized ignition system is less easily deduced by intuition than a set of burned ignition points in a distributor. Similarly, problems caused by emission controls have been largely cured by such advances as programmed fuel injection, but trouble-shooting such a system calls upon far different skills than adjusting a carburetor. **********Ford is testing an expert system developed with the Carnegie Group Inc., an artificial intelligence company in Pittsburgh, to get at the cause of so-called engine-stumble problems. **********Now undergoing field tests at selected dealerships on the 1988 Lincoln Continental, the program, called the Service Bay Diagnostic System, is expected to be used for all Ford cars and trucks by the early 1990's. **********Using a portable computer built by the Hewlett-Packard Company, the system hooks up to the vehicle's computers, finds the source of a problem, and then generates appropriate graphics and repair procedures. **********Because it taps into the memory of the automobile's electronic engine control system, Ford's system can better diagnose the intermittent problems that occur on the road but disappear when the car is brought in for service. **********''With the increased reliance on electronics, the technician was taken out of the picture, simply because the human mind couldn't interpret the devices used on automobiles,'' said Jim Armitaje, technical editor of Motor Service magazine. ''Because you have computer devices in the car, you need another computer to interpret problems, and transform the information into a format a technician can understand.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/13/world/key-road-blocked-afghan-rebels-say.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "1988-11-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 586, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "KEY ROAD BLOCKED, AFGHAN REBELS SAY", "print_headline": "KEY ROAD BLOCKED, AFGHAN REBELS SAY", "body_text": " **********Afghan guerrillas said today that they had blocked the road north from Kabul to the Soviet border in an offensive that killed 20 Soviet soldiers. **********The road, the Salang Highway, is important in supplying Kabul with arms and other supplies, and also as an exit route for heavy Soviet equipment. **********There was no independent confirmation of the report, issued by the Islamic Society guerrilla organization, which said five guerrillas had been killed in the fighting.

Challenging the Giants **********Together, A.T.&T. and Sun, which announced a cooperative technology development agreement in October, hope to create a major new camp in the computer industry that will challenge the two industry giants: the International Business Machines Corporation and the Digital Equipment Corporation. **********Under the agreement, Sun will sell A.T.&T. a 15 percent stake consisting of newly issued shares at a price 25 percent above market value. The sales will occur over the next three years at a schedule to be determined by Sun, subject to certain deadlines. A.T.&T. can buy the remaining 5 percent in the open market. **********At today's prices, A.T.&T.'s investment in Sun would amount to about $300 million, the companies said. A.T.&T. will also get a seat on Sun's board and will nominate Vittorio Cassoni, president of its data systems group, to fill it. Sun Stock Price Jumps **********Analysts generally praised the deal as good for both companies. Sun's stock price rose $2.25, closing at $36.75, while A.T.&T.'s finished down 25 cents, at $28.25. **********For Sun, which is based in Mountain View, Calif., the agreement provides attractive financing and protection from an unwanted takeover. ''It adds so much security in terms of our ability to execute our plans,'' Joseph A. Graziano, Sun's chief financial officer, said in an interview. **********A.T.&T. has agreed to increase its stake in Sun to no more than 20 percent for 10 years. However, if Sun sells a larger stake to another company, A.T.&T. will be able to increase its share to the same level. **********Moreover, Mr. Graziano said, if someone makes a tender offer for at least 40 percent of Sun's stock, A.T.&T. would be released from its standstill agreement and could end up with control of Sun. He said Sun was unaware of any plans for a hostile bid. The Credibility Factor **********The association with A.T.&T. could also help give Sun more legitimacy. ''It lends more credibility and more maturity to a company that, if it suffers from anything, suffers from an image of daredevil graduate students willing to try anything,'' said Richard A. Shaffer, publisher of the Technologic Computer Letter, an industry newsletter. **********Still, the agreement could limit Sun's ability to strike alliances with other companies that view themselves as competitors of A.T.&T. ''It's strategically going to hamper Sun, not help Sun,'' said Vinod Khosla, a founder of Sun who is no longer with the company but remains one of its largest shareholders. ''Two or three years ago this might have been a good deal, but I don't think Sun needs the credibility now.'' **********The deals allows A.T.&T. to tighten its link with a company that has been as successful in computers as A.T.&T. has been a disappointment. ''It's much better to invest money externally into companies that, frankly, know what they are doing,'' said Jack B. Grubman, an analyst at Paine Webber Inc. Previous Joint Ventures **********A.T.&T. and Sun announced in October a cooperative agreement in which the companies would work together to develop a unified version of Unix, a computer operating system that was developed by A.T.&T. and is used by Sun. A.T.&T. also said it would develop computers based on a new microprocessor developed by Sun, which uses technology known as reduced-instruction-set computing, or RISC. **********By investing in Sun, A.T.&T. protects a company upon which it will be vitally dependent in the future. In some ways, analysts said, the investment resembles one I.B.M. made a few years ago in the Intel Corporation, a company whose microprocessor was the basis for the I.B.M. personal computer line. I.B.M. has since sold its Intel stake, but the investment gave Intel the capital it needed to develop future versions of the microprocessor and protected the chip maker from a takeover by an I.B.M. competitor. **********While the bureaucratic and tradition-laden A.T.&T. differs from the upstart and impulsive Sun, they share a common philosophy when it comes to computers. Both emphasize the importance of communications among computers. More importantly, both believe in the Unix operating system, which controls the inner workings of a computer and can work across a broad range of computers. The Attraction of Unix **********Once the different variants of Unix are unified, a program for tasks like accounting and electronic design that runs on one Unix machine will run on all others. By contrast, I.B.M. mainframes and Digital Equipment minicomputers use proprietary operating systems - programs written for those machines cannot run on others. Sun and A.T.&T. both hope Unix will appeal to corporate computer buyers because it frees them from dependence on one manufacturer. **********A.T.&T., which spun off its local telephone companies in 1984 to gain a free hand in the computer business, has stumbled badly. Mr. Grubman of Paine Webber estimates that A.T.&T.'s computer operations lost $1 billion before taxes on revenues of just below $1 billion in 1986. A.T.&T. would not release specific figures but said its losses in 1987 were one-third of those in 1986. Mr. Grubman said, however, that the improvement came mainly from cost cutting, not increased revenues. **********A.T.&T. has linked with other computer companies with mixed success. The most important tie was with Olivetti of Italy, which makes the personal computers sold by A.T.&T. And Counterpoint Computers, a start-up, was supposed to supply A.T.&T. with work stations but did not succeed as planned. Sun's Rapid Growth **********Sun has grown meteorically to $500 million in annual revenues since its founding in 1982 by two computer science graduate students and two freshly minted graduates of Stanford University's business school, including Scott McNealy, Sun's current president. Its main products have been high-performance work stations, a market in which Sun recently took the lead (in revenues) from Apollo Computer Inc. **********Customers bought Sun's machines because of their power, because of their ability to connect with other machines in networks and because of the Unix operating system. Customers realized that if someone else came out with a more powerful Unix machine, they could switch and still use their software. While that helps Sun sell machines, it also keeps pressure on Sun to update its machines. Sun can lose customers much more easily than a company with a proprietary operating system, like I.B.M., Digital or Apple Computer. **********Sun has made no secret of its hopes to expand beyond work stations. It recently announced its own microprocessor, which was the basis for new and even more powerful machines that challenge the minicomputers sold by Digital. **********Sun also slashed the price of its least expensive work station to under $5,000, bringing it into competition with the more powerful personal computers made by I.B.M., Compaq and Apple. Sun is expected to introduce soon a computer based on the Intel 80386 operating system, which could help it move farther away from the technical market and into the general business computer market."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/22/business/consumer-prices-rise-0.4-again.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-09-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1035, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Consumer Prices Rise 0.4% Again", "print_headline": "Consumer Prices Rise 0.4% Again", "body_text": " **********The Consumer Price Index, the nation's most widely followed inflation gauge, rose in August by four-tenths of 1 percent, the same as in July, the Labor Department reported today. **********Sizable increases for gasoline, many grocery items, used cars and auto financing were partly offset by a huge drop for clothing and lesser declines for meats, fish and household fuels. **********The report, which was largely as expected, served to reinforce the view that inflation, though rising a bit this year, is unlikely to climb to worrisome levels. The new figures make it less likely that the Federal Reserve Board will raise interest rates in the weeks before Nov. 8, Election Day. **********The August increase, if maintained and compounded for a year, would mean inflation of 5.2 percent. Comment From Economist **********''For the consumer it's good news - no worsening of inflation,'' said Joseph G. Carson, senior economist at the Chemical Bank. **********Today's report also indicates that tens of millions of people who receive Social Security and other Government benefits will get raises of about 4 percent in January. The exact figure will be determined by what happens to prices this month. **********This summer's severe drought and hot weather continued to push up food prices in August as cereal and baked goods rose 1.6 percent, the largest increase since January 1981. **********But most analysts said the main effects of the drought appeared to be over, except perhaps for a surge in meat prices expected in 1989. Meat prices fell at the height of the drought as cattle were rushed to market. As a result, supplies are likely to be smaller in coming months. Comparison of Food Prices **********Retail food prices advanced eight-tenths of 1 percent in August, slightly more than in June but down from July's 1.4 percent jump. About 90 percent of the increase involved items affected by the drought - fruits, vegetables, grains, poultry and eggs. **********Fruits and vegetables were up 1.3 percent, compared with a 2.9 percent rise in July. Eggs, however, surged 8.4 percent in August, poultry was up 2.1 percent and fats and oils rose 2 percent, twice as much as in July. **********Patrick C. Jackman, the Labor Department economist who supervises the montlhy report, said that, over all, ''the numbers look reasonably good'' and can be expected to remain so since prices of some major items, including gasoline, have moved down since the August survey. **********Thomas F. Carpenter, vice president of ASB Capital Management Inc., a Washington money manager, called the increase in the C.P.I.-U, which covers all urban consumers, ''a good number.'' If the volatile food and energy components were excluded, he noted, the rise would be a mere two-tenths of 1 percent. **********This so-called core rate of inflation was held down by a 1.6 percent drop in the price of apparel. Explanations for Apparel **********Carl Priestland, chief economist for the American Apparel Manufacturers Association, called this decline ''an abnormality'' that might be partly explained by the weather. Some analysts suggested that high temperatures led clothing retailers to delay introducing higher-priced fall goods to clear summer stocks. **********But Mr. Jackman of the Labor Department rejected such theories. He maintained that the August price decline, as reported, reflected a change in data-collection procedures: new fall lines are now recorded later than they were in the past. The old seasonal adjustment factors, meanwhile, are modified only over a period of several years. **********Another procedural change, however, had the opposite effect. Some increases in college tuition were picked up earlier than before, and a 2.2 percent rise in tuition and other school fees accounted for more than two-thirds of the August increase in the lightly weighted ''other goods and services'' category. Costs of Housing Steady **********In housing, which accounts for 42 percent of the Consumer Price Index, the rise was the same three-tenths of 1 percent recorded for every month since January. Higher home-maintenance, water and sewer and out-of-town lodging costs were offset to a large extent by price declines for natural gas, fuel oil, electricity and telephone services. **********The transportation component, 17 percent of the index, jumped nine-tenths of 1 percent after a four-tenths of 1 percent rise in July. More than half of the August increase came from gasoline, which rose 3 percent, the most in 12 months. That reflected stronger-than-usual summer driving. But gasoline prices are likely to drop in coming months because the price of crude oil has continued to slide. **********There were also 1.5 percent increases in the cost of used cars and auto financing and an eight-tenths of 1 percent rise in auto insurance. **********Medical care, up four-tenths of 1 percent, and entertainment, up two-tenths of 1 percent, rose a bit more slowly than in July. Annual Rate of Inflation **********The C.P.I.-U has now climbed at a 4.6 percent annual rate over the first eight months of the year, compared with a 4.4 percent increase for the 12 months of 1987. **********Before rounding, the C.P.I.-U rose 0.42194 last month, a rate that if maintained and compounded for a year would produce inflation of 5.2 percent. **********Commodity prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent in August, which was less than the five-tenths of 1 percent increase in July. Prices of services rose four-tenths of 1 percent, the same as in June and July. **********The C.P.I.-W, covering urban wage earners and clerical workers, is the index used for indexing Government benefits. It rose four-tenths of 1 percent in August, the same as in July. Over the last 12 months the increase has been 3.9 percent. **********Today's report showed San Francisco-Oakland with the highest August price rise - nine-tenths of 1 percent - of any of the five metropolitan areas for which figures are published on a monthly basis. Philadelphia prices rose six-tenths of 1 percent, New York five-tenths, Los Angeles four-tenths and Chicago three-tenths."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/01/business/company-news-sale-at-enron-unit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-11-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 159, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sale at Enron Unit", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Sale at Enron Unit", "body_text": " **********The Enron Oil and Gas Company, a Houston-based subsidiary of the Enron Corporation, and the American Exploration Company, also of Houston, have signed a letter of intent for American Exploration to buy certain Enron gas properties in Texas for $120 million.

Shultz's Middle East mission neared an end without moving the region's leaders closer to the negotiating table.  [ Page A8. ]  'Very Serious Incident' **********Dozens of armed settlers were camped tonight at the entrance to this village, vowing to build a new settlement here in the dead girl's name. **********''This is a very serious incident, and if the matter is not properly attended to at this time, I don't think it will be possible to stop any Jew from taking matters into his own hands,'' said Benny Katzover, one of the settlers' leaders. ''Today, the Arab population dares to attack Jews at every opportunity, and this is the bankrupt situation we have arrived at.'' **********At least 122 Palestinians have been killed in clashes with Israelis in nearly four months, and three others have died in incidents involving charges of collaboration. In addition to Miss Porat, one other Israeli, a soldier, has been slain; he was shot on guard duty by an assailant. Some Details Unclear **********Some details of the circumstances surrounding the girl's stoning death were left unclear today because the only accounts immediately available were from young survivors - many of them still in a state of shock - who gave fragmentary, confused versions. **********It appeared that the 18 young settlers, two of them acting as guards with an M-16 rifle and an Uzi submachine gun, were surrounded by a crowd of stone-throwing Palestinian youths outside this hillside village south of Nablus early this afternoon. The Israeli youths were brought into the village, where, they said, a local Arab elder at first sought to restore calm. **********But pandemonium broke out, according to several of the Jewish youths, when a woman rushed out and slammed a big rock down on the head of one of the Israeli guards. **********The results, at least, were grimly clear. Miss Porat's skull was crushed by repeated blows, apparently from stones, military officials said tonight. Hospital officials in Nablus reported that two Palestinian youths, Hatem Fayez Ahmed, 19, and Mousa Abu Shalseh, 20, died of gunshot wounds. Fourteen other Israelis were wounded, including one who was in critical condition tonight, and two other Palestinians were reported to be seriously wounded. Palestinians Seize Guns **********At some point, apparently in the village, the Palestinians took the guns from the Israeli guards and broke them, said Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, commander of the West Bank. He said the army had recovered the smashed Uzi and part of the M-16. **********''Many stones were thrown at the children, who were also beaten,'' General Mitzna said. ''As a result, the girl was killed and two or three of the teen-age hikers were seriously injured.'' **********The army's chief of staff, Lieut. Gen. Dan Shomron, who went to the scene, said: ''When they walked inside the village, there was an attempt to grab the weapon from the security guard. Already, on the road, he had fired some shots - I don't know if in the air or he had hit some people. In any case, in the middle of the village there developed an all-out assault.'' **********General Shomron continued: ''I want to note that during this event there were locals who tried to protect the children from the others, and even women who hid the girls in some groves and other places to prevent the mob from hurting them. Another group chased away the mob.''  [ Arab witnesses said the clash was provoked by the Israeli settlers, The Associated Press reported from Jerusalem. They said the Israeli guards fired on Arab villagers outside Beita, killing a 19-year-old Palestinian who was plowing his fields.  [ ''When villagers heard a farmer was killed, they attacked the settlers with axes, picks and rocks,'' said Mohammed Abbas Aly, 20, who said he was in the field when the clash occurred, according to The A.P. ]  Village Under Curfew Hundreds of Israeli soldiers poured into the area, fanning out to hunt for any lost Jewish youths. Military helicopters flew overhead. The army put the village under curfew, and by nightfall had ordered all men into the village square for questioning. **********The army also blocked off the Elon Moreh settlement, the home of the Jewish youths, northeast of Nablus. Generals Shomron and Mitzna rushed from the Arab village to Elon Moreh in an effort to calm the settlers. **********''The Arabs are bloodthirsty,'' a settler shouted from his car to journalists who were turned away by armed settlers with walkie-talkies. ''They show only cruelty. They're vicious. They're people who can't be trusted.'' End to Shultz Meetings Urged **********Angry, armed settlers, some carrying Israeli flags, were arguing with soldiers who had pulled a jeep and a truck across the steep road up to the hilltop settlement; the settlers were demanding to be let out. Tonight, other settlers demonstrated outside the homes of Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and other officials, demanding tougher policies toward the Palestinians and an end to meetings with Mr. Shultz. **********Poignant scenes on Israeli television tonight, showing Miss Porat's body on a stretcher being loaded into an ambulance and another young woman from the group sobbing uncontrollably, seemed certain to increase the tensions between Israelis and Palestinians. **********The Religious Affairs Minister, Zevulun Hammer, called on the army to ''cut off the arms of these wild men and smash the skull of the viper of death.'' **********His wrath was widely shared among the religious nationalists of the settler movement, who have already mounted patrols and raided Palestinian villages in retaliation for stone-throwing. **********''It's a most severe anger, I would say anger that is unstoppable,'' said Mr. Katzover, the settlement leader, a resident of Elon Moreh, whose daughter was in the group of hikers. **********Asked what could be done to calm people down, he replied: **********''It's not clear to me that we must intervene in the natural emotions of the public. A lot depends on the army and the Government. Will they, finally, after this despicable murder, stop playing with the murderous Arab population with shameful rules of the game. Maybe they'll finally take things into their hands and do what's necessary.'' On Passover Holiday **********The Israeli youngsters, on Passover holiday, were dropped off by car near the village of Usarin, southeast of here, for a day hike - a national sport here - back to Elon Moreh. **********But they did not get permission from the army to hike in the tense area and, even through there was a base nearby, the army did not know they were here. **********''We discovered ourselves surrounded by Arab boys, dozens, carrying rocks and slingshots,'' Shmuel Fuchs, 15, recalled this afternoon; he was wrapped in bandages at Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem. ''We continued walking. At first they weren't so close, then they got closer. It was a big mess. They shouted in Arabic - surrounded us and led us - there were some who were calming them down, led us into the village, walking very slowly. **********''Some of the elder Arabs in the village, maybe the mayor, tried to calm them down, but it didn't work. A woman came with a big rock and hit it on the head of the security guard. There were wounded. All the Arabs disappeared.'' **********A girl, who was not identified, told Israel radio a similar story from Tel Hashomer Hospital in Tel Aviv. **********''A bunch of guys from the village started to throw stones with slingshots and their hands,'' she said. ''Afterward they surrounded us and we walked with them to their village. We didn't have a choice. And there they started with stones. I mean when we walked with them, it was without stones, like they wanted to be friends or something. Afterward, in the village, they started with rocks and guns.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/06/business/mortgages-dip-below-10.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-02-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 157, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mortgages Dip Below 10%", "print_headline": "Mortgages Dip Below 10%", "body_text": " **********Fixed-rate home mortgages have fallen below 10 percent for the first time since last April, according to a nationwide survey. **********The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation said today that its nationwide average interest rate for 30-year, conventional fixed-rate mortgages declined to 9.94 percent, from 10.16 percent last week.

William O. Studeman, director of the National Security Agency, said the Soviet Navy would be able to repair and maintain its Mediterranean fleet at Tartus. Increased Deployments Seen **********''This will obviate the necessity of frequent naval transits to home ports in the Black Sea,'' he said. ''It would permit longer deployments and an overall increased Soviet presence in an area of considerable political-military volatility.'' **********The expansion is notable because it comes when the Soviets are cutting back on naval deployments and exercises in other parts of the world, both to save money and to project a more benign image to Western Europe and the United States. **********Norman Polmar, an expert on the Soviet Navy, said it was correct to refer to Tartus as a Soviet naval base. Indeed, he said, ''it is the Soviets' only operating naval base in the Mediterranean.'' **********Asked to describe its effect on regional security, Mr. Polmar said the new installation at Tartus ''permits the Soviets to operate their naval forces more efficiently and effectively, and to keep ships in the Mediterranean at a high state of readiness.'' **********Mr. Polmar, a consultant to the United States Navy, said he believed that the United States should protest to Syria over the expansion of Tartus and try harder to get more bases for American ships in the Mediterranean. **********At Tartus, he said, Soviet warships take on fuel, bombs, missiles and other munitions. The base is used by Soviet submarines, cruisers, destroyers, minesweepers and landing ships, he said. The surface ships come from the Black Sea Fleet. The submarines come from the Northern Fleet and would have to return more often to distant ports on the Kola Peninsula if they had no Mediterranean base. Details Sought From Embassy **********White House officials said they had repeatedly asked the United States Embassy in Damascus to obtain detailed information about the purpose and use of buildings under construction in the port of Tartus. But so far, they said, the embassy has not provided details about the new installation or the Soviet-Syrian agreement governing its use. **********The officials said they hoped the new United States Ambassador to Syria, Edward P. Djerejian, would quickly investigate and report on the Soviet activity at Tartus. Mr. Djerejian, who left the United States for Syria this week, is an expert on both the Middle East and the Soviet Union, having served as a political officer at the United States Embassy in Moscow from 1979 to 1981. Moscow is Syria's main source of arms, having supplied $10 billion worth of weapons to Damascus in the last five years, according to American estimates published by the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. But State Department officials say the Soviets appear to be reassessing the costs and benefits of their long-time commitment to Syria, and in the last year they have demanded prompt payment in hard currency for weapons sold to Damascus. **********Syria owes the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies more than $15 billion, according to American officials. Syria incurred most of the debt in the last few years as it bought Soviet warplanes, missiles, tanks, ships and armored fighting vehicles in an effort to match Israel's military strength. The Syrians recently obtained three new Soviet submarines of the type known in the West as the Kilo class. Chemical Arms Bid Reported **********In addition, Israeli and American officials said the Soviet Army's chief of chemical warfare recently visited Syria to discuss possible cooperation between the two countries in the production of chemical weapons. Israeli officials have asserted that Syria was manufacturing chemical warheads for surface-to-surface missiles supplied by the Russians. **********Mr. Polmar said Soviet naval aircraft operating from an airfield in Syria provided direct support for Soviet warships operating out of Tartus. The support includes aerial reconnaissance, electronic surveillance and anti-submarine patrols. In addition, he said, the Soviet Union and Syria have held joint naval exercises near Tartus. **********Admiral Studeman, who was the Director of Naval Intelligence from September 1985 through June of this year, said there had been ''speculation that the Soviet-Syrian agreement will provide for Soviet sovereignty over the facility'' at Tartus. ''We have no specific information as yet on the actual content of the agreement, but it is highly unlikely that Syria would or could make such concessions to any foreign power,'' he said. **********He said ''the agreement most likely calls for the territory to remain Syrian,'' but with strict Soviet controls on access to the site. Under such controls, Syrians could not enter except with Soviet permission. Relations Said to Cool a Bit **********Abdul Aziz Said, a professor of international relations at American University here, said the political relationship between Syria and the Soviet Union had cooled a bit because ''Soviet foreign policy in the Middle East is increasingly informed by pragmatic, material, business considerations, rather than ideological considerations.'' **********Mr. Said, who was born in Syria, said the Soviet Union appeared to be considering the establishment of diplomatic relations with Israel. But such a step is unthinkable for Syria because ''Syria and Israel see each other as archenemies,'' he said. **********In addition, Mr. Said said, Syria has expressed irritation with the Soviet Union because of slow deliveries of arms, Soviet demands for cash payment and Soviet insistence on a measure of control over the arms. Syria sees such control as interference in its affairs. **********Syrian officials are also irritated because they believe the Soviets have not taken a clear position supporting Syria in its long-running disputes with Iraq. **********The Soviets cannot offer the Syrians the economic aid that the Syrians need, Mr. Said added. For this reason, he said, ''Syria is opening more to the West,'' which it sees as a potential source of economic assistance and advanced technology."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/16/business/finance-new-issues-a-unit-of-g-w-offers-8-3-4-notes.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-09-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 124, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Unit of G.&W.

People who remarry typically have significant assets or obligations, and their goals and ideas about money may differ from those of their spouses. **********''There is always a high potential for disagreement over money in marriage,'' said Madeline I. Noveck, president of Novos Planning Associates in New York. ''That potential is higher in remarriage, because people have established patterns of family money management.'' **********In some cases, financial planners recommend that couples prepare a prenuptial agreement, which may detail each spouse's rights and responsibilities. Such an agreement is especially desirable if either person has considerable assets or children from a previous marriage, said Jacalyn F. Barnett, head of the matrimonial law department at the New York law firm of Shea & Gould. **********Lawyers usually advise that the agreement specify how property will be divided if the marriage fails. ''The divorce rate is higher with each successive marriage,'' Ms. Barnett said. ''If there is no prenuptial agreement and the couple divorce, they will have to work out those issues when both are angry and disappointed, or leave the decision to a judge.'' **********Regardless of whether a couple sign a prenuptial agreement, planners suggest that they outline a joint financial plan. ''As soon as people know they will remarry, they should begin thinking how their life styles will change and how they will operate as an economic unit,'' said Laura Adams, a certified financial planner in Princeton, N.J. **********Couples should take a look at their respective incomes and review any existing commitments, such as caring for aging parents, educating children or paying alimony to a former spouse. They should also discuss personal goals like starting a business, returning to school or buying a vacation home. **********It is all the more important to raise such issues if one spouse will be asked to make sacrifices, like postponing his or her retirement. ''It's far better to negotiate these matters during courtship,'' Ms. Adams said. **********As in any household, it is a good idea to set up a budget. ''Without a budget, people tend to spend emotionally,'' Ms. Noveck said. ''That can lead to problems in a new marriage.'' **********Planners and lawyers sometimes advise couples to maintain separate investment and bank accounts and to divide responsibility for certain expenses. For example, they might decide that the husband will pay for his children's educational expenses and that each spouse will take care of his or her own retirement savings. **********Such arrangements may make it simpler to sort out which assets belong to whom. That is important if the couple seek a divorce or if they plan to leave their estates to different heirs. But many couples, particularly those who are less affluent, may need to pool at least some of their resources to meet their common obligations. **********And even if they maintain separate accounts, couples should coordinate their savings and investment strategies. ''Even if the assets are owned separately, the couple need to work toward the same goals,'' Ms. Adams said. And savings and investment plans that were designed to meet the needs of single people may be inappropriate once a couple marry. **********Individuals who remarry may wish to designate new beneficiaries for their insurance policies and retirement plans. Couples should also review their combined life and health insurance to determine whether the coverage is adequate. **********Planners say that both spouses should revise their estate plans. Individuals who have children from previous marriages should seek to provide for both the children and their new spouse, incorporating their wishes in a will devised with the help of a lawyer who specializes in estate planning. **********In the absence of a prenuptial agreement, a surviving spouse may generally claim part of the estate regardless of the terms of the will. The amount that such an individual may claim is determined by state law. In New York, it ranges from a third to half of the estate. **********Some prenuptial agreements call for a husband and wife to waive certain rights to each other's estates. That might permit both parties to leave most of their assets to their children or other heirs. But planners warn that such agreements should not disregard the financial security of either spouse. **********Some individuals leave their entire estate to their new spouse, on the understanding that the assets will eventually be passed along to their children. Such an understanding should be made legally binding. ''The surviving spouse may not follow the wishes of their former mate unless those wishes are spelled out clearly in a premarital agreement or will,'' Ms. Barnett said. **********Couples should consider the possibility that one spouse will outlive the other by many years. ''It may be wise to leave money outright to children, so that they won't have to wait indefinitely,'' Ms. Barnett said. Financial planners also advise some clients to maintain sizable life insurance policies with their children as beneficiaries. **********Even if most of a couple's assets come from one spouse, the other should be included in the planning process. ''The less-affluent spouse has every right to participate, especially if the assets form the foundation of their long-term financial security,'' said Charlie Hughes, president of C. G. Hughes Company, a financial planning firm in Bay Shore, L.I. ''They should not settle for reassurances that they will be taken care of.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/30/world/a-soviet-general-says-nato-distorts-arms-comparison.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-11-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 128, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Soviet General Says NATO Distorts Arms Comparison", "print_headline": "A Soviet General Says NATO Distorts Arms Comparison", "body_text": " **********A high-ranking Soviet military official today rejected as propaganda a recent NATO appraisal of conventional forces in Europe and said it did not provide a basis for East-West negotiations. **********''Instead of an all-around objective appraisal of forces in Europe, the NATO figures contain only a selective approach for propaganda purposes,'' Col.

Mr. Smart suggested a narrower focus. **********But Mr. Verity was eager to make his last year in the post his most successful, these friends said, and he wanted neither the President nor himself regarded as a lame duck. **********According to the friends both inside and outside the Government, this disagreement on an appropriate agenda accounted for part of the ''difference of management styles'' that Mr. Verity cited in deciding not to promote Mr. Smart to deputy secretary. That post has been vacant since Feb. 1, when Clarence Brown resigned. **********''Verity clearly perceived Smart working at cross-purposes with his agenda,'' one friend said. Another official added, ''Verity wanted to get his own man in the job.'' **********Mr. Smart's resignation, after nearly three years in the international trade post, was a surprise. In Congress, Mr. Smart had been considered one of the Administration's key trade spokesmen. He had led negotiating efforts to end some Japanese and European trade restraints. **********''It was a shock,'' said a Congressional aide who follows trade issues. ''Smart has been doing a superb job.'' Friends of the two men said that, while they were split by no major policy differences, frictions had developed over some smaller issues. **********Mr. Smart had been mentioned as a contender for the post of Commerce Secretary after Malcolm Baldrige was killed in a rodeo accident in July. Mr. Verity was chosen in August. One point of tension between the men involved an export license fee that the Office of Management and Budget wanted to levy as a way of financing modernization of the Commerce Department and of easing budgetary strains. **********The $50 fee, agreed to by Mr. Smart but strongly opposed by Mr. Verity, would have been paid by companies applying for licenses to ship goods to Communist countries. **********Mr. Smart had not raised objections to the proposal when it was first suggested by the O.M.B.'s director, James C. Miller 3d, last summer. **********When Mr. Verity was confirmed as Secretary in October, he immediately attacked the proposal, considering it a bad idea to saddle exports with a new tax while the nation was seeking to narrow its huge trade deficit. **********The fee issue is still being fought between Mr. Verity and Mr. Miller. **********According to another official, Mr. Verity also felt that Mr. Smart did not ''pull his oar'' on Kempton B. Jenkins, a former Foreign Service officer and Soviet affairs specialist Mr. Verity wanted to bring into the department. **********Mr. Jenkins has been a target, as has Mr. Verity, of those opposed to doing more business with the Soviet Union. Mr. Smart advised that Mr. Verity should not press for the appointment of Mr. Jenkins to avoid a repeat of the Verity confirmation battle. The advice was not appreciated, friends of both men said. **********A friend said Mr. Smart ''brought up opinions on a variety of issues and was always honest and frank as he thought an adviser should be.'' **********He added, ''On any subject where he thought there was a difference of opinion, he was willing to carry out whatever it was the Secretary wanted.'' **********So sudden was Mr. Verity's decision not to promote Mr. Smart, and Mr. Smart's resignation, that no departure date has been set.

Shevardnadze, is to arrive in Washington on Sunday in search of a compromise that would ease the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan. **********Western and other diplomats here said today that they believe prospects are good for overcoming the critical stumbling block: Washington's insistence that Moscow not only remove its troops but end military supplies to its clients in Kabul. But Soviet officials have given no public indication so far that they see an acceptable middle ground. **********The success or failure on this issue in meetings between Mr. Shevardnadze and Secretary of State George P.

''It's the key to other regional issues.'' **********The Soviet Foreign Minister is also expected to bring Moscow's first, detailed response to the latest American peace initiatives in the Middle East. #2 Weeks of Consultations Mr. Shevardnadze finished an intense two-week schedule of consultations today, including visits from Richard W. Murphy, the Assistant Secretary of State in charge of the Middle East, and a procession of senior Arab officials. **********The Kremlin has so far avoided public comment on the American peace plan, which Western diplomats take as a promising sign. **********''They have given us reason to believe they take the whole thing very seriously,'' an American official said. **********Mr. Shevardnadze's trip is the second in a series of meetings between the two foreign ministers, designed to lay the groundwork for President Reagan's visit to Moscow in late May. **********The official agenda includes talks in the slow search for a treaty to reduce long-range nuclear weapons, discussions on the Iran-Iraq war, Nicaragua, Angola and other trouble spots, and continued dickering on human rights. **********But the trip has acquired added immediacy as the negotiations faltered in Geneva on ending the conflict in Afghanistan. **********If not resolved, diplomats say, the issue threatens to impede progress on other regional crises and to cloud the summit meeting itself. **********Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, has agreed to a nine-month pullout, with half of the estimated 115,000 Soviet troops to be removed in the first three months. The United States has agreed to stop supplying weapons to the rebels as the pullout begins. The Sticking Point **********In Geneva, where delegates from Pakistan and Afghanistan are negotiating terms of the withdrawal, negotiations have bogged down over Washington's demand that the withdrawal agreement include a Kremlin commitment to cease arms supplies to the regime in Kabul in symmetry with an American cutoff of aid to the rebels. **********Moscow has rejected this demand, saying it has longstanding commitments to Kabul, and that the American demand is a last-minute attempt to scuttle an agreement. **********According to Western diplomats, Mr. Shultz is expected to propose several variations designed to overcome Moscow's objection that the American demand interferes with Moscow's two-way relations. The proposals generally entail making the cutoff of military aid by both superpowers the subject of a nonbinding, informal understanding. The formal agreement in Geneva would not require an arms cutoff, but would include a pledge to treat Afghanistan as a neutral and nonaligned nation, an idea Moscow has already accepted in principle. **********Western diplomats said Moscow would be able to console its clients in Kabul by beefing up the Afghan Army's arsenals without limit in the weeks between signing and agreement and the beginning of withdrawal - and the Americans could do the same for the rebels. **********''There are lots of ways to reach an understanding, in which neither side gives up its right to supply arms, but each side knows what is expected of it,'' a diplomat said. What Moscow Says in Private **********In private meetings with Americans, Soviet officials have declared that they plan to leave with or without a Geneva agreement. Last Thursday, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Vadim Perfilyev, said at a news conference of Soviet and foreign reporters that Moscow was prepared to pull out its troops unilaterally if the impasse continues in Geneva. **********Western diplomats said the talk of unilateral withdrawal appeared to be in part a bargaining tactic, intended to put pressure on the United States and Pakistan to relax their demands. Lending credence to this view, Mr. Perfilyev's remarks were not reported in the Soviet press. **********According to this analysis, the United States and Pakistan also have a large stake in a negotiated withdrawal. They would share the brunt of world opinion if the Soviet troops go home and a bloodbath ensues. **********Pakistan may fear that if it is not a party to the withdrawal, it may become the target of stepped-up attacks against rebel bases on its territory. **********Moreover, the implied threat is that if the Americans do not cooperate in extricating the troops, Moscow will be less likely to help American interests elsewhere. **********''The United States has said all along that Afghanistan was the acid test of Soviet intentions,'' a Middle Eastern diplomat said.

The Pentagon has said most of these cases have been resolved. But 126 reports are under ''high-priority investigation,'' a spokesman said today. **********A State Department spokesman said today, ''The meetings in Hanoi were quite productive, and we look forward to greatly expanded cooperation in the coming months.'' **********Although virtually all officials involved in Vietnamese affairs are convinced there are no Americans still being held in Vietnam against their will, the notion that some Americans are still in Vietnam or Laos has become a popular theme and the subject of several movies. The Reagan Administration, in fact, came to office in 1981 critical of previous Administrations for not doing enough to clear up the question of the missing Americans.

Pfister, a spokesman for the United States Pacific Command, which has responsibility for military operations throughout the Pacific region, said today: ''There is no doubt that the leaders of Vietnam have information about the fate of many missing Americans. We are pushing for that information.'' **********The American delegation to Hanoi was led by Lieut. Col. Joe Harvey of the Army, commander of the Joint Casualty Resolution Center, and Lieut. Col. Johnie E. Webb Jr., commander of the Army's Central Identification Laboratory. The center maintains files on all military and civilian personnel captured or missing in the Vietnam War.

Which Experts Will Go **********The United States is prepared to send teams of forensic pathologists, anthropologists and dental experts to Vietnam to help identify the remains of American servicemen. Since 1975, the United States has received more than 8,200 reports related to prisoners of war and men listed as missing in action. Most of the reports came from Indochinese refugees. **********The announcement of plans to search for missing American servicemen is one of several signs of progress on what the United States calls humanitarian issues. Two weeks ago Vietnam and the United States reached an agreement permitting thousands of former political prisoners to migrate to the United States. Many of those people had been held in ''re-education camps'' because they once worked for the United States or for the Government of South Vietnam. **********In addition, Vietnam recently rescued three United States Navy fliers who had abandoned their plane when it became disabled over the South China Sea.

Lawrence, O'Donnell has voluntarily agreed to withdraw as specialist in the Neiman-Marcus Group and La Branche has agreed to stop making markets in the stocks of E.F. Hutton Group Inc. and A. G. Edwards Inc. **********The La Branche situation is an unusual one. The firm had agreed to withdraw as specialist of Hutton. But, as a result of Hutton's acquisition by Shearson Lehman Brothers, Hutton will no longer be listed on the exchange after March 24. This action would make the Hutton withdrawal a meaningless penalty. Consequently, La Branche voluntarily agreed to withdraw as the specialist on A. G. Edwards, a St. Louis stock brokerage. Questionable Performance Cited **********''We believe that in the week of Oct. 19, the specialists did a superb, but not a perfect, job,'' said Richard Torrenzano, a spokesman for the exchange. ''But there were isolated instances where performance was in question. We have taken action in four situations. Several other investigations are pending, and we are hopeful there will be a quick resolution.'' **********The investigation into La Branche and Lawrence, O'Donnell centers on the specialists' ability to maintain a fair and orderly market. On Oct. 20, the price swings in Hutton's and Neiman-Marcus's stock were far wider than what should have been expected. Hutton's stock opened at $24.50, fell as low as $11 and closed at $16.875.

Madison Avenue's leading drama - the walkout last month by top executives from Lord, Geller, Federico, Einstein and the suit filed against them by a unit of the agency's British owner, WPP Group - has attracted an attentive audience in London as well. **********To be sure, the interest in the tussle between WPP and the Lord, Geller defectors is not as rapt in Britain as on Madison Avenue, where the breakaway group and its members' work are well known. Yet because major British advertising firms like WPP and Saatchi & Saatchi now hold a big share of the American industry, the unfolding conflict is being closely watched not only by the local advertising community but also in the London financial district, which has financed the British takeovers of Madison Avenue agencies. A Sense of Anglophobia **********In London, the clash is viewed as a mixture of anglophobia and a test of the tactical management abilities of Martin Sorrell, WPP's 43-year-old chairman. But so far, the conflict is not seen as a threat to WPP or to Mr. Sorrell's strategy of rapidly putting together one of the world's largest advertising and marketing companies. **********''The Lord, Geller thing is an exciting pantomime, especially for Madison Avenue,'' said Neil Blackley, an advertising analyst for James Capel & Company. ''But it should not have much effect on WPP.'' **********Last summer Mr. Sorrell stunned the American advertising industry when his little-known WPP bought, for $566 million, the JWT Group, which owned the world's fourth-largest advertising agency, the J. Walter Thompson Company, and the big public relations firm Hill & Knowlton, as well as Lord, Geller. Another Management Layer **********Even before the WPP takeover, Lord, Geller, a smaller agency renowned for its creative flair, was chafing at the restrictions of being part of a large corporate group, JWT. After WPP bought JWT, Lord, Geller was part of a still-larger conglomerate, and the controls under Mr. Sorrell, the former finance director of Saatchi & Saatchi, were even more confining. Mr. Sorrell had pledged to his financial backers at the time of the JWT acquisition that he would apply tighter controls on the organization to increase profits. **********So to some degree, the conflict between Lord, Geller's management and WPP was inevitable, regardless of the nationality of the acquirer. Nevertheless, memos discovered by a private investigator working for WPP in the court case against the former Lord, Geller executives, who departed to set up Lord, Einstein, O'Neill & Partners, have been viewed here as anti-British. **********According to one memo presented in court, Richard J. Lord, former chairman of Lord, Geller, referred bitterly to ''British masters'' and attempts by Mr. Sorrell to make the agency executives into ''indentured servants.'' British Feel Resentment **********The furor on Madison Avenue over the case is regarded here as reflecting not only the tribal nature of the industry, but also American gloating over Mr. Sorrell's troubles. ''Madison Avenue still resents that Sorrell bought JWT because he's British,'' observed Jan Hawkins, deputy editor of Campaign, Britain's leading advertising-industry weekly. ''They want to see him get his comeuppance.'' **********If so, the view is apparently shared in some quarters of the British advertising industry. ''Martin is a controversial figure here,'' said a senior executive at a major London-based agency. ''Some admire his achievements, but others see him as an overly ambitious financier and not an advertising man.'' **********Some London analysts think WPP can ride out the Lord, Geller problem without a serious loss of clients, the main one being the International Business Machines Corporation, with billings of $125 million. More important, they are betting that the Lord, Geller difficulties will not be so damaging to WPP that client confidence and staff morale will suffer at J. Walter Thompson. **********Last month WPP exceeded analysts' expectations by reporting that pretax profit, including a five-and-a-half-month contribution from JWT, had risen eightfold, to $:14.1 million, or $26.5 million, on a 12-fold increase in revenues, to $:284.1 million, or $534 million, in the year ending in December. This year, analysts estimate, pretax earnings will more than double, to roughly $:32.5 million, or $61 million. Little Impact Seen **********Moreover, analysts have not reduced their earnings forecasts in the wake of the Lord, Geller troubles, noting that the agency contributes only about 5 percent of WPP's profits. ''Despite the Lord, Geller problem, WPP remains a very good company,'' said Laura Shea, an analyst for Hoare Govett Ltd. ''These troubles at the moment are getting a lot of attention, but they should not have much of an impact on WPP's performance.'' **********Still, there are doubts about Mr. Sorrell's legal strategy - the lawsuit seeking monetary damages and an injunction to prevent the new agency from recruiting employees or clients from Lord, Geller. In the advertising industry, a company's image is crucial to success. British advertising executives recognize Mr. Sorrell's desire to punish the Lord, Geller defectors. They warn, however, that a protracted legal battle could tarnish WPP's reputation, damaging the company far more than the surprise walkout by Lord, Geller's senior staff. **********''The sooner Martin can return to a business-as-usual status, the better for his clients and his company,'' one London advertising executive said. **********The Financial Weekly, a London business magazine, described Mr. Sorrell's suit against the breakaway group from Lord, Geller as ''folly.'' **********In an editorial, it said, ''Sorrell lost the war he is now trying to win in the courts when he failed to bind the Lord, Geller defectors back into the JWT organization following the WPP takeover.''I.B.M."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/07/world/knights-of-malta-and-us-picking-new-chief.html": {"writer_name": "Roberto Suro", "pub_date": "1988-04-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 755, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Knights of Malta (and U.S.) Picking New Chief", "print_headline": "Knights of Malta (and U.S.) Picking New Chief", "body_text": " **********Princes, barons and some mere master knights are gathering here for a sacred conclave that will elect the next leader of an organization that is medieval in origin but increasingly American in membership. **********Secluded in a villa overlooking the Tiber, a council of 36 electors will cast secret ballots for the next Grand Master of the Knights of Malta beginning Friday. If the winner is approved by Pope John Paul II, he will be addressed properly as ''Your Most Eminent Highness,'' having the protocol status of both a Roman Catholic cardinal and a prince of the Holy Roman Empire. **********The title reflects the group's identity as both a religious order and a military organization born in 1113, during the Crusades. **********Although the Knights maintain a variety of ideals and rituals dating back to a time when chivalry meant much more than good manners, these Christian soldiers are a changing lot. The order collects only modest dues from its 10,000 members but expects generous contributions to the medical and social welfare projects that it conducts in 90 countries. **********Over their long history, the Knights have been caught up in a variety of diplomatic intrigues, and so it was only a mild shock a few months ago when one of their own confessed publicly that he was a double agent who worked for the Cuban secret services for 12 years while pretending to work for the Central Intelligence Agency, then headed by William J. Casey, himself a knight. **********Mauro Casagrandi, the son of a prominent knight and the charge d'affaires of the order's embassy in Havana, revealed his adventures a few weeks before he was to be invested as a knight. ''Unfortunately, we could not even expel him because he was not a full member yet,'' said an official here. When the last Grand Master died, the Castro Government proclaimed three days of mourning in Cuba. Ostensibly, this was a tribute to the order's humanitarian work there, but as the official said, ''I guess we were giving Castro more than we knew.'' **********For centuries, full membership was restricted to people of noble ancestry, but in 1956 a new rank, ''knights and dames of grace and devotion,'' was opened to commoners. Since then, membership has swelled, and now nearly 60 percent of the knights do not come from noble families. **********Some of the fastest growth has been in the United States. The more than 2,000 Americans are the second largest national group, topped only by Italy, with nearly 3,000 members. The order has attracted Americans like the New York financier J. Peter Grace, the Washington lawyer Edward Bennett Williams and the former Cabinet secretaries Alexander M. Haig Jr. and William E. Simon. **********''We have greatly increased the activities of the order by no longer requiring nobility as a condition of membership, but the traditions remain the same, and this is insured because almost all members of the central government are still nobles,'' said Baron Felice Catalano di Melilli, the Grand Chancellor. **********During the 25-year reign of the previous Grand Master, Fra Angelo de Mojana di Cologna, who died in January, the order faced growing competition from organizations that are set up to resemble it. Some of the imitation groups in effect sell knighthoods for as much as $25,000, officials here said. **********''It is a real headache,'' the baron said. About 20 groups, many in the United States, have uniforms and rituals resembling those of the Knights. But only the original group based in Rome has the status of a sovereign state and maintains diplomatic relations with more than 40 nations. **********''We take legal action whenever we can,'' the baron said in an interview, ''and we alert church authorities whenever we see a group trying to get sanction from a local bishop.'' **********A major problem is the full name of the organization, the Sovereign Military Hospitaler Order of St. John of Jerusalem of Rhodes and of Malta. ''Someone can take part of the name, the St. John or the Malta, go to a notary and create a group, and then people in good faith pay money to join, thinking they are becoming a real knight,'' the baron said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/06/business/finance-new-issues-ohio-pollution-control-bonds.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-10-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 190, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ohio Pollution Control Bonds", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; Ohio Pollution Control Bonds", "body_text": " **********The Ohio Water Development Authority and the Ohio Air Quality Development Authority are tentatively offering a total of $50.7 million in tax-exempt collateralized pollution control revenue bonds through underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company. **********Because the financing is secured by an irrevocable letter of credit from Citibank N.A., the bonds are expected to be rated Aa-2 by Moody's and AA+ by S.& P.

By making a simpler but faster microprocessor, engineers are rejecting more than two decades of design practice and seeking an alternative to the growing complexity of computers. **********Complexity has become a significant bottleneck in computing, with designers finding that their machines are encrusted with powerful computational routines that are rarely used. These routines impose a drag on the microprocessor, in a situation similar to an options-loaded sedan's getting lower gas mileage than a stripped-down version of the same car. **********The new design approach, known as a reduced instruction set computer, or RISC, eliminates many of the instructions built into the microprocessor and instead processes data by performing simpler steps repeatedly at faster speeds. The result is greater computing power at lower costs. Growing Acceptance **********RISC has quickly become the strategic tool for computer designers. Today every major United States computer maker has either introduced or endorsed a computer based on RISC or is developing a prototype. **********The RISC concept will gain added momentum Monday when the Motorola Corporation, a major semiconductor manufacturer, introduces a powerful RISC-based microprocessor. **********''We're entering the next technological breakpoint,'' said Murray Goldman, senior vice president and general manager of Motorola's Microprocessor Products Group in Austin, Tex. **********The RISC concept involves a dual design approach. One aspect involves reducing and simplifying the number of data processing functions that a microprocessor - the famed computer-on-a-chip - has built into its circuits. **********The other involves streamlining the execution of instructions performed by the electronic components embedded in the chip. By carefully tailoring the programs that tell the microprocessor what instructions to use, dramatic increases in computational speed result. **********Desktop RISC-based machines from Sun Microsystems Inc. of Mountain View, Calif. and the MIPS Computer Systems Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif., now have more processing power than the most powerful minicomputer designs of several years ago. An experimental RISC design developed in an International Business Machines Corporation laboratory in Austin, Tex., is reported to match the speeds of the company's mainframe computers, which use the complex designs of the 1970's. **********The Motorola announcement follows introductions of RISC microprocessors and computers from companies including Sun, MIPS, I.B.M.,the Intel Corporation, the Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation, Advanced Micro Devices Inc., the Hewlett-Packard Company, and Apollo Computer Inc. Other Research Projects **********Apple Computer Inc. and the Digital Equipment Corporation are two major computer companies that have not adopted RISC, but both have research projects under way. **********Although I.B.M. has not yet played a major role in RISC developments, William Lowe, president of I.B.M.'s entry systems division, said earlier this year that the company is investing as much in RISC-based products as it has put into its PS/2 personal computer line. **********By choosing RISC over the conventional design, known as CISC for complex instruction set computer, computer companies can shorten design cycles and bring newer, faster machines to market more quickly. **********''What's hard to get across is the tremendous speed at which things are changing in this business,'' said David Patterson, a computer scientist at the University of California at Berkeley who, with other faculty and graduate students, led the first research projects that sparked widespread industry interest in RISC. **********The RISC concept is addressing the industry's mounting concerns about complexity. As semiconductor technology improves and more transistors are squeezed onto a single silicon microprocessor chip, a computer designer's most formidable task becomes managing complexity. For example, Intel's most powerful microprocessor, the 80386, contains 275,000 transistors. In contrast, Sun's RISC-based SPARC chip has only 50,000 transistors. Yet it provides more than twice the processing speed of the Intel chip, according to Sun. **********RISC-based computers are also more flexible than conventional designs, easing the burden of rewriting software for the new machines. **********''Its flexibility confers tremendous versatility to RISC,'' said John Moussouris, co-founder of MIPS Computer. **********The leap in computer performance that RISC promises is, however, confronting computer makers with multibillion-dollar choices on whether to make the switch and what standard to switch to. **********''It doesn't matter how big your company is, if you make the wrong choice you can lose a lot of money real quick,'' said William Joy, a co-founder of Sun Microsystems. Few Machines on Market **********Despite the widespread enthusiasm for RISC, few computers based on the new design have reached the market. According to Dataquest, a market research firm in San Jose, Calif., only 65,000 RISC microprocessors were shipped during 1987, a small fraction of the entire demand. However, by 1992, RISC chips are expected to account for 27 percent of the market in 32-bit microprocessors. **********The expected business has created an intense competition that analysts expect will eventually lead to an industry shakeout and fewer competing designs. **********''Right now there are a lot of players, but it's an unstable situation,'' said Alice Leeper, a Dataquest analyst. ''There's a lot of positioning to establish standards. In the next two or three years we'll see a shakeout.'' **********Sun's Sparc chip has gained the endorsement of some computer makers, including the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, the Xerox Corporation and the Unisys Corporation, and some chip makers, including Fujitsu Ltd., Bipolar Integrated Technology, the Cypress Semiconductor Corporation and LSI Logic Inc. **********But Motorola on Monday will announce that more than 20 companies are backing its 88000 RISC chip, including Data General, Stratus Computer Inc., Tektronix Inc. and Convergent Technologies Inc. **********The competitive pressures have led to a ''benchmark war'' between makers of different microprocessors with each manufacturer issuing impressive reports on performance. **********The standard industry measure is MIPS, or millions of instructions per second. Digital Equipment Corporation's VAX 11/780, which does not use RISC technology, is generally rated at 1 MIPS. The original Sun SPARC chip is rated at 10 MIPS, Motorola rates its 88000 at 17 MIPS and a new version of MIPS Computer's chip reportedly reached 20 MIPS. **********However, many computer designers dispute the validity of MIPS and dozens of alternative benchmarks have been suggested.

Denial Issued in Damascus **********The paper noted that the Jabril group, in a statement in Damascus Friday, denied any connection with the crash. But it said the denial was regarded skeptically by terrorism experts, who suggested the group was trying to avoid possible American military retaliation. **********In its Friday issue, the Times of London said investigators believed that the bomb was triggered by a device with two separate detonating systems. **********The newspaper, in a report attributed to unidentified sources, said experts were working on the theory that one detonating system was a barometric device triggered by altitude, which then activated an electronic timer. The newspaper said the use of two detonators was developed by terrorists to frustrate decompression chambers installed at some airports, including the one in Frankfurt. **********The report said that the reduced pressure in the chambers sets off bombs prepared with barometric detonators. If there were two detonators, however, the pressure would set off the timing device, which would then set off the bomb hours later. **********The newspaper quoted a ''security source'' at Frankfurt airport as saying that a low-pressure simulation chamber had been used there since 1984 to check luggage ''from time to time.'' **********''Its use is subject to special rules,'' the report quoted the source as saying, adding that he declined to say whether the chamber was used to check luggage for the Pan American World Airways flight from Frankfurt to London.

The new 8 5/8 percent Treasury notes due in seven years were offered late in the day with a yield of 8.63 percent, down from 8.70 percent; two-year notes were offered at 7.72 percent, down from 7.79 percent. Commodity Prices at High **********Although Mr. Johnson's comments kept alive hopes that demand from foreign investors might improve, analysts said investors might avoid long-term bonds for other reasons. Some noted that commodity prices, as measured by the futures price index of the Commodity Research Bureau, are near a two-year high (up about 14 percent in the past year) even though the index fell slightly yesterday. **********Other analysts noted that December sales at the nation's large retailers were stronger than expected, suggesting that the economy might receive more support from consumer spending than was anticipated a few months ago. **********The Federal Reserve reported late yesterday that the nation's M-1 basic money supply was unchanged in the week ended Dec. 28, confirming expectations that the money supply would decline in December for the second consecutive month. The annual growth rate for the M-1 over six months has been nine-tenths of 1 percent. **********So far, the Federal Reserve has not tried to push interest rates down significantly to stimulate faster money-supply growth. Yesterday, the Fed temporarily added reserves to the banking system, indicating that it still desired a rate of about 6 3/4 percent for overnight bank loans in the Federal funds market. Activity in Corporate Market **********In the corporate market, Westfield Finance Inc. announced yesterday the first of what was expected to be a flurry of auction-rate preferred stock issues in coming weeks. **********Underwriters led by the First Boston Corporation handled the $308 million in financing for Westfield, a subsidiary of an Australian company. Investment bankers said that, over the next several weeks, the $14 billion in outstanding auction-rate preferred issues might be supplemented by at least another $2 billion in similar issues. **********Because many potential issuers were deterred by poor market conditions in the last few months of 1987, ''there is a lot of pent-up supply,'' noted Ronald L. Gallatin, a managing director at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. The poor markets were caused, he said, by the threat of adverse changes in Federal tax laws and the desire of many corporate treasurers to build up their cash holdings rather than invest in the auction-rate preferred issues. **********The normal desire to show large holdings of cash on year-end financial statements was exaggerated last year, Mr. Gallatin said, because many corporate treasurers were accumulating money to buy back their company's stock after the October drop in stock prices. According to the Standard & Poor's Corporation, at least 232 companies authorized the purchase of their own stock during the fourth quarter. Lower Dividends Set **********Dividends on the four-part Westfield financing were set initially at 5.85 percent to 5.95 percent, or between 85 percent and 90 percent of 60-day commercial paper rates. Like most other auction-rate preferred stock issues, the Westfield dividends will be adjusted every 49 days based on the results of auctions held by First Boston. **********Although the dividends set yesterday were higher than the 70 percent of commercial paper that prevailed most of last year, they were lower than the 90 percent to 100 percent of commercial paper that prevailed late last year. **********''The market is getting back to a normal premium over commercial-paper rates,'' said Joseph S. Fichera, vice president in corporate finance at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. **********He said that the auction-preferred rates would not return to the old, lower levels because the basic corporate income tax declined this year to 34 percent, from 40 percent, and Congress recently reduced to 70 percent, from 80 percent, the amount of preferred stock dividends that can be excluded from the corporate income tax. **********The Westfield financing, rated Aaa by Moody's Investors Service and AA+ by Standard & Poor's, is backed by a letter of credit from Societe Generale of France and by mortgages on large shopping centers in New Jersey, New York and California."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/20/business/a-gloomy-report-on-fslic.html": {"writer_name": "Nathaniel Nash", "pub_date": "1988-05-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 802, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Gloomy Report on F.S.L.I.C.", "print_headline": "A Gloomy Report on F.S.L.I.C.", "body_text": " **********The General Accounting Office said today that the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation was likely to need a new infusion of capital to deal with the more than 500 savings and loan institutions now insolvent. **********''We conclude that the eventual costs of restoring the thrift industry's financial health are likely to exceed the funds that the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation will have available,'' said Frederick D. Wolf, director of the division of accounting and financial management at the G.A.O. **********Mr. Wolf made his comments in a new report by the Congressional unit on the financial condition of the savings and loan industry and the F.S.L.I.C., the Government agency that insures deposits at 3,200 savings institutions. He was joined by several financial consultants, who testified today before the Senate Banking Committee that a taxpayer bailout of the savings fund was almost a certainty. Senators Stunned **********In projections that appeared to surprise several senators, the General Accounting Office and others estimated that Congress may need to allocate $30 billion to $64 billion over the next five years to solve the financial problems of the nation's insolvent savings and loans. **********''We would like to emphasize our view that if Congressional action becomes necessary, it should be taken swiftly,'' Mr. Wolf said in his report to the Senate. ''Any delays in acting on insolvent thrifts inevitably result in increased resolution costs and undermine the stability of all financial institutions.'' **********The report and the hearing testimony provide more problems for both the bank board and the industry, which are struggling to contain the possible erosion of depositor confidence posed by savings institutions, and for Congress, which last summer passed legislation permitting the bank board to borrow up to $10.8 billion over the next three years to handle the insolvent savings and loan institutions. **********In submitting its grim report to Congress on the F.S.L.I.C., the General Accounting Office specifically said that at the end of 1987, the deposit insurance fund was insolvent by $13.7 billion, more than twice the insolvent level of a year earlier. The estimate was somewhat higher than what officials of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the parent of the savings and loan agency, had predicted earlier this year. **********The report noted that the bank board had identified more than 200 hopelessly insolvent savings units whose bailout cost would be about $17 billion. The G.A.O. said that another 300 savings units, with assets of $88 billion, were also insolvent under generally accepted accounting principles. A Dispute Over Costs **********The General Accounting Office strongly differed with the bank board about the total cost of handling the more than 500 insolvent saving units. While the bank board has said that the cost of either finding buyers for, or liquidating, these institutions would be around $20 billion, the Congressional agency said it would range between $26 billion and $36 billion. **********At the hearing today, the General Accounting Office in fact gave the lowest estimates for solving the industry's problems, while other financial experts placed the total costs much higher. For example, Stanley C. Silverberg, former head of research as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, said the total cost of resolving the industry's problems was ''$50 billion and growing.'' **********Senator Jake Garn, Republican of Utah, angrily cautioned reporters that the large numbers were just estimates, and Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, said he ''will never support a taxpayer bailout of the savings and loan industry.'' **********In the wake of the General Accounting Office's testimony, several senators felt the need to stress that the United States Government stands behind the insurance fund that insures savings and loan deposits up to $100,000. **********And after the hearing, an impromptu news conference was held by the bank board's chairman, M. Danny Wall. He said it was too early to tell how much additional funds the savings association insurer would need. Concern About Investors **********An erosion of confidence could disrupt the bank board's current efforts to reach agreements with investors to buy many of the insolvent savings institutions in the Southwest. **********''It's too early to tell whether we're going to need a taxpayer bailout or other assistance,'' Mr. Wall said, stressing that the $10 billion allocated by Congress had been intended as only an interim step. **********He also rejected a suggestion by the General Accounting Office that the bank board would not be able to close down the problem institutions quickly enough."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/22/world/rightist-winners-in-salvador-vote-vow-to-seek-unity.html": {"writer_name": "James Lemoyne", "pub_date": "1988-03-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 811, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "RIGHTIST WINNERS IN SALVADOR VOTE VOW TO SEEK UNITY", "print_headline": "RIGHTIST WINNERS IN SALVADOR VOTE VOW TO SEEK UNITY", "body_text": " **********Salvadoran rightists, victorious in national elections, said today that they would seek compromise with President Jose Napoleon Duarte, but diplomats and political analysts said they were uncertain about prospects for cooperation. **********The diplomats and analysts said the victory of the right-wing Nationalist Republican Alliance in municipal and legislative elections Sunday would test the country's ability to govern itself. El Salvador is conducting a fragile experiment in civilian rule during a civil war that follows a century of dictatorship. **********The differences between the Nationalist Republican Alliance, known as Arena, and the Christian Democratic Party of Mr. Duarte are so great that the rightist party's success will likely have a major effect on government policies and political change here. Big Role for Legislature **********The Christian Democrats will continue to control the Government and the presidency until presidential elections in March 1989. But by controlling the legislature, Arena can appoint a new Supreme Court and Attorney General and block legislation proposed by Mr. Duarte. **********At the same time, the election result will most likely force Washington to reassess the policy under which it has backed a moderate Christian Democratic Government allied to the military in an effort to defeat the Marxist guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front. **********Publicly, American officials said only that they supported ''the democratic process'' in El Salvador, rather than any particular political party. But they privately conceded that Arena's victory and the Christian Democrats' decline could present problems in forging a government here that Congress would be willing to finance. A Shock to the System **********''This is a shock to the whole system,'' said a Western European diplomat here. ''It forces a re-evaluation of American policy and of what is really going on in this society.'' **********Documents said to have been captured by the army indicated that the rebels hoped for a rightist election victory because it would undermine American aid to El Salvador and create disarray in the Government. **********Seeking to obstruct the vote, the guerrillas attacked polling places, killed one mayor and kidnapped four others, forced a ban on road traffic and detonated several bombs that wounded civilians in the capital. **********Final returns are not available because of widespread sabotage of the country's electrical system by the guerrillas. But members of all political parties here say Arena is likely to take control of most municipalities in the country and may well have won an outright majority in the legislature. Even if it lacks such a majority, Arena appears likely to be able to dominate the legislature in coalition with smaller rightist parties. **********More than 50 percent of the electorate, and perhaps more than 60 percent, voted, according to unofficial poll watchers.

The President has almost withdrawn from public life in recent months, failing to respond to charges of corruption against members of his administration. **********Although he did not comment on the election result today, friends said he was shocked by the scale of his party's defeat, including the rejection of his son Alejandro as Mayor of San Salvador. It was the first time the Christian Democrats had lost the mayoralty in 24 years. **********''To be beaten like this is a tragedy for a man who has fought his whole life to lead this country to democracy,'' a European diplomat said. Arena leaders said today that Mr. Duarte had congratulated them on their victory by telephone Sunday night and that they had promised to try to work with him. **********Arena appears to have its own internal divisions. Several of its supporters have been charged with running political assassination teams in an effort to block political change and seize power. Leaders Trade Charges **********Mr. Duarte has previously accused Arena's founder, Roberto d'Aubuisson, of being a Nazi and more recently has charged him with being involved in the killing of the Roman Catholic Archbishop of El Salvador, Oscar Arnulfo Romero, in 1980. Mr. D'Aubuisson has denied the charges and in the past has called Mr. Duarte a Communist. **********Arena's strength is likely to bolster the most conservative officers in the army and permit the return of ultra-rightist officers exiled by Mr. Duarte for gross human rights abuses. **********The rise of the right may also reduce the possibility that members of the political wing of the guerrilla opposition who have recently returned to El Salvador will be permitted to remain politically active here."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/14/business/company-news-prime-raises-bid-for-its-rival.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-01-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 228, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Prime Raises Bid for Its Rival", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Prime Raises Bid for Its Rival", "body_text": " **********Prime Computer Inc. sweetened its offer yesterday to acquire its rival the Computervision Corporation, to $15 a share, or a total of $433.5 million.

Artists can send sketches to clients, who can make comments and send the sketches back for revisions. Commodities traders reduce international phone costs by sending a letter to a customer instead of conveying the information in a much longer phone conversation. In Hotel Lobbies, Too **********The facsimile machines are also appearing in hotel lobbies to enable business guests to communicate with the office and with clients. **********Spreading along with the machines is the expression to fax, as in ''I faxed the letter this morning.'' **********''With the advent of overnight mail, you now need everything yesterday, and since the price of a fax is so low, practically every department and business can justify purchasing one,' said Julie Weiss, an analyst for Dataquest Inc., a market research firm in San Jose, Calif. **********Last year, more than 417,000 fax machines were shipped in the United States, up sharply from 187,000 in 1986, according to Dataquest. Some industry analysts predict the number will swell to 700,000 units this year. **********Retail sales grew to $914 million last year, from $283 million in 1982. Industry analysts expect sales to surpass $1 billion this year. Cost of Machine Falls to $800 **********The machines, which are about the size of a portable typewriter and now cost as little as $800, appear to be altering the way many people conduct business. To send a document, both parties need only a machine and a phone line. **********In addition to replacing telephone calls, the machines are being used instead of computers for the transmission of data. **********Because a document can be sent so rapidly, the machines seem certain to replace a sizable portion of the overnight document delivery business carved out by companies like Federal Express and United Parcel Service. **********The cost of sending a 20-page document from New York to Los Angeles by facsimile machine is about $1.25. Sending the same document by overnight mail costs $14. The rapid growth in sales has been fueled by faster transmission speeds, as telecommunications systems put new equipment into service. Just three years ago, it took two to three minutes to send a document from coast to coast. The time has been cut to less than a minute by a change to faster communications standards that take advantage of digital technology. **********Most of the market growth has come from the low-priced machines, which list at $1,500 to $2,000 and are aimed at small businesses and individuals who work at home - lawyers, freelance writers, artists, and advertising and public relations representatives. Lower long-distance rates have provided an additional incentive. **********Murata Business Systems of Dallas offers a machine for as low as $895, and some discount stores sell them for less than $800. Industry analysts are cautious about further price cuts. They said the strong sales appeared to make new cuts unnecessary. **********They estimate, however, that there are fewer than 20,000 fax machines in American homes and that the devices will not become a consumer hit until prices fall below $500. **********The analysts predict that as more individuals buy fax machines for home businesses they will also use the machines for personal tasks, like banking or ordering merchandise. Love Notes, Too?  ''The fax boom represents the start of an image communications revolution, but it's only the beginning,'' said Judy Pirani, an analyst with CAP International Inc., a market research firm in Marshfield, Mass. ''It will be many years before the machines are so popular that people will exchange love notes or answers to homework problems via fax.'' **********If the future of the facsimile machine as a consumer item is still uncertain, there is no question that in the business world the advent of almost instant hard-copy communications is changing the way people approach work. **********Gregory Washington, a freelance artist in Chicago, said he always sends clients a preliminary sketch of a design on his fax machine before appearing with the finished product. ''That way, we both know what to expect,'' he said. In addition, Mr. Washington said, if a client needs a drawing on the spur of the moment, a general conception can be sent to him by fax machine. **********Nancy Doniger, a freelance artist in Brooklyn, also uses her machine to send sketches to clients. But she has found another use: feeding a sketch into the facsimile machine so that it produces a copy, thus eliminating the need to own a copying machine. Machine Sends Out Bills **********To avoid lost or delayed mail, many businesses now send their bills by fax machine. A spokesman for the Clifford Gould Paper Corporation said the paper distributor transmits most of its bills with a fax machine because it allows the company to deliver more detailed bills faster. ''It's a critical part of our selling program,'' he said. ''We give our clients, especially those overseas, fast, detailed correspondence and we don't have high phone bills.'' **********An indication of the facsimile machine's importance as a business tool is the growing number of businesses that include a fax number on their stationery and business cards. ''We view facsimile as parallel to the telephone, where it takes two to communicate,'' said Ms. Weiss of Dataquest. ''You can't live without it.'' **********Most hotel chains now offer facsimile machines. ''Because so many business people have them in their offices, they are looking for them in our hotels, and usage is increasing dramatically,'' said William Oates, the Sheraton Corporation's manager of hotel systems and telecommunications. **********By some estimates, there are more than 20 million people working at home with a facsimile machine and that number is expected to continue to grow at a rate of 7 percent a year. Joseph Cosegrove, a facsimile product manager for the Sharp Corporation, estimates that a third of American employees will either do part-time or full-time work from their homes by the year 2000 and that most of them will require a fax machine. **********''People who work at home are starting to realize that to stay competitive, they need a fax that allows them to accept and send orders and information immediately as if they were in a big office,'' Mr. Cosegrove said. Technology Developed in 1842 **********Facsimile technology was developed in 1842 by a Scottish clock maker, Alexander Bain, who constructed a rudimentary machine that transmitted a crude image for a short distance. **********In the early 1920's, German inventors improved the facsimile process so that photographs could be sent overseas. Several American companies then took the lead as RCA, Western Union and the American Telephone and Telegraph Company developed systems that transmitted pictures for newspapers and weather maps. **********The present fax machines scan a document and convert dark marks into digital pulses that are changed into audible tones. They are transmitted over standard phone lines where the receiving machine reconverts the tones into digital pulses and prints a copy of the document. **********The more sophisticated machines, which cost upward of $3,000, have memory and can receive several documents, retain them and print them out later. Some can transmit photographs and half-tone reproductions used in the graphic arts industry. Some machines allow the user to send a document to numerous other facsimile machines. Corporations with their own data networks can use a master facsimile machine to distribute documents simultaneously to dozens or even hundreds of branch offices around the country. **********The new generation of faster, low-cost machines are marketed by major Japanese manufacturers like Sharp, Canon, Ricoh, Toshiba and Brother. **********The increased use of facsimile machines poses a considerable threat to next-day mail services. International Resource Development Inc., a market researcher based in New Canaan, Conn., estimates that facsimile and electronic mail could capture as much as 30 percent of Federal Express's overnight mail business. **********Analysts point out that a business that sends an average of 100 pieces of overnight mail at a cost of $15 each would recoup the cost of a $1,500 facsimile machine in a year, not considering the cost of the telephone calls to send the facsimile documents. If getting a document into someone's hands in seconds instead of overnight is critical to a business deal, the facsimile machine would pay for itself even more quickly, they said. **********''Rather than Federal Expressing it, I send it over the fax machine instantaneously,'' said Gary De Persia, president of Aegis Associates, a textile brokerage company that Mr. De Persia operates from his apartment on the Upper East Side. ''Fax allows me to work whenever I want. For example, yesterday, which was Sunday, I did all my billing when phone rates were low, and nothing was lost in the mail.'' **********Arnold Schneider, a spokesman for Federal Express, said the company had yet to experience a decline in business as a result of facsimile machines. ''We know that down the line there will be some impact,'' he said. ''But exactly how much we don't know.'' **********The surge in sales of facsimile machines comes on the heels of Federal Express's unsuccessful effort to capture more of the overnight mail market by offering a facsimile service. Named Zapmail and introduced in 1984, the service sought to provide customers with a two-hour document transmission and delivery service in major cities, but it failed to attract sufficient customers and was discontinued in 1986 at a loss of $317 million."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/14/business/british-productivity-up.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-09-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 80, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "British Productivity Up", "print_headline": "British Productivity Up", "body_text": " **********Britain increased its manufacturing productivity faster than its rivals did in the mid-1980's but is still trailing West Germany, France, Japan and the United States, the private PA Consulting Group and the Confederation of British Industry reported today."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/03/business/the-media-business-book-publishers-try-new-kinds-of-promotions.html": {"writer_name": "Edwin McDowell", "pub_date": "1988-10-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1099, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Book Publishers Try New Kinds of Promotions", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Book Publishers Try New Kinds of Promotions", "body_text": " **********A week from today, Delacorte Press will begin shipping to bookstores more than 90,000 hardcover copies of ''Killing Time in St. Cloud,'' a novel set in that Minnesota city. To stimulate sales, the publisher is sponsoring a contest in which the winner can choose a trip to St. Cloud, worth $5,000 including expenses, or $5,000 in cash. **********As bookselling becomes ever more competitive, publishers are reaching beyond conventional promotions to make such offers. Advertisements and authors' tours still play important roles, to be sure, but now publishers are increasingly calling attention to their books by giving away everything from rebates and free books to jewelry and cruises. Other Kinds of Promotion **********New American Library, hoping to persuade students to buy its dictionaries, thesaurus and desk encyclopedia, is sponsoring a back-to-school sweepstakes offering video cassettes of ''La Bamba,'' ''Dirty Dancing,'' ''Star Trek IV,'' ''Crocodile Dundee'' and ''Secret of My Success.'' **********Warner Books, calling attention to its paperback ''How to Marry the Man of Your Choice,'' is offering a free wedding gown of one's choice, worth up to about $3,000. When it published the same book in hardcover last year, Warner guaranteed that buyers of the book who did not marry within three years could get back their $14.95. **********In some of the offers, a book must be purchased in order to qualify; in other cases, all that is required is mailing in a coupon available on a store's floor display of the book. **********''We got 250,000 responses when we gave away the car from the movie 'Christine,' '' said Maryann Palumbo, director of advertising, promotion and publicity for New American Library, which reprinted in paperback the Stephen King novel on which the motion picture is based. **********New American Library publishes about 40 mass-market paperback books a month, and sponsors about 20 promotions a year. It has offered $1,000 worth of jewels as a tie-in for ''Quest,'' a novel by Richard Ben Sapir. It has given a free lipstick and eyeliner pencils with the purchase of romance novels by Catherine Coulter. And, to coincide with an annual fall sale of reference books, it last year gave away 250 video cassettes of Rodney Dangerfield in ''Back to School.'' **********''It's hard to know exactly how many more books you sell this way,'' Ms. Palumbo said. ''But we got 50,000 responses for the Dangerfield video and figured we sold 21 percent more books over all in the promotion than we normally do. We also feel we received about eight times as many floor displays in stores for 'Quest' as we would have without the contest.'' Floor Displays Help **********Many such promotions are accompanied by floor or counter displays, so-called ''dumps'' that hold 4 to 40 copies of a book. Often the sweepstakes coupon or rebate offer is attached to the display. When Jackie Collins's ''Rock Star'' goes on sale in December, the display will contain free wrapping paper to encourage customers to buy gift copies. **********With space at a premium in bookstores, publishers concede that the displays allotted to a handful of authors could subtract from the space available to others on their list. But they say that is a risk they have to take. **********''We may offer as many as five different books a month for displays,'' Ms. Palumbo said, ''and we know most stores aren't going to take them all. If one store doesn't, another might.'' **********Publishers disagree over whether to invest in special promotions for authors who are already superstars, and on whether to promote works of fiction (in which the author is often more important than the subject) or nonfiction (in which buyers are usually more concerned with the subject than the author). But all agree that certain books and authors lend themselves to such promotions - for example, ''Trump: the Art of the Deal,'' the reprint edition of which Warner will promote by offering a weekend for two at Donald J. Trump's hotel casino in Atlantic City. **********Promotions are usually considered good investments when they call attention to a new or unknown author. Thus, while Judith Guest, the co-author of ''Killing Time in St. Cloud,'' is known for her previous book, ''Ordinary People,'' her co-author, Rebecca Hill, is less widely known. So Delacorte's promotion is intended partly to increase the name recognition of Ms. Hill. **********To promote its new Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys ''super mystery'' series, in which the well-known teen-age sleuths combine forces for the first time, Pocket Books recently co-sponsored a ''mystery sweepstakes'' with a grand prize that includes a trip to New York with parents and a friend, valued at $9,973.95. **********To promote its new tax book, ''Sprouse's Income Tax Handbook, 1989,'' by Mary L. Sprouse, Penguin has printed a coupon in each book that is redeemable for a free copy of Ms. Sprouse's ''How to Survive a Tax Audit,'' a $7.95 trade paperback. ''We've never done anything like that before,'' said Marcia Burch, Penguin's publicity director. ''But with all the tax books out there, we're trying to give ours an edge.'' Incentives for Sellers, Too **********Publishers have long offered inducements to booksellers and distributors, and continue to do so. To promote the 250 titles in its Signet Classics, New American Library offered wholesale customers a sweepstakes in which the grand prize was a cruise to the Caribbean for two. Other prizes in that sweepstakes included I.B.M. computers. **********Promotions aimed at book buyers have also been around a long time, but there have never been as many as today, and publishing executives say they are constantly dreaming up new ones. **********''I think you'll see more and more of them,'' said Paul Fedorko, director of marketing for Delacorte and Dell. ''With hardcover books as well as paperbacks, you have to promote to reach people.'' **********His company has run three book-related sweepstakes in recent months, offering winners a tour of seven British pubs, promoting the British author Martha Grimes's books; a week in Venice, for an Erica Jong novel set there, and 17 days in Australia, to mark the publication of the 12th book in its series ''The Australians.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/26/business/executive-changes-271888.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-09-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 370, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "body_text": " *********** ALC Communications Corp., Birmingham, Mich., a holding company, named Marvin C.

Thousands of groups from all walks of German life were joined in opposition to the new American cruise and Pershing 2 missiles, and they forged the potent disarmament coalition that came to be known as the peace movement. **********Remnants of those heady days still linger among the fields and forests of Hunsruck, the picturesque region between the Mosel and the Rhine that has probably the heaviest concentration of American military garrisons in West Germany - more than 100, Mrs. Ronnefeldt said. **********Ninety-six crosses still stand or lie on the field outside the Hasselbach United States Air Force station, one for each of the cruise missiles deployed there. Tattered tents stand where vigils were once held, and anti-war graffiti decorate the gates and walls of American bases. A Mixed Blessing **********But now the cruise and Pershing missiles deployed amid such fury are to be quietly scrapped under the treaty signed in Washington by President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev, handing the movement both a major victory and stripping it of its prime rallying point. **********Leaders of the movement across West Germany have called for a period of contemplation to be followed by a major national conference in May to forge a new strategy. Causes still abound, ranging from the surfeit of remaining nuclear weapons to Bonn's new military cooperation with France. But the question is whether the public can be roused again as it was when snarling superpowers brandished frightening new weapons at each other over German soil. **********''The problem now is that we still have nuclear weapons and a public opinion that has become lulled,'' said Gerd Greune, an organizer of the May conference from Bonn who will be one of the keynote speakers. Leadership Is Skeptical **********Mr. Greune continued, ''The organizers of the movement are much more skeptical, and they are afraid this agreement only raises hopes, without fulfilling what we really demand: real disarmament.'' **********Mrs. Ronnefeldt, for whom the movement is her life, deeply shared that skepticism and that sense of a task only begun. From a crumbling storefront in Kastellaun, the largest town in the vicinity of the Hasselbach base, she and her husband, Clemens, still staff an office they call the Peace Bureau. It was set up in 1984 to coordinate local opposition to the missiles. **********A clutter of leaflets, stickers, documents and photographs argue the infamy of weapons and war. And some some other causes, too - on a table to the side, packages of Nicaraguan coffee are on sale to help the Sandinistas. **********''Until the cruises leave we are on alert,'' declared Mrs. Ronnefeldt, who said she spends much of her time outside the cluttered office monitoring the American bases and taking visitors on tours. Geese Guard the Motor Pool **********For Mrs. Ronnefeldt, the target is not only the missiles, but all of the American military, ranging from the sprawling United States Air Force base at Hahn to a tiny motor pool in the woods celebrated in the region because it is patrolled by geese. Gaggles of the ill-tempered birds waddle around the perimeter between two rows of fencing, honking furiously when anyone approaches. **********''Sometimes it doesn't feel like it's our own country, like it's occupied,'' Mrs. Ronnefeldt said. The sentiment, however, does not seem universally shared in Hunsruck, an economically depressed region where military bases, German and American, provide about 10 percent of the jobs and indirectly benefit about 40 percent of the population. **********''We were all very happy over the agreement to get rid of the missiles, but I don't think the Americans should leave,'' said the Rev. Rainer Vogt, the Roman Catholic pastor of Holy Cross Church in Kastellaun. He and many of his parishioners, he said, were uneasy about the missiles, but also wary of the movement, which they viewed as largely an outside force. Priest Remembers Dachau **********But the movement did instill doubts in his heart, Father Vogt confessed. He remembered visiting the site of the Dachau concentration camp as a seminarian after World War II and demanding of the local priest why he had done nothing to stop an atrocity he must have been aware of. **********''Now I worry whether I am remaining silent about a weapon with a potential for killing so many millions,'' he said. ''I think about this and pray that war will never come.'' **********The admission seemed to exemplify the profound angst over their past that still underlies so many German attitudes in matters of security and arms, one that sustains the strong longing for detente and disarmament. **********Like a substantial number of West Germans, Father Vogt believed that the credit for the new movement in arms control belonged primarily to Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 'No Fear of Gorbachev' **********''People feel he is a true man, the first Soviet leader with no wood in front of his head,'' the priest said, using a German proverb that describes a realistic and honest man. ''People have no fear of Gorbachev, only that he still has opposition. The problem with Mr. Reagan is that you can't be sure. I fear he can get out of control.'' **********Public opinion polls by the Allensbach Institute have shown that only 24 percent of West Germans today view the Soviet Union as a military threat, compared with 55 percent five years ago. Half the people now favor unilateral disarmament, as opposed to 35 percent five years ago. **********As they have moved onto some of the movement's turf, mainstream political parties have also taken back many of its adherents. Tomas Leif, author of a major study on the movement, said that of the 5,000 to 6,000 groups that made up the movement in 1983, at most 2,000 remained, and many of these were in disarray. **********But leaders of the remnant seemed convinced that the force unleashed in 1983-84 is still there, even if dormant. **********''The fact is that we have a spectrum among the middle-aged and the youth who have grown up with this movement, who are really skeptical that established institutions can solve our problems,'' Mr. Greune said. ''So if there is a concrete issue - if Congress doesn't ratify the treaty, or if there are new deployments - you can be pretty sure we could mobilize a great number of people again.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/31/business/hughes-inquiry-is-reported.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-05-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 209, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hughes Inquiry Is Reported", "print_headline": "Hughes Inquiry Is Reported", "body_text": " **********The Hughes Aircraft Company is under investigation on charges that it earned millions of dollars in improper profits on a 1983 missile contract with the Army, The Los Angeles Times reported Saturday. **********A Federal grand jury in Birmingham, Ala., has subpoenaed 13 officials of Hughes, a subsidiary of the General Motors Corporation, the newspaper said, quoting an unidentified Hughes official. **********At least seven Federal employees have appeared before the jury, and Malcolm R.

Gross, managing director of the Pacific Investment Management Company, which invests $16 billion in fixed-income securities for pension fund accounts. ''The Japanese dealers are the new risk-takers.'' **********Earlier this month, a panel of House and Senate conferees agreed to an amendment to the trade bill that would bar foreign financial institutions from acting as primary dealers in Government securities if within one year their own governments did not grant the same ''competitive opportunities'' in the underwriting and distribution of government debt. **********Even if the proposal becomes law, it may not take effect if the Japanese Government opens its financial markets wider to United States bond firms, said Representative Charles Schumer of Brooklyn, the amendment's sponsor. He added that he hoped that the threat of the proposed legislation would force Japan to open its markets. **********''They're not going to do it on their own,'' he said. ''My goal is not to pass the amendment but to open the markets.'' **********While the proposed legislation calls for competitive opportunities for outside firms, Mr. Schumer said he was willing to negotiate on that point before it become law. **********Nevertheless, many institutional investors think that any legislation restricting the bond market may prove more harmful than the situation the legislation is trying to correct. They said the United States must learn to accept that the Japanese are in part financing its budget deficit by buying an estimated 30 percent of the 30-year Treasury issues at bond auctions. **********''It may not be fair, but they have most of the money,'' said Barbara L. Kenworthy, a portfolio manager of eight fixed-income mutual funds totaling $500 million at the Dreyfus Corporation. ''Reality says you have to bend a little.'' **********Many Japanese investors do their buying through Japanese dealers like Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities and Nikko Securities, which would lose their primary dealer status under the legislation. Obviously, not all Japanese institutions would simply stop buying bonds if the proposal became law. But they might not be so aggressive at the auctions of new issues. **********The threat of losing primary dealer status means a lot. For one thing, the 42 current primary dealers buy Government bills, notes and bonds directly from the Federal Reserve at auctions. This gives them a market advantage over secondary dealers. They can better determine the tone of the auction and provide their customers with better prices, Mr. Gross said. And many customers, like state, local and municipal governments, are required by law to conduct certain transactions only with primary dealers. Some portfolio managers say that these days the Japanese dealers are more aggressive in pricing and more accommodating to customers than the old-line Wall Street firms. Since October, they point out, American firms have been much more conservative - less willing to commit capital and offer extra service for their clients. **********For instance, Mr. Gross said that the Japanese firms were now willing to hold their price open on bonds for an extra 30 to 60 seconds, which is uncommon among American dealers. That may not sound like much, but it gives portfolio managers like Mr. Gross and his colleagues valuable extra time to decide whether the price fits their clients' strategy. ''The Japanese are willing to accommodate to buy business,'' he said. **********Executives at the three Japanese firms that are now primary dealers were surprised and angered by the proposed amendment. ''Many of us were stunned,'' said an executive at one of the firms, who did not want to be identified.

So he took a few suits from his father's closet and wheeled his wares down the block in a little red wagon. The first neighbor he approached sent him home, but an entrepreneur had been born. **********Today, Dan Storper is the 37-year-old founder and president of Putumayo, an expanding chain of women's stores known for its flowing designs, bright signature sashes and colorful collections of crafts and jewelry, mostly from South America. In little more than a decade, Mr. Storper has parlayed a tiny $500-a-month store on Manhattan's Upper East Side into seven stores in five cities and a sprawling wholesale operation that together are expected to post $15 million in sales this year. **********Now, as an adult, Mr. Storper is again going door to door, this time to raise millions of dollars for his latest big move: an ambitious plan to open as many as 50 more stores around the country in the next five years. **********Getting the money may be the easiest part of the process, however. Mr. Storper faces the classic challenge of making the transition from an essentially one-man operation to the big time. It is a transition particularly fraught with hazards for a business like his, whose success has been so dependent on the personality and taste of one person. **********''There is the risk that entrepreneurs can't make the change from a hands-on operation,'' said Alice McCord, a senior vice president for planning and research at the National Retail Merchants Association, a trade group based in New York. **********Mr. Storper will also have to insure continuity - to keep his existing customer base - while at the same time being resilient enough to meet the demands of a much larger and far more diverse marketplace, retail experts say. ''The big test is to see if he can roll it out - whether he can take it from Columbus Avenue to Roosevelt Field,'' said Herbert Wittkin, a management consultant and former vice president of the Allied Stores Corporation. **********Others have stumbled along the way. The Gap Inc., for example, has had mixed results in expanding Banana Republic, the chain of safari-style clothing stores it acquired in 1983. **********But some analysts are optimistic about Mr. Storper's chances. For one thing, he has already brought in outside help. For another, Mr. Storper expects to retain majority ownership of the company, avoiding the kind of disagreements over marketing and other issues that led Banana Republic's founders to break with their new corporate owners. **********PUTUMAYO - named for a river in the Andes that Mr. Storper visited after graduating from Washington University with a degree in Latin American studies - benefits as well from the start-to-finish operation that Mr. Storper has put together over the years, designing everything in-house and having the clothes made in places like Sri Lanka, Portugal and India. ''The thing he has going for him is that he has already developed a vertical operation: designing, manufacturing as well as retailing,'' Ms. McCord said. **********And Mr. Storper's timing seems good. ''His merchandise isn't as narrowly focused as the Banana Republic's is,'' said Ms. McCord. ''At a time when other sportswear has become redundant, Putumayo has been able to develop a very fresh distinctive appeal in filling a niche that other companies aren't. I see his chances as being very good.'' **********Indeed, said James Posner, a New York-based retail consultant. ''If you really have a good niche on the market, you should be able to go like a laser beam.'' **********MR. STORPER is an eclectic brand of businessman, one who combines the passion of an art collector with the perseverance of a traveling salesman. His easy-going manner belies his success. His face is friendly, framed by dark curly hair with a touch of gray, and he goes to work by subway, in casual shirts and khaki pants. **********The trinkets and treasures that clutter his Wooster Street headquarters in the SoHo section of Manhattan suggest a man with an eye for the exotic as well as the classic, someone who sees life as an ongoing garage sale. Hanging from the walls, for instance, are a traditional holiday costume from the highlands of Ecuador, old checker boards from New England and a sign from a West African beauty parlor. **********Mr. Storper has come a long way since his boy-wonder beginnings in 1975 when he rented a 200-square-foot space on East 73d Street, built shelves out of cinderblocks and pine board and kept the stock in his parents' garage in Great Neck, L.I. **********Putumayo was strictly a Manhattan retailer until this year, with stores on Lexington Avenue, Columbus Avenue and SoHo's Spring Street. But then Mr. Storper quickly opened in Boston, New Bedford, Mass., Princeton, N.J., and, most recently, in the newly renovated Union Station in Washington. **********Although expansion had always been a part of his plans, Mr. Storper said, it was accelerated after discussions ended in the spring of 1987 over a possible purchase of Putumayo by The Gap. ''It was tempting,'' said Mr. Storper, who owns 100 percent of his company. ''But I decided that I really was unwilling to surrender either control or destiny to a larger corporation.'' **********He may have to surrender some control, however, to expand further. Until now, the money to open the new stores has come out of operating income. But the $2 million to $4 million Mr. Storper needs for the next phase of expansion will come from outside lenders. He has been negotiating in recent months with a number of banks and venture capitalists, none of whom he would identify. His company, he said, most likely will wind up with a blend of bank and private money. Venture capitalists involved in the deal, he said, would probably get 15 to 20 percent of the company in return for their backing. **********THE investors would be buying an interest in 1,500-square-foot stores that Mr. Storper expects will generate sales of about $750,000 each the first year - about $500 per square foot - and $1 million by the second year, with 8 to 10 percent annual increases thereafter. The national median for stores of this size is about half that level. But Mr. Storper says he has reason to feel confident. So far, each of his stores has been profitable within a month; his Manhattan stores average $1,000 a foot - comparable to what another fashionable chain, Laura Ashley, says its New York stores bring in. **********Prices will continue to be in the moderate range, from $38 to $68 for skirts, for example. Putumayo's gross margin is about 50 percent for wholesale items and 55 to 60 percent for retail, Mr. Storper said. Those markups are in line with industry averages for specialty stores.  Mr. Storper remains wary about giving up more control of the company, even indirectly, as he feels he would if his wholesale operation became more tied to department stores. **********The department stores ''all want special considerations'' and ''tend not to be geared to customer service or merchandising clothing well,'' he said. Putumayo clothing has been available in a few department stores, including Strawbridge & Clothier, and the spring collection will be sold at Marshall Field in Chicago and Macy's in Atlanta. Perhaps three more department stores will be added in 1989. **********''The emphasis is still on the specialty stores,'' Mr. Storper said, referring to the 850 smaller outlets that he supplies nationwide. **********As he has struggled to hold on to corporate control, he has begun to delegate more of his operating authority. It was not until 1985 - when he bounced a $35,000 company check - that he hired a financial adviser to help plan cash flow, establish a larger credit line and engage experienced accountants. The business ''was too big to keep running on gut,'' he said. **********During the last year, he hired a director of store development, a director to train employees and a design team. Now, he spends three months of the year traveling abroad with his fiancee, Judith Falci, an assistant creative director for Putumayo, or staying at his vacation home in Santa Fe, N.M. **********WHILE the expansion promises to increase Putumayo's sales and stature, it also threatens to compromise its character. But Mr. Storper says his original intent in creating Putumayo remains intact. ''I started with the dream of being able to create an environment where I could sell products from all over the world,'' he said. ''The point is not only to design a type of clothing that lots of people like to wear, but to develop appreciation for the cultures that inspired me.'' **********When it first opened, Putumayo sold crafts as well as clothing, but Mr. Storper discontinued the crafts line because customers were unfamiliar with the pieces and his staff was ill-equipped to explain or promote them. With the new fall collection, however, he has begun to integrate folk art into the merchandise again, with explanation cards attached to each item. **********The coming spring collection will be the first jointly designed by Mr. Storper and his new three-person team. During the last six years, Mr. Storper designed most of the clothing himself. His technique, if it can be called that, is haphazard - a cuff from this, a collar from that. He gets ideas from books or by observing the way people dress in other cultures. Then he describes his designs to manufacturers. **********Now, the process is more organized. But head designer Jean Sweeney, who came to Putumayo last March from Macy's private label division, said it cannot quite be called a collaboration. ''It's Dan's concept and we sort of carry it through,'' she said. ''He's unique in this industry because he doesn't come from a clothing background, he comes from an art background, so he looks at things differently.'' **********One measure of that difference is his reluctance to define a Putumayo style. ''They have called us a country Ann Taylor, an updated Laura Ashley, a poor man's Ralph Lauren,'' he said. ''Everyone tries to find an angle.'' If pressed, he describes Putumayo as ''international country,'' and said that he tries to find the balance between preservation and innovation. **********He is less murky about his prospects, however. ''There are times when I'm nervous,'' he said, ''and there are times - like these - when I really feel that we're at a point where we will be successful.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/26/world/trade-pact-sends-canada-into-election-fever.html": {"writer_name": "John Burns", "pub_date": "1988-07-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 829, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Trade Pact Sends Canada Into Election Fever", "print_headline": "Trade Pact Sends Canada Into Election Fever", "body_text": " **********After spending much of the year as interested bystanders in the Presidential contest in the United States, Canadians have suddenly found themselves in a pre-election fever of their own. **********As matters stand, the betting in political circles is that Prime Minister Brian Mulroney will call an election before the end of the year, perhaps as early as October. **********If so, Canada's 17 million voters would be confronted with a choice that is widely regarded as going to the heart of the kind of country they will be living in when the century ends - one that is economically integrated with the United States, or a nation that seeks to balance itself between the United States, Western Europe and the emerging economic powers of Asia. **********The likelihood of an election increased sharply last week when the opposition Liberal Party announced that it would use its majority in the Senate, the appointed upper house of Parliament, to block the free-trade deal that the Mulroney Government has negotiated with the United States. Mulroney's Options **********Since the deal is scheduled to go into effect on Jan. 1, Mr. Mulroney's only options appeared to be to call an election, to hold a referendum on the trade deal, or to ask Congress and the Reagan Administration to defer the date for carrying out the trade pact. **********An election appeared the most likely choice. And this is not an altogether welcome prospect for Mr. Mulroney since his Conservative Party has not led in the opinion polls for more than two years. **********Moreover, he would be battling history. Three times in the past century Canada has negotiated a free trade agreement with the United States and backed away from it each time. #2 Key Election Issues An early election would be likely to turn on two major issues. One will be the free trade deal, which will eliminate all tariffs over a 10-year period and lower barriers to investment, as well as other curbs on trade in agriculture, energy and services. **********The other will be whether John N. Turner, the Liberal leader, erred in asking an unelected group of Liberal Senators, many of them appointees of the Liberal Government that was thrown out in the Conservative landslide of 1984, to block the will of the elected Conservative majority in the House of Commons. **********On free trade, public opinion appears about evenly balanced. Most polls have shown a narrow majority for the agreement, but as many as 30 percent of those asked remain undecided. And Conservative Party officials worry that the nationalist sentiments being stirred by the Liberals and the New Democratic Party could raise a groundswell against the pact. **********''Making the case for this agreement - more jobs, increased prosperity for the resource-based regions of the country, a shield against U.S. protectionism - is going to be a tougher job than tearing it down,'' a Cabinet minister said recently. $130 Billion in Trade Many Canadian economists say that the consequences of the agreement have been overplayed on both sides. Nearly 80 percent of all goods traded in the $130 billion of merchandise trade that passes between the two nations each year already is tariff-free. **********And as for concerns that Canada could lose its economic independence, nearly 80 percent of all its exports already go to the United States. On some of the most sensitive issues, including those that involve Canada's ''cultural'' industries like broadcasting and publishing and Canadian control of its health industry, the pact entrenches Canada's autonomy. **********Until last week's move by the Liberals, Mr. Mulroney was thought to be leaning in favor of a spring election, a few months before the September 1989 expiration of his mandate. An election then would take advantage of having the free-trade pact in place. U.S. Presidential Race **********Another consideration was that the United States would have a new President, presumably George Bush or Michael S. Dukakis, both of whom have strongly supported the trade pact. With either man, there was thought to be an advantage for the Conservatives in having a new face in the White House. **********But now, neither of the Prime Minister's alternatives to an early vote appears particularly inviting.

These are the refugees who fled the mainland in 1949 with the Nationalist Government of Chiang Kai-shek, after being routed by the Communist forces of Mao Zedong. **********A tiny minority is aboriginal. The aborigines, of Malayan descent, dominated Taiwan until mainland Chinese began settling the island in the 12th century. **********More than 95 percent of the people practice Buddhism, Taoism or Confucianism. About 5 percent are Christian. **********Mandarin is the official language; Taiwanese and Hakka dialects are also spoken.  Geography **********Taiwan lies at the juncture of the East and South China Seas about 100 miles from mainland China. The country consists of a large island, Taiwan, the islands of Quemoy and Matsu, and the islets of the Pescadores chain, which lie between Taiwan and the mainland. **********Taiwan is bisected by a north-south mountain range. Its total area is 13,968 square miles, slightly larger than Maryland and Delaware combined. **********The climate is tropical with heat and heavy rainfall in the summer and cooler conditions from November to March.  History **********Portuguese navigators explored Taiwan in 1590, calling it Formosa, or ''beautiful.'' China controlled Taiwan until 1895, when it was ceded to Japan. After World War II, Taiwan was restored to China, then under the Nationalist Government of Chiang Kai-shek. **********After Chiang Kai-shek fled to Taiwan in December 1949, his loyalists constituted less than a fifth of the population, but they quickly dominated the country, building a 600,000-man army with the aim of recapturing the mainland. **********Chiang Kai-shek became president on March 1, 1950. The Government on Taiwan has maintained that it is the rightful government of mainland China. **********Chiang Kai-shek died on April 5, 1975.

And Sweden, which prides itself on promoting international peace, is apparently unwilling to try to take that step. **********Handling the submarine issue without naming the Russians has left Mr. Carlsson performing a diplomatic fan dance this week. He said today that he had long discussions with Mr. Ryzhkov on the subject of submarine incursions. **********The Soviet Union has consistently denied sending its submarines into Swedish waters. Recently, Soviet brushoffs of the allegations have amounted to daring the Swedes to try to sink any straying submarines. ''Bomb us by all means,'' Gen. Nikolai Chervov, head of the disarmament department of the Soviet armed forces, said on Swedish television last Sunday. ''We have not been in your waters.'' Still, all the evidence points to the Russians rather than any smaller nations or the United States. In 1981, a Soviet submarine ran aground on the rocks near Karlskrona.

Mr. Hamid had to run back to his house and fetch a bucket of paint. As the soldiers watched, he slopped it over a half-dozen Arabic slogans scrawled on the sides of homes and shops. **********When he had finished, some of the graffiti were still visible. ''The uprising will continue against the will of the occupiers,'' one sign said. Another declared, ''The leadership warns those who paint over signs.'' Layers of Slogans **********Under those slogans was an earlier layer of paint, and under that were more slogans from a few weeks before. **********It was not the first time soldiers had given Mr. Hamid an order like this. ''The last time they came, I fought them; I didn't want to paint,'' he said. ''But this is nothing. When the soldiers leave, the signs will go back.'' **********Just as soldiers can keep the Arabic slogans off the walls of Salim for only a few days at a time, Israel's many-layered approach to crushing the six-month-old Palestinian uprising seems unable to do anything more than channel the Palestinian anger in new directions. Uprising 'Has Phases' **********The uprising ''has phases,'' Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said in an interview. ''The best known was the large-scale demonstrations - roadblocks, burning tires, stone-throwing,'' he said. ''But they have not been able to keep that up in the face of the measures we have been using. **********''So now,'' he added, ''they are shifting to more individual violence. They are shifting to more petrol bombs.'' **********The army's Chief of Staff, Gen. Dan Shomron, came to the same conclusion last week. ''Since they realize they can no longer stage big demonstrations, they have turned to Molotov cocktails and arson,'' he told Parliament. **********Every day there are new reports. The Government said two Arab youths were arrested on arson charges today. On Saturday a Palestinian was shot and killed in Gaza when he tried to throw a firebomb, the army reported. **********The Government estimates that more than 800 homemade firebombs have been thrown since the uprising begun, almost half of them in just the last few weeks. Several Israelis have been wounded but none killed, though two Palestinians who were apparently mistaken for Jews burned to death in their car last month after it was hit by a firebomb. At the end of last week, 16 Palestinian homes were destroyed or sealed off as reprisal for firebomb attacks. But still the attacks continue, and this new phase of the uprising seems to have silenced the repeated hopeful projections over the last two months from senior members of the Israeli Government, who said the uprising was at last coming to an end. **********On Saturday, Gen. Amram Mitzna, commander of forces in the West Bank, said for the first time that in his view the occupied territories could never return to the relative calm known before the violence began in December. The uprising, he said, would probably continue a long time. 'Toying With an Illusion' **********An editorial today in the daily newspaper Yedioth Aharonoth said: **********''For a short while we tried to believe, maybe because we wanted it so badly, that the intifadeh is dying down and calm is prevailing instead. The events of the last few days slap us in the face and show us that we were only toying with an illusion. Not only us but also army commanders and the Defense Minister. **********''Now it is made clear that the uprising has only taken on a new form -less violent riots and rock-throwing and more arson and firebombs.'' **********''We must live with this as long as the political echelons do not initiate steps toward peace negotiations,'' the editorial concluded. ''For now there is no sign of this.'' Civil Disobedience Falters **********Though the Israelis have not succeeded in crushing the uprising, not everything the Palestinians try has succeeded, either. **********For the last several weeks the leaflets put out by the uprising's underground leadership have called for widespread civil disobedience. Palestinians should not pay Israeli taxes or keep working for Israeli Government employers, the leaflets have said. **********But even leading Palestinians say the call for civil disobedience has largely failed. On some days. people wait lined up outside the tax offices. And while some Palestinians working for the military government have quit, others who left have quietly returned to work. **********Nevertheless, the Palestinians are demonstrating tenacity. **********In the town square of Salim, the reserve captain leading an Israeli Army patrol explained that his men had come to town and ordered Mr. Hamid to paint over the slogans ''because we have to come in from time to time; the slogans are illegal.'' 'We'll Put Them Back' **********His jeep drove off, and as soon as he was out of sight, two dozen boys and young men poured out of buildings and alleys, pointing happily to the graffiti, Palestinian flags and pictures of Yasir Arafat the army had overlooked. **********''They took down our flags, but as soon as they are gone, we'll put them back,'' a teen-ager said. **********Just then an old woman on a nearby roof screamed a warning, and the boys dashed off. The patrol was coming back. When the soldiers pulled in, the square was empty. As soon as they left, the boys came out again. **********''We're fighting kids,'' a army reserve private who is nearing age 40 said, shaking his head. ''We're just doing what we're told.

Danny Wall, addressing the industry on the closing day of the United States League of Savings Institution's annual convention here, said the legislative history of deposit insurance indicated that Congress planned to cover only normal losses and not abnormal or catastrophic losses. **********Though Mr. Wall declined to draw any conclusions, the implications are that Congress is responsible to cover the losses at almost 500 insolvent savings and loans, estimated to range from $50 billion to $100 billion, and that the industry should not be made to bear the financial burden. Healthy Institutions **********That would please the league officials, who throughout this four-day convention have asserted that the healthy saving and loans did not cause the problems and should not bear the burden. **********''Congress provided only for what you would call normal losses,'' Mr. Wall said. ''That is our assessment. I think Congress now has to go back and make its own assessment of what it did.'' **********At the same time, Mr. Wall played down suggestions by a bank board member, Roger Martin, that the agency should consider suspending the extra deposit insurance premium levied on the industry since 1985. **********Mr. Martin has been suggesting here that the $1.2 billion in ''special assessment premiums'' the agency collects every year is insignificant in relation to the problem, and that the risks to healthy savings and loans of paying such a premium outweighs the benefits. Commercial Bank Fees **********The premiums paid by commercial banks for insurance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation are less than half those paid by savings and loan associations for their insurance. **********Mr. Wall said Mr. Martin had not discussed the idea with him. A top bank board staff member also said he had not heard of the Martin proposal. **********Mr. Martin has also been telling convention delegates and reporters here that the cost of the ultimate rescue could be higher than the bank board's current estimate of $45 billion to $50 billion. But again, Mr. Wall said he had not heard of Mr. Martin's calculations. **********''Our estimate stands and will continue to stand until we deem it necessary to change it,'' Mr. Wall said. Members of the bank board staff said that the two incidents underscored a growing tension between Mr. Wall and Mr. Martin. **********It seemed that both regulators were in some form trying to calm industry executives who fear the loss of their independence as a separate industry if the Government steps in with a huge taxpayer bailout. **********''Hold your heads high, because you continue to have the best charter going,'' Mr. Wall said in his talk. **********In his statements on deposit insurance premiums, Mr. Wall said that in a 1935 report to Congress, accountants calculated that, based on banking experience in the prior 50 years, in order to cover normal, abnormal and catastrophic losses by banks and savings institutions, the Government would have to charge an insurance premium equal to 32 cents per $100 of insured deposits. Legislative History **********But instead, Congress decided to set deposit insurance at 8.3 cents per $100 of deposit insurance, about one-quarter of the higher amount. It also gave the bank board authority to impose an extra premium equal to 12.5 cents, so that now savings and loans are paying almost 21 cents per $100. **********Mr. Wall said the agency had calculated that if Congress had indeed imposed the 32 cents per $100 premium since the 1930's, ''it would have paid for all of the losses in the industry and would have left us with a surplus.'' **********The Wall statements can also be interpreted as a signal that premiums are too low. He said in an interview that he could envision steps by Congress to give the F.D.I.C. authority to raise them. **********''It could be that the F.D.I.C. might come up with its own special assessment to cover their future losses, and all of a sudden the two industry's are at equity,'' Mr. Wall said. **********At a news conference Mr. Wall chided the industry, Congress and the press for not knowing more about the origins of deposit insurance.

They say the 1987 Christmas season continued a sluggishness that began last spring when consumers, with little or no savings, found themselves uncomfortably deep in debt. Competition and Promotion **********The year will be very competitive and highly promotional, particularly in the spring, so both sales and profits will be harder to find, said Robert H. Morosky, president of the Allied Stores Corporation. **********''We still haven't fathomed the effect of the stock market crash, and so I'm concerned about spring-summer,'' he said. ''It represents about 45 percent of the year's sales. But fall-winter has the larger share, and that is what we're banking on.'' **********Some analysts see the year as one of the least productive in some time. ''Over the last 20 years, increases in general merchandise sales ranged from less than 3 percent to 13 percent, with the worst year in 1982, when it was only 2.5 percent,'' said Bruce Missett, an analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc. ''I expect 1987 sales will show a 5 to 6 percent gain, while 1988 will be among the lowest, only 3 to 5 percent over 1987.'' **********Harold W. Sells, chairman of the F. W. Woolworth Company, sees 1988 as similar to the two previous years - ''not robust for retailers, but not one with any sharp decline, either.'' Retailers' profits will remain squeezed by ''heavy price promotions, which, once started, are difficult to get away from.'' Shifts From Mergers **********Mergers will shift from the large department store chains to the apparel specialty chains, which have had slow sales. Stacy Ruchlamer, an analyst for Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., says such companies as Clothestime Inc., of Anaheim, Calif., and the Cincinnati-based U. S. Shoe Corporation may be acquired. **********Kurt Barnard, publisher of the Retail Marketing Report, a newsletter, expects mergers among the American franchisees of Benetton, the Italian manufacturer, and among the retail businesses of several fashion designers. **********In other developments, hypermarkets, the European concept of massive, single stores with food and nonfood items, will begin to sprout across America under ventures with such companies as the K Mart Corporation and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. **********The boutique, or ''shop within a store,'' will pick up steam among department stores as brand-name producers and home and fashion designers vie for space in the busiest stores. ''That trend is still in the embryonic stage,'' said Ms. Ruchlamer of Shearson. ''Shoppers want not only values, but they want them in recognizable brand names.'' **********Also, a changed, less-frivolous consumer, opting for home and leisure-time goods, will confound retailers and suppliers by shunning anything that does not appear to be durable and practical or that lacks ''undeniable value,'' Mr. Barnard said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/20/world/kadar-said-to-face-a-tough-challenge-for-hungarian-leadership.html": {"writer_name": "Henry Kamm", "pub_date": "1988-05-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 843, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Kadar Said to Face a Tough Challenge for Hungarian Leadership", "print_headline": "Kadar Said to Face a Tough Challenge for Hungarian Leadership", "body_text": " **********Janos Kadar, the leader of Hungary's Communist Party, is facing a severe challenge for the leadership from Karoly Grosz, the man whom he installed as Prime Minister last June, party figures reported today. **********Officials with close links to party headquarters reported that Mr. Kadar, who was put in power by the Soviet Union during the 1956 uprising, had yielded to mounting party pressure and agreed to cede his place to Mr. Grosz at the national party conference, which is opening Friday. They said the decision had been reached at a Politburo meeting last Monday. **********This report could not be confirmed independently, but the rivalry between the two leaders has become a subject of open discussion in party circles in the last few weeks. Will Conclude Sunday **********In view of the intense leadership competition, diplomats familiar with the report said they could not exclude a possibility that Mr. Grosz's supporters might be using leaks to the press to advance his ambitions. **********Officially, party spokesmen depicted the conference as the most open meeting of its kind in party history. The conference will conclude Sunday with the election of a new Central Committee, which in turn will formally name a General Secretary, as the party leader is formally known, and Politburo. **********But Hungarians with long experience in party affairs, said the leader, as in the past, would be or had already been chosen behind closed doors by the Politburo and rubber-stamped by the Central Committee. The process, they said, would not be made final until the Soviet Union had indicated that it did not object to the choice of leader. Choice Narrowed to 2 **********Even party figures who said the final decision on Mr. Kadar's continuation in leadership had not yet been made said that Mr. Grosz had clearly advanced to such standing in the party since becoming Prime Minister last June that the choice had to be between Mr. Kadar, who will turn 76 years old May 26, and Mr. Grosz, who is 57. **********Party figures also said that the Politburo and the party Secretariat, the main focuses of power in Communist countries, would be drastically renewed, with many of the most faithful Kadar supporters or contemporaries being retired. **********The officials who affirmed that Mr. Grosz's succession to the leadership had already been decided said there was still no certainty over whether Mr. Kadar would be retired or whether an honorific post of party President might be created for him to ease his way into retirement. **********Diplomats said, on the other hand, that Mr. Kadar might well use such a job not as an honorary post but try to invest it with real power. Seen as Responsible for Crisis **********There is unanimity among officials and party figures that Mr. Kadar did not wish to resign. If he did agree to yield to Mr. Grosz, they said, it would be because of a realization that many Hungarians, including party members and officials, were holding him responsible for the deep economic crisis, the continuing decline in standards of living and the harsh austerity measures that were adopted at the beginning of the year. **********A bitter joke circulating in the capital said Mr. Kadar was refusing to step down because he wanted to turn over the country to his successor in the condition in which he took it over. Mr. Kadar was installed as party chief at Soviet behest during the violent 1956 revolt that was put down by Moscow's armed forces. **********The exceptional party conference, the first in Hungary since 1957, is a measure of the depth of the nation''s malaise. Normally the party's congresses, held every five years, are the groups authorized to elect new leaders and chart the party's future path. The next congress is not due until 1990. **********Although diplomats who have seen Mr. Kadar over the last year say that he remains in good health and of lively mind, there is general agreement that he is no longer as active in all areas of leadership as he had been throughout his rule and that Mr. Grosz as Prime Minister has stepped forward, giving the impression that he is setting the policies that his Cabinet carries out. **********This would be a reversal of practice in the Soviet bloc, where there is generally no doubt that the Government is merely the executor of the party leadership's decisions. **********The officials said that, at least temporarily, Mr. Grosz would continue as Prime Minister even if he is elected party leader. This practice, once common in the Soviet bloc, was discontinued in the 1960's. Following the Soviet example, the leadership of the Government was taken out of the party chief's hands. Mr. Kadar gave up being Prime Minister in 1965."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/08/world/charting-road-moscow-speeds-plans-for-afghan-pullout-even-if-it-risks-collapse.html": {"writer_name": "Bill Keller", "pub_date": "1988-01-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1182, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis; News Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Moscow Speeds Plans for Afghan Pullout Even if it Risks Collapse of Kabul Regime", "print_headline": "CHARTING THE ROAD OUT; Moscow Speeds Plans for Afghan Pullout Even if it Risks Collapse of Kabul Regime", "body_text": " **********Having failed to find a safe exit from Afghanistan, the Soviet Union may now be bracing itself to settle for a quick exit - even one that leaves the possibility of continued civil warfare on this country's southern border. **********If so, it would be because a cold look at the situation has convinced Soviet leaders that the military stalemate is unbreakable, an internal political settlement is unworkable, and the costs of the Soviet occupation in tarnished international prestige and domestic pain are growing. **********The future of the Soviet-backed Government of the Afghan party leader, Najibullah, seems in serious doubt. Many officials - including some Soviet officials - believe that a negotiated withdrawal would not stop the bloodshed for long. But such a withdrawal now appears to be the only deal available, and Soviet officials are suddenly, publicly ready to take it. Forceful Message Conveyed **********That is the implicit but forceful message in a series of Soviet statements after Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze's trip this week to Kabul. **********By letting the shape of the deal be known, Mr. Shevardnadze apparently hopes to salvage some moral and political high ground before details of a withdrawal are worked out at United Nations-sponsored negotiations in Geneva. **********The Kremlin still wants cooperation from the White House, from the rebels and from Mr. Najibullah, and a new dose of public diplomacy may be Moscow's best hope of getting it. Shift in Soviet Position **********The evidence of a shift in the Soviet position is contained in Mr. Shevardnadze's interview Wednesday with the Afghan press agency, as well as additional comments today by Yuri K. Alekseyev, chief of the Foreign Ministry division that deals with Afghanistan, Iran and Turkey. Mr. Alekseyev accompanied the Foreign Minister to Kabul. **********Speaking in language that was sometimes diplomatically elliptical, but clear enough to the intended audience, Mr. Shevardnadze and his deputies let it be known that each of the major obstacles that once loomed in the path of a Soviet withdrawal have been either removed or minimized. **********On the issue of a timetable, the Soviet offer to remove all the troops within 12 months of an agreement has now become a hope to complete withdrawal by the end of this year. And that, too, Mr. Alekseyev reiterated today, is ''flexible.'' Mr. Alekseyev, speaking before Secretary of State George P. Shultz's press conference in Washington today, said: ''We're talking about months, not years.'' **********Negotiators in Geneva must still set a date to begin withdrawal, which the Soviet officials said would be within 60 days of a signing. They must also work out the order of withdrawal and terms of verification. **********The issue of American aid to the rebels, once a justification for leaving the troops in place, has been resolved, the Soviet officials say. This week the officials dropped their familiar complaints that the United States is the culprit in prolonging the war, and said for the first time that Americans have agreed to cut off aid to the rebels under an agreement. U.S. Aid May Be a Factor **********American officials confirm this, but the Administration is not unanimously behind the offer. Part of Mr. Shevardnadze's strategy may be to force a public White House commitment to cut off aid, thus stifling the protests of those in the Administration who would prefer to supply the rebels all the way to Kabul. **********Most striking, Mr. Shevardnadze and his deputy made it clear that withdrawal of the troops was not contingent on creation of a transition government acceptable to Mr. Najibullah and his Soviet sponsors. **********Mr. Shevardnadze said Moscow still hopes for a neutral, nonaligned, stable Afghanistan. But that, he left no doubt, is a question to be resolved after the withdrawal timetable has been set. The Soviet troops will leave, Mr. Alekseyev repeated today, when ''external aspects'' of the problem are resolved. **********Mr. Shevardnadze may hope that open talk of an approaching agreement will tempt some of the rebels to cut a deal with Kabul to assure themselves a place after the troops leave. Growing Desire to Leave **********Pressed today to say if it was ''all the same'' to the Soviet Union what happened after it goes home, Mr. Alekseyev replied calmly, ''The direction of national reconciliation is the affair of the Afghans themselves.'' **********The new public line comes as other signs of a growing Soviet readiness to pull out are increasing. One such sign is the extensive Soviet press coverage of the battle for the Afghan city of Khost, implying that the war is ready for Afghanization. Another is a sudden Soviet emphasis on economic and trade relations with Afghanistan, a consolation prize intended to assure the Afghan and Soviet audience that the country is not being abandoned outright. **********Soviet officials readily admit the war is casting a shadow over Soviet attempts to reconcile with China and to woo new friends in the Middle East. The casualties, including a Soviet death count that by the most conservative Western estimates exceeds 12,000 men, have begun to cause stirrings of discontent at home. **********American aid has made it impossible to dislodge the rebels militarily, because American ground-to-air missiles keep Soviet helicopters and airplanes from flying cover for troops on the ground. Mr. Alekseyev said today that peace prevails in just two of Afghanistan's 29 provinces. **********The latest Soviet position is a tacit admission that the ''national reconciliation plan,'' announced after Mr. Shevardnadze's last visit to Kabul a year ago, has failed to reunite the country. By Kabul's own estimates, only 100,000 of the four to five million Afghan refugees in Pakistan and Iran have accepted an offer of amnesty and resettlement. Efforts at Coalition Unsuccessful **********Efforts to push the warring parties into a coalition government have met with no success because of divisions among the rebels and the insistence of some factions that they will never unite with the Communists in Kabul. **********The prospect of a Soviet departure leaves Mr. Najibullah's future in doubt. Mr. Alekseyev said today that Mr. Najibullah's party ''does not claim any monopoly on power,'' and he expressed optimism that the party would ''still be a political force.'' Western diplomats are more inclined to black humor about Mr. Najibullah's place on the last departing Soviet helicopter. **********A senior Soviet official bristled today at the suggestion that Mr. Najibullah had been sold out. **********''He was very realistic from the beginning and he understood that there would be a compromise,'' the official said. ''The terms are still not certain. The conditions have not been specified. But he knew the outcome.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/19/world/a-statue-now-us-judge-is-judged-unworthy.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-01-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 960, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A STATUE?

It has been so ever since 68 million gallons of oil from one of the company's giant oil tankers, the Amoco Cadiz, fouled the beaches of this country in 1978. **********Disappointment recently swelled into anger when a Federal Court judge in the United States, Frank McGarr, awarded what are widely regarded as meager damages to 90 Breton communities and small businesses. They and the 400,000 Bretons they represent had sued Amoco for the worst oil spill to reach land anywhere. The judgment, ordering Amoco to pay $85 million in damages, is the largest ever assessed in an environmental case. But in Brittany's view, it is far from fair. A Message From Mitterrand **********To many in France, the episode has taken on the essense of a morality tale: little villagers pitted against the epitome of insensitive capitalism. **********On Saturday, President Francois Mitterrand saluted ''the solidarity and the tenacity the communities of Brittany have showed'' in a telegram read aloud to some 300 representatives of all the parties suing Amoco, gathered at St.-Brieuc some 70 miles west of here. **********They stood at attention to listen. At the end, they unanimouly adopted a decision to ''go on with the combat against Amoco.'' They said they would appeal the judgment. **********Le Juge McGarr, as everyone here calls him, had been something of a hero in Brittany, ever since what Bretons say was his ''courageous'' 1984 judgment, placing the responsibility for polluting Brittany's beaches squarely on Amoco. But this admiration ended Jan. 11 when the judge awarded the Breton communities of fishermen, innkeepers, small industrialists and others what they regard as the paltry sum of $17 million. Much of the rest of the money is going to the French Government, whose soldiers and equipment were engaged for months in the huge cleanup job. Judge's Comments Hurt **********Bretons say the money does not even pay the legal costs, which have reached 95 million francs, or about $18 million, and are far from over. **********But what really hurt people, said Mayor Alphonse Arzel of Ploudalmezeau, was the judge's comment that the Bretons' claims were ''greatly exaggerated.'' **********''The judge has slapped us on the face,'' the Mayor said, adding with a triumphant gesture that ''we are not cooked yet.'' **********The Bretons were so sure of the judge that they had planned to erect a statue for him at Portsall. ''We will not put up a statue for him anymore,'' Mayor Arzel said. ''They had such high hopes in him because he was so kind to them whenever they took the bench as witnesses,'' said T. Barry Kingham, the Bretons' chief American lawyer, who came to the St. Brieuc meeting to comfort his clients. ''He was patient and understanding.'' 'Evil Characters' **********Inevitably the judgment is being translated into a wider commentary about American justice. **********''The general impression in my village is that it's always the big guys who win,'' said Yves Bertrand, the 85-year-old Mayor of the tiny community of Landunvez. ''To my constituents, Amoco and their lawyer Cicero have become evil characters of mythical dimensions,'' the exquisitely elegant Mr. Bertrand said over lunch, referring to Frank Cicero. **********To understand the dimension of the Amoco Cadiz catastrophe, it is enough to ask people where they were when it happened. They all remember as if it were yesterday. It was 10:45 on the night of March 16, a Thursday, when the giant vessel, beached on the rocky coast, began to break up within sight of Portsall. The huge slick of oil leaked for days from the tanker, a mammoth structure the size of three football fields. **********The oil covered more than 100 miles of Brittany's dazzlingly white beaches with layers of viscous crude piled a foot-high in places. The Toll Is Counted **********It killed 30,000 sea gulls, wiped out prized oyster beds and seaweed plantations and 230,000 tons of crabs, lobsters, sole and other fish, and left the ecological balance of the sea upset to this day. It also deprived France's second most popular summer resort of two tourist seasons. **********Tens of thousands of French soldiers, policemen, students, scientists and other volunteers worked for months to wash the rocks with hot water, scrape the beaches, treat the sea, remove the dead birds and fish and shave the sand dunes. Fishermen stopped fishing for four months. The year's crop of seaweed, a big industry here, was lost. Millions of oysters, another big industry, had to be destroyed and the oyster beds needed three years to make a comeback. **********Jean-Pierre Carval, a spokesman for the fishermen of Brest, said none of the 2,500 fishermen directly affected received any compensation. At a seaside bar, the fishermen were the angriest. **********''Instead of spending 90 million francs on this trial for 10 years we should have purchased a tanker, filled it with oil, and sunk it off the U.S. coast so they can understand,'' one fisherman told his comrades."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/10/world/un-envoy-pushes-afghan-cease-fire.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Weisman", "pub_date": "1988-07-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 751, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.N.

There were, in fact, no signs today that the proposal was receiving support from either Kabul or the rebels. **********But diplomats say that any idea from Mr. Cordovez must be taken seriously, because he is the only person now trying to settle the Afghan conflict peacefully while the 120,000 Soviet troops withdraw under agreements signed three months ago. **********Mr. Cordovez offered his ideas this morning in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, at the conclusion of 10 days of talks in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Council of Tribal Elders **********He said the temporary new government in Kabul should be led by ''a group of Afghans of recognized independence and impartiality'' who would pledge not to serve in any future government. Its main task, he said, would be to plan for a vast council of tribal elders to set up a permanent government acceptable to all sides in the Afghan conflict by next March. **********The envoy's proposals were a significant refinement of ideas he has advanced in recent months, without much success in terms of winning support from the Government of President Najibullah in Kabul or the seven leaders of the American-backed rebel alliance based in Pakistan. **********In a strong rebuff, the rebel leaders refused to meet with Mr. Cordovez this week, charging that he was trying to get them to let members of the Kabul Government remain in power.

Afghans say that a tribal council, known as a loya jirga, could be expected to turn to him for leadership. **********But fundamentalist opposition to the idea of a loya jirga has prevented the alliance from endorsing it. Fundamentalists say it would merely install corrupt feudal leaders who created Afghanistan's problems in the first place. **********Despite his personal preference, Mr. Gailani is known to feel that he cannot endorse it without splitting the rebel alliance and angering the fundamentalists.

Plan Adopted 10 Years Ago **********He said a United Nations technical team returned last week after spending three weeks in the territory, studying plans for administrative and logistic requirements and budgetary provisions for the transition team. **********Security Council Resolution 435, which included a detailed plan for Namibian independence, was adopted 10 years ago, but until now, South Africa has refused to carry it out. **********The President of the United Nations Council for Namibia, Peter D. Zuze of Zambia, accused South Africa of ''posturing and sending deliberate and confusing signals'' and expressed concern that it was raising unrelated issues in the talks ''to wreck the whole process.'' He said that should South Africa block progress by linking Namibian independence to a Cuban withdrawal from Angola, the Security Council should impose ''comprehensive mandatory sanctions'' against the Pretoria regime."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/09/world/talks-with-likud-planned-by-labor.html": {"writer_name": "Joel Brinkley", "pub_date": "1988-12-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 949, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TALKS WITH LIKUD PLANNED BY LABOR", "print_headline": "TALKS WITH LIKUD PLANNED BY LABOR", "body_text": " **********By a wide margin, the Labor Party's Central Committee voted tonight to resume coalition negotiations with the Likud party. The move came a week after the Labor party bureau, a smaller executive committee, narrowly voted to cut off the negotiations. **********Party leaders said they would begin talks with Likud almost immediately. **********Labor officials had expected the vote to be far closer than it was. Many in the party feel strongly that joining a Likud-led government would be a terrible mistake, and the debate today was bitter at times. **********But impassioned speeches by Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin, two of Labor's leaders, in favor of the coalition negotiations apparently changed several minds. Still, party members stressed that they were not voting to join Likud's government but only to negotiate. The vote was 630 to 390. Embarrassed and Amazed **********Labor's vote today is only the latest in a stunning series of reversals and changed opinions among several of the political parties that have left many Israelis embarrassed and amazed. **********Mr. Peres, the Foreign Minister, told the committee members, ''I won't fold up the flag of peace, and I won't put it in a storehouse either.'' In a coalition government, he would either retain his present position or become Finance Minister. **********Mr. Rabin, the Defense Minister, who would probably keep his post in a coalition government, said he was unwilling to enter the opposition as many in the party had wanted. **********He said: ''I don't have a spare state. Do you have one? So what is the alternative? To remain pure, to say 'We're beat - come let's be the opposition?' No.'' Labor leaders insist that they will not join a Likud government unless they are given equal standing and freedom to pursue peace initiatives. Still, if the coalition Goverment of the last four years is any example, peace proposals are likly to be caught in a deadlock. Electoral Changes Sought **********Many in the party also want to insist on a promise of electoral changes so that the last five weeks of tortuous negotiations since the inconclusive elections on Nov. 1 will not be repeated after future elections. There do seem to be signs of growing support for that in Likud. **********Most members of Likud, including Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, have been eager to recruit Labor into a Likud-led government, so they will not become beholden to the small religious and far-right parties that would be their coalition partners otherwise. **********With a narrow coalition government, any party with at least five seats in Parliament could bring the government down at any time by withdrawing its support if some new demand was not met. **********Still, as Labor voted today, Likud scrambled to complete coalition negotiatons with the small parties, partly to keep the upper hand in any negotiatons with Labor. The effort failed. **********Likud did sign an agreement with the far-right Tehiya party, which demanded and won a commitment from Likud that 10 new Jewish settlements would be built in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in each of the next four years. Likud also promised to add 5,000 housing units to existing settlements. **********Tehiya was also promised control of the Ministry of Science and Energy. And Geula Cohen, one of the most vocal far-right members of Parliament, was told she could be a Deputy Prime Minister in charge of relations with American and other foreign Jews. 'Standing in the Doorway' **********Uzi Baram, the Labor Party secretary and the leader of the losing opposition forces in today's vote, told the committee members that while Likud was completing negotiations with Tehiya, ''we're standing in the doorway to see if anything is left for us.'' **********But when some of the other small parties presented wholly new and unanticipated demands to Likud, the talks failed. **********For example, Gen. Rahamim Zeevi, head of the Moledet Party, which advocates expelling Palestinian residents of the West Bank, walked into a meeting today with a list of demands. **********Among them, he insisted on becoming Minister of Police while also controlling the Shin Beth secret police and the information department of the income tax bureau. He demanded the right to appoint five new ambassadors and six consuls general. And he also insisted that the government set a budget of several million dollars for the religious school in Jersualem's Old City where his son is studying. Likud officials were astonished and said they were unlikely to meet his demands. **********The four religious parties, meanwhile, fought among themselves over control of several of the same ministries. 'Did I Degrade Myself?' **********Mr. Peres had negotiated with the religious parties earlier, bringing sharp criticism from some other party leaders. **********Referring to those people today, Mr. Peres said, ''All of you say, 'Why do you degrade yourself?' '' The reason he negotiated with the religious parties, he said, was ''so that we could raise the flag of peace.'' He added: ''Perhaps we'll get a majority of peace. So did I degrade myself?'' **********Still, even with today's victory, Mr. Peres faces difficult negotiations. Labor would not join a government that had agreed to a significant increase in new settlements. And yet Likud's agreement with Tehiya today promises that the settlement pledge will be kept, even if Labor joins the government."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/07/business/schwab-to-market-lotus-service.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-01-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 115, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Schwab to Market Lotus Service", "print_headline": "Schwab to Market Lotus Service", "body_text": " **********The Charles Schwab Corporation, the nation's largest discount stock brokerage, said that it would market a Lotus Development Corporation service that provides real-time stock quotes to investors. **********The agreement could help to expand vastly the market for the Lotus service, which uses radio broadcasts to send stock quotations to customers who have either personal computers or special hand-held terminals.

As the scent of hundreds of millions of dollars in fees and profits lures others to join the fray, everyone from prominent Republicans to the institutions that have been financing the mania is wondering whether enough is finally enough. **********Referring to the RJR Nabisco fight, Joseph L. Rice, president of Clayton & Dubilier Inc., a New York buyout firm, said, ''I think it's clearly out of hand.'' **********People on Wall Street saw the concerns expressed last week by Bob Dole, the Senate minority leader from Kansas, as particularly significant. After all, it was the Republicans' laissez-faire attitude of the last eight years that made the takeover boom possible. At a seminar sponsored by the American Stock Exchange, Senator Dole raised the possibility that Congress might revise the tax code to curb acquisitions financed largely with borrowed funds. **********Worried about the huge amount of debt that these deals are piling onto corporations, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, last month suggested that the Senate consider such action and urged bankers to show caution in takeover lending. **********Whether they heed such advice remains to be seen. But clearly some bankers and institutional lenders who have been financing the wave of buyouts are getting skittish - about the higher stakes, the nastier tone of the battles and the possibility that their own companies could be the next to be swept away. **********At least one corporate pension executive who is a partner in Forstmann, Little & Company's buyout fund plans to question the wisdom of the buyout firm joining the bidding for RJR Nabisco at a partners' meeting scheduled for Tuesday. ''People have to go back and say, 'What if this were their own company?' '' said this executive, who requested anonymity. **********Last week, Representative J. J. Pickle, the Texas Democrat who heads the House Ways and Means oversight subcommittee, said he planned to hold hearings on the use of pension funds and other nonprofit assets in leveraged buyouts. **********Of course, it remains to be seen whether fear will prevail over greed. The people fighting for RJR Nabisco are ''all motivated by that basic human motivation: greed,'' said Harvey P. Eisen, President of Integrated Resources Asset Management, which invests $5 billion for clients. **********THE billions of dollars that can be made explain why those involved in the takeover fest are so reluctant to leave the party. Investment banks and law firms received $200 million after the Campeau Corporation bought Federated Department Stores Inc. last spring, after an 11-week battle. **********Estimates of the potential fees from a RJR Nabisco deal run as high as $500 million. The buyout fee could total $80 million to $100 million, the junk-bond underwriting and bank commitment fees could reach $250 million, and merger and advisory fees could add another $50 million to $100 million. Sales of any of the food and tobacco businesses would earn the investment banking firms another $25 million to $75 million. **********But the bankers are not the only ones who stand to reap extraordinary profits. The management group has proposed a compensation package for RJR Nabisco executives involved in the deal that could enrich some individuals by more than $100 million. **********''It offends my senses that these guys are making this much money,'' said Mr. Eisen. ''They're not inventing a cure for cancer.'' F. Ross Johnson, RJR Nabisco's chief executive, said last week that the group was studying ways to share any potential profits with a larger group of managers. **********The RJR Nabisco battle so far pits Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, the pioneer whose deals unleashed the flood of leveraged buyouts, against a group led by Mr. Johnson and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., the investment bank. Forstmann, Little is considering a bid with Proctor & Gamble, Castle & Cooke and Ralston Purina. **********In a leveraged buyout, a group of investors, including management, uses borrowed money and some of its own to buy the company's stock from its public shareholders. In the past, these companies have profited by drastically cutting costs and from the later resale of the company or its divisions. Those in favor of these transactions argue that managers with a financial stake in the company are more productive and efficient. **********But critics say the heavy use of debt is putting a strain on the financial system, which would be tested in a period of economic weakness. They also point to the pounding suffered by bondholders when a company takes on additional debt. **********Typically the ratings of these bonds are lowered to such a level that many investors are prohibited from owning them. After the announcement that RJR Nabisco's management was considering a leveraged buyout, for instance, the company's bonds lost an estimated $800 million in value. **********Asked about the effect of leveraged buyouts on bondholders, George R. Roberts, one of the founding partners of Kohlberg, Kravis, said, ''they should have had covenants'' to protect them from leveraged deals like the one he is proposing. ''The shareholders are happy,'' he added. **********In an interview last week, Mr. Roberts and his partner and cousin, Henry R. Kravis, were visibly defensive about the criticism the current battle has generated. They wanted to dispel the notion that they were challenging the management-Shearson group simply to protect their ''franchise'' from investment bankers. ''We don't go off and do things for ego purposes,'' said Mr. Kravis. ''We do it because it makes economic sense.'' **********BUT when pressed to discuss the impact of their strategy on the banking system, the economy, the bond market and employees, they ended the interview. ''We've got to go,'' said Mr. Roberts, slapping his hands on the boardroom table in the firm's elegantly furnished office in midtown Manhattan. ''This is it,'' added Mr. Kravis. **********Apologizing for the ''abrupt and frosty'' end to the interview, their public relations official described the two, each of whom by some estimates is worth more than $300 million, as ''stressed out.'' **********Originally, Kohlberg, Kravis and a handful of other buyout firms had this lucrative business to themselves. But the wealth they amassed attracted competitors. Until recently, Wall Street firms acted strictly as advisers and underwriters in leveraged buyouts, sending deals to the buyout firms who rewarded them with banking business. They did not invest as principals. **********But in the past few years, investment banks like Shearson, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley began raising pools of capital to invest. By last summer there was an estimated $25 billion in equity capital, which could finance deals totaling $250 billion. **********A GREAT deal of the capital behind the leveraged buyout funds comes from corporate and state pension funds. Attracted by annual returns of 40 to 70 percent, these institutional investors committed billions of dollars to buyout funds. **********But the mad rush to invest in them has given rise to a Byzantine tangle of conflicting relationships. The pension fund of RJR Nabisco, for instance, is a limited partner in the Forstmann, Little buyout fund that is considering a bid for RJR Nabisco. And while the Ralston Purina Company is one of Forstmann's partners, the Ralston Purina pension fund is a partner in the Kohlberg, Kravis fund. **********Unless Congress intervenes or the buyout funds succumb to backers' pressure to pull back, the wave of buyouts will almost certainly continue. While institutional investors may try to pressure the buyout funds to slow the pace, these institutions are legally committed to provide the capital they previously pledged. Thus, like some creature devouring itself, corporate executives may - under pressure from the takeover pools they created with their own pension funds - be forced to auction off their own companies to the highest bidder. **********This is the fear of executives like Rand V. Araskog, chairman of the ITT Corporation. While he says he is ''ethically opposed'' to leveraged buyouts, his company's lawyers determined that ITT's pension fund could not withdraw from the Kohlberg, Kravis fund. ''It's come back to roost,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/09/world/eiffel-tower-workers-on-strike.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-10-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 68, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Eiffel Tower Workers on Strike", "print_headline": "Eiffel Tower Workers on Strike", "body_text": " **********The 70 employees at the Eiffel Tower went on strike today for higher pay, preventing tourists from entering.

Attorneys involved in the lawsuit are expected to submit briefs by next month. Concerns Over Ruling **********Should the board decide that to be the case, and Texas Air's management and some executives at Eastern and Continental are concerned that that is possible, it would favor Eastern's three main unions - the pilots, machinists and flight attendants -which initiated the proceeding. It would mean that they would have a good chance of unionizing Continental, where Mr. Lorenzo was able to break two major unions when he reorganized it under the protection of the Federal bankruptcy laws. **********The prospect sends shudders through Texas Air's management. **********Martin R. Shugrue, the president of Continental, testified this week at the mediation board's hearings that forcing the carrier to integrate its work force with that of Eastern would be an ''unmitigated disaster'' in terms of human relations. Problems From Seniority **********Mr. Shugrue, who dealt with the integration of the work force of National Airlines after it was acquired by Pan American World Airways Inc. while he was a top executive at Pan Am, recalled that turmoil and stress had occurred for years from having to follow seniority. **********Particularly vulnerable to such stresses would be Continental, which is now winning back travelers after two years of turmoil integrating the work forces of People Express, Frontier and New York Air. **********Some Texas Air executives believe that having to integrate with Eastern would cause even more difficulty. **********''The structure is too fragile,'' an executive from one of Texas Air's carriers said. Main Weapon in Battle **********To Eastern's unions, however, the hearing has become one of the main weapons in their resistance to Mr. Lorenzo's tough stance in demanding major concessions in wages and benefits and in spinning off Eastern's assets to keep it afloat as his managers battle to turn it around. **********The unions' action puts pressure on Mr. Lorenzo to sell Eastern in a leveraged buyout that they are pursuing with outside investors. **********If the unions win, the mediation board could declare Eastern's unions to be the collective bargaining agents for Continental employees, without holding elections. **********Eastern's unions have asked the board to do just that, causing concern and outrage among many Continental workers that their fate would be decided without their having a say. Petitions containing thousands of signatures from some of the 30,000 Continental employees have been submitted, asking the board to call for elections if it decides that the carriers should be treated as a single bargaining unit. **********Catherine Schultz, a leader in a group of employees called Continental by Choice, said many workers were worried that if Eastern and Continental were declared one bargaining unit, Texas Air would merge the operations and many jobs would be eliminated. 'We Have Our Problems' **********If Texas Air did that, Continental employees would generally be the first to be furloughed, since most of them have held their jobs for a shorter time than most Eastern workers. **********''We just want to be left alone,'' she said of the Continental workers, who, except for the flight attendants, are no longer represented by a union. ''We have our problems; we want to deal with them without any mergers.'' **********Attorneys for the unions have attempted to show that distinctions between the two carriers have blurred under Texas Air's ownership. **********Since Eastern was acquired by Texas Air in 1986, its reservations system has become a subsidiary of the holding company, and it handles the reservations for both carriers. **********Texas Air buys the fuel for the carriers and charges them 1 cent a gallon for the service. The sales forces of the airlines have been combined, although last week Continental said it would again create a separate sales force. **********Also until last week, Mr. Lorenzo held major positions at both carriers. But he resigned as Continental's chairman, an effort seen as trying to remove the issue of interlocking management from the unions' lawsuit. **********The unions' attorneys have also found internal documents from the carriers indicating that the managements of Eastern and Continental may have held discussions to coordinate routes, pricing and long-term strategy. 'Who Flies Where?' **********They introduced a handwritten memo from Philip J. Bakes, Eastern's president, to several Continental vice presidents in October 1986 suggesting that they meet to discuss ''who flies where? - how we should price seats?'' **********The attorneys for Continental, Eastern and Texas Air have sought to show that the unions have a hidden agenda in the case. **********They have been able to draw out in testimony from such union officials as Jack Bavis, the chairman of the Master Executive Council of the pilots' union at Eastern, that the union had a three-pronged attack to counter Mr. Lorenzo, which included forcing him to merge the carriers. **********Joseph L. Manson, the attorney for Continental, contends that the unions so far have not demonstrated that the carrier's employees have any interest in being represented by Eastern's unions. **********He argued that a fundamental purpose of the Railway Labor Act, which governs collective bargaining in the airline industry, was to enable employees to decide for themselves whether they wished to be represented by unions. **********But most participants in the case believe that if the mediation board decides in favor of the unions, it will call for elections, in which employees from the carriers will vote on whether they want Eastern's unions to represent them."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/16/business/finance-new-issues-boat-loans-to-back-issue.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-09-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 242, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Boat Loans To Back Issue", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; Boat Loans To Back Issue", "body_text": " **********The different types of asset-backed securities brought to market since their inception in 1985 expanded yesterday.

At Odds With Western View **********The Indian officials who characterized Mr. Najibullah's attitudes offered a portrait substantially at odds with the impression of most Western diplomats, who see the Afghan leader as engaging in the language of compromise without the substance. **********Pakistani and American officials have long said, for example, that publicly conciliatory remarks have been a feature of Mr. Najibullah's rule since early 1987, but that he had never offered any real power to any group outside his ruling People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan. The party seized power in a 1978 military coup backed by Moscow. **********Indian officials said the obvious prerequisite of a future government would be some role for the People's Democratic Party. **********But the seven major guerrilla groups based in Pakistan have repeatedly rejected any kind of power sharing with Mr. Najibullah or his party.

The same was true for the meat, poultry and fish category, with the April increase of 2.8 percent followed by a decline of 1.6 percent last month. **********Mr. Ehrenhalt said the declines reflected increased supplies, but he added a note of caution.

Nevertheless, he was said to feel that the discussions were productive enough to justify continuing American involvement. 'It's Worth the Effort' **********As a result of a briefing Mr. Shultz gave Mr. Reagan this morning, ''The President feels it's worth the effort,'' said Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman. Mr. Shultz was ''realistic,'' Mr. Fitzwater reported, but there seemed ''some reason for optimism, though you don't want to go overboard.'' **********''There has been enough receptivity to continue the discussion,'' he added. **********The approach reflects Mr. Shultz's penchant for persistent, plodding efforts to chip away at intractable problems, avoiding overt pressure but allowing the diplomatic situation itself to constitute the leverage. **********The method, derived from Mr. Shultz's experience as a labor negotiator, has been used successfully in recent years to move the United States and the Soviet Union toward nuclear arms control agreements. Little Common Ground Apparent **********But some officials in the Middle East question whether it can work there. In a labor negotiation, and even in arms control, they observe, both sides want a deal because both can see the clear benefits of an accord. In the Arab-Israeli conflict, and particularly in the confrontation between Israelis and Palestinians, each side simply wants the other to disappear.

Other officials explained that the purpose would be to confront the parties with a formal, public document and some deadline, forcing them to make a decision. To Provoke a Debate **********One objective, Mr. Shultz said, is to provoke each side to debate the issues within itself in the hope that the uncompromising positions will be modified. **********''In a way, the more important negotiations go on within each constituency,'' he explained. ''As you operate on the tip of the iceberg, which is what I do, what you are doing is you are saying to people, 'You better go back and try to condition your constituency along certain lines or try something out on them and so on.'

They include talks on an interim phase of Palestinian self-administration to be guided by a group elected by the territories' residents. Those talks would begin in early April. **********Then, negotiations on the final status of the territories would begin in December, and the interim phase would not be carried out until these talks started. They would be based on the concept of an exchange of territory for peace. An International Conference **********The entire process would be started with some form of international conference to meet King Hussein's need for a broad umbrella to legitimize his entering direct talks with Israel. **********Much of Mr. Shultz's time in Israel, where he returned each night during his trip, was spent shuttling between Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who opposes most elements of Mr. Shultz's plan, and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, who accepts the concept."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/22/world/54-feared-dead-on-2-oil-tankers-in-iraqi-attack-on-iran-terminal.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Cowell", "pub_date": "1988-03-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 857, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "54 Feared Dead on 2 Oil Tankers In Iraqi Attack on Iran Terminal", "print_headline": "54 Feared Dead on 2 Oil Tankers In Iraqi Attack on Iran Terminal", "body_text": " **********More than 50 crewmen from two Iranian supertankers were missing and presumed dead today after an Iraqi air strike Saturday on Iran's Kharg Island oil terminal, shipping officials said. **********If that number is the final total, the toll would be the worst from a single shipping raid in the Persian Gulf since serious attacks on the waterway's traffic began in 1984 as an offshoot of the land war between Iran and Iraq, now in its seventh year. **********News of the missing men came from gulf shipping officials and Norwegians involved in the management of one of the stricken supertankers.

In tests approved by the F.D.A., physicians said that after 12 months the drug, with minoxidil as its key ingredient, produced modest to dense hair growth for 39 percent of the men whose hair had been thinning. **********How many men will spend the money to grow hair is also uncertain. It will take an estimated $700 a year for the drug, plus physician bills. For some men and those they hope to dazzle, being bald can be sexy. However, Ronald Nordmann at Paine Webber said, there are 55 million prospective users in the United States. ''For each million people who use topical minoxidil for one year, Upjohn earnings per share will rise 36 percent,'' he said. **********The company earned $1.63 a share in 1987. Earnings in the first half of 1988 totaled $182 million, which was up 14.9 percent from the level of a year earlier. **********Lawrence E. Hoff, president and chief operating officer of Upjohn, insisted in a telephone interview that Rogaine was far from the only star money maker for Upjohn, which is a leading research-oriented drug producer. This year the company will spend about $390 million, or 12 percent of expected sales of $2.8 billion, on research and development. **********Upjohn has lost patent protection and sales to generic versions of such formerly important drugs as Motrin for arthritis and Cleocin Phosphate, an antibiotic. It still has market leaders like Xanax, a tranquilizer, as well as Halcion for insomnia and Micronase for diabetes. **********''To many people, the only thing to save the Upjohn Company was Rogaine,'' Mr. Hoff said. ''That isn't true.'' **********For example, the company hopes for approval late this year for Ansaid, an anti-inflammatory drug for arthritis. Analysts say it has also shown promise as a treatment for gum disease. **********And breaking with its longtime habit of going it alone, Upjohn signed agreements in May with British and Japanese companies to market new drugs in the United States, to be sold by its sales force of 1,400 men and women who call on physicians. **********The new products include an anti-clotting drug for heart attack patients, developed by the British company Beecham P.L.C.. This product will compete against a widely publicized drug made by Genentech Inc. **********Also there is a joint venture to develop and market products of Chugai, a Japanese company. **********Upjohn is already far along on extending the new drug's attractions. Combining Rogaine with Retin-A, a skin-care drug, is said to increase its hair-growing effectiveness. Rogaine is also being tested to help women combat hair loss. **********''The decisive element could well be how much women use Rogaine,'' Mr. Lippman said. ''Men are not big cosmetic users.'' **********Some dermatologists, such as Alan R. Kling in New York, are already prescribing the combination of minoxidil and Retin-A. This is permissible because both drugs had been approved as safe for other medical purposes. **********Retin-A was discovered and patented by Albert M. Kligman, a Philadelphia dermatologist. He has licensed it to Upjohn for possible use with Rogaine and to Johnson & Johnson, which is marketing it as an acne medicine that is said to retard wrinkles."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/29/world/violence-reported-in-lithuania.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-09-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 336, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Violence Reported in Lithuania", "print_headline": "Violence Reported in Lithuania", "body_text": " **********Riot policemen with truncheons broke up a demonstration today by tens of thousands of Lithuanians protesting Soviet administration of the Baltic republic, a witness said. **********Valdas Analauskas, a correspondent in Lithuania for the unofficial journal Express Chronicle, said some demonstrators fought back by throwing stones during the four-hour protest. **********The police arrested 30 to 40 demonstrators, some of whom were bloodied by beatings, Mr. Analauskas said by telephone. **********The officers surrounded Gediminas Square in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, as the protest was to begin.

Anti-terrorism experts say plastic explosives can be easily molded inside luggage and are very difficult to detect.  Wreckage Scattered 80 Miles **********The crash of Pan American World Airways Flight 103 on Dec. 21, which scattered wreckage in a wide arc up to 80 miles from the area of the main impact in the country town of Lockerbie, killed all 259 people on the Boeing 747 and apparently 11 more on the ground. **********Police officials in Scotland said today that Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist squad and the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation would take part in a criminal investigation into the crash. **********''The explosive's residues recovered from the debris have been positively identified and are consistent with the use of a high-performance plastic explosive,'' the Air Accidents Investigation Branch of the British Department of Transport, which is leading the investigation, said in a 200-word statement.  'Preliminary Conclusion' **********It said other evidence, ''in particular that from the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder and from the wreckage trail on the ground, has led to the preliminary conclusion that the explosion took place soon after the aircraft had crossed the Scottish border whilst it was in the cruise at 31,000 feet, and that this led directly to its destruction.''

[ Page A10. ]  Examination in Laboratory Immediately after the disaster, the British authorities refused to rule out the possibility that structural failure of the aircraft, rather than an explosion, had caused it to disintegrate. But earlier this week, after taking the remains of a suitcase and some wreckage to a laboratory to determine if they showed traces of an explosion, the investigators indicated they might have evidence that a bomb caused the crash. **********British newspaper reports said experts had found signs of heat damage in plastic lining from one of the airliner's cargo bays, which indicated that luggage had exploded in the hold. The reports said bodies of some victims contained pieces of metal, suggesting that a bomb caused the crash. **********Speculation about who would want to plant a bomb aboard the plane has included Palestinian terrorists loyal to Abu Nidal, who oppose the Palestine Liberation Organization's opening of a dialogue with the United States, and pro-Iranian groups seeking to avenge the accidental American downing of an Iranian airliner over the Persian Gulf in July. But American officials have discounted a phone tip to the United States Embassy in Finland on Dec. 5 that a bomb attack would be carried out a Pan Am airliner bound from Frankfurt, West Germany, to the United States. **********Some passengers and luggage on Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt, with the first leg of the flight on a smaller 727 aircraft. About half the passengers of the 727 ended their trip at Heathrow Airport outside London while the others transferred to the larger plane. **********After the announcement today that the plane had been destroyed by an explosive, David Wilshire, a Conservative Member of Parliament and an aviation expert, said the question to be asked now was ''how and where did a bomb get on board.'' Luggage Security Explained **********According to the Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, the luggage of the transit passengers went through the security system at Heathrow, but the luggage of the Frankfurt passengers did not, although it was transferred under the supervision of Pan Am guards. **********Paul Wilkinson, a researcher on terrorism at Aberdeen University in Soctland, was quoted by The Associated Press as saying the bomb was most probably planted in the forward hold, blowing the nose section from the fuselage. **********David Learmount, of the respected aviation journal Flight International, told Independent Television News: ''It may have been a suitcase, but it may on the other hand have been planted by an airport employee who was under the pay of terrorists. It may have been planted by a caterer, by an airplane serving person.'' **********Michael Yardley, a British expert on terrorism, speculated that the bomb contained Semtex, a Czechoslovak-made high-performance explosive that the British authorities say has come into Libyan hands. Unidentified Noise on Tape **********After the first playback last week of the cockpit and flight data recordings from the Pan Am plane, investigators said that the cockpit voice recorder showed normal flight deck conversations until it cut off and that an unidentified noise came at the end of the tape. **********''Much investigative work remains to be done to establish the nature of the explosive device,'' the investigators said in today's statement, ''what it was contained in, its location in the aircraft and the sequence of events immediately following its detonation.'' **********The plane would have gone down in the sea if prevailing winds had not led the pilot to select a northerly route over Scotland, according to air traffic control officials. **********In the area around Lockerbie today, heavy overnight rain and low clouds hampered the search for more wreckage and bodies, as helicopters took to the air and 600 people fanned out over the town and countryside. Searchers have so far recovered 241 bodies from the wreckage, although most of them have not yet been identified. Bodies of 5 Americans Returned **********The bodies of five Americans, including three adults and two children, were flown home today after they were handed over to relatives. The five were identified as Kenneth Garczynski of North Brunswick, N.J.; Om Dixit of Fairborn, Ohio; his wife, Shenti, and their grandchildren, Suruchi Rattan, 3 years old, and Anmol Rattan, 2, of Warren, Mich. **********John Bowyer, the police chief in charge of the search operation, said that locating debris could take years and that because of the dense forest covering part of the area, some items from the crash might never be found. More than 400 bags, containing thousands of airplane fragments, clothing, books, letters, credit cards and other personal effects, have reportedly been collected and labeled for examination by investigators. **********''Every part of the forest has either been checked by people on foot or horseback or by helicopter,'' Mr. Bowyer said, ''but some debris visible from the air is trapped in the thick conifer canopy and is impossible to get at. It may never be reached until the trees are felled.

Oppenheimer. His vehicle for the bid is a Luxembourg-based holding company, the Minerals and Resources Corporation, known as Minorco. **********Gold Fields' chairman, Rudolph I. J. Agnew, is fighting Mr. Oppenheimer on at least three continents in a struggle that Oppenheimer forces say is motivated by the Gold Fields management's ''overriding interest in staying in office.'' **********Agnew forces have raised the specter of South African monopoly control, through a multinational web of Oppenheimer interests, over not only gold production but also strategic minerals like titanium, zirconium and monazite that are used in everything from nuclear submarines to radar screens. **********Although it is an international contest, a number of well-known Americans have lately become involved. **********A financial adviser to the Oppenheimer group is Felix G. Rohatyn, a senior partner of Lazard Freres & Company and chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation of New York. **********One of the Oppenheimer lawyers is Stuart E. Eizenstat, White House domestic policy adviser in the Carter Administration. **********Another senior Carter Administration official, Stansfield Turner, who was director of the Central Intelligence Agency, is among experts called on by Gold Fields to reinforce one of its central arguments - that the takeover would be dangerous for American security. The Perceived Threat **********In an interview arranged by Gold Fields, Mr. Turner, who had served on a Gold Fields advisory board for the company's United States operations between 1981 and 1984, said, ''We don't know where South Africa is headed, nor what the next U.S. moves will be, but we will be better off if South Africans do not have more ability to influence our economy by throttling supplies of gold, platinum or what have you.'' **********Gold Fields' lawyers have formally petitioned President Reagan to block an acquisition on grounds that it would endanger security by denying the United States access to strategic metals. **********In a response to the White House, Mr. Eizenstat countered that such contentions are based on ''flawed assumptions,'' including understatement of the availability of such metals and the fact that most such metals are not even mined in the United States. **********He said the suggestion that Minorco would cut off access to strategic metals or otherwise act in ways ''inimical'' to the United States is ''particularly offensive.'' The Role of Newmont Mining **********Gold Fields' American flagship is the Newmont Mining Corporation, a diversified natural resources company of which Gold Fields owns 49 percent. It is traded on the New York Stock Exchange and engages in a wide variety of mining, processing and marketing activities in the United States and elsewhere. Through a subsidiary it is the largest gold producer in the United States. **********Newmont successfully fought off a raid last year by the financier T. Boone Pickens. Gold Fields helped Newmont in its defense, and after Newmont issued a special $2.2 billion dividend, Gold Fields lifted its ownership to 49 percent, from 26 percent, while agreeing that it would not seek control of Newmont or get more than 4 seats on the 10-seat board. **********Newmont is now trying to help rescue Gold Fields. In a letter Friday to its 14,000 shareholders it warned of the ''negative impact on Newmont's businesses and shareholders'' if the Gold Fields 49 percent interest were to shift to Oppenheimer control. Newmont's Concern **********Newmont's vice chairman, Richard B. Leather, explained in an interview that a shift in the ownership would lead to a perception that Newmont was no longer a Delaware company but one ''manipulated out of South Africa.'' **********''It would be damaging to the interests of shareholders, the going forward of business, our relations with public authorities and private persons if this perception of South African control were draped about us,'' he said. **********Gold Fields' lawyers have moved on another front in the United States by filing an antitrust suit in Federal District Court in New York, charging that the takeover would restrain trade in this country. **********The argument is that the Gold Fields and Oppenheimer groups together control one-third of the non-Communist world's gold production. With such a degree of control, a combined enterprise would have an ''illegal strategic advantage'' in the gold market, the suit charges, depriving American gold-producing affiliates of ''their right and ability to be independent and effective competitors.'' **********Under the new trade law President Reagan must make a decision on the national security petition by Nov. 4. A hearing on the antitrust case is scheduled for next Friday. A response is being prepared by the New York law firm Shearman & Sterling. Objectors in Britain, Australia **********There is action as well on other continents. The British Monopolies and Mergers Commission has been asked to intervene on antitrust grounds. **********Gold Fields also has extensive holdings in Australia. Prime Minister Bob Hawke has written to both Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain and Secretary of State George P. Shultz of the United States, urging them to block the deal. Mr. Hawke's concern is over the impact on the 48-percent-owned Australian affiliate, Renison Goldfields Consolidated Ltd. Its regional operations would be put at risk, he said, by the ''strong anti-apartheid stand'' of countries like Papua New Guinea. **********Renison has a 33 percent stake in a New Guinea deposit described as one of the richest gold fields outside South Africa. **********Mr. Hawke's letter was written after Prime Minister Rabbie Namalui of Papua New Guinea served notice that he would force Renison to sell off its interest if the takeover went forward. **********''We cannot allow this apartheid regime to benefit from our rich resources,'' Mr. Namalui said Oct. 10, in a statement provided by Gold Fields in London. Defense of Campaign **********The Oppenheimer forces accuse Gold Fields of orchestrating the reaction, but a senior Gold Fields official who declined to be identified sharply disagreed. **********''These governments are reacting on the merits,'' the official said. ''There is no one with a baton over which, for example, the Prime Minister of Australia will play second fiddle.'' **********In making the formal offer for the Gold Fields shares on Oct. 4, Sir Michael Edwardes, Minorco's chief executive and a Briton who was knighted for his role in resuscitating the British Leyland Motor Company, called the acquisition ''the next major step in Minorco's evolution from an investment manager focused on asset growth to an operating group.'' **********But many analysts also see the moves as part of efforts by Mr. Oppenheimer, who is regarded in South Africa as a political liberal, to diversify his family's interests internationally. A Promise to Sell Assets **********To ease the monopoly concerns, Minorco has said it intends to sell the Gold Fields stake in Newmont. In addition, Minorco has said it would sell all of Gold Fields' South African investments, including its 38 percent stake in Gold Fields of South Africa. **********But because the Oppenheimer group is presently the second-largest shareholder in Gold Fields of South Africa, such a sale by Minorco could leave the Oppenheimers in effective control - a matter now being investigated by South Africa's competition board. **********According to Minorco, there had been friendly merger discussions between Minorco and Gold Fields two years ago that broke down for reasons that are unclear. At that time, Gold Fields raised no apartheid or other concerns. **********An article in the British newspaper Financial Times on Oct. 7 commented, ''Despite all the anti-South African rhetoric, this bid is almost certainly going to be decided on price alone.''  GOLD FIELDS' RATIONALE **********In a letter to its shareholders Saturday, Consolidated Gold Fields said Minorco's $4.9 billion hostile takeover bid for the company would seriously devalue Gold Fields' assets and that it significantly undervalues the company. **********In what Gold Fields called its first formal defense document, Mr. Agnew, Gold Fields' chairman, also said the Minorco offer would require shareholders to accept shares of dubious quality and value. He promised that a new valuation of the company would be sent to shareholders shortly."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/26/business/touche-ross-purchase.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-03-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 102, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Touche Ross Purchase", "print_headline": "Touche Ross Purchase", "body_text": " **********Touche Ross & Company, the Big Eight accounting firm, said Thursday that it was acquiring Meahl, McNamara & Company, a Boston-based accounting firm.

''Sometimes if you say things too many times in public, it can be counterproductive,'' he remarked. **********But the official added that private appeals to Israel through diplomatic channels had continued in an effort to head off the planned deportation of some Palestinians from the Israeli-occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip. American officials have reportedly cited both legal and humane concerns. **********Officials said the Administration had called the Israelis' attention to Article 49 of the 1949 Geneva Convention, which states, ''Individual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the Occupying Power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive.'' 'People With Families' **********In addition, an official declared: ''These are people with families in the West Bank and Gaza.

The deportation orders came after two weeks of clashes last month between Palestinians, many of whom threw stones and gasoline bombs, and Israeli soldiers, who fired into crowds, killing at least 23 Arabs. **********During the riots, the White House and the State Department appealed to Israel, both privately and publicly, to use non-deadly means of riot control like rubber bullets, water cannons and tear gas, rather than live ammunition. The White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, blamed ''both sides'' for the violence and denounced Israel's ''harsh security measures and excessive use of live ammunition.'' **********This brought a delegation of about two dozen leaders of American Jewish organizations to the State Department on Dec. 24 with a strong complaint about equating rioters with authorities trying to maintain order. **********Since then, the Administration's public tone has been decidedly muted. **********The State Department spokesman, Charles E. Redman, said today: ''Israeli leaders are well aware of our views."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/29/business/italys-tv-tycoon-silvio-berlusconi-a-media-empire-marches-east.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Solomon", "pub_date": "1988-05-29", "snippet": "LEAD: EARLIER this month, Soviet television viewers got their first look at an American commercial - for Pepsi-Cola - as part of a Soviet experiment with foreign TV advertising.", "word_count": 1776, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ITALY'S TV TYCOON: Silvio Berlusconi;\nA Media Empire Marches East", "print_headline": "ITALY'S TV TYCOON: Silvio Berlusconi;\nA Media Empire Marches East", "body_text": " **********LEAD: EARLIER this month, Soviet television viewers got their first look at an American commercial - for Pepsi-Cola - as part of a Soviet experiment with foreign TV advertising. **********EARLIER this month, Soviet television viewers got their first look at an American commercial - for Pepsi-Cola - as part of a Soviet experiment with foreign TV advertising. **********For European advertisers, the route to Russian viewers will start with Silvio Berlusconi, the brash Italian TV baron. On April 29, Mr. Berlusconi's ad agency, Publitalia 80 S.p.A., signed a three-year contract to provide commercials to Gosteleradio, the Soviet state broadcast company. **********There is some confusion about the contract. A Soviet TV spokesman, Pavel Korchagin, says Publitalia's exclusive rights apply only to the state-owned educational channel. Mr. Berlusconi's group insists it is the exclusive agency for European commercials on all Soviet channels. Mr. Berlusconi and the Soviet Union will have to work out their apparent differences, if the American company that brought Pepsi to Soviet TV - Global American Television of Colrain, Mass. - decides to sign up European advertisers like Olivetti as part of its deal with the Russians. **********Publitalia is part of Fininvest, a Milan-based holding company through which Mr. Berlusconi oversees a communications empire. As commercial TV develops in Europe, he has been well ahead of the competition - starting private networks in Italy, supplying programming and ads and buying shares in TV stations in France, West Germany and, soon, Spain. **********''Berlusconi is becoming the William Paley of Europe,'' said Steve Carlin, an independent New York TV producer and consultant. **********The base of Mr. Berlusconi's empire is Italy, where he is credited with transforming TV. His networks have as many viewers, and more ads, than the powerful state-owned networks run by Radio Televisione Italiana, known as R. A. I. His formula is a mixture of game and variety shows, sports, films and serials like ''Dallas'' - much of it imported from America. **********''Berlusconi is the first person in the non-English-speaking world to be a formidable international force in commercial broadcast,'' said Michael Dann, a former programming chief at NBC and ABC. **********Programming may be an even bigger business for Fininvest if rules proposed by the European Commission are enacted to reserve 60 percent of European community air time for programs made in Europe. **********With no antitrust laws to stop him, Mr. Berlusconi, 52 years old, owns Italy's three leading private TV networks, acts as program and ad supplier to what amounts to a fourth franchise network of small local stations, and broadcasts live sports to Italy through a Yugoslav station. His publishing interests include the country's most widely sold weekly magazine, TV Sorrise e Canzone, a sort of Italian TV Guide. He operates 25 percent of the nation's movie theaters. **********''In no industrialized country is it possible to have what he has in Italy - practically all private television, over half the national TV ad market, publications specializing in TV, a circuit of cinema halls and the investment of almost half the total money in film production,'' said Paolo Martini, author of a biography of Mr. Berlusconi. **********Fininvest also holds one of Italy's largest real-estate developments, a financial services and insurance business with 2,500 door-to-door salesmen, and Milan A. C. - the national championship soccer team. **********Estimates differ on the size of this privately owned empire, but in 1987, consolidated sales of the roughly 150 companies were equivalent to about $1.9 billion, with a pretax profit margin of about 11.5 percent. Growth runs about 20 percent a year. **********A charismatic salesman with a tendency to view his work as a mission, Mr. Berlusconi cultivates his clients night and day. ''I mix life and work,'' he said. ''I'm always with my guests or my managers. I don't stop Saturdays or Sundays.'' He holds meetings at his 18th-century mansion outside Milan and at his nine other homes - including those in New York, Paris, Brussels and Bermuda. **********In other respects, too, he remains a classic small entrepreneur in a business grown large. He becomes deeply involved in creative work at his TV stations, even offering casting suggestions. ''He loves to start things from zero,'' said a former manager. ''Someone else must organize things after him. He is less interested in financial problems and management.'' **********Mr. Berlusconi, the son of a Milan bank director, earned an undergraduate law degree at the University of Milan, where he became close to Bettino Craxi. Mr. Craxi, the Socialist Party chief and former Prime Minister who is a pivotal force in Italian politics, is godfather to one of his four children. **********In 1962, Mr. Berlusconi got into real estate, using, he says, $25,000 in savings and bank loans. He developed Milano 2, a luxury village for 10,000 residents just north of Milan, in the mid-1970's. Among the services he offered was closed-circuit cable TV. On the system's vacant channel, he gave out information - store hours, special events, the schedule of labor strikes. Advertising followed. **********In 1978, he entered the wild market for regional broadcast that was springing up alongside R. A. I. At the time, R. A. I. had a monopoly on national, live broadcasts, but rules allowing private TV were expected. ''I started my TV business with $2.5 million from my other businesses,'' Mr. Berlusconi said. **********''Berlusconi understood that there were medium-sized companies that had restructured in the late 1970's and had no access to TV since R. A. I. took only big-volume advertisers,'' said Marco Borsa, a former editor of Italia Oggi, a daily newspaper. **********MR. BERLUSCONI often went to the No. 3 company in a market and sold TV time for a percentage of any increased sales. This got market leaders to buy time, he says. He also accepted barter. **********To get programming, he went abroad, offering top dollar and sometimes taking the entire output of a studio. ''Silvio came to Hollywood like a conquering TV executive,'' said Michael Dann. ''He'd come before the selling season in May, rent a large house and throw big parties to find out what programming was available. He paid the highest prices; it gave him great power.'' **********Later, in 1984, when Mr. Berlusconi had built a virtual monopoly in private TV, he sharply cut his offers, Mr. Dann said. ''People were furious.'' At home in Italy, Mr. Berlusconi overcame the ban on private national broadcasts by using couriers to shuttle videotapes to his regional stations. Through simultaneous broadcast, he created the illusion of a countrywide network. But with no official approval for such networks, he was besieged by lawsuits and political pressure to divest at least one of his stations. **********Mr. Craxi's Socialists championed his cause - in part because they believed R. A. I. was too heavily controlled by the Communist and Christian Democrat parties. (A recent scandal revealed that some R. A. I. ad revenues were diverted to Christian Democrat coffers.) When judges tried to close Mr. Berlusconi's transmitters, the Craxi government reopened them by issuing what the press called ''Berlusconi decrees.'' **********In return for supporting the current Christian Democrat-led coalition, Mr. Craxi has won backing for a proposed law that officially permits private, live, national broadcasts. **********Such a law would enable Mr. Berlusconi to expand into live sports and news. But it would also require him to divest his small newspaper, Il Giornale. Observers say this ''antitrust'' clause is aimed primarily at Giovanni Agnelli, the chief of Fiat, who has extensive newspaper holdings and wants to go into television. Faced with the prospect of competing with Italy's most powerful industrialist, R. A. I. and Mr. Berlusconi recently declared a truce in their battle for programming and TV personalities. **********Given this political and financial intrigue, it is not surprising that there is speculation that the Berlusconi-Craxi relationship may have hidden financial links. Mr. Berlusconi denies this. ''When someone succeeds, envious people say he must have had political friendships,'' he said. ''I have always been independent.'' He has met his financing needs, he says, through bank loans and the common Italian practice of getting clients to pay him before suppliers' bill were due. He offered discounts to big advertisers paying a year in advance, he says, and paid out programming costs over a few years. **********Other speculation centers on why Mr. Berlusconi didn't raise equity on the booming Milan bourse in 1985 and 1986. His answer: ''I don't want any difficulty with partners.'' Others say his complex organization may simply have too much financial disorder to go public. **********FINALLY, there are questions about how Mr. Berlusconi was able to have sufficient funds abroad to buy foreign programming in the early 1980's, when his rivals appeared to be hampered by Italy's strict capital controls. ''In Italy, there is a bureaucracy that is apt to prohibit doing many things. If one wants to work, he has to overcome it.'' **********One foreign acquisition, in 1985, was of La Cinq, a French television station. But Mr. Berlusconi was forced to reduce his share in La Cinq to 25 percent when the Socialists lost the Prime Ministership in 1986 to conservative Jacques Chirac. **********His main European strategy now is to supply programming and advertising while he picks up pieces of TV networks. ''It is important to be present in the entire panorama,'' he said. ''It helps the other activities.'' **********Even if the Soviet experiment is short-lived, Mr. Berlusconi believes it will enhance his European presence. ''We think Russia is the market of the future for European companies,'' he said. ''There is little importation and export. It will grow.''

''We want to see how OPEC and non-OPEC nations can cooperate for that purpose.'' Failure of Vienna Effort **********Experts in the oil industry say a 20 percent price decline in the last few weeks has brought the average price of OPEC oil to between $13 and $14 a barrel. The price of West Texas Intermediate crude, the most actively traded American oil, has declined recently, but not as sharply. **********The experts said the pricing situation was fast approaching what one called a ''meltdown,'' with nothing short of a significant production cut by all world oil producers that could stop it. In 1986 OPEC oil fell as low as $8 a barrel. **********The price deterioration is intensifying barely three months after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, at its Vienna meeting in December, affirmed its commitment to a price of $18 a barrel and pledged to defend its share of the oil market. Supply Outstripping Demand **********The downward pressure on prices has been caused by a record increase in output from non-OPEC oil producers amid merely moderate demand for oil and widespread discounting by OPEC members. So far, consumers of refined products have seen little effect from the recent moves because it normally takes several months for changes in crude oil prices to work through to the retail marketplace. **********In the United States, the price of West Texas Intermediate crude has dropped from $18.87 a barrel on the futures market at the beginning of December to $15.45 a barrel. The futures price includes carrying costs, such as storage charges. **********West Texas Intermediate was trading at about $17 a barrel in early February. It rose 8 cents a barrel today amid a general feeling among traders that producers might yet succeed in agreeing on ways to stabilize prices. **********The steep price drop had been predicted by many oil analysts in December when OPEC failed to reduce its overall production below 17.5 million barrels a day. That level was considered to be more than demand. **********A harsh winter in the United States temporarily lifted the demand for oil during January and part of February, postponing the price drop. But milder winter weather in Europe and Japan and the end of bitterly cold weather in the United States are now eroding support for oil prices. **********''There is nothing to stop oil prices from falling now except rumors or some extraordinary military development in the Persian Gulf,'' said John H. Lichtblau, executive director of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York. ''Basically it is not that OPEC is cheating by producing above its quotas. It is just that the quotas are too high.'' **********Besides the modest demand for OPEC oil, analysts agree, the organization's biggest problem seems to be record increases in oil production by countries that are not members of OPEC. Most of these are new third-world producers, and their oil discoveries are either diminishing those nations' role as OPEC customers or are pumping new crude into the already glutted world market. Yemen's Increase Is Biggest **********Bryan Jacoboski, an oil analyst with Paine Webber Inc. who conducted a study on the subject, says the largest increase this year is coming from Yemen, which will produce an additional 170,000 barrels a day. Angola and Brazil will raise their combined output by 235,000 barrels a day this year. **********Altogether, Mr. Jacoboski's study concludes that 19 non-OPEC oil producers - including Syria, Norway, Argentina, Egypt, Australia, Canada and Colombia - are pumping an extra 800,000 barrels of oil a day this year. ''This will be the 13th consecutive increase of non-OPEC oil production, and that is a major part of OPEC's problem,'' he said. **********Non-OPEC nations continue to find oil production desirable, even at $14 a barrel, mainly because exploration and production costs have been substantially reduced and because of what Mr. Jacoboski calls the ''political imperative'' to find oil. Many third-world countries want to produce oil as a matter of national security and self-sufficiency - regardless of any profit. **********As for oil pricing, he said, ''We are on the verge of a meltdown.'' **********This relentless increase in non-OPEC output has aggravated the organization's effort over the past seven years to sacrifice production and income in order to support a reasonable level of oil prices. **********''How low do you want us to cut, and for how long?'' said OPEC's president, Rilwanu Lukman, the oil minister of Nigeria. His remarks in an interview last week appeared in Petroleum Intelligence Weekly. **********OPEC has slashed its output in half over the past seven years, but it has seen prices fall to half of what they were in 1981. **********The latest drop in oil prices has been encouraged by widespread price discounting among all producers. **********''The bulk, if not all, of OPEC oil is now sold in various formulas that are all basically market-related,'' said Nordine Ait-Laoussine, an oil consultant. ''Unless a cut in production is acted upon soon, prices will fall further.'' Mr. Ait-Laoussine, president of the Geneva-based Nalcosa, is a former OPEC official who played a major role in Algeria's oil industry. **********Some Saudi sources suggested that Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Hisham M. Nazer, might call for a limited production cut of 500,000 barrels a day and renew his appeal that all OPEC members strictly adhere to their formal production quotas. At the moment the United Arab Emirates and Ecuador are producing slightly above their quotas. But Iraq accounts for the largest runaway OPEC output. Iraq is pumping all the oil it can at rates exceeding 2.6 million barrels a day, oil industry sources estimate. **********Saudi Arabia is not eager to call another OPEC meeting because of the difficulty in finding a better solution to the problem of production quotas, according to Saudi sources.  OIL FUTURES UP A BIT **********By The Associated Press - Oil prices rose slightly yesterday in response to the calls for meetings among oil-producing nations. **********On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for April delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark American crude oil, settled at $15.45 per 42-gallon barrel, up 8 cents from Monday's close. **********Trading was quiet, with crude futures contracts moving in narrow ranges.

Inglis Palgrave's ''Dictionary of Political Economy,'' in the 1890's. **********Q. What was so good about it? **********A. Two characteristics: It contained quite extraordinary and comprehensive biographical lists of economists no one has ever heard of before or since. Much more important, the very best people of the day contributed to it, developing ideas of that day and criticizing work of their contemporaries. There was none of the artificial politeness which has crept into academic writing today. Fifty years after publication, you can still see some of the entries being cited in the literature. **********Q. If you could produce an encyclopedia like that, you thought, it would be worth doing? **********A. Exactly. I had talked myself into doing the project at that barbecue and in 24 hours I had submitted an estimate of costs - about $1 million. Macmillan accepted and the project was launched in 1982. **********Q. Did you realize what a job you had undertaken - four volumes, 4,000 pages, four million words? **********A. Looking back now at the scale of the whole project is really quite frightening. Even then, I knew I couldn't do it alone. I needed collaborators with interests ranging far beyond my own. First I called Murray Milgate, a former student of mine at Cambridge. He is a remarkable scholar, now teaching at Harvard, who knows the literature of economics extraordinarily well, particularly for someone so young. He gave scholarly weight to the project.  Then I contacted Peter Newman, a professor of political economy at Johns Hopkins University, who is very much in the mainstream of American mathematical economics. He is also a fine historian of ideas with interests in the history and literature of economics. He even owned a rare set of the original Palgrave. **********Q. How did you manage to induce 900 scholars to write for you? **********A. We wanted to include the young creative scholars in the discipline, as well as the mature leaders of the economics profession. We anticipated a real problem with the younger people who need to publish in order to advance their careers. They would be nervous about devoting energy to any project that would not be respected and help establish them in the profession. Therefore we decided to send them a signal by first enlisting 100 well-recognized economists from around the world. **********Q. What was their response? **********A. Rather remarkable. Very quickly we observed an 80 percent rule emerging. Actually, 81 of the top scholars said yes. Then almost like a precise law of nature, 80 pecent of the respondents quickly sent in manuscripts, of which 80 percent were accepted as received. **********Once we had commitments from the most respected economists around the world, ''The New Palgrave'' was established. Scholars like Milton Friedman knew the old Palgrave well, so with the support of such contributors, we began mass mailings to get contributions from the younger folk. They were now in good company. Eventually, we engaged the support of over 900 economists, historians, philosophers, mathematicians and statisticians, including 11 Nobel Prize winners. **********Q. As you stand back and look at the work, do patterns emerge from economists and their ideas? **********A. Perhaps most surprising was the solidarity of the profession. **********Q. Solidarity? In a profession so splintered and contentious? **********A. That was my surprise. Contributors were really enthusiastic about the whole enterprise. They felt they were writing for a work that represented the whole profession, spanning the entire globe, expressing diverse philosophies, ideologies, methodologies and national perspectives. One might think another writer grossly in error, but everyone took his task seriously. From all their diversity, they came together to provide an extraordinary, current state of economics. **********Q. Where is economics headed? **********A. That is as hard to tell now as when the original Palgrave's was published in the 1890's. At that time, great uncertainty prevailed in the economics profession. Ideas were evolving, techniques were changing, nobody could see quite what was going on. That is exactly our state today. Economics is in great flux, a massive transition. While I was impressed by the solidarity of the profession, there is no apparent solidarity of ideas. **********Q. How did that affect your work? **********A. It made us all the more conscious of the need to capture diversity. Look at monetary theory. We have a discussion of classical theory, several essays on Keynesian monetary theory, and Milton Friedman and Phillip Cagan on monetarism, the doctrine. We also have lots of smaller entries which pick up specific aspects of one or the other monetary theory. **********Q. Do you see major new thrusts in the development of economics? **********A. Certainly. Advances in game theory, for instance, as outlined in Robert Aumann's excellent contribution. Mathematical techniques are rapidly pervading all fields of economics. Hashem Pesaran has contributed a fine entry on econometrics that charts the tension developing between methodological technique and the concrete problem. **********Q. But these are all developments of technique and methodology. What about economic content, ideas and problems of the real world? **********A. Economists are confronting the major problems in the world today. They see the 30 to 35 million people unemployed in the O.E.C.D. countries, three times more than in the 1960's. They see that growth in the O.E.C.D. economies has been slashed by half. They see that instability is increasing on a global scale. The poor performance of O.E.C.D. countries also aggravates the second big problem I see: Tens of millions of people in the third world lead truncated, brutal and uncertain lives. **********Most economists recognize these problems, and many are working on them. Unfortunately, however, economists have no solutions to these problems that they can agree on. **********Q. Is that a failure of the economics profession? **********A. Only in the sense that we have not produced clear-cut, agreed-on solutions to these problems. Part of the responsibility for failure lies with our political institutions and leadership. The political process has its own dynamic. Economists cannot change that, but they do have to come up with more persuasive ideas. **********Q. How should they do that? **********A. At the end of the Second World War, for example, when the Allies assembled at Bretton Woods to design the postwar economic system, the conference was dominated by the personalities of John Maynard Keynes and Harry Dexter White. These two men had different views as to how the world economy should be organized. Nevertheless, they shared enough common ground to be able to present a scheme. It wasn't ideal or perfect, but out of it emerged the Bretton Woods system with the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and later, the GATT, along with rules of behavior for managing the world economy. That gave us 25 years of the most remarkable prosperity the West has ever seen. We don't have that today. **********Q. Why not? **********A. There was political unity in the West for one thing; there was a strong consensus to reconstruct the Western world after the political and economic horrors of the 1930's and the 1940's. But my point is that Keynes and White produced ideas that represented a broad consensus of the economics profession. The ideas made headway because the political climate had formed a supportive consensus. Economists can produce the ideas, but they cannot produce the consensus. SAMPLINGS FROM PALGRAVE **********Excerpts from ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics.'' **********ADVERTISING. Advertising has been controversial, probably more so than its economic importance would justify, at least since the emergence of the mass media in the last century. In the United States, advertising spending in recent years has been just above 2 percent of G.D.P. This ratio has grown slowly over time; it is much lower in most other countries, especially in developing nations. In the U.S. and elsewhere, the ratio of advertising to sales varies dramatically among industries, even if attention is limited to industries selling consumer goods and services. **********Chamberlin's ''Theory of Monopolistic Competition'' (1933) was the first major work in economics to treat advertising formally, but its analysis led to few definite positive or normative conclusions. Perhaps reflecting the traditional distastes for advertising in the intellectual community, most early discussions of advertising by economists were generally critical, describing it as wasteful, manipulative, and anti-competitive. Its main redeeming feature was that it provides a source of revenue for the press ... Most recent writers are less enthusiastic about the relation betwen advertising and the media, perhaps because of the rise of television . . . RICHARD SCHMALENSEE **********FREE LUNCH. ''There's no such thing as a free lunch'' dates back to the 19th century, when saloon and tavern owners advertised ''free'' sandwiches and tidbits to attract mid-day patrons. Anyone who ate without buying a beverage soon discovered that ''free lunch'' wasn't meant to be taken literally; he would be tossed out unceremoniously. **********''Free lunch'' passed over into political economy during the New Deal era, and is loosely credited to various conservative journalists, including H.L. Mencken, Albert Jay Nock, Henry Hazlitt, Frank Chodorov and Isabel Paterson. (All efforts to identify the true originator proved unavailing.) The phrase signified that the welfare state is an illusion: government possesses no wealth of its own, so it can only redistribute wealth it has seized by taxation. **********During the Vietnam war era, ''free lunch'' took on a libertarian cast. When defenders of the draft argued that young men owed military service because they had accepted free tuition and subsidized school lunches as youngsters, the ''free lunch'' expression became a libertarian shorthand to denote that citizens never get something for nothing, that sooner or later they are presented with a bill for all the favors or 'freebies' they accepted from government. **********''Free lunch'' would have passed into oblivian if it had not been able to pass a crucial test of its viability in the marketplace of ideas. In the early 1970's, every political or philosophical idea had to be able to fit on a T-shirt or automobile bumper sticker. The new version, TANSTAAFL (there ain't no such thing as a free lunch) was popularized in a science fiction best seller by Robert Heinlein (''The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress'') and in Milton Friedman's widely read columns in Newsweek magazine. . . . ROBERT HESSEN **********IMPERIALISM. Few subjects of such conspicuous historical importance have so consistently escaped lucid theoretical exposition as imperialism. The neoclassical economists have made no theoretical gains whatsoever in the field, have chosen to ignore the subject altogether. Their starting and ending point is a short essay borrowed from Schumpeter in which imperialism in the 19th and 20th centuries is attributed to the atavism of states, acting on feudal and absolutist impulses from an earlier precaptialist era. The field, therefore, has been dominated by Marxists ... **********Part of the problem lies in the ambiguity of the term. Since there is no agreement on the referent of imperialism, there is none on the meaning of the word itself. Marx and Engels did not discuss imperialism as such so they bequeathed no definition. To one of their followers, Rosa Luxemburg (1913), it was the political expression of the accumulation of capital in its competitive struggle for what is still left of the non-capitalist regions of the world . . .

And it is unlikely that pilots will help load passengers' suitcases like those at People Express once did. **********Nonetheless, it is premature to pronounce deregulation a failure. After a tumultuous decade that turned the airline industry upside down, deregulation is still accomplishing many of the things its proponents said it would. The average cost of flying has risen at a pace significantly below the inflation rate, and that is likely to remain true. **********As a result, air travel still remains a bargain compared to the years before deregulation. The number of passengers has increased to an estimated 450 million this year, from 297 million in 1980, and most experts expect that number to keep increasing. **********And although competition has lessened somewhat from the bloody days earlier in the decade, when more than 30 new airlines joined the fray, the eight surviving big carriers are still slugging it out on some routes and the discount fare is in no danger of becoming extinct. Today, only about 10 percent of people flying pay full fare, and the industry is barely making a profit. **********''The return on assets and the net profit margin is still abysmally low,'' said Candace Browning, an analyst at Wertheim Schroeder. ''This is not an industry charging extortionate fares.'' **********Indeed, the industry's profit margins have shrunk to 1.3 percent, from 2 percent a decade ago. The airline industry makes no more money than the supermarket business, that most cutthroat of low-margin enterprises. Many experts say the industry cannot indefinitely withstand such poor profitability if it is to invest in the equipment and facilities necessary to provide better service and continued safe flights. **********What the nation has now is a vastly changed airline industry, in which the forces shaping it are far more turbulent than anyone expected at the outset of deregulation. These forces, in turn, have produced an air transportation system that is much more complex, confusing and, in some ways, less convenient for travelers. **********The nonstop flight is becoming rarer, and the annoyance of having to change planes along the way has become routine. Everyone agrees that service - whether measured by on-time arrival, baggage handling, spacious seating or food quality - has declined. **********With fare regulation gone and airlines now possessing sophisticated computer systems that enable them to constantly monitor their own and competitors' fares, literally hundreds of thousands of fares and the availability of discounts can change with lightning speed - even hourly. If, say, Midway Airlines lowered its fare between Cleveland and Omaha by $10, United, American and Northwest would learn of it almost immediately through their computer connections and could react quickly if customers began defecting. **********Some airline executives claim pricing is so flexible that on some days the industry introduces as many as one million fare changes. A traveler who calls an airline twice over the period of a few days to inquire about the cost of a trip will often be given widely differing prices and travel restrictions. **********So volatile are prices, that it is possible that the increases announced earlier this month will crumble within a few weeks, if not days, should one carrier defect from the united front. ''If we see demand go down after the first of the year, lower fares will be back very quickly,'' said Edward Starkman, an analyst at Paine Webber Group Inc. **********But on the other hand, it is accurate to describe the battered industry that has emerged as an oligopoly in which about eight big players are calling the shots. These carriers - American, United, Texas Air's Continental and Eastern units, US Air, Delta, Northwest and Trans World - have such a lock on air travel now that it seems increasingly unlikely that scrappy new airlines will appear to offer competitive challenges. **********''We should put the issues of the impact of deregulation behind us and begin dealing with the issues of an oligopoly, which isn't necessarily bad, just different,'' said Tulinda Larson, a vice president at Airline Economics, a consulting firm in Washington. No Cozy Cartel **********Oligopoly has an ugly sound because it implies a cozy cartel that will return the nation to the equivalent of a regulated environment in which a greedy group of companies, rather than the Government, sets fares and carves up routes. But history shows that oligopolies do not act alike. While the breakfast cereal industry, with its fat profit margins, is often cited as the classic cozy oligopoly, the tire industry is one in which cutthroat competition has long prevailed. **********So far, the indications are that the airline industry will continue to be highly competitive - at least for several years. Despite improving profits, several airlines, still have deep financial and operational problems that will force them to try continually to grab market share. One such carrier is the Texas Air Corporation, whose Continental and Eastern units are debt-laden and under duress. **********Ms. Larson, who has been studying the airline industry since before deregulation appeared in 1978, said: ''On the whole, the consumer is better off. Fares haven't gone up as much as the consumer price index'' - a trend she and other analysts see continuing for several years. The C.P.I. has gone up 82.5 percent from 1978 through last August, but the average ticket cost has risen only 39.1 percent. **********But the worrisome issues of oligopoly - and near monopoly in some markets - are perplexing ones that are likely to dog the industry, consumers, Federal officials and investors for years. **********The most fundamental one - and probably most intractable - is the capacity of the air travel system. There is now a shortage of airport gates, and they have become the coin of the realm, in themselves a force regulating the industry, keeping out competition. Without gates to embark and disembark passengers, no airline, however mighty, can hope to storm a competitor already entrenched at a particular airport. **********One of the prime forces behind some of the airline mergers of recent years was the scramble by big carriers to capture airport gates. Frank Lorenzo, Texas Air's chairman, bought People Express Inc., parent of People and Frontier, as much for its gates at Newark and Denver as for its routes and planes. **********United Airlines is just finishing up a $500 million construction program at Chicago, which added one-third more gates and enlarged taxiways around its terminal so jumbo jets can pass one another and not have to wait getting to and from runways. **********At the nation's four busiest airports - New York's Kennedy and La Guardia, Washington National and Chicago's O'Hare - an airline must hold Government-assigned slots to take off and land during peak hours. Last year, the Government decided that airlines can sell their slots, in essence giving established carriers the power to decide whether a potential new competitor, can enter the market. **********United, already strong in Chicago, has been aggressively buying up available landing slots there and hopes to buy more, said Chris Bowers, vice president and general sales manager at United. **********''The lack of gates and landing slots is shifting the equation in favor of established airlines,'' said Richard Bilotti, an airline analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. **********Such capacity constraints could theoretically drive fares up sharply if the number of people wanting to fly continues to grow and demand outstrips supply. But most experts believe such pressures are still several years away. And if prices moved high enough, demand might fall off, driving prices back down. Airlines also might cope by using more jumbo jets, even on short routes, to move more people on each flight.  The Hub System **********Still, the shortage of gates and slots means that the complex network of regional bases carved out by the nation's airlines - what they call a hub and spoke system - has now become a permanent part of air travel. And it has significantly changed the nature of competition between airlines. **********There are now some 20 hubs. In a bid to maximize the use of aircraft, airlines feed passengers into their hub cities with flights from outlying cities, or spokes. At the hub, passengers change planes to travel on to their destination. In almost all hubs, one carrier now dominates. Trans World Airlines Inc. rules St. Louis, for example, and Northwest Airlines Inc. is dominant in Detroit and Minneapolis. Continental owns Houston, and Delta and Eastern are struggling for supremacy in Atlanta. **********Airline Economics, using data compiled by the Boeing Company, the airliner manufacturer, contends that passengers who live in a hub city and begin their flight there end up paying higher fares, in some cases 50 percent more than they would have had deregulation not occurred. Passengers who begin their flight in an outlying city and change planes at the hub pay as much as 30 percent less. ''This means that the principal fare competition in the U.S. is now between airlines serving specific hubs to try and attract connecting passengers through their hub,'' Airline Economics said in a recent report. **********Hubs have changed the nature of non-stop flying. For example, it is typically more expensive now to save two hours by flying non-stop from New York to Denver on United Air Lines Inc. than to fly to Denver on another airline and change planes in one of its hubs - Northwest to Denver with a change in Detroit or Minneapolis, for instance. **********Critics of the airline oligopoly cite the emergence of the hub system as further evidence of a growing lack of competition. ''Carriers have quietly exited hubs where other airlines are trying to establish dominance,'' said Paul Stephen Dempsey, a expert on transportation law at the University of Denver. ''They have shifted their operations around to where on the whole they are anti-competitive. **********Airline executives hotly contest such assertions. ''We have most of the passenger boardings in St. Louis, but in terms of passengers traveling to and from St. Louis itself, we have about half; the rest are going somewhere else,'' said Sandy Rededer, a T.W.A. vice president. **********Like others in the industry, Delta's senior vice president for marketing, W.W. Hawkins, tends to talk about competition now in terms of competing hubs. ''We are competing for passengers with Charlotte, Nashville, Raleigh-Durham, Dayton and Dulles. It's highly competitive,'' he said. **********The hub system and ability of each carrier to constantly assess and change prices has brought a new complexity to scheduling and pricing air travel. Carriers have been forced to become sophisticated marketers.  No More Fire Sales **********They call this new expertise by different names: inventory control, yield management or revenue control. But whatever the name, it means maximizing the amount of money each passenger must pay for a seat rather than trying to fill each seat. Gone are the ''fire sales'' at the gate in the early years of deregulation, when ticket agents would practically give away empty seats at the last minute to fill a plane. Those last- minute passengers, the airlines eventually learned, were the ones willing to pay the highest fare because of the urgency of their business. **********''In March 1983, Delta carried more passengers than ever, and we also lost more money than any month in our history,'' said Mr. Hawkins, noting the harshness of the lesson. **********So Delta, like everyone else, began allocating a portion of seats on a flight to discount fares for passengers willing to book in advance and risk a penalty for changing plans in return for the lower price. And it reserved the rest of the seats for business passengers willing to pay substantially higher fares at the last minute. **********Highly dependent upon computer data bases and detailed historical profiles of each flight, the systems have become marketing staples. They typically work like this: Several weeks before a flight's departure, seats are apportioned to discount and business travelers based on the mix of travelers who have taken the flight before. Periodically - sometimes daily, sometimes more often - actual bookings on the flight are analyzed against past behavior. **********If a flight begins to move outside historical guidelines - for example, if business-traveler bookings are lower than expected a few days before departure - an analyst will decide to reduce the number of business seats. Thus, the traveler who found discounted seats unavailable two weeks before departure, might call a few days before departure and discover seats available.  'A Crap Shoot' **********The technique requires executives with a poker player's nerves, since a flight might be only half filled two days before departure. ''It's a crap shoot. You turn away people who will pay the discount fare today in hopes of more people showing up tomorrow willing to pay a higher fare,'' said Ms. Larson of Airline Economics. **********The consensus among analysts is that carriers are doing it skillfully, and that yield management has begun to fatten most airlines' profits. Yield management heralds what experts believe is the beginning of a long overdue era of stability. **********After fares were liberated in the early 1980's, price wars wracked the industry. Who can forget People Express's $29 fares between Boston and Newark, which allowed legions of prep school and college students to fly home every weekend? But the industry sustained enormous losses, some carriers failed and others were acquired. The shakeout, completed last year, left airlines badly bruised and badly in need of profits to pay for new planes and ground facilities. In recent months, carriers have ordered dozens of new airplanes, such as the Boeing 767, to modernize their fleets. **********These expenses, coupled with a recent rise in operating costs and robust demand for air travel, help explain why big carriers, despite their competitive nature, have been able to implement modest fare increases in the last year. Although fuel prices have been essentially flat for the last year, costs of labor, passenger meals, landing fees, advertising and debt service have been climbing. The Air Transport Association's composite index of unit costs was up 6.1 percent in the second quarter of this year over the same quarter in 1987. **********''They're out there to make as much money as they can while times are good,'' said Mr. Starkman, the analyst.  Discounts Here to Stay **********Despite the fare increases and tightening of restrictions, the discount fare is here to stay. Analysts and industry executives agree that prices are now closely linked to demand. Since about 90 percent of all fares now have some discount, the special prices have become an important part of demand. **********The most significant result of the price increase announced earlier this month was not the elimination of some discount fares, but rather Continental's decision to structure its fares based on miles flown, making longer flights more expensive. That had not been the case until now. **********Other carriers said they would follow, applauding the Continental move. ''These increases are something we are welcoming,'' said Mr. Hawkins of Delta. ''Continental has held the rest of us hostage because every time we tried to move toward a more rational fare basis, Continental wouldn't move.'' **********But airline executives contend that announcements of fare changes, which often receive considerable public exposure, can be misleading because fares are often changed weeks or days later as a carrier responds to shifting competitive forces. **********''Quite often the media reports these increases as if they are actually permanent and will last a lifetime and, in fact, a lot of them never get into place,'' said A. B. Magary, a Northwest executive vice president. **********Such remarks reflect how price volatility is a given. They also mirror how executives long for stability. The airlines, however, have a long way to go before they are big moneymakers. A Need for Profits **********Ms. Browning, the analyst, expects the industry to earn an operating profit this year of $2.6 billion on gross revenues of $52.4 billion. She expects $2.9 billion in operating profits next year, which would translate into a skimpy profit margin of 1.5 percent. **********''They are pouring more money back into the business than they are making,'' said Robert P. Neuschel, professor of corporate governance at Northwestern University. ''If we want a healthy industry, we have to see more profits.'' **********What additional strategies the carriers can adopt to achieve such profitability is not clear, but some airlines are making more money than the industry average, and their experience may point the way. United, for example, had record earnings of $179 million in the thrid quarter and last month filled an impressive 69 percent of its seats. It has a profit margin of 4.3 percent after several rocky years. **********The airline's executives credit skillful yield management and a commitment to quality service to lure the frequent business flyer. But many experts say that air travel today is still more often a chore than a pleasure. ''Fares are down, but the product we purchase today is a decidedly inferior product than the one we could buy a decade ago,'' said Professor Dempsey. ''In terms of service, all you could buy then was steak. Today all you can buy is horsemeat. Consumers are saving billions of dollars, but it doesn't taste as good.'' **********A popular belief in the industry today is that People Express failed, in part because the public tired of the carrier's no-frills approach and the travails of coping with it.  Painful Global Changes **********Airline executives are eager to increase attract more business travelers to whom the quality of service is often what matters most. Mr. Hawkins said Delta's dependability and service were essential in its successs in increasing its share of the business market. **********Donald Trump, the real estate developer and casino-hotel operator, has said he intends to refurbish Eastern Airline's shuttle operation and turn it into a quality service airline when his acquisition is completed next month. **********Texas Air and Scandinavian Airlines System just announced an alliance that would link the two airlines' flights around the world. Mr. Lorenzo said one motive was to use the S.A.S. connection to help Continental improve its tarnished service image with business travelers. S.A.S. has a reputation for high-quality service. **********But Mr. Lorenzo's alliance with S.A.S. also illustrates what many experts call the coming globalization of the industry, a move that could also increase profitability. By linking domestic carriers with foreign carriers, the potential for additional revenue is increased. United, which has no European presence, recently sought an alliance with British Airways. **********Much of this globalization movement is being focused on developing global computer reservation systems, which would give the various consortiums of international airlines additional marketing power. ''We are headed toward three or four competing worldwide reservation systems, all of them essentially based on the leading systems in the U.S.,'' said Mr. Magary of Northwest. **********Professor Neuschel sees continued consolidation as the global trend accelerates. ''By the year 2,000 you will have nine or 10 major airlines in the world and only four or five in the U.S. will make it,'' he said. **********Thus, even as the industry emerges from the roughest days of deregulation, the pain of global consolidation may be upon it.

These lightweight materials can withstand very high temperatures making them ideal replacements for some metals in the aerospace, chemical and automobile industries. Dr. Maxine L. Savitz, director of the Garrett Ceramic Components Division of the Allied-Signal Aerospace Company, talked with the Business Forum editor, Joel Kurtzman, about the state of ceramic research. **********Question: What are some of the advantages of advanced ceramic materials? **********Dr. Savitz: We've developed ceramics with high strength - they can withstand 115,000 pounds per square inch - at room temperature and as much as 70,000 p.s.i. at 2,500 degrees. Now what we need to do is produce these materials in complex shapes with thick and thin surfaces, like turbine blades, that can withstand 150,000 revolutions per minute. At 2,500 degrees, I might add, metals don't exist - it is too hot. **********Q. Are these products less expensive than the metals they replace? **********Dr. Savitz: Currently they are more expensive because of the low volume and because we are still on the learning curve. But in time they should become competitive in cost with the products they replace. The aim is to make them equivalent in price. **********Q. If these materials only become equivalent in cost and not cheaper, why develop them at all? **********Dr. Savitz: Products made from advanced ceramic materials will have many advantages. These products are lightweight, and that is a real benefit for aerospace and automotive applications. And they can withstand high temperatures. These materials also don't corrode and don't wear. **********Q. Will these products become widespread? **********Dr. Savitz: I think they will become very widespread. They allow you to have simpler systems - without the need for lubrication, and many kinds of maintenance, for instance. They are also extremely durable. In the next 10 to 15 years you'll see a growing penetration of these materials into commercial applications. **********Advanced ceramics are made from the same basic materials as china with added processing to increase density and strength. Products made from these materials are even slip cast and made in molds. The Achilles' heel, of course, is that advanced ceramic products are brittle. **********Q. Who is ahead in the race to commercialize advanced ceramics, the United States or Japan? **********Dr. Savitz: The Japanese are ahead in the commercialization of these materials. The ceramic turbochargers that were offered on certain cars produced by the Nissan Motor Company and by the Buick Division of the General Motors Corporation were all supplied by Japanese companies. But American companies have made great strides. You can get certain valves, bearings and industrial tools from the Norton Company and from Sohio. But the higher-tech products are all from Japan. The Japanese are also ahead in making larger numbers of products a month. No one yet is really making these products in large batches, but the Japanese are ahead. **********Q. These materials were first developed in the United States. How did the Japanese get so far ahead? **********Dr. Savitz: The Japanese got ahead by putting a lot of manpower on the project. Japanese industry and Government underwrote research and carefully went about developing processes and controls. There was no magic on their part; it was a very carefully controlled process. And the Japanese are constantly improving their processes. They began by emphsizing consumer products and they now sell scissors and knives made out of advanced ceramic materials. They focused on consumer products to get their processes and techniques down. **********We can now get as much strength in our materials as the Japanese do, but only in simple shapes. It takes time to develop complex shapes like turbine blades. **********Q. What kinds of research projects does the United States government underwrite? **********Dr. Savitz: The Department of Energy has sponsored an advanced gas turbine project. Ford, Garrett and Allison have all competed on designing an all-ceramic engine. This led to improved design - even ahead of the Japanese. **********Q. Will we be seeing an all-ceramic engine soon? **********Dr. Savitz: We won't see an all-ceramic engine until about the year 2000. But we will see more ceramic engine components introduced. But don't forget, this is a new technology and we are still learning how to make products. It takes a long time for a new technology to evolve and there is always resistance to change."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/26/business/the-media-business-advertising-call-to-arms-to-oppose-ad-curbs.html": {"writer_name": "Randall Rothenberg", "pub_date": "1988-10-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 818, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Call to Arms To Oppose Ad Curbs", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Call to Arms To Oppose Ad Curbs", "body_text": " **********A SERIES of speakers yesterday lambasted public officials who would tax, restrict or ban advertising and urged members of the Association of National Advertisers to be unyielding in the fight for unfettered ads. **********''The most important issue facing national advertisers is the attack on commercial free speech in America,'' said R. William Murray, vice chairman of the Philip Morris Companies. In dire tones, he warned an audience of about 100 corporate advertising and marketing executives gathered at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York that tobacco is not the only product whose ads are under attack. **********''If the censors can stop tobacco advertising, your product may be next,'' he said. ''They have a long list, and your product is on it.'' He said that red meat, fried foods, children's cereals and detergents with phosphates ''are on the hit list'' of legislators in Washington, although he provided little specific evidence. **********Mr. Murray's attack came toward the end of the 79th annual meeting of the advertisers' group. Speakers touched on a variety of topics including global marketing and the threat that rising promotion expenditures pose to media advertising. The mood was subdued, without the elation that might have been expected in a year when the advertising community succeeded in its efforts to repeal a Florida advertising tax. Thus, the virulence of attacks on what Mr. Murray called ''the self-appointed censors of commercial free speech'' stood out. **********Earlier in the day, DeWitt Helm Jr., the association's president, criticized ''those architects of social behavior who attempt to tamper with the First Amendment constitutional protection of commercial free speech by banning, or placing restrictions that constitute a ban, on advertising lawful products and services.'' **********To illustrate what he meant by ''restrictions that constitute a ban,'' Mr. Helm flashed on a large screen behind him a slide showing the Surgeon General's cigarette-pack warning. **********Later, Gilbert H. Weil, a partner in the New York law firm of Weil, Guttman & Malkin and the A.N.A.'s general counsel, charged the National Association of Attorneys General, which has been investigating local retail and consumer-product advertising that it considers deceptive, with possible violations of the Federal Civil Rights Act. **********That act, Mr. Weil said, protects the constitutional rights of all citizens. ''Truthful advertising of a lawful product or service certainly is a constitutional right,'' he said, ''so that any improper deprivation of that right would violate the Civil Rights Act.'' **********Mr. Murray, a 52-year-old native of Australia who was filling in for the scheduled speaker, the acquisition-minded chairman of Philip Morris, Hamish Maxwell, singled out Senator Bill Bradley, a New Jersey Democrat, and Representative Mike Synar, an Oklahoma Democrat, for criticism. **********Senator Bradley has proposed that the advertising tax deduction be eliminated on ads for tobacco products. Representative Synar has long argued for a complete ban on tobacco advertising. Both proposals have been gaining support in Congress, as public disaffection with smoking has increased. **********''As citizens, we stand to lose our personal access to information,'' said Mr. Murray, whose company has spent millions of advertising dollars promoting the rights of smokers. He then read, with a touch of drama, from the First Amendment to the Constitution. **********Senator Bradley, in a telephone interview from Washington, took issue with the speakers' equation of advertising tax-deductibility and free speech. ''My argument all along has been that you have a right to free speech,'' he said. ''You don't have a right to a tax loophole. They're throwing up a scare tactic, that this is a freedom of speech issue. It isn't. It's a question of tax benefits.'' **********Representative Synar, reached in Oklahoma, where he was campaigning for re-election, disputed the advertisers' interpretation of the First Amendment. **********He read from a copy of a 1986 Supreme Court decision in the case of Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Company of Puerto Rico that he has carried with him since he began his effort to restrict tobacco advertising. **********''It is precisely because the Government could have enacted a wholesale prohibition of the underlying conduct,'' recited Mr. Synar, ''that it is permissable for the Government to take the less restrictive step of allowing the conduct but reducing the demand through restrictions on advertising.'' **********To rule out restrictions on the advertising of tobacco, alcoholic beverages or prostitution, the Court ruled, ''would require more than we find in the First Amendment.'' **********''I don't care how long the lawyers for the tobacco or advertising industries scream and yell, the fact of the matter is this is the law of the land,'' Representative Synar said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/07/world/gorbachev-visit-gorbachev-begins-us-visit-urges-greater-dynamism-relations-with.html": {"writer_name": "Bill Keller", "pub_date": "1988-12-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1563, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Gorbachev Visit; GORBACHEV BEGINS U.S. VISIT; URGES 'GREATER DYNAMISM' IN RELATIONS WITH AMERICA", "print_headline": "The Gorbachev Visit; GORBACHEV BEGINS U.S. VISIT; URGES 'GREATER DYNAMISM' IN RELATIONS WITH AMERICA", "body_text": " **********Mikhail S.

We shall be sharing our concerns and our interests in analyzing and thinking over the current situation.''  [ Transcript, page A18. ]  'Fighting the Jet Lag' **********Mr. Gorbachev then climbed into a black Zil limousine for the motorcade to the Soviet Mission to the United Nations. Because the route into Manhattan was closed to other traffic, the motorcade took 25 minutes to make what is normally a 40-minute drive. **********The Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, Gennadi I. Gerasimov, said Mr. Gorbachev would spend his first evening in New York ''fighting the jet lag, I suppose.'' **********The first major event on Mr. Gorbachev's schedule is an address this morning to the United Nations General Assembly. Soviet officials said yesterday that the speech would include a proposal on conventional arms reductions, including a voluntary cut in Soviet troop strength. A Washington Counteroffensive **********In Washington yesterday, senior advisers to President Reagan and President-elect Bush sought to reduce the effect of Mr. Gorbachev's diplomatic offensive. They warned that Mr. Gorbachev might be trying to raise expectations and increase pressure on the United States to make concessions at a time when the United States Government is in a transition phase, and thus unable to engage in serious negotiations with the Soviets. **********Mr. Reagan scheduled a news conference tomorrow night, to assure himself a chance to put his own gloss on the week's events. A Soviet official said Mr. Gorbachev had not planned to meet reporters during his visit, but might reconsider in light of the White House announcement. **********Soviet officials predicted yesterday that the centerpiece of Mr. Gorbachev's speech at the United Nations would be a new proposal for reductions of conventional forces. **********One official said the proposal would include a unilateral troop cut by the Soviet side, with a call for the Western allies to follow suit. **********After his United Nations speech, Mr. Gorbachev is scheduled to meet Mr. Reagan and Mr. Bush for lunch on Governors Island in New York Harbor. **********A Soviet official said yesterday that Mr. Gorbachev would solicit American support for sending United Nations peacekeeping forces to Afghanistan. **********Mr. Gorbachev, the first Soviet party leader to visit New York since Nikita S. Khrushchev did so in 1960, did not tip his hand about new proposals in brief remarks after his arrival. **********''We have not arranged any formal agenda, so either side will be free openly and frankly to raise any issues it wishes to,'' he said, speaking through a veteran Soviet Foreign Ministry interpreter, Viktor M. Sukhodrev. Mr. Sukhodrev was the interpreter on Mr. Khrushchev's first trip to the United States in 1959. **********Although the Reagan Administration has sought to play down the Soviet-American encounter, Mr. Gorbachev said, ''I believe the very fact that this meeting is going to take place means a great deal.'' The Gorbachev Entourage **********The Soviet leader was accompanied by his wife, Raisa, wearing a dark brown lambskin coat. His delegation includes Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, Aleksandr N. Yakovlev, the Politburo official responsible for foreign affairs, and Anatoly F. Dobrynin, the longtime Soviet Ambassador to Washington, who is now a foreign-policy adviser in the Soviet legislature. **********Mr. Gorbachev was met by a delegation that included Aly I. Teymour, the United Nations chief of protocol; Vernon A. Walters, the American delegate to the United Nations; Jack F. Matlock Jr., the United States Ambassador to Moscow, and Selwa Roosevelt, the American chief of protocol. **********A crowd of about 200 Soviet citizens, evidently delivered from the Soviet Mission to the northwest corner of Kennedy airport, waved little Soviet flags as the Soviet leader arrived. **********Mr. Gorbachev's routes through Manhattan have been closely inspected by three security services - the New York Police Department, the Secret Service and the K.G.B. - and from his limousine window yesterday he probably saw more blue uniforms than ordinary citizens. **********The block of East 67th Street where the Soviet Mission is situated was cordoned off by hundreds of police officers from the three agencies, who were providing a bumper business for grocery stores in the neighborhood. **********Just before Mr. Gorbachev's car pulled into the Soviet compound's garage, police officers were seen poking nervously into a steaming manhole 10 feet from the mission door. Several Small Protests **********Two small groups of protesters took up stations yesterday at East 67th Street and Lexington Avenue, a block from the Gorbachevs' quarters. **********On the southwest corner, about 100 Armenian-Americans gathered for an all-night vigil supporting Soviet Armenians in their conflict with the neighboring republic of Azerbaijan, a dispute that centers in part on the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. **********They hung signs from police barricades saying ''Return Karabakh to Armenia!'' and ''Gorbachev stop the Azeri mob!'' and chanted ''We want Karabakh! Karabakh is Armenian!'' and ''We want Gorbachev!'' **********Sosy Kadian, a New Jersey schoolteacher who is an ethnic Armenian, said more people would be gathering to protest at the site during the next two days. ''Busloads are coming from all five boroughs,'' she said. **********Across the street, chanting and singing to guitar accompaniment, were about two dozen protesters from a group called the Student Struggle for Soviet Jews. Time for Sightseeing **********Mr. Gorbachev is to spend tomorrow sightseeing in Manhattan before continuing to Cuba and Britain. **********The trip has been conceived as a promotional tour for what Mr. Gorbachev calls the Soviet Union's political ''new thinking,'' which stresses the interdependence of East and West and puts the pragmatic quest for cordial relations above the old Marxist view of a world revolution. **********Given Mr. Gorbachev's penchant for the grand gesture, there has been much speculation about new policy initiatives he might disclose during his New York visit. **********American officials are wary of a proposal on conventional arms, for example, fearing that people may have difficulty distinguishing a reasonable arms proposal from a propaganda gambit. **********Mr. Bush's choice for national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, has warned that the West consider putting strategic arms talks on hold if Moscow comes forth with purely propagandistic proposals for conventional arms cuts that seem designed to divide the Western alliance. Tass Chides the White House **********White House officials are especially leery of being pressed to commit themselves on new proposals during a period of transition, before Mr. Bush has had a chance to take charge of the White House and settle into his job. **********In a statement distributed as Mr. Gorbachev left Moscow for New York, the official Soviet press agency Tass chided the White House for being overly cautious. **********''It is perfectly natural that the new administration will need some time to get its bearings in the complexity of domestic and international problems,'' Tass said. ''But it is very important not to drag out this period. Marking time in international affairs, especially in the domain of arms limitation and reduction, is tantamount not only to loss of time but to backsliding.'' **********The question of Afghanistan is expected to be central when Mr. Shevardnadze meets Secretary of State George P. Shultz this morning. **********The Soviet Union has promised to withdraw its remaining 50,000 troops from Afghanistan by Feb. 15 under an agreement brokered by the United Nations, but there has been mounting concern in Moscow that the Soviet-backed regime in Kabul faces a quick collapse after the withdrawal. Moscow said last month that it was suspending the pullout because terms of the withdrawal accord were not being respected by the United States and Pakistan. Hoping to Prevent a Bloodbath **********One Soviet official said yesterday that Moscow was committed to completing the withdrawal, but would like United Nations peacekeeping troops sent in to prevent a bloodbath and supervise the formation of a transition government. **********The official said this idea would be raised in Mr. Shevardnadze's meeting with Mr. Shultz and probably in Mr. Gorbachev's session with the American leaders. **********American officials also say they expect Mr. Gorbachev to make a strong pitch this week for relaxing barriers to Soviet-American trade and lending. The Soviet leader is expected to argue that his program of domestic liberalization is sufficiently far along to justify such a vote of confidence by capitalist countries. **********Soviet officials confirmed that Mr. Gorbachev probably would appeal for freer trade, although it was not clear whether he would offer details."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/11/business/savings-unit-deposits.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-02-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 128, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Savings Unit Deposits", "print_headline": "Savings Unit Deposits", "body_text": " **********Deposits at the nation's savings institutions increased in December for the third consecutive month, continuing a trend that began after the October stock plunge, the Government said Tuesday.

W. Botha of South Africa and the leaders of Togo and Niger. The ceremonies began with a pontifical requiem Mass in Munich's landmark cathedral, the twin-towered Frauenkirche, and ended with a twilight march down the Ludwigstrasse, a route lined with members of old Bavarian shooting societies with banners in traditional garb. **********In a demonstration of grief and fealty, thousands of people gathered along the route, just as tens of thousands had filed past Mr. Strauss's coffin since his death in Regensburg last Monday. So great was the crush that the authorities were compelled to extend mourning hours far past midnight. **********Mr. Strauss will be buried Saturday in a private family ceremony in Rott am Inn, the northern Bavarian hometown and burial place of his wife. A Power in Bonn, Too **********At his death at 73, Mr. Strauss wielded considerable influence in Bonn as the leader of the Christian Social Union, the conservative Bavarian party aligned with Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Party. Along with Mr. Kohl's group and the small Free Democratic Party, Mr. Strauss's followers made up West Germany's governing coalition. **********In Bavaria, though, there was no coalition; Mr. Strauss ruled as the undisputed and enormously popular boss, a butcher's son who loved drinking beer and eating pig's knuckles in a village guesthouse. He mingled with the world's leaders and oversaw the development of Bavaria into one of West Germany's most prosperous states. **********''There's nobody else for whom I would have come out like this,'' said Rudolf Eichhammer, a Munich resident who had donned the peaked felt cap and jacket of his shooting club, one of hundreds of the old organizations where Bavarian and German traditions reside, to form an honor guard along the Ludwigstrasse. **********''He was a Bavarian, he lived as a Bavarian, and he did much for Bavaria. He could speak to people in the beer tent, and he could speak to the world's greatest politicians.'' **********It was a theme echoed on the streets and in formal eulogies, including one by the West German President, Richard von Weiszacker, speaking in Hercules Hall, the grand concert hall built in the throne room of the old royal palace. 'Son of Bavarian Homeland' **********''He thought in great perspectives and broad horizons, and he saw politics as a historic task,'' Mr. Weiszacker said. ''But in this world he always remained the immutable son of his Bavarian homeland.'' **********The mourners reflected the many and often ambivalent strands of Mr. Strauss's career. Chancellor Kohl and most mainstream West German politicians were there. Among those who did not attend were leaders of the Greens, the West German leftist and environmentalist party, who stayed away to protest the presence of President Botha. **********Mr. Botha was accompanied by his Foreign Minister, Roelof F. Botha, in a strong demonstration of gratitude to a politician who had staunchly maintained ties with Pretoria. **********There were also high-ranking envoys from the East bloc, including Deputy Prime Ministers of the Soviet Union, China and East Germany, testifying to the active economic and political ties Mr. Strauss had forged with Eastern Europe despite his vocal anti-Communism. He had shocked West Germans in 1983 by extending a credit of a billion marks to East Germany - then about $400 million. Americans in Attendance **********The United States was represented by Richard R. Burt, the Ambassador to Bonn, and former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger. A message from Pope John Paul II spoke of ''the heavy loss of this great and worthy Christian statesman.'' **********The contrast between Mr. Strauss, the bogeyman of the West German left, and Mr. Strauss, the hero of conservatives, formed a strong subtheme of many of the tributes. **********''He drew lightning bolts like a tall tree,'' said Max Streibl, the Deputy Premier of Bavaria and one of the contenders to succeed him. ''But he transformed Bavaria into a modern state.'' **********The grandeur of the funeral reflected the royal history that still casts a potent spell over Bavarians today and contributes to a sense of uniqueness embodied in its official designation, as the Free State of Bavaria. **********It was a spirit that Mr. Strauss often invoked in his regal receptions for foreign dignitaries, and one that often produced headlines in the popular press referring to him as Emperor Franz Josef. Pageantry to the End **********On the final march down the Ludwigstrasse, Mr. Strauss's catafalque, covered in the blue-and-white checkered flag of Bavaria and drawn by six spirited black horses, moved from the residence of the old Wittelsbach dynasty, past an equestrian statue of the 19th-century King Ludwig I. ''He was a king, and Munich was a royal residence,'' said Josef Joffe, a political commentator on Suddeutsche Zeitung, a major Munich daily. ''Bavaria was always a monarchy that was infatuated with its kings, and he ran the country like a king. **********''He was also the Bavarian par excellence - beer, hunting, pigs knuckles and all. But Bavarians combine loudmouth rhetoric with great caution when making decisions, unlike the Prussians, who say little and go to war. Strauss was a very intellectual man. That may explain his failure in national politics - his love for quotable sentences always got the better of his power politics.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/01/business/at-t-in-rate-cut-today-3.5-drop-exceeds-estimate.html": {"writer_name": "David Rampe", "pub_date": "1988-01-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 423, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A.T.& T. in Rate Cut Today; 3.5% Drop Exceeds Estimate", "print_headline": "A.T.& T. in Rate Cut Today; 3.5% Drop Exceeds Estimate", "body_text": " **********The American Telephone and Telegraph Company said today that it would lower its rates for interstate long-distance calls by an average of 3.5 percent on New Year's Day, a larger reduction than expected. **********The lower rates reflect a $772 million reduction in the charges that A.T.& T. will pay for connections to local phone systems. **********Last week, the Federal Communications Commission directed local Bell companies to lower their connection charges to reflect growth in long-distance calling. **********At the time, the industrywide reduction was estimated at $750 million, and A.T.& T.'s share of that was put at $500 million.

Because of its huge volume of calls, A.T.& T. has a lower cost per call. **********The commission said it would allow A.T.& T. to put lower rates into effect but would investigate whether prices should be reduced even more. Daytime Rates to Fall 6.4% **********The average residential customer, who pays about $9 a month for out-of-state phone calls, will save about 21 cents, or 2.4 percent, the company said. Daytime rates will drop 6.4 percent, evening rates will fall 1.9 percent and late-night and weekend rates will be trimmed by six-tenths of 1 percent. **********This was the sixth major rate reduction since Jan. 1, 1984, when A.T.& T. was stripped of its local Bell operating companies by an antitrust decree. Since then, interstate long-distance rates have fallen nearly 36 percent. **********At the same time, the cost of local telephone service has risen - part of the F.C.C.'s intention to end the subsidy that long-distance rates had provided for local service. The Consumer Federation of America estimated earlier this year that the average consumer's phone bill had increased by 20 percent since the Bell breakup."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/22/business/2d-honda-plant-in-us.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-03-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 141, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "2d Honda Plant in U.S.", "print_headline": "2d Honda Plant in U.S.", "body_text": " **********Honda broke ground on Sunday for a second United States auto assembly plant.

'We Are Very Serious' **********''We are very serious about this,'' said Peter A. Perry, a Nevada lawyer and chief executive of Mustang Ranch Inc., a company formed last year, which is making the stock offering. ''I can confirm that we have a registration statement pending with the S.E.C.'' **********Under the proposed offering, a group led by Mr. Perry and Donald R. Clough, a Nevada real estate developer, is offering to buy Mustang Ranch for $18 million. The difference between that cost and the amount raised will go toward capital improvements, financial reserves and administrative costs. **********Four managers and directors, including Mr. Perry and Mr. Clough, will hold enough stock to control more than 40 percent of the company. **********No brokerage firm is underwriting the offering, and all the shares are being offered by ''officers, directors, and employees as a self-underwritten offering,'' the prospectus says. Sale Is Not Improper **********Last year, the Mustang Ranch brothels showed a drop in gross revenues to $5.4 million, from $5.9 million in 1986. But profits rose from $848,000,to $917,000. **********While prostitution is illegal in every state but Nevada, the securities sale is not improper. **********''We are not merit regulators,'' one S.E.C. official said. ''Otherwise we would have people trying to get us to prohibit tobacco companies, alcohol companies and companies that do business with South Africa from selling securities to the public.'' **********Though the S.E.C. does not seem to be in a position to stop the stock sale, individual states could. Scott Stapf, spokesman for the North American Securities Administrators, said that 36 states have the power to block sales by mail to state residents. **********For those accustomed to reading the habitually dry and excessively long propectuses filed at the S.E.C., the filing deviates only in content, not in style. 7 Straight 12-Hour Days ''The brothels are licensed boarding houses at which the independent contractors, as female prostitutes, make available their services for the performance of sexual acts with male customers,'' the prospectus says. **********The brothel does not set the fee structure for the business of prostitution, or impose any ''pricing schedules or guides.'' **********The women turn over half their receipts to the company and pay a fee of $10 a day for room and board. They generally work seven consecutive 12-hour days, then are off for two to three weeks. **********The prospectus notes that the offering is a high-risk venture, primarily because of potential lawsuits, adverse publicity and the potential for clients or ''independent contractors'' to acquire sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS. **********''Although no independent contractor doing business at the brothels has been reported to have been tested 'positive' for exposure to the AIDS virus, the level of incidence of AIDS has been reported by the media to be extremely high amongst prostitutes,'' the document said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/28/business/algerian-oil-discovery.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-12-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 98, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Algerian Oil Discovery", "print_headline": "Algerian Oil Discovery", "body_text": " **********The Algerian state petroleum agency Sonatrach has struck oil in an area close to the Tunisia border, the agency said today.

Some Help From the West **********The action was only the latest instance of such coordination. On Feb. 1, opposition figures in Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary and the Soviet Union demonstrated against economic austerity measures that have caused hardship in Rumania. Later that month, dissidents from several Eastern bloc countries signed a petition on behalf of opposition figures jailed in East Germany. **********In part, the dissidents are aided by groups in the West. The appeal today was coordinated by a London-based organization called the Eastern European Cultural Foundation, which has links with anti-war and human rights groups in Eastern Europe. But mostly, the dissidents have developed close contacts over a number of years. **********The first significant international activity was in October 1986, when dissidents from five Eastern bloc countries signed an appeal to mark the 30th anniversary of the Hungarian uprising. The appeal called for the restoration of democracy in Eastern Europe. **********Since then, groups in several countries have availed themselves of the greater level of political tolerance, improved international telephone links, and relaxed travel regulations to increase their contacts. **********Mr. Haraszti, for example, traveled to Vienna thanks to relaxed travel rules introduced in Hungary on Jan. 1. Official Irritation **********There have been independent conferences of dissidents in Warsaw and Budapest. Last summer, dissidents from Poland and Czechoslovakia, in an unusual meeting on their border, agreed to form a joint organization. **********Such cooperation, modest as it is, is irritating to East European leaders.

But with so many resumes flooding the market, how can a job hunter convince a potential employer to let his foot in the door, and not somebody else's? **********''We're inundated with resumes, receiving up to 50 percent more than last year,'' said Phyllis E. Tama, vice president and principal of Thorndike Deland, an executive search firm in New York. **********In this atmosphere, some job seekers are hoping that two new kinds of resumes will catch the eye of the potential employer - the video resume and the certified resume. **********Video resumes, lasting from 3 to 7 minutes, have been used for several years by a small number of job seekers, and video boosters see more use in the future. For instance, said John B. Kelman, president of Res-A-Vue, a video resume company in Milford, Conn., ''We're making a video of a group of Ph.D.'s who are looking for venture capital.'' **********In a video resume, information about the job candidate appears on the screen followed by the job seeker describing his or her abilities and the type of job being sought. The main difficulty, however, is in getting employers to screen the resume, which takes more effort than simply glancing at a written resume. **********''There are certain people for which this would do well,'' said Edmund Stone, owner of The Write Resumes. These often include ''mature people who felt they were passed over because they were perceived as being too old.'' **********Certified resumes also differ from the standard issue. These are resumes on which every piece of information has been ''certified'' as being accurate based on polygraph tests given to the job seeker. It is the product of Jeffrey L. Gwynne, a former private investigator, and president of Jeffrey L. Gwynne & Associates of New York. **********His service differs from other reference checking services in that he works directly with the employee, in a series of in-depth interviews and behavioral tests, rather than calling third parties. **********The job candidate reviews all the information with the service, and can be given a polygraph test and other behavior diagnostic tests. Mr. Gwynne guarantees that the information is accurate and says he will pay for the consequences for any errors. **********For the most part, Mr. Gwynne's clients are not job candidates but employers who wish to perform thorough background checks on potential employees. Thomas Rotunda, chief of police for Ridgefield, Conn., uses the service to help screen applicants for entry-level police positions. Mr. Rotunda said Gwynne's service has uncovered burglaries, robberies, child abuse and other offenses that had not been discovered through departmental interviews. **********Some, however, question the need for this type of resume. ''Why would the job hunter need a certified resume?'' asked Marcia Fox at Drake Beam Morin. ''Employers typically want to check references themselves, and if you do falsify information, it is immediate grounds for dismissal.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/15/business/currency-markets-dollar-rises-against-mark-to-reach-11-month-high.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Fuerbringer", "pub_date": "1988-07-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 566, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dollar Rises Against Mark To Reach 11-Month High", "print_headline": "CURRENCY MARKETS; Dollar Rises Against Mark To Reach 11-Month High", "body_text": " **********The dollar rose yesterday, hitting an 11-month high against the West German mark and generally defying the usual cautious position taken the day before the release of major economic data. **********Both the West German Bundesbank and the Federal Reserve intervened to sell dollars several times yesterday, traders said, but the central banks could not stem the decline of the mark.

Dealers Holding Dollars **********Today the Commerce Department will report United States trade deficit figures for May, one of the most keenly anticipated economic statistics. But unlike past release dates on the merchandise trade figures, it appears that many traders are so confident in the dollar's strength that they were willing to go into Friday holding dollars. **********The consensus for the trade deficit figure has been in the $11 billion to $12 billion range, up from the surprisingly low $9.9 billion in April. If the deficit is lower than expected, the dollar is likely to surge again. If the deficit is a little higher then the consensus figure, some traders say the dollar may fall, but not precipitously, because of the bullish sentiment on the dollar. **********One factor overhanging all the predictions is that the market has been caught off guard several times recently because the report was far off the consensus expectation. 'Dollar Is Well Supported' **********''With the demand and the psychology, the dollar is well supported now,'' said Francoise Soares-Kemp of Credit Suisse. ''The mark has lost favor.'' **********''If the trade figure is worse than expected,'' Mrs. Soares-Kemp said, ''it will be shrugged off. It won't be a crushing blow to the dollar.'' **********The market, she added, continues to believe the dollar will go higher because of apparent Reagan Administration support, the strong economy in the United States and the anticipation that the Federal Reserve will push up interest rates in the near future. The half-point increase in the prime lending rate to 9 1/2 percent yesterday by major banks, although already expected, was another small, positive development. **********Richard E. Witten, vice president for foreign exchange at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said that the Congressional testimony of the Federal Reserve Board's chairman, Alan Greenspan, on Wednesday was very ''bullish'' for the dollar. He said if it was not for the anticipation of the trade deficit report today, the dollar would have gone higher. **********The dollar was helped also during the day by a rumor, reported by many traders, that the trade deficit figure would be less than $9 billion, which may have led some people to buy dollars. There was some concern that someone had somehow gotten the figure early.

But that does not mean they should. **********Given the uncertainties that have surrounded the world's stock markets since the crash last October, many investors avoid equities of all nations. **********Yet, for investors who want to balance their portfolios with stocks, it may make sense to spread the risk among the world's active equity markets. **********Many global stock experts think American investors might want to consider European markets over the high-flying Tokyo market, where Mount Fuji-like price/earnings ratios are the norm. **********Banque Paribas, a leading French-based international bank that specializes in European equities, has just sent its stock analysts on a six-day world trip to promote European equities. **********Banque Paribas says some stock markets within Europe offer better value than others. Gilman Gunn, a Paribas analyst based in London, said that, among the European financial markets, ''West Germany represents the best equity value compared to bonds.'' **********That is because Germany has long been considered the most undervalued of the major European stock markets. Bonn's traditionally conservative fiscal policies have kept a lid on interest rates and inflation - and on growth. **********The West Germans are not a stockholding people. Only about 3.5 million of them own stocks, compared with 47 million Americans - roughly one of every 20 Germans and one of every five Americans. German stocks typically trade at low price/ earnings multiples and offer high dividends. ''The German market is dependent on foreign investment,'' said Reinhard Fischer, a Paribas analyst. But he sees a potential for increased domestic investment in German stocks. ''German households were not affected by the crash because they weren't in the market,'' he said. **********Politically, West Germany's Government is one of the most stable in Europe, and the Paribas team sees few worries on the horizon. **********Mr. Fischer predicts a 20 percent increase in prices on the Frankfurt stock exchange in 1988. Trading volume has been picking up since the October crash, he said. **********He disagrees with the current wisdom that German corporations and the stock market are ''prisoners'' of the dollar-mark exchange rate.'' He thinks Germany's exports to the rest of the European Community and to Japan will rise this year. **********For that reason, he recommends buying the shares of Daimler-Benz A.G. and the MAN Group. **********Mr. Fischer likes Daimler not only because it makes upscale cars - he is not too bullish on the auto sector in general - but also because ''their truck business is running for very high numbers.'' That should make up for any drop in Mercedes sales, although he said that its car line tends to be recession-proof and ''has very good potential, especially in Japan.'' **********As for MAN, Mr. Fischer said the mechanical engineering company had accomplished a strong profit turnaround in its trucking and construction operations, and that its MAN-Roland unit, a printing-press producer, had just received a huge order. **********The political situation in France, where a presidential election looms, is not nearly as stable as in West Germany, but the Paribas experts argue that whatever type of government is in control in Paris, the private sector will receive preferential treatment. The inflation rate in France is low, industrial productivity is up and the country has little foreign debt, they point out. With privatization and takeover activity heating up prices on the Bourse, they say, domestic investors (who have a lot of cash in money market accounts) may be lured into stocks. **********Paribas is recommending Carrefour, the French retailer, which operates 105 ''hypermarkets'' and about 100 small discount stores. Carrefour is expanding into Spain and Brazil. Its stock yields about 2.9 percent, with a P/E multiple of 12. **********Other recommendations include Lafarge, which Paribas said ''has the best cement technique in the world'' and may expand into the United States, and Peugeot, ''a tremendous turnaround situation'' that is ''better managed'' than its rival, Renault. **********Peter Michna, an analyst in Britain, predicted that London would be pro-business for at least the next 10 years. But he cautioned that the British stock market ''may not be very far from a downturn,'' so the stocks he favors have ''have market leadership and stock liquidity, yield, asset backing and strong balance sheets.'' **********His recommendations are British Aerospace, whose military business is picking up; Prudential Assurance, for its ''enormous customer base'' and ''huge sales force,'' which should come in handy when various European Community competitive barriers vanish in 1992, and Sainsbury, a food retailer, ''the Rolls-Royce of the pork chop, baked beans and toilet paper.'' **********The Paribas team also suggested stocks in other European markets. In Belgium, it liked Delhaize Freres (food retailing), Petrofina (oil and gas) and Solvay (chemicals); in the Netherlands, Ahold (food), and in Switzerland, Nestle (food) and Inspectorate (quality control). **********The Banque Paribas analysts did not say there would be a bull market in all European equities. Indeed, their recommended portfolio for American investors is heavily weighted in favor of bonds and cash. Mr. Gunn pointed out that his charts comparing bond and stock values ''do not show the damage done emotionally'' to investors by the October crash. As a result, he said, ''it will be a year for stock picking,'' not sector or market picking."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/20/business/the-media-business-advertising-peanut-butter-is-topic-of-an-ad-controversy.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1988-06-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 186, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Peanut Butter Is Topic Of an Ad Controversy", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Peanut Butter Is Topic Of an Ad Controversy", "body_text": " **********The May report from the national advertising division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus, the advertising industry's self-policing unit, discloses that there was a heated controversy between Procter & Gamble and the Best Foods division of CPC International over peanut content in crunchy peanut butter. **********It started with P.&G.'s Jif brand's advertising by Grey Advertising, which promised ''more bigger chunks, more peanut butter taste than any big brand.'' **********Best Foods, maker of Skippy, didn't take kindly to that, even though the TV advertising compared Jif only with ''other leading brand.'' **********After much testing, the council unit decided that Jif had proven most of its case except for an ''implied message'' that Best Foods complained about.

Inside, hundreds of Dominicans are assembling electronic parts and medical equipment and stitching together clothing. **********This is manufacturing at its cleanest and neatest, in Caribbean style: no smokestacks, no soot. Wages of $4 a Day **********Such manufacturing has been catching on throughout the islands, but it has been growing even faster in the Dominican Republic where wages of $4 a day are among the lowest in the region, while the labor supply is virtually unlimited. **********Nearly 200 companies, almost all of them either American-owned or operating on contracts with Americans, have set up plants in 10 industrial parks scattered around the Dominican Republic. The Government is building 13 more of these parks and says it has companies waiting to move in. In four years, the number of Dominicans working in the industrial parks has jumped from 20,000 to nearly 80,000. **********The plants here and elsewhere in the Caribbean employ unskilled workers, mainly women, to assemble mechanical parts and stitch together pre-cut fabrics that are shipped from the United States or Puerto Rico and returned as finished or semi-finished products, duty free. Effect on Jobs in U.S. Debated **********Organized labor in the United States accuses the companies of exporting jobs to the islands. But the companies say they are actually preserving American jobs. Without the low-cost labor in the islands, the companies say, they could not remain competitive and would have to eliminate some of the products that are partly made abroad. Some companies say that lower prices have improved their sales and led to the creation of more jobs in the United States. **********The Dominican Republic and the other Caribbean countries exempt the foreign companies from all taxes and most financial reporting. Where the countries profit is in renting space and providing telephone, electricity and water service and, most of all, in reducing their universally high unemployment. Money from the plants also ripples through the ports and trucking companies and finds its way into the grocery stores. **********Most of the islands have attracted some of these plants. Besides the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Haiti have been among the most successful, although the industry in Haiti has gone into decline in the face of political turmoil since the collapse of the Duvalier dictatorship in early 1986. **********The industrial park just outside the capital, which takes its name from the adjacent village of Itabo, is one of the newest and most expensive in the Dominican Republic and so far has attracted exclusively major American corporations. **********Westinghouse, which had been operating in Puerto Rico for 20 years, was the first company to move into Itabo. It dedicated its first plant in early 1987 and expects to open its fifth there in June. **********The much larger industrial parks at Santiago, in the north central part of the country, and at San Pedro de Macoris, about 50 miles east of Santo Domingo on the south coast, have drawn scores of smaller companies that employ from a few dozen to a few hundred workers in each plant. Most Production Is of Clothing **********More than half of the production in the industrial parks is of clothing, from underwear to fur coats. Last year, a Government official said, the Dominican Republic shipped more than 36 million pairs of men's pants to the United States, making it the second-largest supplier of these goods, after Hong Kong. It is a big producer of shoes, too. **********There is also a plant in Santiago that makes cigars and one in San Pedro de Macoris in which gold links are connected to make necklaces that are sold in New York City's jewelry district. **********Though the plants at the Itabo industrial park, near the capital, are especially attractive, most of the others in the country and elsewhere in the Caribbean are spacious, well lighted and often air-conditioned. **********Itabo, which is privately run, leases building space at $4 a square foot per year, compared with as low as 48 cents a square foot in the least expensive of the Government-run industrial parks. But a Government official said construction in the private park is ''much more sophisticated.'' **********Manuel E. Tavares, the 36-year-old president of Itabo, said similar space in the United States would rent for perhaps $2 to $2.50 a square foot. But, he added, the higher leasing expenses in his park are quickly offset by the lower labor costs. Unions Allowed; None Organized **********Unions are permitted to organize in the industrial parks in the Dominican Republic, but none have ever done so. **********Haiti had been leading the Caribbean in this type of manufacturing -often referred to as ''the assembly industry.'' At $3 a day, no place offered cheaper labor. **********But more than two years of political upheaval and an election-day massacre last November decimated the assembly industry in Haiti, wiping out nearly 20,000 jobs, by some estimates. Some companies moved next door on the island of Hispaniola to the Dominican Republic and, according to American executives and United States officials, more are being wooed to it. **********The Dominican Republic has also gotten a big influx of businesses from Puerto Rico. Two years ago, the United States Government was considering eliminating major tax advantages for American companies doing business in Puerto Rico. Without the tax benefits, it seemed, many companies would pull out. **********Governor Rafael Hernandez-Colon persuaded the Reagan Administration to leave the benefits intact by promising that companies operating in Puerto Rico would farm out some of their work to so-called twin plants that they would build on other islands. **********Companies discovered that setting up plants here could directly improve their profits. Work that had cost them $8 an hour in Puerto Rico could be done in the Dominican Republic for $4 a day. The main cities, San Juan and Santo Domingo, are only 45 minutes apart by air, and since the Spanish language is common to both places, experienced plant managers from Puerto Rico could be used in setting up the new operations."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/23/business/ayer-settles-army-dispute.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-05-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 242, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ayer Settles Army Dispute", "print_headline": "Ayer Settles Army Dispute", "body_text": " **********N.

Mr. Regan's recommendation followed by a day a decision by five Wall Street firms to suspend such computerized program trading for their own accounts. 'The Present Game Is Rigged' **********Program trading, which allows institutions to take advantage of price differences between the stock index futures and actual stocks, has also been blamed for driving many investors out of the market because of the sharp swings in prices. **********Mr. Regan told the Senate Banking Committee that a sweeping ban of index futures contracts was a necessary step to attract small investors back to the stock market. **********''The public has every reason to believe the present game is rigged,'' Mr. Reagan said. ''It is.'' He added, ''I don't think it's too extreme to say that overall confidence in our free market system is threatened by this sort of scandal, and that's what it is - a scandal.'' **********Mr. Regan ignited a political storm in Washington in the last week because of his critical observations about the Reagan Presidency in his just-published book, ''For The Record.'' The book, among other revelations, disclosed that Nancy Reagan consulted an astrologer in deciding how the White House would plan the President's schedule. **********The subject of the book was ever present but seldom spoken at the hearing, as Mr. Regan made clear from the outset that he did not wish to discuss it. But Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, prompted laughter when he read Mr. Regan's horoscope. And Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, suggested that perhaps Mr. Regan had used astrology to reach his conclusions about program trading. **********Mr. Regan had few kind words for Wall Street and Federal regulators. At one point, he referred to the Securities and Exchange Commission as a ''lapdog instead of a watchdog.'' **********Mr. Regan's views on stock index futures were endorsed by George L. Ball, chairman and chief executive of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., and Charles R. Schwab, the chairman and chief executive of Charles Schwab & Company. **********Mr. Schwab said a recent survey of his customers indicated that 80 percent considered program trading to be a major cause of recent market volatility and that 60 percent said the elimination of program trading would increase their level of confidence in the market. **********Mr. Ball told the Senate committee that the complete abolition of stock index futures ''merits inspection,'' even though Prudential-Bache made more than $15 million in revenues from stock index futures last year. **********Mr. Ball said a survey of his customers indicated that more than half no longer considered the stock market to be a place for the small investor and that program trading had put them at a serious disadvantage. Moves to Limit Program Trading **********The New York Stock Exchange currently bans the use of its computers for index-arbitrage transactions when the Dow Jones industrial average moves 50 points in one direction. Moreover, John J. Phelan Jr., head of the New York exchange, and Leo Melamed, head of Chicago Mercantile Exchange, are negotiating an agreement that would halt trading on both exchanges if the Dow moved 200 to 300 points in a day. **********The working group established by the President earlier this year to recommend changes in the markets in the wake of the crash is likely to endorse that agreement and to institute a coordinating committee among the regulators that would oversee issues that affect both markets. Its recommendations are expected in a week. **********One senior Senate aide said it was uncertain whether Congress would pass market legislation this year and that it might take another market collapse to get Congress to act. **********At a news conference after his testimony, Mr. Regan described the market as a ''ticking bomb'' that might explode.

Founded in 1935 by two brothers, S. Priestley Blake and Curtis L.

The previous year, it earned $50.4 million on sales of $536.4 million. Hershey attributed the decline in Friendly's earnings to heavy competition, fewer customers, and a shortage of restaurant workers. **********For Hershey, the sale represents a decision to end its nine-year foray into the restaurant business. Hershey, which is based in Hershey, Pa., and is best known for its chocolate bars, earned $148 million on sales of $2.4 billion in 1987.

''There is much further to go.'' **********On Saturday, following a meeting of Central American Presidents in Costa Rica, the Nicaraguan President, Daniel Ortega Saavedra, announced that he would restore political and civil rights suspended when his Government decreed a state of emergency in 1982. Mr. Ortega also said he would issue a limited amnesty for prisoners and open direct cease-fire talks with contra guerrillas. **********Under the regional peace accord signed in August, Central American Governments are required to revoke states of emergency, issue amnesties and hold cease-fire talks with guerrilla groups. Mr. Ortega took the new steps toward compliance less than three weeks before Congress is scheduled to vote on new aid for the contras. Practical Impact Is Unclear **********The practical impact of Mr. Ortega's announcements remained unclear today. Anti-Sandinista politicians, who will presumably now be permitted to operate more freely, were cautious. Several noted that at the same time Mr. Ortega was announcing the new measures, security policemen in Managua were arresting opposition leaders in an operation broader than any in recent years. **********Between Friday night and Saturday night, six leaders of opposition political parties in Nicaragua were taken into custody. All but one of those arrested had attended a meeting with contras in Guatemala last week. The Government accused them of seeking to unite guerrilla groups and civilian parties into ''a single front.'' **********Associates of the arrested men denied that their parties were forming alliance with contras. **********The arrests indicated that with or without the legal tools available under the state of emergency, the Government is able to move against opposition figures whenever it suspects them of subversive intent. Many arrests and prosecutions are carried out under the public security law, which forbids acts that expose Nicaragua to ''foreign domination.'' Predictions Vary **********Dr. Gustavo Parajon, who was appointed by the Government to the four-member National Reconciliation Commission that monitors compliance with the peace accord, today described the steps announced by Mr. Ortega as positive and important. He said he expected the release of several thousand prisoners and the reappearance of radio news programs that have been shut down by the Government. **********But Virgilio Godoy Reyes, leader of the Independent Liberal Party, said he doubted the opposition would be freed from restrictions. **********''We'll see what the details are, but I'm sure the security police will continue arresting anyone they decide is a contra,'' Mr. Godoy said. ''I am afraid this is just another act of theater designed for the outside world.'' **********A member of the Sandinista National Directorate, Bayardo Arce, said in a speech Saturday that Sandinista groups would soon begin ''intense mobilizaton of the masses.'' **********''The moment has come to heat up our motors,'' Mr. Arce said. He urged Sandinista supporters not to surrender the streets to ''enemies of the revolution.'' **********The official Sandinista newspaper Barricada said the Government's latest concessions should persuade the United States Congress not to approve further aid for the contras. 'No Longer Any Pretext' **********''There is no longer any pretext for the approval of more funds,'' Barricada said in a front-page editorial. ''The ball is definitely in Washington's court.'' **********According Mr. Ortega'd announcement on Saturday, prisoners will be freed as soon as a cease-fire is reached. If there is no cease-fire, he said, they will be freed when a country outside Central America agrees to accept them. **********Mr. Ortega fixed no time limits for the cease-fire talks, however. The talks are likely to be difficult because of the chasm that separates the warring groups. **********Aristides Sanchez, a senior contra leader, said in a telephone interview from Miami that cease-fire talks should cover ''the reasons why there is a war in Nicaragua,'' and added, ''But Sandinista leaders say cease-fire talks should be only to discuss how and when the contras will stop fighting.'' **********''I don't think a cease-fire is possible,'' said Luis Humberto Guzman, an opposition member of the National Assembly. ''In civil wars, cease-fires are only possible after one side has been defeated.'' **********Cardinal Obando said today that he would speak to Sandinista and contra leaders to see ''if there is a willingness to reach a cease-fire or if there is only a desire to gain time.'' He said the arrest of opposition leaders did not contribute to ''a climate of reconciliation and peace.'' **********Two of those arrested, Agustin Jarquin Anaya and Duilio Baltodano, are leaders of the Social Christian Party, which is affiliated with Christian Democratic parties in other countries. Meeting With Contras **********The other four detainees, Alberto Saborio, Julio Ycaza Tigerino, Silviano Matamoros and Mario Rapaccioli, belong to the Conservative Party, one of the two traditional parties that dominated Nicaragua until the Sandinista takeover in 1979. All except Mr. Matamoros met with a contra delegation in Guatemala last week. **********Six other opposition figures who attended the meeting in Guatemala have not returned home, and a spokesman for the Interior Ministry said Saturday that they will be arrested if they try to re-enter the country. Among them is Jaime Chamorro Cardenal, editor of the oppositon newspaper La Prensa. **********On Saturday, Mr. Rapaccioli, who heads one faction of the Conservative Party, was arrested, released and then arrested again. **********''It was the strangest thing in the world,'' said Dr. Emilio Alvarez Montalvan, another prominent Conservative. ''Police dropped him off at the Intercontinental Hotel, and he called me from there. I went over and we had coffee while he told me about his 10 hours in jail.

They predicted that the Federal Reserve Board might be forced to increase interest rates, which the Republicans hope to avoid in an election year. **********But Government economists said they were not so concerned about the likelihood of inflation. Comment From Sprinkel **********''I think people in the market are overemphasizing fears of inflation,'' said Beryl W. Sprinkel, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. **********Traders in the credit markets interpreted the revised forecast as bad news, and short-term interest rose sharply. But stock-market investors took the report in stride, and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 5.38 points, to 1,966.75. **********Mr. Sprinkel said ''an encouraging shift'' was taking place in the economy, with sharply higher exports leading the country's economic growth as domestic demand slows. **********Government economic statistics are periodically adjusted as more data become available. The revision announced today was one of the most dramatic in recent years, as fresh figures showed that exports were more robust than had been previously projected. ''The numbers are clearly favorable, but they are one more piece of evidence that the economy may well be growing too strongly for its own good,'' said Christopher N. Caton, senior economist and vice president at Data Resources, a consulting firm in Lexington, Mass. **********He and other economists expressed concern that the economy was overheating - approaching a point where declining unemployment and rising utilization of production capacity tend to generate higher wages and industrial prices. **********''We've already seen some pickup in inflation, and the strong numbers point to further upward pressure on prices,'' said Robert T. McGee, vice president and economist for the iIrving Trust Company. In the last five years, he noted, the Consumer Price Index has averaged 3.4 percent annual increases, while in the first quarter of this year prices rose at an annualized rate of 4.2 percent. An Economist's Viewpoint **********Robert M. Giordano, partner and co-director of economic research for Goldman, Sachs & Company, said it was ''highly probable'' that the Federal Reserve would raise its discount rate, the interest it charges when it provides funds to depository institutions, ''within the next three or four weeks.'' Higher interest rates slow the economy by discouraging business expansion and consumer spending. **********Such a move is likely to be strongly resisted by the Reagan Administration - especially by Vice President Bush, the presumed Republican Presidential nominee, who is counting on strong economic growth to bolster his White House bid. **********The Federal Reserve last raised the discount rate on Sept. 4, to 6 percent, from 5 1/2 percent. Some economists have suggested that the increase contributed to the stock market's collapse on Oct. 19. **********Today's report of first-quarter economic activity was encouraging in what it showed of inflation. Measured over a broad economic spectrum, including what industry and consumers pay for goods, inflation was revised downward to a 1.7 percent annual rate, compared with 2.7 percent in the fourth quarter of last year. Slow Domestic Activity **********In a sign that domestic demand has turned sluggish, today's report showed that domestic economic activity - which economists call real gross domestic purchases - rose by a 2.1 percent annual rate in the first quarter, compared with 3.4 percent in all of 1987 and 5.4 percent from the fourth quarter of 1982 through 1986. **********Yet rising exports caused the foreign trade deficit to shrink, in inflation-adjusted terms, at an annual rate of $16.7 billion during the quarter. This was the largest drop in the trade deficit since the first quarter of 1980. **********In calculating the gross national product a month ago, Commerce Department economists projected a much smaller $3.6 billion compression in the quarterly deficit. **********Robert Ortner, the Under Secretary of Commerce for economic affairs, said that despite an upward revision in consumer spending in the first quarter - from a 3.8 percent annual rate to 4.3 percent - he expected the pace of consumer activity to taper off as well. **********Some sectors of the economy are not growing quickly, he noted, including home building, where higher interest rates have taken a toll. Heavy construction has also slowed, he said, because of less favorable depreciation allowances under new tax laws. **********He said that he would worry about inflation if the economy continues to grow around 4 percent the rest of this year but that he did not think growth would exceed 3 percent. **********The Reagan Administration has predicted growth at a 2.4 percent rate this year. Mr. Ortner said he expected that to be revised upward. Midyear Review to Come **********The forecast is produced by the Council of Economic Advisers. Today Mr. Sprinkel said: ''We're taking another look, but I don't know yet. Remember, when we came out with the 2.4 percent, how all you guys in the press called it a rosy forecast?'' A midyear review of the economy will be published in July. **********Some private economists are now predicting economic expansion through 1989. **********''We see the economy so strong that it will very likely continue to expand next year, barring any financial catastrophes,'' said Mr. McGee of Irving Trust. ''The economy has so much momentum that it would take some major shock to cause a recession at this point.'' **********Today's report showed that business investment was increasing at a fast pace, with growth up 20 percent over a year ago. This was seen as an indication that stronger export demand is causing some companies to modernize or enlarge their production capacity. **********The report also showed that corporate profits after taxes continued to rise in the first quarter but that the growth was tapering off. **********The first-quarter increase was at an annual rate of five-tenths of 1 percent, compared with 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter of last year.

''So many people, especially in America, still see us as a town surrounded by a tall wall and dark Communism. The reality is that it's a swinging city.'' **********It is also larger than any city in West Germany, with more cultural life, more research and development, more students, more night life and far more of the street life, experimentation and counterculture that Berliners call their ''scene.'' **********After several setbacks since the war, most traumatically the raising of the infamous wall in 1961, the crushed capital of Germany and of the Third Reich seems at last to have found its stride. Population Growing **********An enlightened administration, a generous package of financial incentives and a stabilizing of East-West relations have combined in recent years to reverse the city's long decline, bringing back people, money and business. **********The population, which bottomed at 1.9 million in the mid-1980's, has bounced back to 2 million and is climbing at a rate of 20,000 a year. Some 250 new enterprises and 42,000 new jobs have sprouted over the last three years in the fertile soil created by 180 technical institutes and government aid. **********Less tangible, but probably most important, the dark sense of siege and isolation fostered by the wall is increasingly being offset by the appeal of what is arguably the most cosmopolitan city in either Germany. 'A Personal Decision' **********''Young people are more interested in going 'downtown' than to the 'green desert' of the suburbs,'' said Horst Kramp, the chairman of Schering, the large chemical and pharmaceutical concern that bucked the trend in the 1950's and kept its headquarters in West Berlin. **********''We stayed,'' Mr. Kramp said. ''It was very much a personal decision of our board. My predecessors were Berliners, and for them it was self-evident that they should rebuild here. Now we're very happy they did.'' Some problems nonetheless persist. West Berlin remains surrounded by East Germany, a fact that complicates access to suppliers and markets, adds considerably to business expense and the cost of living, and still afflicts Berliners with a sense of isolation. **********Then there is the Byzantine political limbo in which the city is suspended. Berlin is technically still occupied by the victorious powers - the United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union. And there is still the awesome wall, severing the city through its former heart. Despite these problems, West Berlin is thoroughly integrated into the West German economy. Unemployment Is High Although the number of jobs has increased, unemployment remains high. About 81,000 are jobless, 11 percent of the work force - a rate higher than in West Germany as a whole, but lower than that in the northern cities. Many remain, officials say, because of the generous social security benefits. **********The ''scene'' that has made the Bohemian Kreuzberg district so colorful and creative has also brought the urban blight of drugs, squatters and violence. The ''autonome,'' whose credo is to provoke clashes with the authorities, are the most feared. They have threatened to disrupt the I.M.F. meetings and peaceful protests. As a result, West Berlin's police have received heavy reinforcements. **********Yet the consensus among Berliners and foreigners is that the 1980's have brought an end to the dark foreboding about the city. ''There's definitely a new climate,'' said Hartmut Fetzer, a member of the board of directors of Nixdorf, the computer company that has developed a sizable portion of its research and production in West Berlin. ''People are becoming a bit more proud of being in the city, there's more culture, new venture capital companies, a new industrial life.'' Up From 'Ground Zero' **********West Berliners divide their postwar history into distinct setbacks and advances. May 1945 was ''ground zero,'' when the city lay in ruins and the Soviet forces were carting off every piece of industrial equipment still functioning. But the arrival of the Americans, their determination during the 1948 airlift not to cede West Berlin to the Russians and their infusion of capital through the Marshall Plan, put the city back on its feet and fueled a rapid recovery through the 1950's. **********The erection of the wall in 1961 abruptly halted the revival. Some 50,000 people who worked in the Western sector found themselves stranded in the East, and those who remained in the West questioned the viability of living in a walled island. **********''We lost 5,000 employees in one week,'' recalled Joachim Putzmann, vice president of the Siemens electronics concern, which moved its headquarters out of Berlin after the war but remains the city's largest employer. It has 23,000 people at a vast research and production complex in ''Siemenstadt,'' or ''Siemens City.'' **********A ''psychological nose dive'' followed the building of the wall, one diplomat said. Jobs steadily dwindled and the population began aging and shrinking. '71 Accord a Factor **********The shift in mood, Berliners say, came only gradually. One factor was the agreement among the four powers in 1971 on the status of the city, which guaranteed West Berliners access to West Germany and lessened the fear that the East would continue trying to strangle the city. **********The turning point most commonly cited is the election in 1981 of a Christian Democratic Mayor, Richard von Weiszacker, now the West German state president. Mr. von Weiszacker brought in a team of capable managers and began a campaign - inherited in 1984 by his aide and successor, Eberhard Diepgen - to make West Berlin attractive as well as economically viable. **********The city had long received huge subsidies from the West German Government, including a direct infusion of half the city's budget. But under the new administration the city and federal governments shaped a new system of financial incentives to end the preponderance of basic manufacturing and to bring in entrepreneurs in high-tech industries. **********''If 20 years ago more than 65 percent of the work force was employed in production, today it's less than 50 percent,'' said Mr. Putzmann of Siemens. The Business Incentives **********Here are major segments of the financial package: Value-added taxes on goods shipped out by West Berlin are 10 below those in the rest of the country. Income taxes in the city are 30 percent below and corporate taxes 22.5 percent below those in the rest of the country. In addition, Bonn and West Berlin offer various incentives to new investments. **********All told, said Mr. Rexrodt, the city's head of finance, the incentives amount to about $4.89 billion a year. **********Officials in Bonn and West Berlin bridle at talk of handouts. They prefer to see ''compensation'' for the indisputably higher price of living in Berlin. In addition to the higher transport and energy costs, they note that West Berlin is denied lucrative military contracts under the four-power agreements, and receives none of the money that wealthy West German states pay their poorer neighbors under a national distribution system. **********''We need these tax advantages, no question; but not as a subsidy, rather as compensation for the disadvantage of doing business in Berlin,'' said Schering's Mr. Kramp. Aid for Cultural Events **********Not all the compensation goes to business. The city annually spends $267 million on cultural events, arguably more than any other city, to subsidize its renowned opera, orchestra, theaters, museums and festivals. Some of the money even trickles down to avant-garde artists and rock musicians. **********Considerable resources have also been plowed into education. Two major universities - the Free University and the Technical University - top an array of 180 institutes that employ a staff of 37,000 and enroll 100,000 students. **********This pool of talent, much of it technical, has made West Berlin the leading center of public and private research and development in West Germany, as well as a magnet for high-tech entrepreneurs like software designers. **********But Berliners get a bit miffed when visitors seem to put too much emphasis on the financial incentives as the reason for the new climate in their city. The incentives, they argue, simply tapped a spirit spawned in the swinging Berlin of the old world and steeled in adversity. **********''Berliners are one of the most enterprising groups around,'' said Harry J. Gilmore, the United States Minister in West Berlin, as the senior diplomat is known. ''It's a town of survivors, a town of people who got street smarts.''

The deal would create the nation's 12th-largest banking institution, with assets of $42 billion. **********Irving's board is expected to approve the $1.5 billion offer tomorrow. Most of Irving's directors joined in a telephone conference call yesterday during which Joseph A. Rice, the company's chairman, presented an outline of the proposed transaction. **********Mr. Rice's decision to abandon his resistance came one day after the Appellate Division of New York State Supreme Court unanimously agreed that a critical component of Irving's anti-takeover defense was invalid. Irving said Mr. Rice would retire after the merger is completed. **********''Irving's management saw the handwriting on the wall,'' said James J. McDermott, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, a New York securities firm specializing in banks. He noted that state and Federal regulators had approved the deal, the courts had invalidated much of Irving's defenses and the bank's management had been unable to find an ally with which to merge. **********During the spring, Irving's management had arranged a friendly merger with Banca Commerciale Italiana, but the Italian bank withdrew its offer in late August after the Federal Reserve Board raised some questions about the Italian Government's ownership of the bank's parent company. **********The battle between Irving and Bank of New York has been closely watched by other bankers as a litmus test of whether hostile takeovers could be achieved in the regulated banking industry. And the protracted nature of this attempt was widely believed to have discouraged some bankers from considering similar attempts. **********But many investment bankers and industry analysts attribute the exceptional length and bitterness of this dispute to the unusually large role played by personalities, rather than financial or strategic considerations. **********''I don't think this transaction is a blueprint for other deals,'' said Lee H. Kimmell, a managing director of Salomon Brothers and the head of its financial institutions department. ''There will be other hostile takeovers in banking, and even if they are hotly contested they won't ultimately drag on this long.'' **********The merger between Irving and Bank of New York will technically be a friendly deal, if Irving's board goes along. In a hostile takeover, the suitor makes a tender offer for publicly held shares in a company, gains control and ousts the board. Lawsuits to Be Dropped **********Irving's acquiescence to the deal will make it possible for the Bank of New York to avoid a provision of New York law relating to hostile takeovers that could have required it to run the two banks as separate entities for five years. In addition, both sides have agreed to drop all the considerable litigation outstanding. **********Bank of New York's offer for each share of Irving consists of 1.675 shares of its own common stock, $15 in cash and a warrant intended to have a market valued of $5. Given the current price of Bank of New York's stock, $34.125, its offer would be worth about $1.5 billion. **********Mr. Rice's change of position yesterday was made somewhat easier by Bank of New York's offer of the $5 warrant. That represented a slight increase from previous offers. **********''It looks like a way for Irving to save face with its shareholders,'' said Mark Alpert, a bank analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company. ''But it's questionable whether it was worth it for shareholders to wait a year for their compensation.'' Battle Cost Put at $40 Million **********The takeover battle has cost the two banks an estimated $40 million in legal and investment banking fees, not to mention the business opportunities that have been lost because of the distraction. In its exhaustive legal efforts, Irving has sued the Federal Reserve, the New York State Banking Department and Bank of New York, the latter many times. **********The mood at Irving was somber yesterday as employees tried to gauge the personal impact of Mr. Rice's decision to yield. In the investment community, however, the reaction was overwhelming relief. Arbitragers were anxious to reap the benefits of their investments, which have tied up their capital for months when other deals were taking place. **********The undisputed winner in the battle is J. Carter Bacot, Bank of New York's strong-willed chairman. Neither Mr. Bacot nor Mr. Rice was available for comment yesterday. But Mr. Bacot has maintained throughout that the two institutions combined would be much more competitive than if they stood alone in an industry facing growing pressure from securities firms and international financial institutions. **********The two institutions together will be in a better position, for instance, to participate in interstate banking. And the combined entity will have a legal lending limit to any one customer of $460 million, compared with the $240 million that Bank of New York is limited to now. A bank's lending limit is linked to the amount of capital it has set aside as a cushion against potential losses. **********Bank of New York has previously estimated that it could generate $45 million in pretax savings the first year after the merger and $668 million over a five-year period. Those savings would come from combining some operations and reducing corporate overhead, advertising, and legal and travel expenses. The employee payroll would also be reduced, but Bank of New York has said it expected to accomplish that primarily through attrition, as opposed to layoffs or salary reductions. **********The terms of the merger proposal call for Bank of New York to maintain all of Irving's employee benefits and severance packages. The ''golden parachute'' arrangements for more than 40 of Irving's senior officers would be modified so that they could only receive their lucrative severance packages after spending one year at the combined institution, unless they are dismissed or their responsibilities are substantially altered. **********In addition, Irving's directors would be invited to join Bank of New York's board. After the merger, key personnel decisions would be made by a committee of directors from both banks. Bank of New York would have three directors representing it, and Irving two. **********Bank of New York will derive a number of important benefits from the merger's being accomplished on a friendly basis. Assuming Irving's board accepts the proposal, it will waive its shareholders rights plan, known as a ''poison pill,'' which would have made it more expensive for Bank of New York to acquire Irving."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/27/business/company-news-audi-increases-warranty-plan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-07-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 200, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Company News; Audi Increases Warranty Plan", "print_headline": "Company News; Audi Increases Warranty Plan", "body_text": " **********Audi of America Inc., whose sales have been affected by lawsuits over the unintended acceleration of some models, said it would offer buyers increased warranty protection. **********The increased protection includes free coverage of all scheduled maintenance for the first three years, or 50,000 miles, when the work is performed at an Audi dealership. **********Joseph Bennett, an Audi spokesman, said the plan was part of the efforts of the company to restore consumer confidence in its cars and increase sales.

By the end of this year, the money managers will no longer be able to charge GTE a fixed percentage of the account, said Pamela McCann, vice president. **********Instead, the fee will be changed to one based on the managers' investment performance as compared with an agreed-upon benchmark portfolio. In effect, if their performance is below average, the management firms' compensation will be less than before. Others Expected to Follow **********GTE is the first blue-chip corporation to adopt performance-based fees, but it is expected that others will soon follow. RJR Nabisco Inc., for instance, will likely adopt such a fee structure sometime this year, said Robert E. Shultz, vice president of pension asset management at the company. **********Meanwhile, Wilshire Associates, a Santa Monica-based pension fund consulting firm, has been urging its clients to adopt such an approach. In the last year, it has persuaded five small corporate clients and 15 other institutional funds, such as city pension funds and endowment organizations, to use performance-based fees. **********The result of these and other moves will be a reduction in the estimated $3.5 billion that pension funds pay in fees to the hundreds of investment management organizations serving these corporations, unions and government funds. ''Fees will be the hot topic in 1988,'' said David O'Donovan, vice president of the S.E.I. Corporation, one of the largest pension consulting firms in the country. Performance Down, Fees Up **********Performance-related fees would not be an issue if money managers had better performance. For five consecutive years, more than two-thirds of the equity money managers in the country have failed to generate investment results better than an unmanaged index of stocks like the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Adding insult to injury, the money manager's fees increased, nonetheless, because assets doubled in the bull market and fees are based on a percentage of the client's account. **********In reaction, pension executives directed almost $200 billion of their assets into index funds, which are low-cost portfolios designed to match the performance of an index. Fees on these funds are generally as low as one-tenth of 1 percent of the account. **********These days, pressure on money management fees is coming in a number of ways. Besides the demands for performance-fee schedules, some corporate officials, tired of watching state and city fund officers pay lower fees, are negotiating to reduce their fees directly. Others have simply stated to their money managers that they are cutting the fees without any negotiations or relation to performance. **********And in the last year, a number of corporate executives have taken another step to lower their costs. More than 20 of the largest companies in the country that belong to the Committee on Investments of Employee Benefit Assets sent letters to their money managers asking for a fee reduction if their firms agreed to lower fees with any new clients. Such a movement could have a snowballing effect if it takes hold. Lower Minimum Fee **********Performance fees generally include a minimum fee that is much lower than the traditional equity fee of four-tenths to five-tenths of 1 percent of the account. To earn the rest of the fee, the money manager must provide a return that is a specified amount higher than that achieved by an agreed-upon benchmark of stocks, designed to match the managers' investment style. **********Such an arrangement, officials point out, is not unlike paying an executive a year-end bonus based on his performance. ''It's paying after the performance rather than paying for the promise of that performance,'' said John J. Nagorniak, chairman of Boston's Franklin Portfolio Associates, which manages $2.4 billion. **********GTE's goal is better investment performance from its group of money managers, not lower costs, Ms. McCann said. ''The objective here is to pay the good managers for good results,'' she said. **********But Ms. McCann agrees that overall fees will likely decrease because studies show that most money managers cannot beat the market. In a pilot program involving only three of its money managers last year, the company saved more than $200,000. **********Ms. McCann said she might dismiss some managers if their performance stayed below average. She declined to disclose the total amount GTE pays its money managers. But using the average rate of four-tenths to five-tenths of 1 percent of the $5 billion stock portfolio, the fees are estimated at $20 million to $25 million. **********For years, performance, or ''incentive,'' fees were used only by wealthy individual investors in hedge funds and by officials at public pension funds, who were required by state statute to hold down their costs. Labor Department Clears Way **********Corporate pension funds were unable to pay a performance fee unless they received a special exemption from the Department of Labor, which oversees corporate and union pension assets. Then in 1986, the department issued an opinion saying that corporate funds could adopt these fee structures. **********Obviously, money managers are less than thrilled with a system that will probably reduce their income. Many of them worry that they will be compared unfavorably against a benchmark that might be irrelevant to their style of investing. Some worry that they will be forced to adopt riskier and more volatile investing strategies to get better returns. They argue that plan sponsors who are dissatisfied should replace the poor organizations with better performers. **********''If managers have not outperformed the S.&P., maybe we ought to be fired, not paid less,'' said John F. Hotchkis, general partner of Hotchkis & Wiley, a Los Angeles investment firm that manages $2.3 billion."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/26/business/home-resale-rise-is-5.3.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-07-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 203, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Home Resale Rise Is 5.3%", "print_headline": "Home Resale Rise Is 5.3%", "body_text": " **********Sales of existing homes climbed 5.3 percent in June, helped by a smaller-than-expected increase in mortgage interest rates, a real estate trade group said today. **********The National Association of Realtors said existing single-family homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.78 million units last month, the fifth consecutive monthly increase.

Palmieri in Federal District Court in Manhattan, dismissed the Government's lawsuit seeking to close the P.L.O. mission under the Anti-Terrorism Act passed by Congress last year. **********Judge Palmieri said the language and history of the agreement that established the United Nations headquarters in New York required the United States to ''refrain from impairing the function'' of the P.L.O. mission. U.S. Studying Decision **********But in a related case on the terrorism law, Judge Palmieri ruled that the Government could prohibit people from acting in an official capacity for the P.L.O. in this country, aside from the United Nations mission. **********Rudolph W. Giuliani, the United States Attorney in Manhattan, said his office and the Justice Department were studying the judge's rulings. He added, ''We will make a decision as to further proceedings as soon as possible.'' **********In Washington, officials in the State and Justice Departments said they would reserve judgment for the moment to coordinate Administration policy. State Department officials have argued that the P.L.O. mission had a legal right to stay open while Justice Department officials said it could be closed. U.N. Officials Hail Ruling **********The decision yesterday was a victory of sorts for the State Department, which had opposed closure of the mission because of American treaty obligations under the United Nations Headquarters Agreement. **********The effort to shut down the P.L.O. offices in this country, which came from Congress, also drew outspoken opposition from diplomats at the United Nations. Officials there hailed the decision yesterday as a victory. **********Judge Palmieri noted that the P.L.O. had maintained its observer mission since 1974, when the United Nations invited it to ''participate in the sessions and the work of the General Assembly in the capacity of observer.'' Act 'of a Unique Nature' **********The judge said the Anti-Terrorism Act was ''of a unique nature,'' adding, ''We have been unable to find any comparable statute in the long history of Congressional enactments.'' **********Judge Palmieri said the statute, which went into effect in March, identified the P.L.O. as a terrorist organization and as an international threat that ''should not benefit from operating in the United States.'' **********The Government filed its lawsuit to enforce the law, which was intended to bar the P.L.O. from receiving or spending funds and from operating offices in this country. **********Rejecting the Government's arguments, Judge Palmieri stressed ''the lack of clarity in Congress's action.'' He said the law's failure to mention the United Nations Headquarters Agreement ''reflects equivocation and avoidance, leaving the court without clear interpretive guidance.'' **********Judge Palmieri said no member of Congress had ''explicitly stated that the Anti-Terrorism Act was intended to override any international obligation of the United States.'' Shultz's Letter Is Cited **********The judge also cited a letter to some members of Congress from Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who said that forcing the mission to close ''would be seen as a U.S. treaty violation.'' **********Condemning terrorism was the only thing that Congress was unanimous about in the debate, the judge observed. But he added that no evidence of P.L.O. terrorism in this country was presented to the court. **********Judge Palmieri said he interpreted the Anti-Terrorism Act as not applying to the mission at the United Nations, but added that the statute was valid for more general use. **********''It is a widely gauged restriction of P.L.O. activity within the United States,'' he said, ''and, depending on the nature of its enforcement, could effectively curtail any P.L.O. activities in the United States aside from the mission to the United Nations.'' **********''The P.L.O. Mission to the United Nations is an invitee of the United Nations under the Headquarters Agreement,'' he said, ''and its status is protected by that agreement. The Headquarters Agreement remains a valid and outstanding treaty obligation of the United States.'' 'Gratified,' U.N. Chief Says **********Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar said he was ''gratified by this judgment, which demonstrates the respect of United States courts for the international obligations of the country.'' **********The P.L.O.'s chief observer, Zehdi L. Terzi, called the ruling a ''victory for justice, for the United Nations, and for respect for obligations under treaties.'' **********Mr. Terzi said he did not believe the second part of the court's decision upholding the validity of the law in non-United Nations matters would block other P.L.O. activities in this country, which include lectures by Mr. Terzi and members of his staff. **********A suit challenging the constitutionality of the terrorism law was filed by 65 United States citizens and organizations. Ruling on that suit, Judge Palmieri said it involved ''important First Amendment interests.'' But he concluded that a First Amendment analysis of the law showed that its passage was ''within Congress's constitutional power.'' **********''The Anti-Terrorism Act, in order to survive constitutionality, must be interpreted narrowly,'' the judge added. **********''It effectively penalizes individuals only in prohibiting them from acting in an official capacity as representatives of the P.L.O. Congress must have the power to do that, since the P.L.O., as a foreign political entity, stands outside our constitutional structure.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/19/world/seoul-journal-as-foes-meet-old-longings-awake.html": {"writer_name": "Susan Chira", "pub_date": "1988-08-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1175, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Seoul Journal; As Foes Meet, Old Longings Awake", "print_headline": "Seoul Journal; As Foes Meet, Old Longings Awake", "body_text": " **********Suddenly, Min Kyung Nam finds himself dreaming again about the home in the north he fled long ago. **********''These days, when I dream I dream about my hometown,'' said the 67-year-old retired businessman, who ran south to escape conscription into the Communist army during the Korean War. ''I daydream about the roads I used to walk, the landscape I used to see.'' **********He is thinking, too, about the parents he left behind, his only keepsake a photograph of his father, so worn that he has had a portrait painted to preserve the image. **********On Friday, North and South Korea will hold their first Government talks in nearly three years. They come at a time of wide-ranging debate in South Korea about its relations with the North, a debate that evokes painful memories and raises measured hopes for the estimated five million South Koreans who left families behind in the North.  [ The talks adjourned after nearly three hours with no agreement, but the two sides agreed to meet again on Saturday, The Associated Press reported. ]  A Shift by the South Prompted by students who have taken up the cause of reunification, a lively debate is raging over the once-taboo issue. Students, arguing that Korea's division was the result of cold war maneuvering by great powers, pushed for the withdrawal of American troops, a North Korean role as co-host of the Olympics, and meetings with their North Korean counterparts as preludes for reunification. Academics called for better access to reliable information on the North. Politicians proffered their own solutions; opposition leader Kim Young Sam suggested, for example, that the South pay the North's debts as a gesture of good will. **********On July 7, President Roh Tae Woo signaled a shift in policy by proposing citizens' exchanges and trade and encouraging South Korea's allies to establish ties with the North. After a flurry of proposals and counterproposals by both sides, the two sides agreed to meet Friday, to talk about holding more talks; North Korea is pushing for a joint parliamentary meeting. What else is on the agenda is unclear. The South wants to talk about exchanges and trade, while the North wants to proclaim a nonaggression pact, agree on withdrawing American troops from the South, and serve as co-host of the Olympics, just a month away. **********For Mr. Min, as well as many South Korean scholars and Government officials, the talks at best could lead to a situation like East and West Germany, with family exchanges, citizens' visits, and telephone and mail links. Previous talks on economic and Red Cross issues ended without result when North Korea broke them off in January 1986. **********Some opposition politicians, such as Kim Dae Jung, say they believe it possible to agree on some kind of statement of principles, though not necessarily a nonaggression treaty. **********But the two sides remain far apart and deeply suspicious of each other. They are technically at war, communicating through Panmunjom. **********The talks have spurred hopes, however, of family exchanges, which took place for the first and, so far, only time in 1985. Mr. Min was among thousands of Koreans who visited and called the offices of the Red Cross, which coordinates the exchanges. More than 950 people crowded into the office to pick up applications on the first day it began accepting them. Many walked out with a stack of 100 or 200 applications, to take back with them to other provinces. A Struggle With Guilt **********Helped by volunteers in yellow smocks, Mr. Min filled out his parents' names and last known address. **********Mr. Min has no idea whether his parents are even alive. ''Whether I find them or not is not the point,'' he said, his eyes filling with tears. ''I came here because I have a sudden urge to look for them, quickly. But I don't expect too much, to actually find them. When you are young, you think about parents in one way. As you get older, you think about your parents more.'' **********Like so many other divided families, Mr. Min still struggles with guilt. ''At that time, it was a matter of life and death,'' he said, recalling his decision to flee south. ''I don't know whether I did the right thing by leaving them, but I couldn't stay there either. I thought I would come back.'' **********Lee Bong Sook, too, thinks of what might have been. She is looking for her three daughters. Early in the war, when Seoul was under constant bombardment from the North, Mrs. Lee left the city for a few days on business. She returned to a house reduced to rubble, no husband, and no children. She believes that the house was destroyed in a bombing raid and that her children must have fled north, where their grandparents lived. **********She has searched for them without success in the South, so she believes they are somewhere in the North. ''They must be alive,'' said Mrs. Lee, who came to Seoul from the United States when she heard that the Red Cross was accepting applications for reunions. ''Since they were girls, I believe they did not die in the war.'' Reunification Is Goal **********Mr. Min and Mrs. Lee share the ardent nationalism and deep attachment to the land of their ancestors that is fueling the excited talk of reunification. It is an almost universal goal, endorsed by 88 percent of people polled by the Korea Political Science Association. According to poll results made public today, 51 percent of those questioned believed Korea should be united because ''the North and South are brethren.'' **********But for many Koreans, as for Mr. Min and Mrs. Lee, reunification is more of an ideal, a yearning to right a historical injustice, than an immediate possibility. **********''I don't know much about politics,'' said Mrs. Lee, her voice rising in anger. ''But these people don't seem to know about Communism. There is a vast difference between our ideology and theirs, so reunification is impossible.'' **********Mr. Min listened quietly, and gently shook his head. ''We have to follow the tide of the time,'' he told her, noting that many Communist nations have begun to reach out to capitalist societies, and that East-West tensions are easing. ''We should not just insist on our experience of the past. Both sides should be more flexible.'' **********One day perhaps, say Mr. Min and his wife, Kim Joong Won, they can visit their hometowns in the North. Mrs. Kim said she thinks of her town on holidays like the harvest festival when Koreans traditionally visit ancestors' graves to pay homage. **********''I want to go and see where I lived,'' she said. ''But I don't want to live there.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/29/business/executive-changes-187688.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-12-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 326, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "body_text": " *********** Brush Wellman Inc., Cleveland, a metal and ceramics maker, said Raymond A.

Trump, the real estate developer, agreed to buy the Eastern Airlines shuttle yesterday for $365 million in cash and said he would rename it after himself and turn it into a ''diamond.'' **********''I want to run it immaculately clean,'' Mr. Trump said at a news conference at the Plaza Hotel. He said the 17 aging Boeing 727's that he acquired ''will be immaculate, they'll be well run, they'll be on time.'' **********Frank Lorenzo, chairman of the Texas Air Corporation, Eastern's corporate parent, called Mr. Trump's deal a coup and said those flying the Trump shuttle would retain all of their frequent flier benefits. No Shuttle Job Losses Seen **********He also said that no Eastern employees associated with the shuttle would lose their jobs and that there would be close marketing ties between the new shuttle and Eastern and Continental Airlines, which is also owned by Texas Air. **********Mr. Lorenzo was able to get clauses in the deal that will tie Mr. Trump's hands for as long as 15 years should he want to sell the shuttle. Attorneys involved in the deal, which was not signed until about 10 minutes before this morning's news conference, said that Mr. Trump could not sell the shuttle to a non-airline investor for five years without Eastern's getting the right of first refusal. **********The agreement also prevents Mr. Trump from selling the shuttle to an airline for 10 years. For five years after that, Mr. Trump cannot sell the shuttle without giving Eastern the right of first refusal. Dominance Protected **********Mr. Lorenzo has thus protected himself against a major carrier, like Delta or American, significantly expanding its presence in the New York market. Both airlines have expressed an interest in buying the shuttle in the past. Mr. Lorenzo maintains his dominance in the New York area, where both Eastern and Continental are major carriers. **********''American Airlines would pay very dearly to have a shot at this operation,'' said Thomas Pettee, the airline analyst for Bear, Stearns & Company. ''That wouldn't have been in Texas Air's interests, to sell it to a direct competitor.'' **********While other analysts said that Mr. Trump had paid a premium price, they added that he got Eastern's most valuable asset. This year the shuttle is expected to earn $30 million to $35 million before taxes. **********Mr. Trump now owns two of New York's institutions: the Plaza, for which he paid about $395 million, and the Eastern shuttle, which was founded in 1961 and has carried about 70 million travelers since then between New York, Washington and Boston. **********In a triumphant mood, Mr. Trump, whose wife, Ivana, stood nearby, said that he might consider buying new planes for the shuttle in the future. He said that he was thinking about creating new air service to Atlantic City, where he owns two hotel-casinos. He said the most likely plan would be to shift some planes to Atlantic City service on weekends when traffic on the shuttle is light but travel to Atlantic City is at its peak. **********Mr. Lorenzo is handing over an operation that has already been refurbished by Eastern. The shuttle now serves food and drinks and is sprucing up its terminals. New uniforms for its employees will appear before Mr. Trump takes over the operation Dec. 15. Subject of Safety Investigation **********The Eastern shuttle now competes with the Pan Am shuttle, which was gaining market share last summer when Eastern was the subject of a safety investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration and the Department of Transportation was looking into the management capabilities of Texas Air's executives. **********The sale will bring a huge infusion of cash to Eastern, which has been losing money. It also gives the airline a cash war chest of more than $700 million to use in its nine-month struggle with the airline's machinists' union. The union's contract has expired and Mr. Lorenzo has made it clear he will try to keep the airline flying should the confrontation with the union eventually lead to a strike. **********Mr. Lorenzo expressed frustration yesterday with the National Mediation Board, which under the National Railway Labor Act has overseen the bargaining between the airline and the union. Eastern wants the board to declare an impasse and start a 30-day clock ticking. If no agreement has been reached at the end of this cooling-off period, Eastern would be free to impose new wages, benefits and work rules and the union would be free either to accept them or strike. **********The position of Mr. Lorenzo and Eastern management has been that Charles Bryan, the leader of District 100 of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, will not begin serious bargaining until the board declares the impasse and the 30-day period begins. **********The sale of the shuttle has already escalated the bitter battle between the Eastern's major unions and Mr. Lorenzo. **********Joseph Guerreri, an attorney representing the Eastern machinists' union, said yesterday that he was readying a request to the Federal District Court in Washington to grant an injunction against the sale. The chances of success for such an action are considered slim. **********Ron Cole, a spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association at Eastern, said that his union also opposed the sale and would take whatever legal means possible to stop it. **********Mr. Lorenzo also confirmed yesterday reports that Carl C. Icahn, the chairman of Trans World Airlines, has expressed an interest in buying Eastern and that he had requested permission to put a proposal before the Texas Air board."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/17/world/botha-pressing-drive-by-pretoria-meets-with-ivory-coast-president.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-10-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 342, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Botha, Pressing Drive by Pretoria, Meets With Ivory Coast President", "print_headline": "Botha, Pressing Drive by Pretoria, Meets With Ivory Coast President", "body_text": " **********President P.

The South African Government has linked its acceptance of Nov. 1 as the date for starting a United Nations peace plan leading to independence for South-West Africa, the territory widely known as Namibia, to prior agreement on a Cuban withdrawal. **********Under the United Nations plan, South Africa would withdraw its troops from Namibia and elections would be held on June 1, 1989. **********But hope is waning among diplomats here that the Nov. 1 deadline can still be met for setting in motion the United Nations independence process. One Deadline Missed **********At three days of talks here late last month, representatives of the three countries could not agree on a timetable for a Cuban withdrawal and thus failed to meet the Sept. 1 deadline set in Geneva for reaching an acceptable schedule. **********But the talks narrowed the gap between the South African position of a withdrawal over seven months (from Nov. 1) and the Cuban-Angolan position of a four-year time frame for withdrawal. The new goal sought by South Africa is one year; the Cuban-Angolan position is three. **********South Africa announced Aug. 30 that it had completed the withdrawal of its estimated 2,000 troops from southern Angola, beating a Sept. 1 deadline. **********Guerrillas of the South-West Africa People's Organization, who are not a party to the talks, announced that they would join the cease-fire Sept. 1 by halting hostilities in their long bush war against South African forces. **********Under the agreement, they must withdraw to bases in southern Angola, about 100 miles north of the Namibian border. **********The main reason the parties have become bogged down on the Cuban withdrawal issue appears to be that Angola fears it will not be able to contain rebels which are armed by South Africa and the United States. **********Under the peace agreement, South Africa has had to withdraw its troops aiding the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, the rebel group led by Jonas Savimbi. **********Recent statements by high-ranking South African officials indicate that they are not willing to see the rebels overrun by the Cuban and Angolan troops. **********Since the last talks here two weeks ago, the South Africans have called attention to reports that Cuba has built up its forces in southern Angola - to more than 50,000, a State Department representative said last Friday.

Botha, addressing a conference of his governing National Party in Bloemfontein, warned that if reports of a large-scale Cuban troop buildup were correct, then South Africa regarded that development as a breach of the set of principles agreed to by the three nations in Geneva. **********His statements appeared to back up an assertion by his Defense Minister, Gen. Magnus A.

More than ever, employees are receiving their job training from videotape along with information about company services, benefits and programs. At a many companies, live broadcasts about late-breaking company news are being transmitted by satellite to television screens in employee gathering areas and coffee rooms. Corporate broadcasts and videotapes vary in content and quality, but most have the same basic purpose - to improve the flow of important information from management to employees. **********Corporate video, like home video, began to grow in popularity in the early 1980's. In the last four years, the corporate video business has roughly doubled, according Douglas Brush of D/J Brush Associates, a research firm in LaGrangeville, N.Y. Mr. Brush estimates corporations will spend about $5.5 billion on video production and equipment this year, an amount that is increasing by about 20 percent annually. **********Len Magsamen, president of the International Television Association, an industry group based in Irving, Tex., attributes much of the growth to new ways of using video. Companies have gone far beyond showing training tapes, Mr. Magsamen said: ''Today, they're doing video conferencing, interactive video, and they are even using video to market and sell products to the public.'' Mr. Magsamen predicted that video ''will continue to become an integral part of the corporate culture.'' **********Companies have been pouring money into video budgets recently, with some large ones spending half a million dollars or more annually. But there are signs that budgets are tightening. ''Mergers and cutbacks are starting to have an effect,'' Mr. Brush said. As a result, he said, some video services that had been performed in-house - such as editing and production - are now being contracted to outside specialists. Anticipating this trend, the public relations company Burson-Marsteller this month opened a $5 million ''Telemedia Center'' to provide a full range of video services for clients. **********Budgetary pressures aside, most companies are committed to video. Some companies have invested millions in equipment for in-house networks, while others have built elaborate video production studios. Professional actors and directors are often used, as well as the latest special effects. The result is programming that can, at times, rival commercial television in quality. Said Linda Evans, head of corporate video at the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, ''We want the quality of our productions to equal what people are seeing on TV at home.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/04/business/credit-markets-prices-of-treasuries-show-gains.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1988-11-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 880, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Prices of Treasuries Show Gains", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; Prices of Treasuries Show Gains", "body_text": " **********Prices of Treasury notes and bonds climbed as much as a half-point yesterday, buoyed by a firm dollar and a drop in commodity prices. **********A number of market participants also cited action by the Federal Reserve Board, which aggressively added reserves to the banking system to prevent the overnight Federal funds rate from rising further, as a positive factor. **********''All the little pieces came together for the market,'' said James R.

Most market participants had assumed that in its announcement on Wednesday the Treasury would have set a date and made the sale contingent on President Reagan's signing the bill.

Meanwhile, the 9 percent five-year notes were offered at 102 15/32, up one-eighth of a point, to yield 8.37 percent. Short-Term Rates Fall **********Short-term Treasury bill rates also declined.

Six-month bills were offered at 7.45 percent, down three basis points. **********In advance of next week's refinancing auctions, the three-year notes to be sold on Tuesday were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 8.30 percent.

The rate was the highest on three-month bills since the 6.84 average rate brought at the auction held when the markets plunged last Oct. 19. **********Meanwhile, six-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 6.41 percent yesterday, up from 6.28 percent last week. **********Analysts said the recent rise in short-term rates, if sustained, was likely to prompt commercial banks to lift the prime lending rate, now at 8.5 percent. **********One regional bank, Riggs National Bank in Washington, raised its prime on Friday by one-fourth of a percentage point, to 8 3/4 percent. **********''Since the beginning of March interest rates on three-month certiticates of deposit have risen by about 50 basis points,'' or half a percentage point, to about 7.10 percent, Mr. Robertson said. **********''If that rate sticks around this level, I would think other banks will move to raise the prime,'' he added. **********Activity in the secondary market for corporate and tax-exempt municipal bonds was limited, with little or no movement in prices. **********There was virtually no activity in the new-issue market, although professionals said that corporate bond desks were flooded with inquiries from potential issuers.

The announcement came one day after the Mexican Senate approved a request to begin operating the plant, but before the lower house of the Mexican Congress had given its formal approval. **********The Government action, which comes at a time of unusual political ferment in Mexico, has been denounced as irresponsible by leading ecologists and opposition parties of the right and the left. A national coalition of some 80 ecological groups set up a permanent vigil outside the reactor site this week and called for a series of demonstrations at the plant beginning Sunday and for protest marches in Mexico City. **********''The struggle has been joined,'' said Homero Aridjis, president of the Group of 100, an organization of prominent intellectuals and artists active on ecological issues. ''The ecological movement is going to do everything within its power to prevent and impede the functioning of this plant, including civil disobedience if necessary.'' Troops at the Plant **********Since Monday, according to ecology groups in Veracruz, Mexican Army troops have been deployed around the plant, just outside the hamlet of Palma Sola about 45 miles north of the port of Veracruz. Other army units have been sent to towns and villages in the vicinity of the plant, they also said. On Friday night the troops were reported to have prevented a local town assembly from convening to discuss the Government's approval of the reactor. **********''The local population is quite alarmed, and there is a generalized discontent throughout the state,'' Dr. Thomas Berlin Schaller, president of the Veracruz Ecological Group and professor of urban planning at Veracruz University in Xalapa, said in a telephone interview Friday. ''It appears that the Government has decided there is no turning back.'' **********When first envisioned in the mid-1960's, the Laguna Verde plant was expected to cost $550 million and to become the cornerstone of a program of at least eight reactors. But cost overruns, a decade of delays and heavy interest payments on the foreign debt have pushed the cost of the project above $3.5 billion and have contributed to the shelving of plans for other plants. **********Popular opposition to the plant, which grew dramatically after the Chernobyl disaster in the Soviet Union in 1986, has centered on technical and economic questions. Critics of the project say that the plant is in an earthquake and volcano zone, that there has been no decision made as to where to store radiocative wastes and that each kilowatt of electricity at the nuclear plant will cost double that produced in plants using oil. Concerns About Plant **********Government officials do not dispute the cost calculations, but argue that with so much money spent, it would be foolish to abandon the plant. As for the doubts about safety, Rafael Fernandez de la Garza, director of the project, said this week that ''it would be ridiculous to attempt to set up a plant like Laguna Verde if we couldn't count on the technical capacity to operate it in a secure and efficient manner.'' **********But concerns in Vera Cruz about the project increased after a gas pipeline explosion there in late August that killed 11 people. The gas pipeline passes within 1,000 feet of the Laguna Verde plant and is operated by the state oil company Pemex, which has been widely criticized as a result of several major accidents in recent years that have resulted in millions of dollars of damages and the loss of dozens of lives. **********To foes of Laguna Verde, such incidents raised doubts about the Mexican Government's ability to operate the nuclear plant safely. In its official statement late Friday, the Ministry of Energy and Mines said Laguna Verde ''will not present problems to the health and well-being of the population'' and also said the federal Government ''fully guarantees the operating security of the plant.'' **********There is also irritation that the Government apparently decided to start up the plant, which has been ready to start up for several months, only after local elections were held in Vera Cruz on Oct. 3. Dr. Berlin said ''the Government changed its attitude once the elections were out of the way, taking a much harder position'' and rejecting longstanding demands by ecology groups and opposition parties that the project be submitted to a popular referendum."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/19/business/careers-summer-jobs-in-right-line-hard-to-find.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-04-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 650, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Careers; Summer Jobs in Right Line Hard to Find", "print_headline": "Careers; Summer Jobs in Right Line Hard to Find", "body_text": " **********FOR a college student, a career-related summer job is ideal, but such a job may be harder to find this year, one expert says. **********Vicki Lynn, director of the career development center at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., has discovered that fewer summer jobs of this kind are available, particularly for some students with a B average or less. **********There are alternatives, however. Construction jobs pay high hourly rates, sales jobs can provide good commissions and hotel work offers a chance at occasionally lavish tips. Working as an office ''temporary'' can provide a taste of business and possibly a door to a full-time job later. Some lower-paying alternatives include serving as a lifeguard or working at a supermarket. **********Mrs. Lynn gave some reasons for the difficulty in finding summer employment that is career-oriented. **********''Many employers feel obligated to offer summer jobs to sons and daughters of their employees,'' she said in an interview last week. ''Then, if other summer jobs are available, they are offered to women and minorities.'' And many companies, she said, insist that their few career-related summer jobs go to students with high grades. **********The problem can be serious for those with lower marks. When the time comes to seek good jobs after graduation, they will find it quite helpful if they can mention pertinent summer work on their resumes. **********About 80 percent of Rensselaer's students find career-related work experience, though not necessarily during the summer, Mrs. Lynn said. About 15 percent of that 80 percent can be described as co-op students -those who work for a company for a semester or so while they continue to take courses. **********Because many students cannot find career-related summer jobs, she said, ''I hire on a year-round basis'' for the placement center at Rensselaer. Some part-time students handle computer work in the office. **********Students can advance in their field of interest by working for professors on projects - sometimes being paid for their efforts. In some cases they volunteer for research, both to gain the experience (which looks good on a resume) and to earn a recommendation from a professor. **********''The colleges are looking at many extracurricular ways to transfer skills,'' Mrs. Lynn said. ''I think more and more colleges are encouraging their own campus research projects to help students gain experience. It is self-serving in a way because the professors get the help they need at minimal cost. Some students even work as volunteers. In fact, I see a reawakening of volunteer work.'' **********Mrs. Lynn praised Cornell University's two-year-old program, the Cornell Connection, in which the university works with its alumni to find summer jobs for undergraduates. **********While Mrs. Lynn worries about the scarcity of career-related summer jobs, especially for engineering and science students, much summer work of a more general nature is available. **********Officials of Manpower Inc., a nationwide temporary-worker company, talk of a boomlet in summer jobs for college students. **********''We expect another good year,'' Sharon Canter, director of strategic information for Manpower, said last week. The company has about 100,000 temporary jobs available this year. That matches last summer's number and indicates that the nation's economy has not slowed. Summer job salaries range from $5 to $15 an hour, depending on the region. **********''Salaries are slightly ahead of last year, but not significantly,'' said Mitchell Fromstein, president of Manpower. He cited summer job opportunities in Boston. **********''In fact, in the whole of New England from New Haven up to Maine there are many summer jobs,'' Mr. Fromstein said.

The waterway is blocked by eight years of accumulated silt and shipping sunk during the war. **********The Foreign Minister said Iran has agreed only to guarantee Iraqi shipping freedom of navigation, in accordance with international law.

Remarks to Artists **********Well, as Henry VIII said to each of his six wives, ''I won't keep you long.'' . . . . You here, writers, artists, dramatists, musicians of this vast country, are heirs to the seminal figures in many of the arts as they have developed in 20th-century Europe and America. I'm thinking of such giants as Kandinsky, Stravinsky, Stanislavsky, Dostoyevsky, to name a few men whose vision transformed all of ours. **********I've been very impressed with what I've heard just now. For my contribution to this dialogue I thought I would deal here briefly with a question whose answer might open up some new insights for all of us. You see, I've been told that many of you were puzzled that a former actor could become the leader of a great nation, particularly the United States. What does acting have to do with politics and statecraft? **********In looking back, I believe acting did prepare me for the work I do now. There are two things, two indispensable lessons that I've taken from my craft into public life. And I hope you won't think it excessively opportune if I use the words of a Soviet film-maker to explain one of them. It was during the production of ''Ivan the Terrible'' when Eisenstein noted that in making a film, or in thinking through any detail of it - which, to my mind, the acting of a part - in his words, ''The most important thing is to have the vision. The next is to grasp and hold it. You must see and feel what you are thinking. You must see and grasp it. You must hold and fix it in your memory and senses. And you must do it at once.'' **********To grasp and hold a vision, to fix it in your senses, that is the very essence, I believe, of successful leadership. Not only on the movie set, where I learned about it, but everywhere. And, by the way, in my many dealings with him since he became General Secretary, I've found that Mr. Gorbachev has the ability to grasp and hold a vision, and I respect him for that. **********The second lesson I carried from acting into public life was more subtle. And let me again refer to a Soviet artist, a poet, again, one of the world's greatest. At the beginning of ''Requiem,'' Anna Akhmatova writes of standing in a line outside a prison when someone in the crowd recognizes her as a well-known poet. She continues, ''Then a woman standing behind me, whose lips were blue with cold, and who naturally enough had never even heard of my name, emerged from that state of torpor common to us all, and putting her lips close to my ear - there everyone spoke in whispers - asked me, 'And could you describe this?' And I answered her, 'I can.' Then something vaguely like a smile flashed across what once had been her face.'' 'You Get Inside a Character' **********That exchange, ''Can you describe this? I can,'' is at the heart of acting, as it is of poetry and of so many of the arts. You get inside a character, a place, and a moment. You come to know the character in that instant, not as an abstraction, one of the people, one of the masses, but as a particular person yearning, hoping, fearing, loving, a face, even what had once been a face apart from all others. And you convey that knowledge. You describe it. You describe the face. **********Pretty soon, at least for me, it becomes harder and harder to force any member of humanity into a straitjacket, into some rigid form in which you all expect to fit. In acting, even as you develop an appreciation for what we call the dramatic, you become in a more intimate way less taken with superficial pomp and circumstance, more attentive to the core of the soul - that part of each of us that God holds in the hollow of his hand, and into which he breaths the breath of life. . . . **********As I see it, political leadership in a democracy requires seeing past the abstractions and embracing the vast diversity of humanity, and doing it with humility; listening as best you can, not just to those with high positions, but to the cacophonous voices of ordinary people, and trusting those millions of people, keeping out of their way; not trying to act the all-wise and all-powerful; not letting government act that way. And the word we have for this is freedom. **********In the last few years freedom for the arts has been expanded in the Soviet Union. **********We in the United States applaud the new thaw in the arts. We hope to see it go further. . . . We want this not just for your sake, but for our own. We believe that the greater the freedoms in other countries, the more secure both our own freedoms and peace. And we believe that when the arts in any country are free to blossom, the lives of all people are richer. Remarks to Students **********Standing here before a mural of your revolution, I want to talk about a very different revolution that is taking place right now, quietly sweeping the globe without bloodshed or conflict. **********It's been called the technological or information revolution. And as its emblem, one might take the tiny silicon chip no bigger than a fingerprint. One of these chips has more computing power than a roomful of old-style computers. These microcomputers today aid the design of everything from houses to cars to spacecraft. They even design better and faster computers. They can translate English into Russian, or enable the blind to read, or help Michael Jackson produce on one synthesizer the sounds of a whole orchestra. **********But progress is not foreordained. The key is freedom - freedom of thought, freedom of information, freedom of communication. The renowned scientist, scholar and founding father of this university, Mikhail Lomonosov, knew that. ''It is common knowledge,'' he said, ''that the achievements of science are considerable and rapid, particularly once the yoke of slavery is cast off and replaced by the freedom of philosophy.'' **********The explorers of the modern era are the entrepreneurs, men with vision, with a courage to take risks and faith enough to brave the unknown. These entrepreneurs and their small enterprises are responsible for almost all the economic growth in the United States.. . . Some people, even in my own country, look at the riot of experiment that is the free market and see only waste. What of all the entrepreneurs that fail? Learning From Mistakes **********Well, many do, particularly the successful ones, often several times. And if you ask them the secret of their success, they'll tell you it's all that they learned in their struggles along the way. **********Experience is the greatest teacher. And that's why it's so hard for government planners, no matter how sophisticated, to ever substitute for millions of individuals working night and day to make their dreams come true. **********The fact is, bureaucracies are a problem around the world. There's an old story about a town - it could be anywhere - with a bureaucrat who is known to be a good-for-nothing, but he somehow had always hung onto power. So one day, in a town meeting, an old woman got up and said to him, ''There is a folk legend here, where I come from, that when a baby is born, an angel comes down from heaven and kisses it on one part of its body. If the angel kisses him on his hand, he becomes a handyman. If he kisses him on his forehead, he becomes bright and clever. And I've been trying to figure out where the angel kissed you so that you should sit there for so long and do nothing.'' **********Democracy is less a system of government than it is a system to keep government limited, unintrusive, a system of constraints on power to keep politics and government secondary to the important things in life, the true sources of value found only in family and faith. But, I hope you know, I go on about these things not simply to extol the virtues of my own country, but to speak to the true greatness of the heart and soul of your land. **********Let me cite one of the most eloquent contemporary passages on human freedom. It comes not from the literature of America, but from this country, from one of the greatest writers of the 20th century, Boris Pasternak, in the novel ''Doctor Zhivago.'' He writes: **********''I think that if the beast who sleeps in man could be held down by threats, any kind of threat, whether of jail or of retribution after death, then the highest emblem of humanity would be the lion tamer in the circus with his whip, not the prophet who sacrificed himself. **********''But this is just the point: What has for centuries raised man above the beast is not the cudgel, but an inward music, the irresistible power of unarmed truth.'' **********Today the world looks expectantly to signs of change, steps toward greater freedom in the Soviet Union. We watch and we hope as we see positive changes taking place. There are some I know in your society who fear that change will bring only disruption and discontinuity, who fear to embrace the hope of the future. 'Butch Cassidy' Example **********Sometimes it takes faith. It's like that scene in the cowboy movie ''Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,'' which some here in Moscow recently had a chance to see. **********The posse is closing in on the two outlaws, Butch and Sundance, who find themselves trapped on the edge of a cliff with a sheer drop of hundreds of feet to the raging rapids below. Butch turns to Sundance and says their only hope is to jump into the river below. **********But Sundance refuses. He says he'd rather fight it out with the posse, even though they're hopelessly outnumbered. Butch says that's suicide, and urges him to jump. But Sundance still refuses, and finally admits, ''I can't swim.'' Butch breaks up laughing and says, ''You crazy fool. The fall will probably kill you.'' And by the way, both Butch and Sundance made it, in case you didn't see the movie. **********At the same time, we should remember that reform that is not institutionalized will always be insecure. . . . And that is why, in my conversation with General Secretary Gorbachev, I have spoken of how important it is to institutionalize change, to put guarantees on reform. And we have been talking together about one sad reminder of a divided world: the Berlin Wall. **********It's time to remove the barriers that keep people apart. I am proposing an increased exchange program of high school students between our countries. General Secretary Gorbachev mentioned on Sunday a wonderful phrase you have in Russian for this, ''Better to see something once than to hear about it a hundred times.'' **********Words travel lighter, and that's why we'd like to make available to this country more of our 11,000 magazines and periodicals, and our television and radio shows that can be beamed off a satellite in seconds. Nothing would please us more than for the Soviet people to get to know us better and to understand our way of life. **********Your generation is living in one of the most exciting, hopeful times in Soviet history. . . . **********I am reminded of the famous passage near the end of Gogol's ''Dead Souls,'' comparing his nation to a speeding troika. Gogol asks, ''What will be its destination?'' But he writes, ''There was no answer, save the bell pouring forth a marvelous sound.'' . . . In this Moscow spring, this May 1988, we may be allowed that hope, that freedom, like the fresh green sapling planted over Tolstoy's grave, will blossom forth at last in the rich fertile soil of your people and culture. We may be allowed to hope that the marvelous sound of a new openness will keep rising through, ringing through, leading to a new world of reconciliation, friendship and peace.  Questions and Answers  Moderator: Do you think that it'll be possible for you and the General Secretary to get a treaty on the limitation of strategic arms during the time that you are still President?  A. This is a much more complicated treaty than the I.N.F. Treaty, the intermediate-range treaty, which we have signed and which our two Governments have ratified and is now in effect. So there are many things still to be settled. Once we had hoped that maybe, like the I.N.F. Treaty, we would have been able to sign it here at this summit meeting. It is not completed. There are still some points that are being debated. **********We are both hopeful that it can be finished before I leave office, which is in the coming January. But I assure you that if it isn't, I will have impressed on my successor that we must carry on until it is signed. My dream has always been that once we've started down this road, we can look forward to a day . . . when there will be no more nuclear weapons in the world at all.  Students, Then and Now  Q. The student wonders how the youths have changed since the days when you were a student, up till now.  A. Well, I know there was a period in our country when there was a very great change for the worst. When I was Governor of California, I could start a riot just by going to a campus. But that has all changed, and I could be looking out at an American student body as well as I'm looking out here, and would not be able to tell the difference between you. **********And I think there is a seriousness, I think there's a sense of responsibility that young people have, and I think that there's an awareness on the part of most of you about what you want your adulthood to be and what the country you live in, you want it to be.  Q. Mr. President, you have just mentioned that you welcome the efforts aimed at the settlement of the Afghani question, and it might promote the settlement of other regional conflicts. What conflicts do you mean - Central American conflicts, Southeast Asian, or South African?  A. Well, for example, in South Africa, where Namibia has been promised its independence as a nation, it is impossible because of a civil war going on in another country there. And that civil war is being fought on one side by some 30,000 to 40,000 Cuban troops who have gone from the Americas over there and are fighting on one side with one kind of authoritative Government. But what we believe is that those foreign soldiers should get out and let the citizens of that nation settle their problems. Explanation on Nicaragua **********And the same is true in Nicaragua. Nicaragua had a dictator. There was an organization that then was aided by others in the revolution. And they appealed to the Organization of American States for help in getting the dictator to step down, stop the killing, and he did. But the Organization of American States had asked, ''What are the goals of the revolution?'' And they were given in writing. And they were the goals of a pluralistic society . . . And then the one group that was the best organized among the revolutionaries seized power, exiled many of the other leaders, and has its own Government, which violated every one of the promises that had been made. And here again we're trying to encourage the making of those promises come true and letting the people of that particular country decide their fate.  Q. Since your term of office is coming to an end, what sentiment do you experience and whether you feel like if, hypothetically, you can just stay for another term?  A. There has kind of grown a tradition in our country about two terms. It was just a tradition, and then Roosevelt ran the four times, died very early in his fourth term. And suddenly, in the atmosphere at that time, they added an amendment to the Constitution that Presidents could only serve two terms. **********When I get out of office I'm going to travel around . . . and try to convince the people of our country that they should wipe out that amendment to the Constitution because it was an interference with the democratic rights of the people. . . . **********In Hollywood, if you didn't sing or dance, you wound up as an after-dinner speaker. And I didn't sing or dance. So I have a hunch that I will be out on the speaking circuit, telling about a few things that I didn't get done in Government but urging the people to tell the Congress they wanted them done.  Comments on Indians  Q. I heard that a group of American Indians have come here because they couldn't meet you in the United States of America. If you fail to meet them here, will you be able to . . . correct it and to meet them back in the United States?  A. I didn't know that they had asked to see me. . . . I'd be very happy to see them. **********They from the beginning announced that they wanted to maintain their way of life. . . . And we set up these reservations so they could, and have a Bureau of Indian Affairs to help take care of them. At the same time, we provide . . . schools on the reservations. And they're free also to leave the reservations and be American citizens among the rest of us, and many do. . . . **********Maybe we made a mistake. Maybe we should not have humored them in that wanting to stay in that kind of primitive life style. Maybe we should have said, ''No, come join us. Be citizens along with the rest of us.'' **********I'm very pleased to meet with them, talk with them at any time, and see what their grievances are or what they feel they might be. And you'd be surprised. Some of them became very wealthy because some of those reservations were overlaying great pools of oil. And you can get very rich pumping oil. And so I don't know what their complaint might be.  Meeting With Dissidents  Q. Why did you receive yesterday just refuseniks or dissidents? Just what are your impressions from Soviet people?  A. You have to realize that we are a people that are made up of every strain, nationality and race of the world. And the result is that when people in our country think someone is being mistreated or treated unjustly in another country, these are people who still feel that kinship to that country because that is their heritage. **********What I have brought to the General Secretary, and I must say he has been very cooperative about it, I have brought lists of names that have been brought to me that are from people that are relatives or friends that . . . believe that this individual is being mistreated here in this country, and they want them to be allowed to emigrate to our country. Some are separated families. **********Now, I'm not blaming you. I'm blaming bureaucracy. We have the same type of thing happen in our own country, and every once in while somebody has to get the bureaucracy by the neck and shake it loose and say, ''Stop doing what you're doing.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/13/business/more-oil-rigs-in-action.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-12-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 62, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "More Oil Rigs in Action", "print_headline": "More Oil Rigs in Action", "body_text": " **********The number of rigs actively exploring for oil and gas increased by 17 last week, to 922, Baker Hughes Inc. reported today.

There, diplomats said, he was urged to seek a political solution to the long civil war in the country's northern provinces and encouraged to broaden his relations with the West. **********The Ethiopian leader, who holds the rank of lieutenant colonel, said in the interview that neither Ethiopia nor the United States stands to gain from bad relations. He sent a swift and unusually warm message of congratulations to Mr. Bush. **********''I think there is a new opportunity for both of us to improve the situation, particularly for the United States to change its present perceptions,'' Colonel Mengistu said during a two-and-a-half-hour interview Saturday, his first in several years with a Western news organization. Issue of Resettlement **********While emphasizing his desire to improve relations with Washington, Colonel Mengistu turned to the more controversial question of the resettlement of peasants, a policy that the United States has protested as a violation of human rights. **********He said the resettlement - from arid regions to potentially more fertile areas - is now voluntary, but added: ''Supposing it was not voluntary. Is it proper to watch someone die, perching on hills and sitting on parched land? Is it right to watch him die? Are we leading people or destroying people? What is the purpose of a Government or a party unless it provides guidance?'' **********Colonel Mengistu prides himself as a tough soldier and is considered a ruthless leader. He was one of the members of the military committee known as the Dergue that toppled Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974. It has been widely reported that he emerged as the undisputed leader after pushing for the execution of 57 members of the imperial regime, and then later eradicating his major opponents within the revolutionary committee. **********Colonel Mengistu, who is 47 years old, was dressed in a finely tailored royal blue Mao-style suit and smoked an occasional Winston cigarette. He spoke at a gleaming wooden office desk in the heavily guarded modern state building that overlooks the palace of Emperor Mendelik, where as President he now lives. **********Briefly educated in the United States in the late 1960's, where he took military training, he greeted his visitor in English, understanding all the questions in English and laughing at some colloquialisms. But in what was described as an expression of national pride, he spoke in Amharic through an interpreter. Will Press Civil War **********On issues that United States officials say they would like to raise in any renewed discussions with Ethiopia, Colonel Mengistu made these points: *********** Ethiopia would continue to fight the civil war against secessionist forces in Eritrea and Tigre provinces in the north, ''whatever the cost'' and ''whatever the time.'' While the United States supports the territorial integrity of Ethiopia and has not sent arms to the rebels as it has to guerrillas in some other countries - a fact Colonel Mengistu said he appreciated - American officials have said they would like to see new attempts at a resolution of the long-running conflict. *********** A resolution to the war, similar to the talks on Afghanistan, Angola and Cambodia was not possible because Ethiopia's struggle was internal, not regional. *********** A restructuring like the Soviet Union's perestroika is not the answer for Ethiopia as a developing country. ''We must devise our own solutions for these problems,'' he said. American officials have said they would like to see Ethiopia follow a more pragmatic economic policy, particularly in agriculture. At a Central Committee meeting earlier this month, Colonel Mengistu, deploring the ''unhealthy trend'' of the economy, said private enterprise would be allowed in some sectors, including large-scale agriculture on undeveloped land. *********** The resettlement of peasants will continue, although he said there had been faults with the program in the past. ''Transportation may have been inadequate, so aging and starved people may have perished on the way,'' he said. In all, about 7 million of Ethiopia's 48 million people would probably be relocated, he added. *********** Improved relations with the United States, which were downgraded when Ethiopia asked for the recall of the American ambassdor in 1980, should be made ''in phases, step by step.'' On U.S. Relations **********''Before anything else, like any economic assistance I think the first prerequisite for harmonious relations is to create the will and understanding to overcome the crisis of confidence between our two countries,'' he said. **********Relations between the United States and Ethiopia fell apart in 1977 when Ethiopia received military aid from the Soviet Union to help it fight its civil war and to repel an invasion by neighboring Somalia. Until then, the United States had been the main provider of arms, even after the 1974 revolution. **********''We did not expect the United States to impose an arms embargo on us -that was a big blow for us and something under which we were smarting for a long time,'' he said. Had he overcome those feelings? ''Oh yes, we have,'' he said, adding, ''We have found another solution,'' a reference to the Soviet Union. ''So this we consider a bygone thing.'' **********Three months ago, Colonel Mengistu met here in a friendly session with former President Jimmy Carter, in whose early days in the White House the breach occurred. Both men are said to have expressed regret and in the interview, Colonel Mengistu, referred to the hard feelings with America as ''something that happens between two countries, as it does between members of a family. **********''If there had been enough contact and were better communications between the two countries,'' he continued, ''some of those things that unfortunately took place would not have happened.'' Experiences in America **********Under Haile Selassie, Colonel Mengistu was sent to the United States in 1967 for military training. He said he spent 18 months at the Aberdeen Proving Ground outside Washington, and took extra courses at the University of Maryland. **********It has been written that the young officer came away with bitter impressions of the United States, an attitude he expressed in leanings toward the Soviet Union in the early days after the 1974 revolution. **********Since taking power, he has never visited Western Europe or the United States, canceling a proposed visit to address the United Nations when he was head of the Organization of African Unity. Many Western officials complained of a lack of gratitude at the outpouring of aid that helped Ethiopia during the 1984-85 drought and famine. **********Asked what his personal sentiments were toward the United States, he replied: ''This is a very, very direct question. The attitude of the Ethiopian people to the people of the United States is on the whole one of respect, affection and I must say even indebtedness. **********''Of course, the difficulty lies when it comes to executing and doing what the United States wants us to do. Because this goes to the heart of the matter. We feel we are a sovereign state and not acting on the bidding of anyone, so this is a source of the trouble.'' Admiration and Misgivings **********For himself, Colonel Mengistu said, he viewed with ''admiration the material achievement of the people of the United States, also the cultural and intellectual achievements.'' **********He said he had made ''very good friends who took me to their homes.'' He pointed out that he was in the United States during the civil rights battles, a period when ''I have witnessed myself some lamentable things.'' **********''It was a paradox for me when I was in the United States to note that a country with great achievement of science and technology, where production forces are highly developed and where society is really enlightened, that the civil rights of some of the people were not respected. That this paradox should take place was a source of particular regret and sorrow for me.'' **********But he added: ''That was in those days and things have changed, many years have elapsed.'' **********On the question of big-power help in resolving the Ethiopian civil war, which Colonel Mengistu conceded for the first time was costing 50 percent of the country's budget, he was adamant. **********''I would like to be quite specific -the Angola, Afghanistan and Cambodia cases - the solutions that have been used to solve the problems in those countries have no application in our case,'' he said. Avoiding Catastrophe **********In defending the programs of resettlement, under a system in which scattered peasant families are moved to new groupings of homes, Colonel Mengistu said these two programs were designed to bring about rational land use. **********The first phase of resettlement took place during a ''catastrophe of huge proportions,'' he said, a reference to the 1984 famine. What other country, he asked, had attempted an operation where ''under a year, 150,000 hectares had been developed and the lives of millions of people saved.'' **********The involuntary resettlement program in 1985 and the roughshod way people were moved brought loud condemnation of Ethiopia in the West. Now, he said, such moves were voluntary. **********When asked whether he would visit the United States, Colonel Mengistu gave his only English reply: ''Why not?'' **********But in reality, he suggested that a lot still had to be accomplished. **********''The laying of the groundwork is a big leap - a leap forward,'' he said. ''Once this is achieved, we can be free to develop our relations, step by step, in any direction.'' Conflicts **********Secessionists in Eritrea, the Red Sea coastal region in the north, pose the greatest threat to central authority in Addis Ababa. The war between the Eritrean People's Liberation Front and the Ethiopian Army has taken hundreds of thousands of lives, and the end is not in sight. Another separatist guerrilla group is active in the neighboring province of Tigre. **********Hostilities with Somalia over the Ogaden border region broke out in 1977, when the Somalians seized the disputed semi-desert region. Ethiopia recaptured the region, and the two countries opened talks about normalizing relations in 1986.  Economy **********Coffee is Ethiopia's most important cash crop, but it is the devastation of food crops by recurring drought that has attacted greatest international attention. Famine has caused immense refugee problems as people flood the cities, seeking food. Famine and sectarian fighting have caused an estimated one million people to flee the country altogether.  History **********Ethiopia, a nation of 48 million people, is one of the world's longest-surviving civilizations. Modern Ethiopia dates to 1896, when Emperor Menelik II repelled an Italian invasion from Eritrea and consolidated the country. His cousin, Ras Tafari Makonnen, became regent for his daughter at Menelik's death, and when the Empress died in 1930, he proclaimed himself Emperor Haile Selassie. Mussolini's invaders forced him to flee the country in 1935, but he returned in 1941 after the Italians were defeated by British troops. Haile Selassie was awarded Eritrea in 1952. **********In 1974, he was deposed in a military coup by leftist officers. One of them, Lieut. Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam, consolidated control in 1977, killing remaining rivals for power. Authoritarian rule in the following decade - along with the miseries of drought, famine and sectarian strife - left the country hobbled. Colonel Mengistu has received billions of dollars in Soviet military and economic assistance.  Demography **********The dominant Ethiopian people are the Amhara of the central highlands. But there are roughly 40 other tribes. The population is mostly rural and, in the best of times, one of poorest in the world. After the revolution, the illiteracy rate was cut from more than 90 percent to less than 40 percent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/02/world/13-killed-in-blaze-at-bangkok-hotel.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "1988-01-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 466, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "13 KILLED IN BLAZE AT BANGKOK HOTEL", "print_headline": "13 KILLED IN BLAZE AT BANGKOK HOTEL", "body_text": " **********At least 13 people died and 36 were injured when a fire destroyed a tourist hotel early today.

''The others, though slightly higher than I expected, were not strong in comparison with past years' results.'' **********With the Dow Jones industrial average plummeting by 101.46 points, the Tribune Company's shares fell $1.50, to $39.125, on the New York Stock Exchange.

Knight-Ridder's shares fell $1.125, to $40.375, and Gannett fell 75 cents, to $33.625. ---- Tribune Company The Chicago-based Tribune Company reported a 100 percent gain in its net income per share, to 42 cents from 21 cents. Revenues for the quarter rose 9 percent, to $522 million, and operating profit climbed 63 percent, to $66.4 million. **********The most dramatic gains came from the Tribune Company's newsprint operations, which posted a 79 percent gain in operating profit, to $23 million, and a 20 percent gain in revenue, to $109 million. The company attributed the jump to higher newsprint prices and improvements in its operations. **********In newspaper publishing, the company said its operating profit rose 22 percent, to $51.8 million. It attributed much of the gain to higher revenues and labor savings from The Daily News. In 1987, the company took an aftertax charge of $11 million for severance pay for employees terminated from the Daily News. **********However, the broadcasting and entertainment group reported a $3.5 million operating loss, compared with a $10.1 million loss in 1987, on a 7 percent gain in revenues, to $91 million. Higher revenues, coupled with lower administrative and marketing costs, accounted for the rise. ---- Gannett The Gannett Company said its earnings per share rose 39 percent, to 46 cents from 33 cents, in the first quarter. Revenues for the quarter rose 8 percent, to $757.9 million. **********The company's results were favorably affected by a one-time gain on the sale of Gannett's 20 percent stake in the Cowles Media Company, a Minneapolis-based publishing and broadcasting concern. Gannett sold its stock for $128 million in early February and realized a $45 million gain. **********As a result, nonoperating income for the quarter was $11.9 million, compared with nonoperating expense of $20 million in 1987. Operating income was down 4 percent, to $112.2 million from $117 million. **********In newspaper publishing, the company said that advertising linage increased 4 percent in the quarter, reflecting continuing gains in classified advertising.

He is a lover of Shakespeare who enjoys reciting soliloquies from ''Hamlet'' for a visiting reporter. But Mr. Hani has proved no less adroit at surviving several assassination attempts against him. **********He displays an ability to combine his intellectual interests and dynamism with a ruthlessness that becomes apparent in the methods he advocates to rid South Africa of apartheid. **********Mr. Hani and Umkhonto we Sizwe - Spear of the Nation - advocate intensified attacks in South African population centers and on white security policemen, politicians and judges who serve the white Government. His message unnerves political leaders of the black nationalist group who want to retain recently achieved support for the congress in Western countries. **********Politically, he shares the congress's longtime preference for negotiation. He says the guerrillas would like to stop fighting - if there is a genuine settlement, one that establishes democracy. Some Sympathy for Victims **********While eschewing deliberate attacks on civilian targets, Mr. Hani said he regretted the death of white civilians, but added that whites had been complacent for too long. **********''I don't think most whites want to die for apartheid,'' he said in an interview here. ''Our intention is to make them see, so that when they are maimed and they are in hospital, others will go there to visit them and will say: this is the price of apartheid, ''How long are they going to sacrifice loss of limb to maintain a system that deprives the overwhelming majority of the right to vote, the right to a proper house, to proper medical attention, to education?'' he asked. **********As the Pretoria Government has tightened its hold on dissent under an emergency decree that is now two years old, it has sealed off many political avenues of protest. This, in turn, has driven more frustrated blacks toward the 27-year-old ''armed struggle'' of the congress, an organization that is outlawed in South Africa. Position of Power **********This shift has moved Mr. Hani, who is 45 years old, into one of the most powerful and visible positions in the guerrilla movement. **********It has even made him a future contender for the congress leadership, though the succession odds are still in favor of the organization's director of information and publicity, Thabo Mbeki, a soft-spoken diplomat and contemporary. The African National Congress is now led from headquarters here in Lusaka by Oliver Tambo, who is in his 70's; its formal chairman, Nelson R. Mandela, has been imprisoned in South Africa for a quarter of a century. **********Chris Hani, as the guerrilla leader is widely known, was born in Cofimvaba, a town in what is now the nominally independent Transkei. His father, Gilbert Hani, was a construction worker who migrated to Cape Town and lived in a primitive men's hostel, leaving his family behind. The younger Mr. Hani said the poor conditions in which his father had to live and work affected his own outlook. **********He attended a Roman Catholic school up to the age of 12. ''I wanted to be a priest,'' he said, ''but my father intervened and said no. I was angry, and reacted to his order by turning my back on the church.'' Schooling, Law, Commitment **********He attended Fort Hare University, a black institution but graduated in 1962 from the predominantly white Rhodes University in the eastern region of Cape Province with a degree in Latin and English. He studied law and went to work as an clerk with a law firm in Cape Town. There, he joined the congress's underground and left South Africa a year later. He has lived in exile since, except for infiltrating back for a year to set up the congress's organization in Cape Province, In the last five years, Mr. Hani has played a key role in the political education of an estimated 8,000 guerrillas in training camps in northern Angola. **********He is credited with raising the morale of impatient guerrillas who may wait years before being assigned on missions inside their country, where they face the prospect of death or imprisonment at the hands of South African forces. Educating New Guerrillas **********Mr. Hani has also been instrumental in the congress's tactical shift from reliance on infiltrated saboteurs to a ''people's army,'' in which the infiltrated instructors become the officer corps to train recruits inside South Africa. **********''We want to build up the people's army of the future, training our people in guerrilla warfare,'' he said. ''They will be the nucleus of a post-liberation army.'' Mr. Hani did not say how successful overall this new strategy had been, though he did express satisfaction with the number of men recruited from inside South Africa and the support they are receiving from the country's black population. **********Statistics published in South Africa show that the number of bombings by African National Congress guerrillas inside the country have increased fourfold since 1985. Since the beginning of April, a spate of bombings in Pretoria, Johannesburg and Soweto have killed at least four civilians and wounded or maimed 25 more. A Few Black Victims **********The group's political leadership has expressed reservations about some of these attacks, but Mr. Hani and some other military leaders are not prepared to condemn the actions of their soldiers. **********Congress policy dictates that guerrilla attacks should be directed at economic, military and police targets and that civilian deaths should be avoided where possible. **********In 1985, the rebel group began to target white farmers in northern border areas. Its political leadership has never endorsed the assassination of legislators and judges. **********Speaking of the toll that its guerrilla violence has exacted on fellow blacks, Mr. Hani said: ''I know that a few blacks were maimed in a recent land mine blast in eastern Transvaal Province. ''Their response was, 'I am sorry that I lost a leg but I know that the action was not intended for me.'"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/20/business/talking-deals-why-pillsbury-added-advisers.html": {"writer_name": "Alison Cowan", "pub_date": "1988-10-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 918, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Talking Deals; Why Pillsbury Added Advisers", "print_headline": "Talking Deals; Why Pillsbury Added Advisers", "body_text": " **********PILLSBURY is getting ready to call on a bevy of Wall Street experts to defend itself against the surprise takeover offer from Grand Metropolitan P.L.C., according to a filing late Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. **********At some expense, Pillsbury has raised the number of its investment banks to four from the United States and one from Britain over the last year.

The Minneapolis food giant did not disclose what it agreed to pay its various advisers at Kekst & Company, the Carter Organization, Carter Valin Pollen, LEK Partnership and Morrow & Company. **********Investment bankers involved in the deal defend the fees as comparable to those paid after the conclusion of the Campeau Corporation's acquisition of Federated Department Stores, another situation involving several investment banking firms. **********Privately, however, the bankers lament having to share the client's business and the risk of losing the client altogether down the road. ''It's very common these days to have at least two bankers and it's becoming more common to have more than two,'' one banker in the Pillsbury group said. ''None of us like it, but that's reality.'' There is no question that the trend toward multiple bankers is growing. And as Dominic Solly, a merger specialist at Kleinwort Benson, said, ''Cross-border transactions do tend to have more advisers.'' **********Still, Pillsbury's hiring of five firms took some of Wall Street by surprise. ''I think it probably is a record,'' said Robert W. Willard, head of mergers and acquisitions at Prudential-Bache Securities. **********''They may be looking for a blast of ideas,'' said Dwight B. Crane, a Harvard Business School professor and co-author of ''Doing Deals,'' a recent book about investment banking. ''The other thing is they're taking a lot of talent away from the other side.'' He stopped short, however, of saying this would be a winning strategy. **********Philip Keevil, head of mergers and acquisitions at S. G. Warburg, which along with Morgan Stanley & Company is representing Grand Metropolitan, said that such alliances could be ''notoriously difficult.'' He added: ''The egos are so big. Trying to get four advisers all in the ring at once and letting them all have their say must complicate things.'' **********Kleinwort's hiring is the easiest to decipher. Grand Metropolitan must seek the approval of its own shareholders and must comply with London Stock Exchange procedures to follow through on its offer. So Kleinwort can provide Pillsbury with invaluable advice about British business practices. **********It is less clear why the assistance of four United States investment bankers was needed and what each brings to the party. Drexel has special expertise in raising subordinated financing, which might become critical in a restructuring or leveraged buyout. And First Boston shares with Wasserstein Pirella, which began life as an offshoot of First Boston, a historic relationship with Pillsbury. **********That still does not explain why Shearson, a firm that had not previously had a major Pillsbury assignment, is on the list, and, say, Merrill Lynch, the firm that has taken Burger King public and done a number of debt financings for Pillsbury, is not. **********A Pillsbury spokesman declined to elaborate or to explain how responsibilites were being divided now among the group. ''All four United States bankers worked on separate assignments and it would be a mistake to prioritize any of them as playing a more important role than any of the others,'' he said. **********But at least one analyst thought the strategy would backfire. ''Pillsbury can hire every corporate finance department on the globe,'' said James J. Murren, a food analyst at C. J. Lawrence. ''I don't see how that protects them from what Grand Met is doing. Every way you slice the numbers, I can't see how internally they can get a better price than $60 cash unless there's some hidden asset there like a gold mine we dont know about.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/01/business/business-people-cullinet-founder-back-as-chairman-and-chief.html": {"writer_name": "John Markoff", "pub_date": "1988-04-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 311, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Cullinet Founder Back As Chairman and Chief", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Cullinet Founder Back As Chairman and Chief", "body_text": " **********John J.

The move by Merabank was the first by an out-of-state institution under a Federal program to help the deeply troubled industry in Texas. The two institutions, First Financial of El Paso and Brownfield Savings of West Texas, together have relatively small assets, $350 million, but Merabank agreed to acquire another $650 million of Texas assets by this fall. Merabank will put up $27.8 million in its first deal and will be protected against losses from taking on bad assets. Gene E.

The counting of ballots cast on June 17 will take weeks, but Mr. Icahn acknowledged losing after the investment firm of Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts said it had voted its 4.9 percent block of stock for management. Mr. Icahn, the oil company's largest shareholder, with a 14.8 percent stake, has made a takeover offer to management but has been rebuffed. He did not say what he might do now, but before the proxy fight he had said that if he lost he might make a hostile tender offer to shareholders or sell his stake. *********** Consumer prices nudged up three-tenths of 1 percent in May, the second month in a row that the rate of inflation has slowed. The rise in April was four-tenths of 1 percent and in March, five-tenths of 1 percent. A big factor in May was apparel, which posted no change in price after sharp rises in the preceding months . . . Orders for durable goods fell 2.2 percent in May, the steepest drop in nine months, with a slump in aircraft orders getting much of the blame. **********The official forecast of 1988 economic growth was revised upward to 3.5 percent, from 2.9 percent. The Reagan Administration also said it expected inflation for the year to hold steady at 4.3 percent. *********** The economic summit conference in Toronto was heavy on optimism and self-congratulation, with the leaders of seven nations saying the outlook is for continued robustness in their economies. They called for the rapidly growing economies of East Asia to take a more responsible role in world financial affairs, hinted that a slightly stronger dollar was acceptable, and supported greater leniency toward the debts of the world's poorest nations. One disappointment for President Reagan was the resistance of the other leaders to his call for a gradual end to the subsidies that nations pay their farmers to support agricultural exports. *********** The dollar had hefty gains, pegged to the signals coming out of the summit conference that a moderate rise would be welcome. The dollar was at its highest since last October against the West German mark, and the highest since mid-March against the yen. The stronger dollar gave a lift to the stock and bond markets, with the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks reaching a post-crash high of 2,152.20 on Wednesday. It backed off some from that level to finish the week at 2,142.96, up 38.94. Farm commodity prices surged early in the week as the drought intensified, but profit taking trimmed the gains somewhat by week's end. Gold prices turned down as the dollar rose. *********** A trade dispute with Japan was settled. After months of talks, the Japanese agreed to end all import restrictions on American beef and oranges in three years and on orange juice in four years. Japan currently takes about $650 million of American beef and oranges each year, and American officials said the accord could mean an additional $1 billion in annual sales for American producers. The total trade deficit with Japan last year was $52 billion. *********** A debt accord between Brazil and its banks was reached. Brazil agreed to bring itself current on its obligations by paying $1.35 billion in overdue interest. The banks agreed to cut the interest rate on Brazilian loans and lend an additional $5.2 billion. The deal would end the moratorium on interest payments that Brazil imposed in February 1987. That halt to payments caused many banks to post losses and the payments now should provide a lift to their profits. *********** Volvo is buying into Hertz. The Swedish auto maker said it would pay Ford $100 million for a 20 percent stake in the car-rental company's parent. Volvo said the deal was primarily an investment. Only about 2 percent of Hertz's rentals are Volvos, but Volvo said it would not put pressure on the company to increase that. *********** Miscellanea.

A proposal to aid the Nicaraguan rebels will be among the issues addressed Tuesday in a scheduled White House meeting including the President and congressional leaders of both parties. 'Time Is Running Out' **********''The point that we will make on the Hill today, and the President will make tomorrow, is that time is running out for the resistance,'' said Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman. ''They're running out of food. They're having problems with their medical supplies.

That request included $3.6 million for weapons and military equipment. **********Mr. Wright, meanwhile, expressed amazement that the contras' supplies of food and clothing could run out so soon and said the Feb. 29 cutoff date had been well known. **********''A wise and prudent course would surely have dictated that they stock them up pretty well before the 29th of February,'' he said. ''That is scarcely two weeks, and it amazes me if they didn't load enough in there prior to this vote.'' Aid Plan Being Prepared **********The White House official, who spoke on the condition he not be identified, said that Lieut. Gen. Colin L. Powell, the national security adviser, other White House aides, and officials from the State and Defense departments are working to ''fashion a package that makes the contras more than refugees.'' **********Congressional sources expressed doubts about the Administration's strategy, saying that a plan that looks first to the Senate for an immediate vote is rife with difficulties. **********At this point - in light of the two defeats in the House - the Senate is more attractive than the House as a starting place for a vote because its rules allow the attachment of amendments to bills without the requirement that the rider be related to the legislation under consideration. However, it is also in the Senate where renewed contra aid, a highly politicized issue, could most easily fall prey to a filibuster. **********Even getting a vote this week in the Senate ''definitely would involve quite an effort,'' said an aide to one Democratic Senator who favors extending United States assistance to the rebels."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/02/business/company-news-wang-to-acquire-convergent-unit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-02-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 116, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Wang to Acquire Convergent Unit", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Wang to Acquire Convergent Unit", "body_text": " **********Wang Laboratories Inc. has agreed to acquire the Informatics Legal Systems subsidiary of Convergent Inc., the companies announced today.

G. Sheppard, has been pursuing the goal since he took the company's helm two years ago. The sale last week of its Inter-Continental Hotel chain for $2.27 billion and then the bid on Tuesday to acquire the Pillsbury Company for $5.23 billion reflect Mr. Sheppard's dual strategy of internal growth and acquisitions. **********Moves toward those goals, notably the $1.2 billion purchase of the Heublein unit of RJR Nabisco Inc. last year, have made Grand Metropolitan one of the largest spirits marketers in the world. It sold an estimated 47.1 million cases of everything from Smirnoff vodka to Bailey's Irish Cream in 1987, according to Impact International, an industry newsletter. Food and Retailing Next **********Now Mr. Sheppard wants Pillsbury to help place Grand Met in a strong position in the other two businesses he has earmarked, food and retailing. (Restaurants are included in the latter category.) ''With Pillsbury, we plan to be not only one of the world's leading drinks companies in the 1990's,'' he said, ''but also one of the world's greatest food companies and leading retailing companies.'' **********Pillsbury was the most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, with five million shares traded. It closed at $58.125, up $1.125. **********If Grand Met succeeds in addingPillsbury, it would make the combined company more than 50 percent larger than it is today, with revenues of about $14.45 billion, Mr. Sheppard said. Moreover, bringing Pillsbury's businesses into the Grand Met fold would greatly even out the weight of the three core businesses. **********Drinks sales as a portion of total business would move to 32 percent from 51 percent. Food, thanks to the Minneapolis company's brands, led by Pillsbury baking products, Green Giant vegetables and Haagen-Dazs ice cream, would rise to 39 percent from 23 percent. And retailing would edge up to 29 percent from 26 percent. **********''It would give us a much better balance,'' Mr. Sheppard said. 'Operation De-clutter' **********The sale of the 100-hotel Inter-Continental chain was the big remaining step in a series of strategic selloffs that Mr. Sheppard is fond of labeling ''operation de-clutter.'' It was the final break with Grand Met's origins in the 1950's, when Sir Max Joseph, the founder, began building the company with a handful of hotels. Once in charge, Mr. Sheppard, who started out as an accountant and spent 18 years in the auto industry with Ford and British Leyland, looked hard at the hotel business. He decided that if Grand Met could not be an international leader, it was best to use its resources elsewhere. ''With 100 hotels, we were still too small,'' he explained. **********In the United States, the company has gone through a similar series of selective acquisitions and divestitures. Among the selloffs were Quality Care, a home health-care company, which was sold for $100 million, and a string of Pepsi-Cola franchises sold for more than $700 million. The purchases, besides Heublein, included a liquor distributor and Pearle Health Services Inc., the nation's largest eyeglass retailer, with 1,000 outlets, which it bought in 1985 for $385 million. **********''Today, Grand Met is a much more focused company than it was a few years ago,'' said Ian A. Martin, chief executive of the company's United States operations. Sees Opportunity in Pillsbury **********In Pillsbury, Mr. Martin sees the opportunity to ''take a company that has been languishing and suffering from a crisis of management and turn it around.'' **********Pillsbury's food business, analysts agree, is an extremely attractive franchise, offering a portfolio of market-leading brands. However, the big Burger King fast-food chain appears to be afflicted with marketing and management problems. Some in the industry have even dubbed its well-known hamburger ''The Flopper.'' **********''Grand Met will be taking on quite a little challenge in Burger King,'' said Eric Frankis, an analyst for Phillips & Drew, a London brokerage. **********Grand Met executives reply that many industry analysts are overstating Burger King's problems. The Burger King franchise, they insist, is fundamentally strong, but the marketing and management strategies have been inept. In particular, Grand Met would get rid of Pillsbury's Distron division, which sells food and other supplies to Burger King outlets. Distron alone is estimated to have lost $10 million last year; Pillsbury's overall earnings fell 62 percent, to $62 million, on sales of $6.19 billion. **********''We've studied Burger King closely,'' Mr. Martin said, ''and we think it is a much healthier business than many people see it to be.'' Growth in Spirits Business **********For its part, Grand Met has shown its ability to increase market share and profitability in the spirits business, an industry that is scarcely growing over all. In the last five years, Grand Met's net income has advanced 66 percent, to $571 million, on a sales increase of 27 percent, to $9.7 billion. So far this year, profits are running more than 30 percent ahead of last year, analysts estimate. **********''We want to take the Pillsbury brands and market them internationally, just as we have done with our spirits business and other businesses,'' Mr. Martin said. **********The global approach to brands is vital if Grand Met is to achieve its other long-term aim of a broader geographical distribution for its business. If the Pillsbury bid succeeds, the company will have a lopsided dependence on Britain and Ireland, with 47 percent of sales, and North America, also with 47 percent. ''We want to spread our business more evenly across North America, Europe and eventually Japan and the Far East,'' Mr. Sheppard said.

Complicating the process is the fact that the two bidders are likely to present sharply different sorts of offers that may not be directly comparable. **********A bidding group led by F. Ross Johnson, RJR Nabisco's chief executive, is likely to bid for just the tobacco interests, not the whole company, people with knowledge of the situation said. A special board committee of RJR Nabisco running the auction said earlier that it might sell off the food businesses and encouraged bidders to consider offers for just the tobacco operations. Securities Worth Less Than Face **********The second bidder, Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, is likely to present an overall bid, but a substantial portion of that will be in securities worth considerably less than their face value, the sources said. Such an offer would not be comparable to a partial offer, making a choice between the two difficult. **********The stock tumbled more than $5 in the morning, to $79, as traders reacted to unsubstantiated rumors that Kohlberg, Kravis was dropping out of the auction process, which requires that all bids be submitted by 5 P.M. today. **********There was also some concern among traders yesterday over lawsuits filed by two big bondholders, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and the ITT Corporation, against RJR Nabisco and its chief executive, F. Ross Johnson. The value of RJR Nabisco has plunged since the first takeover moves were announced in late October.  [ Page D3. ]  On the New York Stock Exchange, trading was halted at 1 P.M. yesterday because of an imbalance of orders that was swamping the specialist handling RJR Nabisco. At the time of the halt, the stock was trading at $80 a share. **********Trading resumed 34 minutes later at $80.75 and the stock gained for most of the afternoon, closing at $82.75, down $1.25. Nearly six million shares changed hands, making it the most active stock on the Big Board. **********On Wednesday, another potential bidder, a group led by Forstmann Little & Company, dropped out of the auction process, sending the stock price lower because of the prospect of less competition. **********People with knowledge of the bid planning said yesterday's rumor about Kohlberg, Kravis was baseless. But the fear that there would be no competition - and hence an offer lower than the expected $21 billion -spooked the market and sent the stock skidding. **********Contributing to the slide were rumors that a special committee of RJR Nabisco directors running the auction would extend the deadline to create more competition. A spokesman for the special committee said that Charles E. Hugel, RJR Nabisco's chairman and head of the group, flatly denied that there would be an extension. **********People with knowledge of the situation said the RJR Nabisco board and its advisers were clearly worried about the prospect of less competition. Some close to the special committee had encouraged more bidders and had encouraged reports that other potential buyers were lurking about. **********The group was extremely disappointed when the Forstmann Little group pulled out, the sources said, both because it raised questions over how serious the group was in the first place and because it sharply reduced the competitive pressures. **********The First Boston Corporation sent a letter earlier to the board saying that it was potentially interested in bidding with an investor group that included the wealthy Pritzker family of Chicago. Some board advisers were eager to make that letter known to create the perception of a bidding battle, but the letter was not taken seriously by those involved in the process because of the limited amount of time the group would have to come up with a proposal, sources said. **********The bids themselves are likely to include several hundred pages of supporting documents, including legal terms for a deal and specifics on how the bidder would pay for the transaction. The special committee is scheduled to meet on Sunday to consider the offers, but no announcement on a deal is expected before Monday at the earliest, sources said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/08/world/administration-begins-talks-on-new-contra-aid-package.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Roberts", "pub_date": "1988-03-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 712, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Administration Begins Talks On New Contra Aid Package", "print_headline": "Administration Begins Talks On New Contra Aid Package", "body_text": " **********The Reagan Administration is working with key lawmakers from both parties to fashion a new proposal for aiding the Nicaraguan rebels, the White House said today. **********Over the weekend, the President talked at length with Representative Robert H.

Boren, an Oklahoma Democrat, about producing an aid package for the contras. **********''We will come up with one,'' said Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman. Mr. Fitzwater did not say when he thought a bipartisan aid package could be arranged. United States aid to the contras was cut off on Feb. 29. Weapons Request Deferred **********For the moment, the spokesman said, the Administration is talking solely about a ''humanitarian package'' that apparently excludes weapons and ammunition. ''We don't want lethal aid,'' he added. **********But in the long run, particularly if peace talks in Central America break down, the Administration still hopes to supply the contras with war-making materiel. **********In a speech today to the Veterans of Foreign Wars, President Reagan clearly implied the Administration's intention to seek renewed military aid. ''It's time for Congress to show that it knows you can't have real peace negotiations when one side has helicopter gunships and the other has bandages,'' he said. **********The latest skirmish in the long-running battle over contra aid was fought last Thursday, when the House narrowly defeated a plan drafted by Democratic leaders to give the contras $30.8 million in aid, exclusively for such items as medicine, food and clothing. The bill lost because some Democrats oppose any aid, while most Republicans considered the package inadequate. **********Mr. Fitzwater said that details of the new plan have not been filled in, but Johanna Schneider, a spokeswoman for Mr. Michel, said the Administration would seek to include two key elements of a Republican version of the Democratic initiative that lost last week. The Central Intelligence Agency, not the Defense Department, would be charged with distributing the aid. And if the peace process collapsed, the President would be assured of a vote on a request for additional aid, including military hardware, later in the year. **********Members of both parties agreed today that the contra aid issue had become highly politicized, and that last week's vote reflected intense partisan maneuvering as the 1988 elections approach. The key difference between the approaches of the two parties last week was that the Republicans wanted to guarantee the President an opportunity as early as April 15 to propose a resumption of military aid to the rebels, while the Democrats sought to leave the initiative with the House Speaker, Jim Wright of Texas. **********The Democrats advanced their proposal only after they had defeated a larger Administration aid request last month. Many moderate Democrats wanted to vote for some form of aid, and Democratic leaders felt it was necessary to provide party members with a positive alternative. **********As Representative Tony Coelho of California, the party whip, said just before last week's vote, the Democrats' package sent the message that ''not only do we want to govern, but we can govern.'' **********Republicans say the chance to embarrass the Democrats politically was a major reason why all but four opposed the plan. By supporting the Democratic initiative, ''all we were doing was providing them political cover,'' Ms. Schneider said. ''Why go along with that?'' **********Mr. Fitzwater asserted today that Democratic leaders ''didn't produce'' on their promise to pass an alternative aid package, and that the Republicans would make that failure an issue ''in the spring campaign, the summer campaign and the fall campaign - and the winter campaign, if you want to go to Nov. 8.'' **********Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, a leading Democratic voice on Central American policy, said the Republicans ''felt that a short-term political gain was worth it.'' **********Mr. Bonior said the Democrats might come up with another proposal of their own, but only after waiting to see how the peace talks in Central America evolve."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/17/business/company-news-british-airways.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-08-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 156, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "British Airways", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; British Airways", "body_text": " **********British Airways P.L.C. said it had placed a $250 million order with the Boeing Company for two additional long-range Boeing 747-400 aircraft.

With toy sales up only 4 percent over last year and with toy advertising expenditures expected to be down about 15 percent, such growth is tantamount to a Christmas miracle. **********Shelly Hirsch, the agency's executive vice president, likes to explain the success by asserting, ''We're not advertising people who do toys -we're toy people who do advertising.'' **********Indeed, the frenetic informality and mile-a-minute banter with which a visitor to Bohbot's lower Madison Avenue offices is greeted underscores that these are ad folk whose hearts and histories are in toy retailing. Ever optimistic, like the children with whom they converse, they believe the toy industry's slump - now in its third year - is actually ending. **********''No one will believe what I'm about to say, but 1989 should be terrific,'' said Allen Bohbot, the agency's chief executive. **********Mr. Bohbot, 34 years old, a quick-lipped Jackie Mason sound-alike from Queens, is celebrating his successful year by changing the name of his agency, which was founded in early 1986 as Bohbot & Cohn. He has further thumbed his nose at the naysayers by announcing that his firm is expanding beyond the secure boundaries of media buying and entering the rough-and-tumble arena of children's television production. **********This morning, the agency expects to sign a licensing agreement to revive the defunct television series ''Bonanza.'' ''Bonanza: The New Breed'' will open in 1989 as an animated series and feature the children of Hoss, Little Joe and the rest of the Ponderosa crowd as modern cowboys. **********Another series, ''Ring Raiders,'' which Mr. Bohbot described as ''an animated 'Top Gun' for kids,'' is being developed in conjunction with Those Characters From Cleveland, the American Greetings Corporation division that delivered unto the world Strawberry Shortcake. Matchbox Toys will create toys based on the show. **********Another series, based on the Western Publishing's Little Golden Books, will have Hasbro as the major toy licensor and sponsor. **********The shop will distribute home video versions of these programs, which will feature two minutes of advertising, half of it reserved for a non-toy marketer. **********''By being involved in the production and distribution of all these shows, we can now go to a toy company and deliver them a product, instead of just handling their advertising,'' Mr. Bohbot explained. **********Mr. Bohbot's bullish expansiveness belies the overall state of toy advertising, which his agency's researchers expect to decline from an estimated $350 million in billings last year. But he believes that the recent video game renaissance will lead to higher advertising expenditures next year. **********In 1983, he pointed out, home video game systems sold about $1.8 billion worth of hardware and software and spent about $150 million on advertising. This year, video game sales should climb to $1.5 billion, led by Nintendo of America. Yet media advertising expenditures in the category will not exceed $30 million. **********''Nintendo has moved its product very carefully and methodically into the stores, and its word-of-mouth is so strong it doesn't need to advertise,'' Mr. Bohbot said.  But next year, the company plans to sell 7.5 million video game systems - up from 7 million in 1988 - and 55 different games, up from 34 this year, and much of it produced by 32 licensees. **********''They will all need to advertise,'' Mr. Bohbot said.  Peter T. Main, Nintendo's vice president for marketing, confirms that ''there will be expanded advertising next year.'' Much of it will be aimed outside Nintendo's main audience of boys aged 8 to 15, directed at adults and at children under the age of 8. **********All told, Mr. Bohbot believes that by next Christmas, video game advertising could reach $100 million. **********''Nineteen-eighty-nine won't be like 1983, but it will be big,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/06/business/legislative-outlook-new-york-state-income-tax-rates-cut.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-03-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 200, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New York State Income Tax Rates Cut", "print_headline": "LEGISLATIVE OUTLOOK; New York State Income Tax Rates Cut", "body_text": " **********The rates will be lowered over a five-year period, and at the same time larger standard deductions will be phased in, as shown below.

The study also indicates that the average award in product-liability and related suits has been rising faster than the gross national product. **********While cases against asbestos manufacturers and the maker of the Dalkon Shield contraceptive device have surged, a variety of other lawsuits have also been filed, against such defendants as auto manufacturers and airlines. **********The numbers do not reflect whether the increased litigation has been harmful or beneficial. Consumer advocates say victims are finding it easier to be compensated for defective products. Representatives of manufacturers cite the trend as part of a crisis that has made insurance more costly and difficult to obtain. **********Justice Richard Neely of the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals is disturbed by the trend, which he says the courts have caused. Judge Neely, a critic of the judicial system, recently completed a book, ''The Product Liability Mess,'' which is scheduled to be published next week by the Free Press, a division of Macmillan Inc. **********In the book, Judge Neely contends that the state courts, including those in West Virginia, are distinctly biased in favor of local plaintiffs and are hostile to the out-of-state companies that are typically defendants. **********''As a state court judge, much of my time is devoted to designing elaborate new ways to make business pay for everyone else's bad luck,'' Judge Neely writes. ''I may not always congratulate myself at the end of the day on the brilliance of my legal reasoning, but when I do such things as allow a paraplegic to collect a few hundred thousand dollars from the Michelin tire company - thanks to a one-car crash of unexplainable cause - I at least sleep well at night.'' **********He suggests that the only workable solution must come from judges, who should strive to unify product-liability laws under one national standard, replacing the current system in which different rules apply in different states. He points to moves by courts to set up minimum national standards in criminal and libel laws as examples to be followed by judges in cases involving defective products. **********On the other hand, Prof. Alan Schwartz says the growing number of product-liability cases can be considered evidence that more people are being compensated for injuries. Mr. Schwartz, a professor at Yale Law School, wrote an article in the most recent issue of the Yale Law Journal proposing several modifications to product-liability law. **********Offering an economic analysis, Professor Schwartz maintains that ''informed consumers,'' if they were aware of the true cost to society of awards for ''pain and suffering,'' would choose a system that sharply limits them. These awards now account for more than 40 percent of the average damages in product-liability cases. **********''When people buy insurance, they tend strongly not to buy it for possible pain and suffering for an injury,'' Professor Schwartz added. ''They prefer instead to get coverage for out-of-pocket losses.'' **********As part of a broad outline of reforms, Professor Schwartz recommended that courts implement a standard scale for pain and suffering damages -one resembling the rules governing workers' compensation. **********Both Congress and the United States Supreme Court are facing opportunities to change the rules for product-liability suits. **********Last week, the House Energy and Commerce Committee began analyzing a Federal product liability proposal supported by some business groups and opposed by three leading consumer groups. By a voice vote, the committee decided to add a provision that would make companies liable if they fail to provide adequate warnings about hazards posed by their products. **********But even if the bill is adopted, some critics warn that businesses would continue to pay a high price for product-liability suits. In a speech prepared for delivery later this summer, Federal Judge Warren W. Eginton said legislative reform would not decrease the costs to businesses by ''one iota.'' **********Judge Eginton, a lawyer who specialized in product liability for 20 years before being elevated to the Federal District Court in Connecticut, said legislation ''will only increase transaction costs and consulting-expert employment.'' **********The United States Supreme Court could wind up reducing costs for defendants, in a case on the constitutionality of punitive damages. Such damages have become increasingly common in product-liability cases. **********The Court is reviewing an appeal of a 1981 Mississippi jury award to Lloyd M. Crenshaw, who was granted $20,000 plus $1.6 million in punitive damages.

Thousands of Pages of Data **********The investigation is so sensitive and secret that American and Pakistani officials have agreed not to compile progress reports that might draw false conclusions before all the evidence is in. Instead, Pakistan will compile the only official report and then only after the inquiry is completed. **********Pakistani and American officials from several agencies have already compiled thousands of pages of information about the crash, from analyses of speculative conspiracy theories to a technical repair history of the C-130 that went down. **********Some of the debris has been transfered to the Pentagon and to the Lockheed Corporation, the plane's manufacturer, for laboratory testing. **********The inquiry, which is being directed by Pakistani authorities with American help, has been complicated by these technical and political factors: *********** Immediately after the crash, Pakistani officials kept American military personnel in Pakistan from examining the site except to identify the bodies of the two Americans killed, Ambassador Arnold L. Raphel and Brig. Gen. Herbert M. Wassom, the chief American military attache in Pakistan. *********** Much of the debris had to be moved to dig victims' bodies from the rubble, since the Islamic religion requires that the dead be buried as soon as possible. That could have obliterated some evidence. *********** The Federal Bureau of Investigation, the primary agency responsible for investigating acts of sabotage against American officials and private citizens abroad, was not allowed to participate on the American side of the investigation. The State Department and the Pentagon said Pentagon experts could handle the job and that sabotage had not been proved. *********** Security for President Zia was poor and packages taken on board flights during his trips were not routinely checked, a Pakistani official said. This has raised speculation that a bomb may have been placed in 20 crates of mangoes taken on board before takeoff. *********** There is no indication from conversations on the plane recorded by the control tower or retrieved from the flight recorder that the pilot knew anything was wrong before the crash. *********** American and Pakistani officials tend to place varying degrees of importance on the same evidence. Largely on the basis of interviews conducted by Pakistanis with more than 100 witnesses, American officials have become increasingly convinced that the plane did not blow up in midair. But some Pakistanis said they were reluctant to believe the witnesses, saying they may not have actually seen the crash. **********There are numerous other theories about the cause of the crash, including that the plane was hit by a missile fired by Soviet, Indian or Afghan agents or dissident Pakistani military officers. The Soviet Union, India and Afghanistan have denied any involvement. **********American and Pakistani officials say that the most plausible explanation of the crash was reported on Friday in the Lahore morning newspaper The Nation. The publication quoted unnamed sources close to the investigation as blaming a mechanical problem in the rear of the plane. Tampering Is Studied **********The report quoted officials as ruling out a missile attack or a bomb on board because the plane did not explode in midair but jolted and lost control before plunging into a field. The report added that although it was unlikely that Pakistani Air Force technicians who had worked on the plane tampered with it, that possibility was being investigated. A senior State Department official said the article ''appeared authoritative.'' **********The investigation is further complicated by the fact that it is taking place against a backdrop of dramatically deteriorating Soviet-Pakistani relations, which initially convinced many senior Pakistani civilian and military leaders that Moscow had planned and executed the crash. **********Pakistan is the headquarters for the Afghan insurgents who have been fighting Soviet and Afghan Government troops. The guerrillas, supported by the United States, have scored military victories in recent weeks as Soviet troops have begun to withdraw. **********Less than two weeks before President Zia's death, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze warned Pakistan's Foreign Minister, Sahabzada Yaqub Khan, that it would be a mistake to think that continued support for the guerrillas would ''go unpunished,'' Pakistani officials said. **********Since the crash, Afghan planes have bombed targets farther inside Pakistan than at any time during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/05/business/business-digest-saturday-november-5-1988.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-11-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 587, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST: SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 5, 1988", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST: SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 5, 1988", "body_text": " **********International **********Boeing received an order from the Polish airline, the first order for advanced American aircraft from an Eastern bloc country.

Those doubts were effectively erased on Friday, analysts said, despite some pockets of weakness in the figures. **********The report showed that nonfarm payroll employment increased by a stronger-than-expected 262,000 jobs in March. As significant, analysts said, was the fact that the huge 531,000 increase reported for February was revised downward by only about 14,000 jobs. 'A Distinct Negative' **********''These numbers are a distinct negative for all the markets,'' said Allan Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Group Inc. ''They are telling us that the economy is far stronger than anyone thought. Over the near term, this report will probably push short-term and long-term interest rates higher by anywhere from 10 to 25 basis points.'' **********Milton W. Hudson, senior economic adviser at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, said that in the first quarter about one million people were added to nonfarm payrolls. ''That is a powerful lot of purchasing power that has been injected into the economy,'' he added. **********Equally troubling to some analysts was the report on construction spending during February. **********While overall construction expenditures declined by three-tenths of 1 percent, spending on new plants and equipment rose by a healthy 1.2 percent. **********''If the plant and equipment numbers mean anything, there is something going on out there,'' said one economist, who asked not to be identified. ''They tell me the second quarter almost certainly will be stronger than the first quarter.'' **********A further upward move in interest rates would merely accelerate a trend of the last month. **********On March 3, the day before the Labor Department released employment data for February, yields on the Treasury's closely watched 8 7/8 percent bonds due in 2017 stood at 8.31 percent. In late trading on Thursday, the yield had risen by more than 40 basis points, to 8.75 percent. **********Analysts took some solace in the fact that manufacturing employment and the average workweek for factory employees both declined slightly last month. Those factors suggest that industrial production, which is running into constraints on capacity in a number of areas, was not further strained in March. In addition, the rise in employment was accompanied by a very modest rise in wages, suggesting that inflation is likely to remain moderate. **********''I don't think we are going to get an increase of a quarter-point in interest rates overnight,'' said Rudolf Thunberg, an economist at Ried, Thunberg & Company Inc., an economic analysis and consulting firm in Westport, Conn. ''But the trend of interest rates is higher, because the economy is straining against capacity constraints and the Federal Reserve is committed to battling incipient inflation.'' **********Worries about the effects of the employment report are likely to dominate the markets all week, because no significant economic statistics are scheduled to be released. Congress, which has been debating contentious trade legislation, will be on its Easter recess. **********''The bearish sentiment that has been in place for the past few weeks will merely deepen,'' said Jeffrey Leeds, chief economist at Chemical Bank. ''I look for the market to erode all week.'' Renewed Fears on Dollar **********The start of the second quarter is also likely to rekindle worries about the dollar. Although its value dipped on the foreign exchange markets in late March, a number of analysts questioned whether it might have fallen further but for the pressures stemming from the March 31 close of Japan's fiscal year. That may have prevented Japanese institutions from selling assets denominated in dollars. **********Mr. Leeds said that the dollar could indeed fall further, and that Congress - not the Japanese - might be responsible, because of fears about legislation that would require foreigners to disclose all substantial investments in American business and real estate. A trade-bill amendment to that effect is sponsored by Representative John Bryant, a Texas Democrat. **********''I am convinced that the recent slip in the dollar was occasioned by debate over the so-called Bryant amendment to the trade bill, which would reduce the free flow of capital into the United States,'' Mr. Leeds said. **********''Debate on that issue will be back on the front pages in a week or so,'' he added. ''Amendments like this make the job of attracting foreign investors to finance our substantial current-account deficit more difficult.'' **********In addition, analysts said that with the economy growing at a pace of 2.5 percent or more, further improvement in the trade deficit is unlikely to provide support for the dollar or the fixed-income markets. **********''Both the fixed-income and currency markets are convinced we have turned the corner on trade,'' a government securities trader said. ''The worry now is whether the economy has the ability in both capacity and labor to meet further increases in demand. Further improvement in trade is not unmitigated good news for bonds.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/14/business/consumer-rates-yields-flat-or-down.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Hurtado", "pub_date": "1988-01-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 415, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Yields Flat Or Down", "print_headline": "CONSUMER RATES; Yields Flat Or Down", "body_text": " **********Yields on certificates of deposit and bank money market accounts were flat in the week ended yesterday, while those of money market mutual funds slipped. **********The results of the Treasury's weekly bill auction on Monday - usually an influence on what banks and savings institutions pay their money market account and C.D. customers - showed the average discount rate for a three-month bill down 5 basis points, to 5.85 percent, while the six-month bill declined by 2 basis points, to 6.33 percent.

The measure, which passed, 94 to 2, earlier in the year, was split into two bills: one that deals with changes in the nation's banking laws and a second that changes the nation's securities laws. **********The result of the two bills taken together would be the same as the original Proxmire bill, ending the barrier between commercial banks and securities firms and, in particular, opening the door for the nation's commercial banks to engage in wide new securities underwriting, including the issuing of corporate debt and mutual funds. **********A similar, though more restrictive, bill that would give banks only limited new securities powers has passed the House Banking and House Energy and Commerce Committees. But the chairmen of the former, Fernard J. St Germain of Rhode Island, and the latter, John D. Dingell of Michigan, are locked in an apparently intractable dispute over whether the energy committee, which has not traditionally dealt with banking matters, can propose changes in the nation's banking laws. Dingell Proposes Amendments **********Mr. Dingell proposed amendments to the banking bill last month, after it had cleared the banking committee. His amendments would have more sharply limited the banks' new powers. **********The dispute has become so intense in recent days that the prospects of passing any bill has dimmed considerably, especially as Congress rushes to adjourn for the elections by the end of this week. **********Mr. Proxmire, who will be retiring from the Senate at the end of this year and who has sought for more than a year to pass legislation that would give banks new businesses, has been searching for ways to settle the dispute. **********At issue is the prospect that Mr. St Germain stands to lose exclusive jurisdiction over the nation's banking laws if Mr. Dingell's Energy and Commerce Committee succeeds in changing any of those laws. **********Likewise, Mr. Dingell could lose his committee's jurisdiction over the nation's securities laws, if any St Germain bill changes those statutes. 'It Is Really Bad' **********''This is a big jurisdictional dispute and it is really bad,'' said Kenneth A. Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent Bankers Association. **********The Proxmire approach essentially is to create a bill that Mr. Dingell could accept, which would alter only national securities laws and one that Mr. St Germain could accept, which would change only banking laws. **********But Mr. Proxmire's efforts could be derailed at any time. For one thing, his approach needs unanimous support in the Senate to succeed. **********The Wisconsin Senator seems to have gone along with Mr. St Germain's insistence on placing strict consumer requirements on banks entering new underwriting businesses, such as offering low-cost checking services to the poor and elderly, but he has made few concessions to Mr. Dingell's desire to restrict bank underwriting powers. **********One Congressional aide predicted that Mr. Dingell would not take the Proxmire approach seriously. **********''I think it's a real question whether St Germain or Dingell will go along with this,'' one Congressional aide said.

Dealers said the Federal Reserve made only a token move to prop the dollar, causing some concern in the financial markets about the commitment of Washington and other nations to stable exchange rates.  Stock Market Affected **********The dollar's recent weakness, which prompts fears of inflation, and several other factors continued to take their toll on the stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 44.92 points yesterday, or 2.2 percent, to 1,978.95, after losing 43.77 in Thursday's session. **********''The big question being asked again by the Street is to what extent the major nations are willing to commit themselves to stabilizing the dollar,'' said Stephen H. Axilrod, vice chairman of Nikko Securities International and a former official of the Federal Reserve. **********''After all, the stock market is simply reflecting the concern about the dollar,'' Mr. Axilrod continued. ''Thus far, the flight to quality has been a small-scale affair.'' **********Small scale or not, the bond market rallied as some investors moved their funds from equities to fixed-income securities. This ''flight to quality'' tended to outweigh fears that the Fed may have to raise interest rates to attract foreign buyers of Treasury debt if the dollar weakens further. **********According to dealers, the Bank of Japan was an aggressive buyer of dollars early yesterday when the dollar was trading at 125.20 yen. They said the Federal Reserve began buying dollars when the dollar had slumped to 125.10 yen from Thursday's close of 125.60. **********In late New York trading, the dollar was being quoted at 125.30 yen, down from 125.60 late Thursday. And it had dropped to 1.6740 West German marks, from 1.6770. **********The Fed's purchases of dollars, largely with yen, were apparently so modest that many dealers doubted that any intervention was taking place at all until well into the afternoon. **********A dealer at the Bankers Trust Company said: ''Whether or not the Fed is intervening is unclear. What is not unclear is that even a rumor to that effect is enough to cause some shorts to cover part of their positions, which is what we saw this morning. But the pressure is still on the dollar and we expect the dollar to move to lower ground next week.'' **********Aside from the short covering, much of the early buying of dollars resulted from the steep decline in the British pound, which resulted from Britain's release of February trade figures. Despite an 8 percent drop in its merchandise trade deficit, Britain reported a larger-than-expected deficit in its current account, which includes earnings from such invisible exports as insurance and other financial services. **********But sterling recovered to close at $1.8410, down from $1.8415 the day before and well above its intraday low of about $1.82. More important to overseas interests, the critical sterling-mark cross-rate fell in favor of the West German currency. At the close in London, it took 3.074 marks to buy a pound, compared with 3.0945 the day before. **********The dollar remained weak against other currencies. It dropped to 1.3855 Swiss frances, from 1.3870, and to 1.2420 Canadian dollars from 1.2425. But the high-flying Australian dollar fell as a result of profit taking, declining to 73.90 cents (United States), from 74.28 cents. **********Gold prices, which have been strengthened by the dollar's weakness, were off slightly as some investors took profits. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted gold at $452.75 an ounce at 4 P.M., down 40 cents from Thursday's late price. **********Despite heavy profit taking, the expiring spot March Comex gold futures slipped 90 cents an ounce, to $453.20.

The panel said the exemption encouraged the belief that insurers conspire to raise prices and gouge consumers. **********The group's recommendations were hailed by some state officials and other insurance industry critics, who unsuccessfully sought Federal legislation last year to repeal the exemption, known as the 1945 McCarran-Ferguson Act. 'Ought to Be Subject to Scrutiny' **********''This underscores a growing understanding of the unfairness of the antitrust exception,'' Marc Dann, the antitrust director for the West Virginia Attorney General's office, said in an interview. ''Insurance companies are making record profits, their chief executives are getting million-dollar-plus salaries, and we think they ought to be subject to the same scrutiny as any other business.'' **********Three of the 12 A.B.A. commission members, all insurance-industry consultants or officials, dissented from the recommendation that the antitrust exemption be repealed. Moreover, the recommendations are certain to be opposed by the insurance industry, which argued against repealing the exemption in the previous Congress and which contends that its profits are reasonable. **********George Klotzbaugh, counsel for the American Insurance Association, a group representing property and casualty insurers, said the A.B.A. report ''misses the entire point'' by arguing that repeal of the antitrust exemption will promote competition. **********An A.B.A. antitrust committee recommended in February that the Federal exemption be repealed, but the association delayed acting on the proposal until today's report could be considered. **********The 1945 law was passed largely to keep insurance regulation out of Federal hands and under the control of state officials, where it should remain, Mr. Klotzbaugh said. Despite efforts by proponents of regulation, the Government has not generally regulated the industry's business practices in recent years. **********In 1980, Congress prohibited the Federal Trade Commission from regulating insurance companies after the agency published a report that was sharply critical of the industry's sales tactics. More Opposition **********The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, the group representing state insurance regulators, also opposes repeal of the law. **********The A.B.A. commission recommends that the Federal antitrust exemption be replaced by more limited exemptions to promote competition within the industry. They include allowing companies to gather statistics on claims, to standardize policy forms and to underwrite large risks jointly that a single company often would refuse to insure. **********The group also called for a Federal agency with subpoena power to conduct an inquiry into charges that the industry has conspired to restrain competition. **********The recommendations will be considered at a February meeting in Denver by the bar association's ruling body, the House of Delegates, which can adopt all, some or none of the recommendations. Those that are adopted will be sent to Congress, where another repeal attempt is expected next year. **********While the existing law itself is narrowly drawn, it allows companies and industry groups to strike agreements on prices, claims adjustment and policy forms, although boycotts and some other anti-competitive practices remain Federal violations. **********As some insurance rates rose sharply in recent years, many state officials have increased their own efforts to spot and prosecute antitrust violators. **********In the largest such action, 17 states filed Federal lawsuits in San Francisco last March charging that four major insurers conspired to eliminate general liability insurance for pollution damage in policies sold to local governments. The lawsuits have not yet come to trial. **********In its report, the A.B.A. commission lacked the data to determine whether the industry does in fact use its antitrust relief to reap unfairly high profits. The report stated only that a repeal of the exemption ''may increase the competitive atmosphere.'' **********The report said the industry did not appear to be dominated by a handful of companies.

Few economists had expected it after private foreign investment dried up last year and the United States had to depend on foreign central banks to finance its external deficit. But, after dropping more than 15 percent against a trade-weighted average of other currencies in the latter half of 1987, the dollar stabilized and then took off this summer. It was back to where it was a year ago before starting to slip again in the past week. **********Is the dollar's rally over? It would be easier to answer that if we knew what caused the rally. **********Economists differ. David Hale of Kemper Financial Services attributes the rally to three causes: the market's belief that foreign central banks had agreed to protect the dollar's value at least until November; the Federal Reserve's gradual tightening, which raised interest rates and made dollar assets look more attractive abroad, and the actions taken by West Germany and Japan in imposing withholding taxes on many domestic investments, which had the effect of spurring German and Japanese private foreign investment, especially in the United States. **********A panel of economists surveyed by Blue Chip Economic Indicators said the most important cause of the dollar rally was the narrowing of the United States trade deficit, but they said that second was the Fed's actions in widening the spreads between interest rates in this country and abroad. **********The Germans may have checked the dollar rally by raising their interest rates, lest a falling mark unleash inflation. Last week Karl Otto Pohl, president of the Bundesbank, departed from the cryptic style of central bankers in expressing dissatisfaction with the dollar's value and declaring that the Bundesbank would do all it could to prevent the mark from falling. **********The summer rally was partly caused by the robustness of the American economy. More recent signs that the economy is cooling - especially the rise in the unemployment rate to 5.5 percent in August, the second monthly increase - has helped to halt the dollar rally. **********Some economists see the Federal budget deficit as the fundamental cause of the dollar's rapid climb from late 1980 until February 1985. A leading champion of that view, Martin Feldstein of Harvard, who is an economic adviser to Vice President Bush in the campaign, earlier stated the deficit-dollar linkage this way: ''When the Government borrows on a vast scale, it creates a vacuum in the domestic capital market that sucks in capital from abroad.'' The increased demand for dollar securities causes the value of the dollar to rise, and that brings about an enlarged trade deficit. **********Mr. Feldstein's policy advice to Mr. Bush flows from this analysis: Announce a credible plan for eliminating the budget deficit in five years; that will bring down real interest rates, reduce the value of the dollar relative to other currencies and eliminate the trade deficit. **********But Mr. Bush has yet to produce a budget plan that the markets find credible. Neither has Michael S. Dukakis. Does the likelihood of a continued loose fiscal policy, which would have to be offset by a tight money policy, explain the recent dollar rally? Is this a replay of the original Reagan mix of a loose fiscal-tight money policy, which sent the dollar soaring and, as Mr. Feldstein argued, greatly increased the trade deficit? **********But as Shafiqul Islam, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, notes, some economists dispute the link between the Federal budget deficit and high American interest rates. Others dismiss the high rates as the main force that drove the dollar up, and still others challenge both linkages. For his part, Mr. Islam offers as the explanation of dollar swings what he calls the ''policy-performance-confidence mix'' - that is, the combined changes in American and foreign monetary policy, the performance of national economies, and the state of confidence in the markets. **********In his view, presented in a study for Princeton's International Finance Section, the dollar's value is determined in speculative markets, like stocks and bonds, with market psychology critically influencing the way traders respond to data on all variables. Any new information - about growth, inflation, unemployment, the intentions of policy makers, election polls - can affect the dollar. **********Lately senior American officials have been saying that the dollar is now fairly priced. They do not want to see interest rates climb further, lest securities markets be clobbered. Inflation fears are lessening; the gold price has been slipping and the oil price dropping. Henry Kaufman, who now heads his own investment advisory concern, says the dollar's range is now between 135 and 175 Japanese yen, and between 1.75 and 1.88 German marks. **********The rise in unemployment has given the Fed breathing room. With the Fed on the sidelines, there is less likelihood of another run-up in interest rates or the dollar in the near term. This should pacify financial markets and avoid downward pressure on the economy. It looks like all quiet on the economic front - at least until the election."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/27/world/us-puts-full-support-behind-delvalle.html": {"writer_name": "Elaine Sciolino", "pub_date": "1988-02-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1176, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Puts Full Support Behind Delvalle", "print_headline": "U.S. Puts Full Support Behind Delvalle", "body_text": " **********The United States threw its full support today behind Panama's civilian President, Eric Arturo Delvalle, in his attempt to dismiss Gen.

When asked whether military intervention was planned, he replied, ''No, I don't think that's the answer.'' **********Vice President Bush, in an appearance before the South Carolina Press Association in Greenville, S.C., appeared to take a harder line than the President did on the question of possible military action, The Associated Press reported. **********''We will do whatever is necessary to protect American interests in Panama,'' he said, and added: ''We would obviously, as the United States, and I would, reserve the right to do whatever is necessary, including military force, to protect America's sacred interest in that region of the world.'' **********He stopped short of calling for military intervention, however, saying that past United States intervention in Latin American affairs is ''what's hurting us in some areas now.'' Support on Capitol Hill **********On Capitol Hill, key lawmakers of both parties expressed support for Mr. Delvalle and some called for an immediate trade embargo to further squeeze Panama's already desperate economy. **********The Reagan Administration, which had urged Mr. Delvalle to use his consitutional powers to take action against General Noriega, is trying to figure out what to do if the general succeeds in resisting his ouster. **********Administration officials acknowledged they were gambling that Mr. Delvalle's move to oust General Noriega would provide the catalyst to further isolate him from Latin American democracies after the American indictments and might prompt popular protests and further economic pressure that could lead to his removal. 'Broke the Impasse' **********''The process of moving Panama to democracy had somehow come to a halt,'' said one senior Administration official in describing events that led to General Noriega's dismissal. ''The indictment stirred things up for a few days and then things went back to an impasse. Delvalle's move broke the impasse.'' **********Administration officials who just a few weeks ago were calling President Delvalle a weak, ineffective leader with no power, were suddenly portraying him as a result of yesterday's action as a man of courage who potentially could lead the country on the road to democracy. **********The United States has known of and supported Mr. Delvalle's desire to force out General Noriega for some time, and senior Administration officials and Panamanian opposition leaders predicted that General Noriega would refuse to step down. **********What is not clear is how the United States intended to back up Mr. Delvalle and what it planned to do now. **********When Mr. Delvalle detailed his intentions to Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams during a meeting in Miami last week, Mr. Abrams encouraged him, saying that the United States would publicly support him and would push other Latin governments to do the same, senior State Department officials said.

''Yes, we want him to stand trial,'' he added, referring to the indictments against General Noriega. ''Yes, we want civilian government in Panama. But we want to be careful not to unduly intrude upon the affairs of Panama.'' **********Other Administration officials acknowledged that the process of deposing General Noriega and restoring democracy to Panama might still take some time and declined to make any predictions. **********''You never know what might be unleashed by an action such as Delvalle's,'' said one senior State department official. No Immediate Punitive Measures **********These officials said that they would not immediately impose punitive measures, such as a trade embargo urged by Mr. Delvalle, but did not rule out such actions later. They added that they would wait to see whether a call by opposition leaders for a general strike was honored in Panama at the beginning of next week and were awaiting the reaction of the Panamanian Church. **********Next Tuesday, President Reagan could impose new sanctions against Panama under the provisions of a 1986 anti-drug law, since he is expected to declare that Panama and other countries have not fully cooperated with the United States to crack down on the drug trade. **********In the case of Panama, the law would require the United States to abstain from any international loans to Panama. The President could take the opportunity to impose other sanctions under the law, such as loss of preferential tariff treatment and a 50 percent tax on all Panamanian imports. **********As for a lifting of the indictments against General Noriega so that he could seek refuge in a third country without fear of extradition to the United States, a senior State department official said the events of the last day had damaged any chances he may have had for a reprieve. ''Reacting like a military strongman has set things back for him,'' the official said. **********Administration officials were quick to deny the assertion by some Panamanian exile leaders that Mr. Delvalle was a ''sacrificial lamb'' who would facilitate the return of democracy to Panama. **********Mr. Delvalle was elected as First Vice President in a questionable presidential election in 1984 and assumed the presidency under the Constitution when President Nicolas Ardito Barletta was forced to resign by military pressure in 1985. No Alternative Leader **********''He may have been a puppet but he doesn't have the strings attached to him any longer,'' one official said. **********But American officials who closely watch Panama acknowledge that although they hope Mr. Delvalle can lead the country until elections are held next year, they acknowledge that at this point the Panamanian people have not yet rallied around an alternative leader, unlike the situation in the Philippines when the masses threw their support to Corazon C.

Its successor, the 80386, was more than twice as complex - 275,000 transistors - and was finished in a little under three years. **********Now, gathered around oversized display screens, a team of Intel designers is laying out the million-transistor 80486 - amid hopes that they can reach ''first silicon,'' the industry's phrase for a first prototype chip, in less than two years. **********If Intel's team meets its self-imposed deadline, it will mark another small victory in the escalating battle between chip-design engineers and their twin enemies: time and complexity. If they make the deadline without a tiny error that will haunt them later, it will be a miracle. **********''We are learning that it is possible to constantly shorten the amount of time it takes to get from the concept to the first chip,'' Albert Yu, the exuberant vice president of Intel's microcomputer components group, said recently as he negotiated a warren of chest-high cubicles in Intel's development laboratory here, where the 80486 is taking shape. ''We are also learning that one defect kills it all.'' **********The 46-year-old Mr. Yu, who started his microelectronics career after moving to California from Shanghai, is one of the architects of what Intel calls its ''52-week chip'' program, an effort to reduce the average time it takes to design a logic chip to a year or less. Five years ago, he said, virtually everyone in Silicon Valley would have regarded the goal as ludicrous. Even today the program has its critics, some among Mr. Yu's colleagues, who complain that it can lead to the kind of tiny mistakes that can cost millions of dollars in delays as well as embarrassment. **********But in the cutthroat world of designing logic chips, shrinking the time it takes to put a chip on the market has become essential. Intel is locked in a battle with the Motorola Corporation to have its chips used in future electronic products. Chip makers also are under growing pressure to feed large customers - in Intel's case, I.B.M. and scores of manufacturers of I.B.M.-compatible machines -ever more powerful processors that operate far faster and can handle far more sophisticated software. **********To cut design time, Intel has adopted some basic principles from makers of rifles, autos and air-conditioners, who learned a long time ago about the merits of building new products from old parts. **********In Intel's case, the ''parts'' are circuits, and combinations of circuits, that made the company's past chips tick. It may have taken a chip designer weeks or months to design a ''bus interface,'' which controls communications between the processor and external devices, or an ''instruction cache,'' an area of on-chip memory that holds the most recently received instruction for re-use a split second later. **********In the 52-week chip program, each such feature is indexed and stored in the memory of a design team computer. With the flick of a pointing device, a proven feature of the 80386 can be lifted from the electronic library and dropped into the 80486. **********If necessary, the part can be altered for its new role. But that might defeat the purpose. ''The most difficult thing as a designer is that you want to make everything better, to go in and do it again,'' Mr. Yu said. **********An advantage of the circuit library is that it allows designers to see the forest for the trees - to use a shorthand notation for the role of a set of circuits rather than drawing them out in transistor-by-transistor detail. During a recent visit, engineers were moving sets of components around a screen, exploring how they could be laid out most efficiently. **********But the process also has its risks. Every set of circuits in the library must be perfect. An error made in one chip could be propagated in specialty circuits used in everything from automobiles to ovens. And each circuit must be painstakingly ''verified'' - that is, a designer must check that every connection from one part is properly hooked to other devices on the new chip without violating strict design rules. **********''We can't have any time bombs,'' said Mike Aymar, an engineer who oversees much of the process. **********Intel learned that lesson last year, soon after it began delivering its 80386 chips in volume. A manufacturer building the chip into a computer noticed that the processor sometimes made a subtle math error. The trouble was traced to one improperly designed transistor out of more than a quarter of a million. It took two weeks of around-the-clock work to amend the design and produce revised chips, and months to replace chips that had been shipped. **********Some Intel engineers blame the haste of speedy design for the mistake, but Mr. Yu maintained that techniques like the electronic parts library cut the likelihood of such errors. ''There is a classical misperception that there is a trade-off between quality and time,'' he said. ''That is totally wrong. If you do it right, faster can be better.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/08/world/the-welcome-by-nepalese-is-more-wary.html": {"writer_name": "Sanjoy Hazarika", "pub_date": "1988-09-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 579, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Welcome By Nepalese Is More Wary", "print_headline": "The Welcome By Nepalese Is More Wary", "body_text": " **********For years, this Himalayan kingdom, renowned for its tough Gurkha soldiers, its Hindu traditions, its spectacular views of the world's highest mountain range and as a trekker's paradise, has lived uneasily with a growing flood of foreign tourists. **********The tourists have brought some prosperity, and problems. **********At the luxurious Soaltee Oberoi Hotel in Katmandu, the only casino between the Middle East and Southeast Asia draws hundreds of foreign visitors every night. **********A new international airport is being built and new hotels are rising to cater to the boom in tourism, which brought in about $55 million in foreign exchange last year and which is the country's biggest industry.

The earnings through the first three quarters of 1988 already total $17 billion, he said, compared with the full-year record of $18.1 billion in 1985. **********But Mr. Seidman said at a news conference that nonperforming loans on the books of the nation's 13,239 banks jumped by $3.2 billion in the third quarter, and that some of that was from a marked weakening in the real estate market in the Northeast. 'Not as Good as They Look' **********''While these numbers look good, they are not as good as they look,'' Mr. Seidman said of the profit figures. ''There are several areas we need to keep a careful eye on.'' **********For example, Mr. Seidman said that bank failures were likely to continue to be very high next year.

For last year as a whole, the industry earned only $3.6 billion, the lowest level since the Depression. **********Though Mr. Seidman and other regulators are closely monitoring the third-world loans, they are also beginning to see some signs of weakening in the real estate market in the Northeast, where residential real estate prices have soared in recent years. **********Mr. Seidman said that in the six New England states, New Jersey and Florida, they had seen an increase in loan delinquencies. ''But they are not at alarming levels and not like the Southwest,'' he said. **********Indeed, the Southwest continues to be the most troublesome area for bank regulators, where more than one in four banks lost money in the third quarter. The Southwestern states have accounted for almost three-quarters of the bank failures this year, and more than half of the F.D.I.C.'s problem banks are in Texas and the surrounding states. **********While he said that bank involvement in leveraged buyouts was a topic of concern and closer regulatory scrutiny at the F.D.I.C., Mr. Seidman added that banks were aggressively trying to get leveraged buyout loans off their balance sheets and that he did not see the loans as a cause for bank failures. **********Of the $263 billion in loans that banks sold either to each other or to nonbanking institutions, ''about half of them were LBO'' loans, Mr. Seidman said, adding that most of the leveraged buyout loans were sold to non-banking institutions. **********But Mr. Seidman said he did see possible problems with some of the leveraged buyout loans on the books of the banks if the nation's economy went into a recession. **********Though banks would have booked large fees for arranging the loans, if a recession weakened the individual companies, the banks could be stuck with large losses on the loans. **********''I think when you look at LBO loans, you have to look more at quality, rather than quantity,'' said Donald G. Ogilvie, executive vice president of the American Bankers Association. Mr. Ogilvie said that some buyouts had produced ''gilt edged'' loans for their lenders. **********Mr. Seidman said that the fund was not concerned about an immediate threat from bank involvement in leveraged buyout loans, but that ''whenever it appears there is an increased concentration of lending, we like to get there ahead of the situation.'' **********The $5.9 billion in profits in the third quarter followed earnings of $5.3 billion in the first quarter and $5.8 billion in the second quarter. The agency included the $2.3 billion in losses from the failed First Republicbank Corporation of Dallas in the first six months, even though it has since been taken over by the NCNB Corporation of Charlotte, N.C."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/01/business/beatrice-bond-prices-dip.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-09-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 302, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Beatrice Bond Prices Dip", "print_headline": "Beatrice Bond Prices Dip", "body_text": " **********Prices of the Beatrice Company's high-yield bonds dipped 1 to 2 percentage points yesterday in response to a published report that the company might pay its equity investors special dividends totaling as much as $800 million. **********Charles Long, a Beatrice spokesman, would not confirm the report, which appeared in yesterday's editions of The Wall Street Journal.

But clearly times have changed: despite some shortages, wages are barely rising and there are no signs that they will begin to soar. **********The reason is that, over the last five years, the bargaining power of American labor, both union and nonunion, has so diminished that no one knows just how low the unemployment rate has to be before workers can insist on higher pay, and get it. **********Indeed, despite the current unemployment level of 5.4 percent, announced last week, the teamsters' and the automobile workers' unions have reached tentative agreements that give truck drivers and Chrysler Corporation workers lower wage rises than they received in their last contracts, which were negotiated in 1985. Doubt on Reliability **********Such settlements show how the unemployment rate is no longer as reliable an indicator of wage pressures as it once was. ''We don't know where the magic number is on the unemployment scale,'' said George Stiluto, the Labor Department official in charge of gathering wage data. ''We look at a lot of material, but we aren't finding a wage buildup.'' **********To be sure, there are pockets of pressure. The best known are at supermarkets and fast-food outlets. With fewer young people entering the labor force than in the early 1980's, these outlets are having problems finding counter workers. This has pushed up pay to $5 or $6 an hour from the $4 or less that was common two or three years ago. **********Those who work in the service sector - particularly in banks, hospitals and some clerical jobs - are also enjoying bigger wage increases than other workers, including factory workers, the Labor Department reports. And in the Northeast, where the unemployment rate is below 4 percent, pay has gone up the most rapidly of all. **********But even in the Northeast, the upward movement in wages is hardly alarming. After rising at a 5 percent annual rate in the 12 months through December, wage increases in the region fell back to a 4.6 percent annual pace in the first quarter of this year. ''The Northeast seems to have passed its heyday,'' said Felicia Nathan, a Labor Department economist. In many cases, employers are operating short-staffed, rather than push up pay to attract workers. **********Still, the tie between wages and employment levels has been so strong in the postwar years that it has been difficult for many economists to accept that the relationship has changed. Indeed, the Labor Department's announcement last Friday of another fall in the civilian unemployment rate, to 5.4 percent in April from 5.6 percent in March, caused some economists to sound the alarm. **********Their concern is that employers will be forced to pay higher wages to keep workers or attract them. They will then push up prices to cover their higher payrolls. The result will be an inflation rate of 5 percent or more this year, says Joel Popkin, who runs an economic consulting service in Washington. This would be up from an annual rate of 3.9 percent in the first quarter. **********Mr. Popkin and many Wall Street economists expect the Federal Reserve to push up interest rates ahead of time, in expectation of the inflation threat - indeed, some are urging the Federal Reserve to act in this fashion. By pushing up rates, the Federal Reserve would make loans more costly for individuals and businesses. Borrowing would drop off, purchasing would slacken and higher prices would be harder to impose. Less Pressure Seen **********Employers, unable to pass on wage rises, would increase their resistance to them. The inflation pressure, in sum, would be watered down, if the Federal Reserve acts early enough, Mr. Popkin said. **********But even without any Federal Reserve action, employer resistance to higher wages is considerably greater than it was in the early 1980's, when worker costs rose three times faster than today. Unit labor costs today, for example - that is, the labor cost of producing each piece of merchandise - have been rising at an annual rate of less than 2.5 percent, or well below the current inflation rate. **********Similarly, average hourly wages, a key measure of how much money workers can count on in their paychecks, have risen by far less than 1 percent since January, to about $9.22. When adjusted for inflation, hourly wages have declined since last May. Survival Is Stressed **********The chief reason for the wage hold-down has been the success of many employers in convincing workers that company survival against foreign and domestic competitors depends on keeping wages down. **********Two recent contract agreements, involving the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the United Automobile Workers, illustrate the ground lost by the unions, which generated the greatest pressure for higher wages until the early 1980's. **********But as the membership of unions has fallen to 17 percent of the work force, from 23 percent in 1980, so has the size of wage increases in union contracts. Since 1984, annual wage increases in union contracts have been less than 2.5 percent a year, compared with 8 percent annual increases in agreements signed in 1980, according to the Labor Department. **********The teamsters have just agreed to a three-year contract for 200,000 truck drivers that calls for annual wage rises of 35 cents an hour. By comparison, the expiring agreement, signed in 1985, provided 50-cent-an-hour annual increases. The truckers, who must ratify the new agreement, now average $13.61 an hour. Changes in Chrysler Pact **********Similarly, a 28-month Chrysler agreement, also awaiting ratification, provides for annual bonus payments equal to 3 percent of base pay, plus profit-sharing if there are profits. In the expiring three-year agreement, the workers also received 3 percent a year. But these were wage increases that were folded into base pay; the bonuses will not be. **********The base pay of Chrysler workers now averages less than $14 an hour and would remain at this level in the new agreement. Base pay, in turn, determines the levels of pensions, overtime and other benefits. **********Other trends have also reduced wage pressures. The number of temporary workers, for example, has risen sharply. So has the number of part-timers who would prefer full-time jobs. These two categories provide a safety valve: temporary workers can be laid off if they push for higher pay, and many of the part-timers can be upgraded to full-timers, presumably at the same hourly pay, if labor shortages worsen. **********But sooner or later, tight labor markets are likely to set off sharply higher wage rises, as they did in the late 1960's, when the unemployment rate fell below 4 percent for four years.

But Soviet soldiers and their officers, the civilian advisers and the corps of Russian correspondents all speak as if there is no longer a question of whether and when Moscow's involvement will end. **********''We are leaving this year, whether or not there is an international settlement,'' a Russian told a foreign reporter who was visiting this week. **********The statement, echoed privately by several Soviet officials in Moscow, is not consistent with official policy. A withdrawal of the 120,000 Soviet troops, according to that policy, is contingent on an end of Western aid to the guerrillas and a package of other agreements discussed under the auspices of the United Nations. A Change in Atmosphere **********But in Kabul several signs suggest that the possibility of a unilateral withdrawal is not out of the question, and it appears that Afghan and Soviet officials are already preparing the way for the Russians to go. **********For an American reporter returning to Kabul after a year's absence, a palpable change in atmosphere was apparent in the capital. **********A year ago, the Afghans and the Russians seemed hunkered down for the continuation of the war, which began in late 1979 with the arrival of Soviet forces. There was little talk of turning the war over to the Afghan Army, or leaving the fate of the Government, headed by Najibullah, solely in its hands. **********This week there was talk of little else. Almost every event organized for visiting reporters seemed designed to demonstrate the independence and power of the Afghan Army. **********It seemed hardly to matter to the Afghan hosts that the events witnessed by the visitors often did not square with the official theme of the visit, and left an impression that the war and the general situation in Afghanistan are anything but under the Government's control. **********But it was the show itself that counted for Afghan and Soviet audiences. Reports about the visit stressed how the foreign reporters had seen for themselves the fortitude and strength of Afghan units that recently helped break the siege of Khost, a town near the Pakistani border. **********Najibullah, at a news conference today, repeatedly said the army was ready to deal with guerrillas on its own and was capable of preventing the collapse of the Government if Soviet forces withdrew.  Protecting the Americans **********American reporters who travel here to cover the war find themselves in the odd, somewhat uneasy, position of depending on Soviet forces to protect them against American-made missiles fired by American-backed guerrillas. **********It takes some adjustment to feel comforted by the sight of Soviet soldiers and tanks, and to be heartened by the presence of a Soviet pilot in the cockpit of an Afghan Army plane. **********Since the United States began providing the guerrillas with Stinger anti-aircraft missiles several years ago, flying in Afghanistan has become a risky business for both civilians and military forces. **********After an unnerving flight this week from Khost back to Kabul, a Soviet reporter turned to an American correspondent on the plane and said, ''Your missiles and your women, they are both very dangerous.''  A Diplomatic Limbo **********The life of American and other Western diplomats in Kabul is strange, to say the least. **********The senior American diplomat, Jon D. Glassman, conducts no diplomacy, attends no Government functions and stays away from most Afghans. **********Washington recognizes the pro-Soviet Government of Afghanistan, but to demonstrate its reservations, the State Department does not post an ambassador in Kabul and bars normal diplomatic business. **********The same is true for many Western European nations. **********The Americans work in an impressive but largely deserted embassy building near the airport. The twisted wreckage of two rockets that slammed into the compound a year ago rested on a table outside the embassy library, reminders of the war and the poor aim of guerrillas, who apparently intended to hit the Afghan radio headquarters next door. **********American and other Western diplomats spend most of their time monitoring the political and military situation, although they are unable to travel outside Kabul. **********By far the most lavish, if somewhat empty, embassy complex belongs to the British, a large estate left over from the days of the empire. **********In what was once the ambassador's residence, now home to the charge d'affaires, visitors can leaf through game and fishing books once used to record hunting excursions. **********The last entry was Nov. 26, 1960, when Naim, the Afghan Crown Prince, went duck hunting with Lord Landsdowne and the British Ambassador.

Even in this day and age when the multibillion-dollar acquisitions of household-name companies have become commonplace, the sheer size of the offers was astounding: $20.3 billion for RJR Nabisco, $11.5 billion for Kraft and $5.23 billion for Pillsbury. **********With the value of the 10 biggest offers announced since July totaling a breathtaking $63 billion, people all over the country are wondering whether takeover mania has finally gone too far, threatening the economic health of the country. **********This year's binge of buyouts, acquisitions and stock repurchases is causing corporate debt levels to soar. Even before the latest deals, the debt of non-financial corporations had reached alarming heights, suggesting to some economists that corporate America might be headed for a debt crisis. **********At the end of June, the debt totaled $1.78 trillion, up from less than $1 trillion in 1982. Just the interest payments on that debt, according to the Federal Reserve, eat up 20 percent of corporations' available cash - a level usually reached only during recessions. **********The leveraged takeovers alone account for more than $300 billion of the debt, including $150 billion in bank loans and a similar amount in high-yield, high-risk ''junk'' bonds issued to finance the takeovers, according to several Wall Street firms. Most of the acquisition lending has been in the past two years, and the RJR Nabisco and Kraft deals would add $19 billion or $20 billion to the quickly rising indebtedness. **********Recognizing the debt problem, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned banks last week to be cautious in lending for buyouts. He also suggested that the Senate reconsider the tax incentive for debt financing. The law allows corporations to deduct from income all the interest they pay on loans. **********The latest takeover offers have made antitrust enforcement an election issue. While George Bush's camp defends the current, relaxed antitrust enforcement as healthy for the economy, Michael Dukakis's aides say that the Philip Morris Companies' proposed acquisition of Kraft Inc. would be closely scrutinized in a Democratic Administration. **********One issue would be whether there would be too great a concentration of food companies: Kraft's cheese and other food lines and Philip Morris's General Foods subsidiary. **********''If this takeover had been proposed in the 1970's, when Jimmy Carter was President, it probably would not have passed muster,'' said Robert B. Reich, who is a Dukakis adviser and a professor at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. **********The escalating takeover prices - until two weeks ago, the biggest deal was $13.4 billion - come just a year after the stock market crash and many fear that a speculative frenzy like the one that preceded the crash might be unfolding. **********John Kenneth Galbraith, the Harvard economist, says a better parallel is the binge of corporate borrowing that took place in the 1920's and ended in spectacular bankruptcies during the Depression. ''There is the same massive substitution today of debt for equity; it is one of the in-built destructive features of capitalism,'' he said. **********Many economists agree that corporations have become more vulnerable to downturns when they switch from stock to debt, as they have been doing. Stock has been liquidated at the rate of $100 billion a year in the past two years. **********What happens is that companies take on debt to buy out shareholders, as RJR Nabisco would do, often in the process becoming a private rather than a public corporation. But when hard times come, it is much easier for managers to reduce or cancel stock dividends than to persuade bankers and other lenders to accept lower interest or principal payments. **********''If you get a recession with equity, it is easier to live with than a recession with debt,'' said F. Michael Scherer, a Swarthmore College economist. **********If a recession should occur within the next two years - and most economists expect one by 1991 - a wave of bankruptcies could hit as companies defaulted on their loans. The fear is that such bankruptcies would turn a moderate recession into a severe one. A recent study by two Princeton professors of 1,500 large corporations concluded that if a recession similar to the one in 1974 were to occur now, 10 percent of the companies might go bankrupt. **********So far only one major buyout has gone broke: Last July, Revco D.S. Inc., the drugstore chain that went private in 1986, sought bankruptcy protection from creditors. **********Families could also be hurt if many other companies follow suit. The public has a stake in takeover loans because big chunks of the high-yield junk bonds are bought by mutual funds, insurance companies and, to a lesser extent, by pension funds. **********Some businessmen insist that the escalating prices being paid for acquisitions and the debt involved are already taking a toll. They say the cost of repaying debt is leaving some companies short of the cash they need to invest in their factories. **********''These are insane times,'' said Stephen R. Hardis, vice chairman of the Eaton Corporation, a Cleveland-based industrial company. ''We can't be competitive on a world-class basis unless we invest substantially in new technology, and we can't do that with a balance sheet heavily burdened with debt.'' Nevertheless, the deals continue. Some are driven in large part by the huge potential profits to be made by executives and their backers. A windfall can result from taking a company private and then selling it piecemeal for more than the original price, or by sprucing up operations and taking the company public again. Whichever of the competing groups wins RJR Nabisco - one is led by Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company and the other is led by F. Ross Johnson, RJR Nabisco's chairman, and Shearson Lehman Hutton - could make billions of dollars this way. **********But there is another engine driving the deals: the investment banks that arrange and finance them. The investment-banking fees and expenses for the RJR Nabisco deal could total more than $500 million, if Kohlberg, Kravis's $20.3 billion bid is successful, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. **********''Everyone I talk to has the same feeling, that there is something sick about a society where you can get filthy rich by doing this sort of deal,'' said Robert M. Solow of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, winner of the 1987 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science. ''It is an activity about as far from Florence Nightingale as you can get and that is what underlies the discomfort people feel.'' **********Despite the potential for so much profit, the Wall Street firms and the corporate executives who buy and sell companies take on little risk. The planned financing for the RJR Nabisco deal is not yet fully announced, but those familiar with such deals say that if Kohlberg, Kravis wins, it would probably work like this: **********Kohlberg, Kravis would make as a downpayment $2 billion of the $20.3 billion that would be paid to shareholders, at $90 a share. The firm itself might provide only $20 million of the $2 billion; the remaining $1.98 billion would come from outsiders who have invested in the firm's takeover fund, hoping for big profits. **********The other $16 billion to $18 billion would come from loans - perhaps $12 billion or $13 billion in bank debt and $4 billion or $5 billion in junk bonds issued in the food and tobacco company's name. The banks could resell much of the loans to other banks.  RJR Nabisco, of course, would have to repay the debt from its earnings, a not inconsiderable task considering that the interest payments would be close to $1 billion a year and the company earned $1.2 billion on revenue of $15.8 billion last year. **********But companies often obtain relief. According to Morgan Stanley & Company, about 25 percent of the $150 billion in junk bonds outstanding today allow the companies that sell the bonds to put off payments of interest or principal for five years. In some cases, nothing is paid; in others, new junk bonds are issued to cover interest costs. **********Such financing has even generated cries of alarm in the buyout field. In an Op-Ed piece in The Wall Street Journal last week, Theodore J. Forstmann, a senior partner of Forstmann Little & Company, warned that ''the rules of prudent investing are being violated again and again.'' He added: ''Surely, when the history books are written, the reason so many investors bought these bonds will be the financial riddle of our age.'' **********Indeed, whether these intricate transactions ultimately pay off depends on several assumptions that are anything but sure bets. One is that there is not a recession. Another is that inflation rises so that resale prices go up and debt can be paid off in cheaper dollars. But inflation now appears to be moderating and economic growth slowing. **********A related assumption is that the stock market today is underpricing companies and they will sell for more in the future. Barry S. Friedberg, a top investment banker at Merrill Lynch, shares this optimism. ''The level of stock prices, the level of interest rates and the great availability of financing all come together to make this a very attractive time to make purchases,'' he said. **********Even the steep recent premiums offered to buy companies don't faze him. ''There is no such thing as the ultimate value of a company,'' he said. That value, he said, is determined by the prices a business will fetch when it is sold piecemeal and by the availability of enough low-interest financing so that buyers can pay the big prices. Also important, he added, is the skill of new managers in improving profitability. **********But others say Mr. Friedberg's approach is becoming increasingly risky. For one thing, the strategy in many buyouts is to resell the companies in one form or another within five years; a recession would disrupt the schedule. Also, prices might be getting out of proportion to what acquired companies can earn to support their new debt. **********Right now, the biggest completed takeover is the Chevron Corporation's 1984 purchase of Gulf Oil for $13.4 billion. That stands to be eclipsed by Kohlberg, Kravis's $20.3 billion offer for RJR Nabisco, a bid that topped the $17 billion that Mr. Johnson and his partners have said they might offer. Overnight, such uninhibited bidding has made RJR Nabisco worth nearly twice its old value on the New York Stock Exchange. And if the nation's 19th largest industrial company is bought on credit for such a sum, then other big companies previously thought to be beyond any buyer's reach may not be. **********The overbidding for companies is widespread, many say. IC Industries, for example, this year sold its Pneumo-Abex division, an aerospace manufacturer, for $1.3 billion. The buyers were a partnership composed of the investment-banking firm of Wasserstein, Parella & Company and the Henley Group. **********Before they paid the $1.3 billion asking price, the Cummins Engine Company rejected it as almost twice Pneumo-Abex's real worth. John Hackett, then Cummins's chief financial officer, said his analysis of the company brought him to the conclusion that Pneumo-Abex's income would barely support the debt that would have to be incurred if it had been bought for $750 million. **********Mr. Hackett said he reported this to the investment bank that had brought Pneumo-Abex to his attention. ''They did not come back and say, 'Oh, no, you are wrong.' They said, 'That's what the market values it at.' '' **********DESPITE the criticism, some economists continue to defend debt-financed deals. They note that the high level of debt forces managers to run their enterprises more efficiently and get rid of mediocre businesses and unneeded personnel. The result is greater productivity, says Michael C. Jensen, an economist at the Harvard Business School. **********Mr. Jensen argues that debt-financed transactions - including managers buying their own companies, one company buying another, or a company simply buying up its own stock to avoid a takeover - promote efficient capital investment rather than hinder it. This assumes that when shareholders receive their buyout payments, they will reinvest them in growing companies starved for capital. **********Thus, when RJR Nabisco's stockholders are bought out with borrowed money, they will reinvest their windfall in, say, a biotechnology company. And the debt taken on to finance this process forces RJR Nabisco to use its earnings from cigarettes, a declining business no longer in need of much investment, to pay off bondholders. **********But this is a long-term process and perhaps an imperfect one. Instead of buying a biotechnology company's stock with their earnings, RJR Nabisco shareholders might instead buy a new car or a house. **********What's more, high debt can hurt companies. The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, for example, borrowed $2.6 billion in 1986 to buy back stock, as part of an effort to prevent a takeover. Robert E. Mercer, Goodyear's chairman, charges that construction of new tire factories that would aid the company in the hotly competitive world tire market has been delayed because money has had to be diverted to repay debt. **********James D. Ong, chairman of B.F. Goodrich Company, the chemical and aerospace concern, takes a similar point of view. Mr. Ong said the Kroger Company, the supermarket chain that is undertaking a financial restructuring to try to ward off takeover attempts, can afford to put its spending plans on hold. In retailing, delaying a geographical expansion or the remodeling of stores will not necessarily compromise a company's survival, said Mr. Ong, a Kroger director. **********But a highly leveraged buyout of Goodrich might have left it unable to develop such blockbuster products as its new lighter-weight, longer-lasting brakes for aircraft, he said. **********Takeovers, of course, have been an American corporate phenomenon since the 1960's, but only in the last five or six years have they been financed heavily through debt. Before, the custom usually was to pay for another company in stock or cash, taking most of the money from income and reserves. **********With borrowing now the preferred approach, the debt load of American non-financial corporations is now equal to 42 percent of the gross national product. That's unusually high for the United States, but in Japan, where debt financing is commonplace, the corporate debt load is equal to 100 percent of G.N.P. and in West Germany, it is 70 percent. **********In these countries - particularly Japan - the relationship between lender and corporate borrower is quite different from the United States. Bank lenders often also own a stake in the borrowing companies, and when companies get into trouble or need to take expensive risks, like developing products or trying to break into new markets, the banks find a way to help: deferring interest payment or refinancing the debt. **********A similar system is becoming necessary in the United States, says Mr. Jensen. Buyout firms like Kohlberg, Kravis might fulfill this function, he said, becoming ''the American version of the Japanese system.'' **********Besides providing them with financing, Kohlberg, Kravis also is majority owner of more than 20 companies, including such giants as Owens-Illinois and Safeway. ''Their reputation is tied up in the success of these ventures,'' Mr. Jensen said. **********But the Japanese system assumes long-term relationships between the companies and their backers and not the American strategy of buying and then quickly reselling a company. Mr. Jensen acknowledges that the Japanese-like role he envisions for buyout firms won't work if they come to rely on the profits from buying and selling companies rather than from the companies' earnings. ''If you get people involved just to do deals, then that's a problem,'' he said.  TAKEOVER FEVER HIT NEW HEIGHTS  Largest announced takeovers and buyout bids since July 1, 1988.

Timofeyev's daughter was assigned a school essay entitled ''The Happiest Day of My Life,'' the 14-year-old focused on the day in February 1987 when her father came home from prison as a wave of political dissidents was released from Soviet prisons. **********That Sofiya Timofeyev could praise her father, a man who challenged Soviet morality, in an essay for a school system that is the epitome of Communist conformity was as much a sign of the times as of Mr. Timofeyev's new-found ability to champion freedom of expression, freedom of movement and freedom of religion through his unofficial human rights organization Press Club Glasnost. **********Sofiya will not find out what grade she received until Wednesday. It will take far longer for Mr. Timofeyev to learn what his work will mean to his own fate and to his country's. For in a society that has always operated more by explicit permission than implicit consent, Mr. Timofeyev and the others who call themselves rights defenders, operate today in a new area of permission-less gray that expands and contracts arbitrarily. A Central Issue for Leaders **********This shifting perspective on human rights - with an image that changes depending on whether one looks at a free, active and accepted Andrei D. Sakharov; a harassed and occasionally jailed dissident like Sergei I. Grigoryants, or a husband kept from his American wife for seven years, like Sergei L. Petrov - is expected to be a major focus of President Reagan's visit here for his meeting with Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader. **********Mr. Reagan arrives Sunday and is scheduled to meet prominent dissidents Monday afternoon at Spaso House, the ambassador's official residence. **********These men and women now exercise some limited freedoms within the amorphous gray area of activities that are not officially approved. At the edges of this new freedom are harassment, surveillance and the prodding and poking of the security services -uniformed police and plainclothes K.G.B. agents. **********Beyond the edge is jail, where Mr. Grigoryants, who edited the unofficial journal Glasnost; Sergei Mkrtchyan, an advocate of Jewish rights; Valeriya Novodvorskaya, a political campaigner, and Olis Shevchenko, an anti-nuclear campaigner, have all passed hours or days in the last two weeks, on charges of violating public order or refusing to obey instructions of the police. Telltale Case of Armenian **********But that was jail, the local lock-up, not prison - which in the 1970's was the dissident's inevitable destination. The most likely sign of whether the road of dissent will again lead to prison is the case of Paruir Airikyan, the 39-year-old Armenian nationalist who has been in K.G.B. custody for seven weeks. **********The preliminary charge against him, slandering the Soviet state, is taken from a section of the criminal code that liberal intellectuals had thought was consigned to the scrap heap. But this law, created to break the nascent dissident movement in the mid-1960's, is still poised for use in such volatile regions as the Baltic republic of Estonia and in Armenia, in the south. **********The law - plus the presence of at least 17 and possibly many dozens more political and religious dissidents in prisons and psychiatric hospitals, the hundreds of Jews unable to emigrate and the official refusal to recognize the existence of one million or more Ukrainian Catholics - indicate that freedom of speech, movement and religion are at best a sometime thing in Mr. Gorbachev's Soviet Union. **********''That people are still in prison means there is still a zone of fear,'' Mr. Timofeyev said in a recent interview. ''A mother can look at her son when he's writing a plea for someone and say, 'What do you think you''re doing? People are in prison for doing that.' That's the zone of fear. That's what we have to eliminate.'' Unlike the Bad Old Days **********But, he added, ''the level of freedom here has become entirely different from the 1970's and 1960's. They could only dream about our scale of operations, our seminars. Our program is to change the Soviet Union - not to change the Government, but to change the legal code.'' **********At least one official member of Fyodor M. Burlatsky's year-old Soviet Commission on Human Rights, Mikhail A. Krutogolov, of the Institute for State and Law, said that a deeper transformation must occur for the notion of Western-style human rights to take hold here. **********''Human rights hasn't entered into our flesh and blood yet,'' said Mr. Krutogolov in a telephone interview. ''It wasn't there in czarist times, it wasn't there during the revolution or the civil war or Stalin's era or the great war,'' a reference to World War II. ''The whole Soviet people hasn't been ready for it. We would be doing well if it only took decades'' to get ready. **********If Mr. Krutogolov looks forward, however cautiously, to a Soviet Union that incorporates Western concepts of civic freedom and legal protections, others look with concern at the list of Jews denied emigration, at the number of dissidents who have not been freed, at other reminders that the pain is not all past. **********Abe Stolar's wait, for instance, is not over. The 76-year-old American citizen was brought here from the United States as a child. He and his wife, an Israeli citizen, have permission to leave. So does their 28-year-old son, Mikhail. But his wife, Yuliya Tryansunov, cannot get her parents' permission, and as a Soviet citizen, that bars her departure. Mr. Stolar refuses to go unless the whole family can go together. **********Like others who have endured long waits, Mr. Stolar's emotional clock is geared to the ups and downs of Soviet-American relations. Feelings Are Not Enough **********''The last time Shultz was here,'' he said referring to the American Secretary of State, ''I had the feeling we were going to get out. I have the feeling this time, too. But it takes more than feelings.'' **********Mr. Stolar knows why his daughter-in-law cannot go. Mr. Petrov, a freelance photographer who worked for three months at a radio electronics institute 11 years ago, had never known exactly why he cannot rejoin his wife, Virginia Johnson, a lawyer in Washington. **********''There is no violation of human rights in the Soviet Union,'' he said. ''They just don't exist here.'' To him, the right to emigrate is even more basic than the right to civic freedom within the country. ''The right of emigration is the right not to participate in a society, not to be part of it,'' Mr. Petrov said. **********He and Mr. Stolar are among the last of the cadre of Americans and their spouses who were struggling to reach the United States two years ago. At least 20 of the original group have been allowed to leave. **********Progress on emigration for Soviet Jews, ethnic Germans and Armenians has also been significant. **********The most recent figures from immigration authorities in Vienna show that the number of Soviet Jews reaching the Austrian capital climbed above 1,000 in April, still below detente-era levels of 4,000 a month in the late 1970's, but higher than any period since 1981. **********The most recent compilation by Moscow-based would-be emigres gives the names of 1,183 Soviet Jews willing to go public and announce that they have been refused permission to leave the country, according to Yuli M. Kosharovsky, who has been waiting 17 years. **********''I think the numbers are greater,'' he said, pointing out that widely accepted figures in early 1987 indicated that 15,000 to 20,000 people had been denied exit visas. Since then slightly more than 10,000 have left. **********''In early January, you could only request an exit visa if you had an invitation from immediate relatives abroad,'' Mr. Kosharovsky continued. ''Sometime in mid-Feburary that was broadened: your aunt or uncle could ask you. Now there's a rumor that they began tightening again at the beginning of this month.'' **********This year, for the first time in memory, representatives of those denied emigration are meeting with Soviet officials, representatives of the Foreign Ministry division that deals with humanitarian issues. Thus far, the meetings have been inconclusive, yet ''there''s a dialogue. They're trying to discuss the problem,'' Mr. Kosharovsky said. ''But in real terms things haven't changed that much'' in the process of deciding who leaves and who doesn't. Aroused Gorbachev's Interest **********Demonstrations are outside the gray area of permissible human rights activity. So is the work of Mr. Grigoryants. In an interview with The Washington Post last week, Mr. Gorbachev made it clear that he considered Mr. Grigoryants ''tied not only organizationally but also financially to the West. Therefore people think of him as some kind of alien phenomenon in our society sponging on the democratic process.'' **********In an interview of his own, Mr. Grigoryants said that his brief jail term and the confiscation of the material he used to put out the journal Glasnost was ''a sign of the present.'' **********''We live in a period of crisis,'' he said. ''The stable situation around us is fading away faster and faster. The situation is getting serious.'' The more unstable the economic and political situation in the country, he said, the more parlous the position of the dissidents. **********But, though Mr. Gorbachev sees Mr. Grigoryants as ''a parasite,'' Mr. Grigoryants sees himself, at least in part, as a Gorbachev supporter. **********''Gorbachev is a politician,'' he said. ''He, one way or another, comes from a political mind-set. We come out of a mind-set that is moral and ethical. In some cases our aims will coincide. But the details are different. He's saving the Government. We, briefly put, are saving the people. Sometimes those goals will coincide, sometimes not.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/26/business/the-media-business-advertising-people.html": {"writer_name": "Randall Rothenberg", "pub_date": "1988-10-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 60, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "People", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; People", "body_text": " *********** Harvey W.

The publication of polls is illegal in France a week before an election. **********A decisive triumph Sunday by the 71-year-old President over Mr. Chirac, the 55-year-old neo-Gaullist leader, would further splinter the right, tempting some center-right National Assembly deputies to explore tactical alliances with the Socialists, politicians say. Mitterrand Needs the Right **********''It is wrong to say there is going to be an explosion of the right,'' an influential center-right legislator said. ''But it is going to be different, and it is going to be new.'' **********In an arrangement called cohabitation, Mr. Mitterrand two years ago was compelled to accept Mr. Chirac as Prime Minister to administer the Government when the Socialist Party lost its majority in the National Assembly. **********Because the Socialists have only 215 seats in the 573-member Assembly, a Socialist-led Government designated by President Mitterrand would need support from the right to pass its legislation. **********It appears unlikely that such a minority government would be toppled immediately because center-right deputies grouped around Raymond Barre, a former Prime Minister, and Valery Giscard d'Estaing, the former President, have indicated that they will not vote to censure it. These so-called centrists fear a quick dissolution of the Assembly and legislative elections that they would have to fight under adverse conditions. Mutual Resentment **********A Cabinet minister said that Mr. Chirac's lieutenants have put out the word that, if Mr. Mitterrand is re-elected, the majority's two main blocs, Mr. Chirac's Rally for the Republic and the Union for French Democracy, should immediately show their unity. The Rally for the Republic controls 145 assembly seats and the Union for French Democracy, oriented toward Mr. Barre, has 129. **********''But there is still a lot of resentment'' of Mr. Chirac's party, the Cabinet minister said, alluding to the neo-Gaullists' aspirations to dominate the right and lingering bitterness over Mr. Barre's elimination in the first round of the presidential election on April 24. **********The resentment is mutual, as shown by a verbal slip by Mr. Chirac during a rally in Rennes. ''I cannot have confidence in Ray - '' the Prime Minister said, almost pronouncing the name Raymond Barre before checking himself and saying Francois Mitterrand. A Move Toward Le Pen?  The powerful showing on April 24 by Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the anti-immigrant, far-right National Front, has threatened to split the neo-Gaullists, with hard-liners like Interior Minister Charles Pasqua favoring a move toward the National Front's positions and moderates opposing such a shift. The possibility of a radicalization of the neo-Gaullists has made centrist politicians receptive to overtures from the Socialists. **********A pivotal group within the Union for French Democracy is the Center of Social Democrats, which is Christian Democratic in inspiration and which has 50 assembly seats. It is the leading candidate to be detached from the rightist majority to cooperate with the Socialists in governing France. **********But a centrist politician said the group wanted a change in France's majority-vote electoral law and a guarantee that its members will be returned to Parliament once the assembly is dissolved. The guarantees could involve Socialist candidates' stepping aside in certain constituencies. 'Continental Drift' **********A realignment of French politics, various politicians stressed, could be a messy procedure and could involve parliamentary deputies and leaders of various parties changing camps. Such a process would probably not be completed until municipal elections next March and National Assembly elections before or after that. **********Jean-Michel Helvig, a journalist at the Paris daily Liberation, likened the imminent realignment to ''continental drift.'' **********''But at the heart of the story, the decisive event is the death of political Gaullism,'' Mr. Helvig said. ''After the war, Gaullism managed to freeze all the different currents of the right -Christian Democrats, liberals, authoritarian conservatives - and these are what are appearing now.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/12/world/allah-and-gorbachev-mixing-in-central-asia.html": {"writer_name": "Bill Keller", "pub_date": "1988-02-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1406, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Allah and Gorbachev Mixing in Central Asia", "print_headline": "Allah and Gorbachev Mixing in Central Asia", "body_text": " **********Worshipers who come to the mosque of Imam Ibudulayev Nasrulo may sometimes find it difficult to tell where Mohammed leaves off and Mikhail S. Gorbachev begins. **********One week, at Friday Prayers in this town on the brown edge of the Kara-Kum desert, the young Imam explains to the local cotton farmers the Soviet leader's program of economic restructuring, or perestroika. **********Another week, the congregation prays for a treaty to eliminate medium- and shorter-range ground-based nuclear missiles. **********''We especially support the decree of the Supreme Soviet against alcoholism and narcotics, and the struggle against smoking,'' the 38-year-old Imam explained recently, as he sat cross-legged at a lunch of lamb pilaf and fresh fruit in the anteroom of his mosque. **********Such adaptation to secular politics is one way Islam has managed to stay alive in Soviet Central Asia, in a state that looks on any religion with distaste and on the followers of Mohammed with special wariness. **********Some Western analysts are persuaded that a formidable Islamic consciousness lies submerged in Soviet Central Asia, and that Islam together with anti-Russian sentiment there can be a combustible combination. **********Interviews with Moslem leaders and believers in Tadzhikistan and Turkmenia, two Soviet republics bordering on Afghanistan and Iran, indicate that a war of attrition continues between the state and Islam in the Moslem belt of Soviet Central Asia. **********To most outward appearances, the state is prevailing. Signs of religious fervor are rare, especially in the cities, where young people seem more inclined to congregate at video parlors and discotheques than at mosques. Among the men gathered for midday prayers at mosques in Tashauz and Dushanbe, the capital of Tadzhikistan, the average age appeared to be over 50. **********But the clannish societies of Central Asia are generally closed to the inspection of an outsider, and so are the private feelings of the young Uzbeks, Tadzhiks, Turkmen and other traditionally Moslem ethnic minorities. **********The possibility that the religious and anti-Russian sentiment could cause problems for the Government is not far from the minds of Soviet officials, especially since the anti-Russian riots that broke out last year in Moslem Alma Ata, the capital of Kazakhstan. **********''It must be admitted,'' said Vladimir V. Petkel, the K.G.B. chief in Tadzhikistan, in a speech published in a Dushanbe newspaper in December, that because of inadequate atheistic training, Moslem ideas find ''fertile ground.'' **********''This is illustrated by the dozens of trials held in 1986-87 of ringleaders, unofficial Moslem clerics who not only fanned religious sentiments but also called for a jihad against the existing system,'' the K.G.B. official warned. **********He said the clerics who favor a jihad, or Islamic holy war, have set out to infiltrate party, government and law enforcement agencies. Arranged Marriages Common **********Another sign that Islamic traditions are more persistent than they seem on the surface is the continued practice of arranged marriages and payment for brides. **********The Soviet press has reported cases of scores of young women setting themselves on fire to avoid submitting to arranged marriages. **********Moslem clerics interviewed in Dushanbe also acknowledged the existence of an unofficial ''Sufi brotherhood,'' a devout Islamic underground, although they professed to know little about it. **********Impassioned Islamic radio broadcasts from Iran and Pakistan are beamed into Soviet Central Asia in the local languages, urging Moslem solidarity and condemning the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. **********''We don't listen to them,'' said the young Imam of Tashauz. But Moslem clerics interviewed in Central Asia seemed generally familiar with their contents. **********Of the more than 275 million people in the Soviet Union, about 45 million are Moslems. Most of them are Sunni Moslems, and most live in the republics along the southern border - Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenia, Tadzhikistan, Kirghizia and Azerbaidzhan. This number includes some nonreligious people, including Communist Party officials who attend a mosque on festive occasions. **********Each republic has a different ethnic makeup, which affects the proportion of the population that is of Moslem background. Kazakhstan's population, for instance, is about 33 percent Kazakh and 42 percent Russian. Turkmenia, on the other hand, is about 65 percent Turkmen, 14 percent Russian and 8 percent Uzbek. **********Soviet officials say that while many families observe some Moslem rituals and holidays, these have become hollow customs not backed by any real faith. Education and the secular cultural attractions of city life seem to have worn away at traditional beliefs. **********''All these rituals have lost their religious tint,'' said Gennadi N. Skidanov, second secretary of the Komsomol youth league in Turkmenia. **********Komsomol officials in the two republics, who are responsible for ''atheist education,'' said they have recently stepped up their anti-religious campaigns with a focus on young women. **********''If a girl says she does not love the young man her parents want her to marry, and she comes to us for help, she gets our 100 percent support if she says no to her family,'' Mr. Skidanov said. **********In frequent newspaper articles and lectures, the Komsomol youth league encourages young people to foresake Moslem rites in favor of secular, ''Komsomol weddings,'' where, in the spirit of the Gorbachev anti-drunkenness campaign, no alcohol is served. To replace ritual circumcision, the Komsomol has invented a secular ceremony in which a newborn youngster is awarded a medal from the state. **********''We see our task as differentiating the genuine people's rituals from the religious ones, and explaining to people which part is religious and reactionary,'' Mr. Skidanov said. Efforts for Young Women **********The local youth press has featured articles praising young women who escaped from strict families to pursue their education and careers. Articles have called for earlier sex education to control the tendency toward families of seven, eight or more children, and have urged that the age of admission to official women's groups be lowered so young women can be weaned away from the influence of religious families. **********The opening of new mosques is regulated by the state, with the result that no places of worship have existed in Ashkhabad, the capital of Turkmenia, since an earthquake leveled the city in 1948. Organized religious education is banned outside of two schools in Bukhara and Tashkent. **********A methodical effort to divide, co-opt and tame the Moslem clergy has resulted in an official Moslem hierarchy that raises no public protest against restrictions on worship. **********''There is no contradiction between the Komsomol and religion, no antagonism,'' insisted Imam Ibudulayev Nasrulo, an Imam's son who studied in Bukhara, Tashkent and Egypt. He was picked last year to represent Turkmenia's Moslems in the Tashkent regional council of Islam, and is thus the spiritual guardian of clerics in the republic. Difficulties Unmentioned **********Asked if he could think of any difficulties confronting Islam in an atheist state, he smiled and said, ''The only problem for Moslems here is that there is not peace in the world.'' **********Imams who rise to senior positions in the sanctioned Moslem organizations tend to be those most willing to support the state's programs, especially promoting the Soviet image in the Islamic world. Last year in Baku, Soviet Moslems were host to an international Islamic gathering that served as a forum to denounce United States policies in the Middle East and praise Mr. Gorbachev's disarmament proposals. **********The Imam of Tashauz also sees the mosques as playing a role in advancing Mr. Gorbachev's domestic policies.

Interest in the mammoth case is so large that the hearing will be held in the ballroom of a hotel near the court. **********Texaco shares closed up $1 yesterday, at $45.125, on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Shareholders have filed 15 suits on behalf of the company against Texaco's top executives for mishandling Texaco's 1984 merger with the Getty Oil Company. That deal broke up a merger arrangement between Getty and the Pennzoil Company. After Pennzoil was outbid by Texaco, Pennzoil sued, arguing that Texaco had illegally interfered with a completed deal. **********Pennzoil was awarded $10.3 billion by a jury in Houston. Unable to post a bond required for the appeal, Texaco entered bankruptcy. Texaco and Pennzoil later agreed to a $3 billion settlement, to be paid on Texaco's emergence from bankruptcy.  Plan to Extinguish Suits **********The reorganization plan, if approved by the judge, would extinguish the shareholder suits. Its provisions also bar Texaco from suing the entities that sold it the largest blocks of Getty stock, the Sarah Getty Trust and the J. Paul Getty Museum, which, Pennzoil maintained, had earlier agreed to sell their shares to Pennzoil. **********According to other lawyers in the case, the lawyers for the shareholders will apply to the court for payment of their fees, which Texaco will not oppose. But the dollar amount of the bill has not been established, and other details are still open. **********''It's not a done deal,'' said one of the lawyers, ''it's not even a 90 percent done deal.'' But he confirmed the outlines of the agreement. **********Texaco announced late yesterday that it had entered into an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service that would permit negotiations to continue with the I.R.S. after the company emerges from bankruptcy. Under the agreement, Texaco plans to deposit $1 billion over four years in an account bearing no interest, beginning with $200 million on April 14, the day it plans to emerge from bankruptcy. Four other equal payments would be made on each anniversary of the first payment. **********Texaco also promised to maintain a net worth of at least $7 billion, and agreed to other financial limits, including restrictions on its ability to make payments to shareholders. **********According to Wilbur L. Ross Jr. an adviser to the equity committee, this provision would eliminate the possibility of a leveraged buyout of the company by limiting the amount of the debt the company could incur. **********''The I.R.S. has determined that, based upon the term of the agreement and its review of Texaco's financial information, the company will be able to pay the tax claims as and when they are finally resolved,'' the company said. ''The agreement is neither a settlement nor an admission of liability for tax claims on Texaco's part, but rather establishes a process under which tax claims against the company can be resolved.'' **********The I.R.S. claim results from a two-tiered oil-pricing system imposed by Saudi Arabia on Texaco and three other oil companies, the Exxon Corporation, the Chevron Corporation and the Mobil Corporation, from 1979 to 1981. Under the system, the Saudis sold oil to the four companies at $28 a barrel when the market price was $34, and ordered the companies to sell the oil to their subsidiaries at the lower price. The I.R.S. asserted that the difference between what the companies charged and the world oil price was taxable income. **********Even if Texaco successfully emerges from bankruptcy, its corporate troubles are not over. Carl C. Icahn, the head of Trans World Airlines who owns 14.8 percent of Texaco's shares, is pressing for a drastic restructuring of the company and T.

He said all other businesses would be required to open as soon as electricity was restored. **********Mr. Seaga said the decree would permit the Government to requisition vehicles and heavy equipment for transport of vital supplies to the eastern and western portions of the island, which were the hardest hit. **********The decree apparently also gives Mr. Seaga wide-ranging police powers, although aides said it was far less sweeping than martial law. 'To Restore Normality' **********The order, Mr. Seaga said, is ''designed to restore normality to civic life in the shortest possible time and to set the stage for the commencement of rebuilding.'' **********A few hardware stores, restaurants, gas stations, groceries and offices opened today, but only a few people returned to their jobs. Banks opened for the first time since the hurricane hit, but the demand for money was so heavy that many managers limited withdrawals. **********Most of the country's almost 2.5 million people remained without electricity, telephones or running water. **********Looting has been widespread, and scores of looters have been arrested.

Many were nearly overwhelmed, too, by the realization that recovery would take months, if not years. **********''We've had scares and we've had storms hit parts of the country,'' said Claude Clark, the chairman of a factory that produces and distributes products for General Foods in the Caribbean.

''No money, no bed, no house, no nothing,'' she said in a monotone. **********Like many of the Jamaicans left homeless by the hurricane - the Government has put the figure at 500,000 - Mrs. Gray and her family are now living with neighbors. But Government officials say thousands may be left stranded and that tent citites may become a part of the landscape. **********Two weeks ago the two main political parties in Jamaica unofficially started campaigning for an election in which Michael N. Manley hopes to regain the post of Prime Minister, which he lost to Mr. Seaga eight years ago. **********Mr. Manley's People's National Party had planned to begin its annual convention today.

Carlucci said today that no one from the United States Navy would be disciplined for the downing of an Iranian civilian jetliner by an American warship in the Persian Gulf last month. **********Mr. Carlucci and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., released a report on the investigation into events aboard the cruiser Vincennes, which shot down the Iran Air jetliner on July 3. killing all 290 aboard. **********The report listed a series of errors on the ship that led to the downing of the plane, ranging from the erroneous conclusion that the plane was descending, the report that it was issuing a signal identifying it as a military plane and the suggestion that it was outside a commercial air corridor. A Portrait of Confusion **********The report included a chronology of the episode that described high tension aboard the Vincennes, with men shouting and loose objects crashing to the deck as the ship maneuvered at high speed.  [ Page 5. ]  The 53-page ''Investigation Report'' appeared to confirm earlier news accounts that human error resulting from combat stress was among the main causes of the tragedy. ''Stress, task fixation, and unconscious distortion of data may have played a major role in this incident,'' it said. **********In his briefing, however, Admiral Crowe appeared to reject crew error as the sole cause of the tragedy. He said the commander of the Vincennes, Capt. Will C. Rogers 3d, would have fired in any event given the lack of clear assurance that the plane was not hostile. 'Mistakes Were Not Crucial' **********The admiral acknowledged that ''mistakes were made on board Vincennes that day,'' but emphasized the confusing combat situation rather than human error, and said that Iran was at fault for letting a civilian plane fly into a war zone. **********''Singly, the errors or mistakes were not crucial to the fateful decision,'' Admiral Crowe said. ''Even cumulatively, they do not appear to change the picture in a decisive way. The commanding officer never received the clear evidence that he felt he needed to establish that the Iranian aircraft had not come to participate in the ongoing surface action. **********''No disciplinary action will be taken against any Navy personnel.'' **********He said the ''villains of the piece were six significant problems'' that Captain Rogers could not control. He cited the sea battle in which the Vincennes was engaged at the time, the unidentified Iranian aircraft and the flight path of that plane directly toward his ship. **********''The unknown aircraft radiated no definitive radar emissions,'' the admiral said. He also cited warnings from the ship that went unanswered and the short period of time, less than five minutes, to make a decision. **********''It was only prudent for Captain Rogers to assume the contact was related to his engagement with the Iranian boats until proven otherwise,'' the admiral said. **********''The proof never came. I believe that, given the operating environment, Captain Rogers acted reasonably and did what his nation expected of him in defense of his ship and crew.'' Report's Recommendations **********The report by Rear Adm. William M. Fogarty, head of the investigation, recommended no disciplinary action but did urge that further study of combat-induced stress be undertaken. It also recommended that voice warnings to aircraft be revised. **********Lastly, the report said, ''if we must operate in a low-intensity conflict and in the presence of commercial air, we must train to that environment.'' It suggested several exercises, such as using drones to simulate commercial aircraft as well as hostile planes to train operators to sort them out. Aegis operators are trained to distinguish friendly military aircraft from foes, but do not recieve instruction on how to identify civilian aircraft. **********After the report was finished, Gen. George B. Crist, the Marine Corps officer who heads the Central Command responsible for American military operations around the Persian Gulf, issued what was termed a ''non-punitive'' letter of censure to a middle-grade operations officer aboard the Vincennes for having passed misleading information about the Iranian airplane to the captain. **********But Mr. Carlucci said that given the wide publicity about the episode, the letter would have been punitive, and ordered General Crist to withdraw it. **********Admiral Crowe also asserted that it was ''unconscionable'' for Iran to permit the plane ''to fly directly into the midst of the ongoing surface action in the Strait of Hormuz.'' **********The plane was on a regularly scheduled flight from Bandar Abbas, Iran, to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. Original Version Revised **********The report by Admiral Fogarty differs in many details from the initial statement made by Admiral Crowe on July 3, hours after the plane was shot down. The investigation found that the airplane was transmitting civilian identification signals, not military signals as Admiral Crowe initially reported, and that it was inside a commercial air corridor, not outside of the channel, as Admiral Crowe had said. **********But the conclusion that Captain Rogers acted prudently was much the same as Admiral Crowe's initial judgment in July. **********In a press briefing, Mr. Carlucci said: ''The investigators found that the captain acted prudently on the basis of the information available to him.'' **********The Defense Secretary said that he, Admiral Crowe and General Crist agreed with that finding. **********The White House press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, said in California today that President Reagan also concurred. ''This tragic accident was ultimately the result of the conflict between Iran and Iraq, which we now hope is on the verge of settlement,'' the statement said. A cease-fire in that eight-year war is scheduled to take effect Saturday. **********Representative Les Aspin, Democrat of Wisconsin and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said he was not disturbed by discrepancies between earlier accounts and today's report. **********Initially, he said, Admiral Crowe was relaying messages from the Persian Gulf. ''His choice was either to state what the messages said or to maintain silence,'' Mr. Aspin said. ''Neither the media nor the Congress would have tolerated the latter. The admiral should not be burned for the former.'' **********But, he added, ''We have not reached the bottom of this matter.'' He said the committee would hear from Admiral Fogarty next month ''and plans to look more fully into this incident to determine if reasonable changes might have reduced the chances of this tragedy occurring.'' A 'Puzzling Mistake' **********Admiral Crowe recalled that, in his initial report, the aircraft was said to be outside the commercial air corridor. Instead, the report showed that it was inside a 20-mile-wide corridor but off the center line flown by most civilian planes. ''The commanding officer interpreted that as unusual,'' he said. **********''Perhaps the most puzzling mistake was the ultimate call of Flight 655 as descending instead of climbing,'' Admiral Crowe said. He said everyone agreed that the plane was climbing until it was 15 miles away, when information passed to the captain became inconsistent. The reason for the inconsistency remains unclear, he said. **********The investigators did offer an explanation for the third significant misinterpretation of the electronic data: the Vincennes operator's false interpretation of a signal suggesting that the approaching plane was using the identification device of an Iranian F-14. **********When the operator searched for signals from the unknown aircraft, the Iranian civilian jet was close to the Bandar Abbas runway. But for 90 seconds, the operator did not shift the location at which he was seeking identifying signals - a step that must be taken manually. **********Thus, the operator may have mistakenly heard a signal from a military aircraft near Bandar Abbas where he was still searching, and attributed that signal to the civilian jet, which had left that location. **********Later, when the operator moved his search to a new location, no military identifying signal was heard. By that time, however, the crew had already mistakenly identified the plane as an F-14."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/28/business/futures-options-crop-prices-advance-by-daily-limit.html": {"writer_name": "H.

Renewal of Inflation Fears **********The sharp rise in commodity prices helped renew fears of inflation in the financial markets yesterday. **********The prices of Treasury bonds and notes fell as the commodity news contributed to a selloff that began overseas.

[ Page D10. ]  In commodity trading, one feature was a sharp rebound in the prices of cattle, hogs and pork bellies (uncured bacon). Brokers attributed this unexpected development, which sent futures contracts for cattle, hogs and pork bellies to daily-limit gains, to the belief that the recent sharp drop in livestock prices had discouraged further liquidation of herds. Additional Land for Grazing **********Also, new Government regulations have opened large amounts of public and private lands to livestock grazing. Other sources of forage are increasing as more farmers convert wilted crops to forage or make their lands available to livestock raisers. **********The recovery in livestock prices, combined with soaring grain and oilseed prices, sent the Commodity Research Bureau index of futures prices, a major inflaion barometer, soaring. The index jumped 5.34 points, to 270.52 of its 1967 base of 100, and it closed at the highest level since June 29, 1984, when it stood at 271.00. **********Moreover, the index rose despite the drop in energy prices and the mixed close in precious metals.

Assimos, manager of crop analysis at Cargill Investor Services, said: ''The pools of unsatisfied orders are large indeed. The latest we heard from the floor was that 36 million bushels of corn were wanted at the limit. The soybean pool is about 13 million bushels.'' **********Another indicator of the intensity of demand for soybeans and corn was, oddly, the daily-limit advance in Chicago wheat. The reason was that traders who could not or would not buy soybeans or corn, both of which are traded in Chicago, bought wheat. **********Many of the bidders for wheat in Chicago, as well as in Kansas City and Minneapolis, were those who had sold grains, soybeans or bean byproducts short during last week's heavy profit taking, brokers noted. Wheat Harvest Under Way **********Wheat prices should now be under considerable downward pressure because the harvest of winter wheat, which accounts for 75 percent of the total wheat crop, is in full swing. Now is also the time when flour millers, exporters and other buyers of the bread grain are selling futures short as a hedge against a decline in prices. **********As a result, the spot July, or nearest, wheat delivery in Chicago advanced by the limit of 20 cents a bushel, to $4.05, while spot corn rose the limit of 10 cents a bushel, to $3.525. July soybeans climbed the limit of 30 cents a bushel, to $10.595; soybean oil rose the limit of one cent a pound, to 32.30 cents, and soybean meal rose the limit of $10 a ton, to $320.70. **********In Minneapolis all oat contracts had daily-limit gains of 15 cents a bushel for the sixth session in a row.

''I do believe that MCI and U S Sprint have surprised A.T.&T., and what a good response.'' **********A.T.&T.'s shares closed yesterday at $29.375, down 50 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. A.T.&T.'s 2.8 million shareholders make it the world's most widely held corporation. **********Digital equipment will reduce labor costs because fewer workers are needed to run it. As a result, A.T.&T. plans to eliminate 10,000 network maintenance jobs and 6,000 operator jobs. The company said the 16,000 employees, about 5 percent of its work force, would be transferred to other positions rather than being laid off. Hiring Freeze Is in Effect **********The company has imposed a hiring freeze, which gives displaced workers a better chance of finding employment within the company. But some of them are expected to choose early retirement, A.T.&T. said. **********Steve Rosenthal, a spokesman for the Communications Workers of America, said yesterday that the union had expected the staff reductions and that it views them as layoffs. Mr. Rosenthal said that adopting the digital equipment would be good for A.T.&T. in the long run but that the company was ''still fat in terms of management.'' **********In the last four years, he said, A.T.&T. had cut 78,500 non-management jobs while adding 13,600 managers. ''I think some trimming needs to be done in that area,'' he said. **********A.T.&T. plans to have about 95 percent of its domestic traffic carried on digital equipment by mid-1989 and 100 percent by the end of 1990. **********The company said it expects the digital equipment to reduce its maintenace and other expenses by about 25 percent. Customers, however, may not see a reduction in their telephone bills as a result of the lower costs because they may be offset by other factors, A.T.&T. said. Components of the Charge **********The company said that about $5 billion of the $6.7 billion charge would appear on its books as a non-cash item to write down the old equipment. The remaining $1.7 billion is for the removal of the outdated equipment and reductions in employment. **********The $6.7 billion charge is the second-largest that A.T.&T. has ever taken against its earnings. The company took a $10 billion charge at the end of 1983 to divest itself of the regional telephone companies. **********A.T.&T. also took charges of $200 million in 1985 and $3.2 billion in 1986 to reduce costs."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/05/world/administration-says-it-plans-to-sell-75-f-16-s-to-israelis.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-04-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 149, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Administration Says It Plans To Sell 75 F-16's to Israelis", "print_headline": "Administration Says It Plans To Sell 75 F-16's to Israelis", "body_text": " **********The Reagan Administration told Congress today that it intended to sell Israel 75 advanced F-16 C/D fighter planes for $2 billion as a way to help bolster Israeli security. **********The new planes are to take the place of the Lavi, a fighter Israel had started to build but dropped last year because of excessive costs, officials said.

The ensuing selloff, this theory went, was exacerbated by index-arbitrage-related program selling, which turned an incipient 60-point loss in the Dow into a 101.46-point rout. **********Some analysts speculated that new rules intended to curb program trading also contributed to the sharp decline, because they severed the relationship between the cash stock market and the stock index futures market in Chicago. This, they said, allowed spreads between cash indexes and futures on those indexes to widen to the point that program traders could sell stocks and buy cheap futures blindly, and still make money. **********But other analysts, while acknowledging the role played by the trade report and index arbitrage, believe that many of the Monday-morning quarterbacks are missing the real point: The overall stock market has not recovered from the October crash, when the Dow fell 508 points, 22.6 percent, in one session, and is basically unhealthy because its lifeblood - small individual and institutional investors - has hemorrhaged. The market, they argue, is now only a poker game where a relatively few takeover artists, program traders and large insti tutional money managers (many of whom are forced by mutual fund or pension fund charters to invest in stocks) nervously play highly speculative hands, looking for a quick killing. **********''I thought we were in a bull market,'' said one big trader sarcastically, after last week's sudden collapse, which had wiped out most of the stock market's recent ''rally.'' This trader, who asked not to be identified, said ''the only strength in the market was provided by takeovers'' and by program traders, not by real investors or anything fundamental. **********The only surprise last week, he and other experts said, was that so many people professed to being surprised by Thursday's dramatic decline. **********These skeptics argue the following: If the stock market had any semblance of normality or health, it should by now be inured to surprises. Government reports come out all the time, and are often sharply revised in the next month. A healthy stock market, filled with investors who are basically confident about the economy, can shrug off bad news. A healthy stock market filled with investors who are nervous about the economy will shrug off good news. Only an unhealthy stock market, devoid of all but speculators and computers, will react the way last week's did. **********''We're going to see a pattern of run-ups on perceived good news, then drops on anything that comes along to throw cold water on it,'' said Thom R. Brown, chief investment strategist for Butcher & Singer, the Philadelphia brokerage. ''The market will continue to be erratic. This is a typical bear market. Psychology is probably the major component of stock prices, with fundamentals and other factors being less than half. When you have a day like Thursday, which erases the gains it took four or five weeks to get, it kills your market psychology, it just ruins it.'' **********Mr. Brown is a notable bear, who believes that Congress is on the verge of trade legislation that will repeat the mistakes of the 1930's and possibly create real problems in the high-flying Japanese stock market, and then worldwide. ''It's almost a given that the October stock market crash was trying to tell us something,'' he commented. ''And it's also fairly obvious that Washington wasn't listening. If the same folks who gave us the tax reform act give us a trade bill, we're going to be in big trouble.'' Ban on Program Trading Urged **********Needless to say, the avalanche of program-related selling last Thursday renewed the calls for the total banning of the practice. Mere curbs are not enough, many critics say, especially since some experts believe curbs - such as the New York Stock Exchange's 50-point ''collar,'' which cuts index arbitragers off from the exchange's computer order system - only made the situation worse. Better to ban the practice outright and lure small investors back into the market, the critics argue. **********But many large brokerage houses are likely to fight such a ban tooth and nail. The consensus is that, with retail stock business virtually extinct, index arbitrage is one of the few sure revenue producers left. In the bull market of yesteryear, an index arbitrage program that produced a profit of $3 million a month was lost among the flood of profits produced by junk bonds, new issues, investment banking, mortgage-related securities and other glitzy business. Today, that $3 million looks like King Solomon's mines. ''They are going to take their profits wherever they can,'' said one market expert. **********On the other hand, many brokerage house employees, including traders and account executives, are beginning to regard program traders as a threat to their livelihoods, since they blame them for driving investors out of Wall Street and back to Main Street - where the banks are."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/27/business/cuba-expects-growth-in-89.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-12-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 194, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Cuba Expects Growth in '89", "print_headline": "Cuba Expects Growth in '89", "body_text": " **********Cuba's economy will grow 1.5 to 2.5 percent in 1989, the head of the central planning board was quoted as saying today. **********Antonio Rodriguez Maurell gave the forecast during a meeting of the National People's Assembly, Cuba's parliament, last Friday.

He said he had expected Irving's core earnings - earnings adjusted for nonrecurring items - to be about $1 a share less than Irving's projection. **********An average of analysts' estimates compiled by Zacks Investment Research put Irving's 1988 earnings at $7.28 a share. **********At the same time, Irving Bank confirmed yesterday that it had filed suit against Bank of New York to block a proxy solicitation of Irving shareholders, an attempt to gain control of the Irving board. The suit was filed March 31 and was disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Charges Are Denied **********''We believe the lawsuit to be totally without merit,'' said Owen Brady, a spokesman for Bank of New York. ''I'm sure that we will ask for it to be dismissed.'' **********Mr. Brady said that his bank ''has no way of knowing the accuracy of the forecast'' and that Irving's forecast contained several nonrecurring items that had increased the projection. **********''Their claim that our bid is insufficient is nothing new,'' Mr. Brady said. ''They've been saying that for the last six months.'' **********The Bank of New York first sought Irving in September, offering $1.4 billion, or $80 a share. After the market collapse in October, it lowered its offer, which at yesterday's closing stock price would be worth about $1.1 billion, or $63 a share. **********The merger would create a company with more than $40 billion in combined assets, making it the nation's 11th-largest bank holding concern. **********In its letter to shareholders, Irving said that its board ''is convinced that Irving's inherent value far exceeds the price offered by Bank of New York.'' It based this conviction on Irving's two-month performance, which was in line with the 1988 earnings projection. **********Irving also said yesterday that it had reached an agreement with the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company to purchase Continental's branch in Seoul, South Korea.

He is barred from entering Belgium, and his political views cannot be printed or broadcast here. **********But the Government's French-language television network decided that its series on Mr. Degrelle last week qualified as history rather than politics. It was the first time that a program devoted to the Fascist leader has been shown, although interviews with him were allowed in a series on collaboration five years ago. **********Organizations of Belgian survivors of Auschwitz, Dachau and Mauthausen, Jewish groups and some Resistance organizations tried to block the broadcast, but the court said it had no competence in such matters. **********The Auschwitz Foundation, an educational association of concentration camp survivors, had this to say: **********''It is absolutely inadmissible and unacceptable to give a platform to an individual who is not only a collaborator and a traitor but who, even today, is an active neo-Nazi following his old objectives and denying the existence of genocide against the Jews.'' **********Some historians and politicians have expressed the hope that the Degrelle programs, which ended last Saturday night, will clarify the country's thinking about the period of German occupation from May 1940 to September 1944. The period remains one of the touchiest subjects for people over 60 years old. **********Mr. Degrelle was born in the Ardennes village of Bouillon in 1906 and by 20 was a leader in right-wing Catholic youth organizations. In 1932, as a journalist, he founded the Rexist party sharing the ideas of Hitler and Mussolini and right-wing Catholic thinkers. In the elections of 1936 the Rexists won 11.5 percent of the vote and 21 of the 202 seats in the legislature. But after it was disowned by the Catholic hierarchy, Rexism lost power and by 1939 had only one legislator left, Mr. Degrelle. **********In the occupation Mr. Degrelle offered the services of Rexism to the Nazis. Rexists filled key posts under the German military administration and served as Gestapo informers. Mr. Degrelle raised an SS regiment of 5,000 French-speaking Belgian Fascists and spent much of the war fighting on the eastern front. He reached the rank of SS lieutenant colonel and was decorated by Hitler. In interviews he still says his proudest moment was when Hitler told him, ''If I had a son, I would like him to be just like you.'' **********In December 1944, Mr. Degrelle was named by Hitler as Gauleiter, or Nazi leader, of Belgium, but never got to exercise the political office because the country had already been liberated by the Allies. On the last day of the war he escaped to Spain by plane. He acquired Spanish citizenship and lived under an assumed name until the 1970's. **********Like the 30,000 other Belgians who fought in German uniforms, Mr. Degrelle was indicted for treason after the war. He was not accused of war crimes, although some Resistance figures have said he could be accused of complicity in murder for the execution of hostages after Resistance assassination of Rexists. The Justice Ministry says the 14-year statute of limitation on such crimes has long expired. **********Mr. Degrelle himself is unrepentant. The series on him this week began with his statement from a 1977 interview: ''I was a Hitlerite then, and I am one still, to my dying day.'' Younger Belgians could get a hint of his ranting style of speech and his slurred backcountry accent. **********Much of the programs has consisted of statements by historians pointing out the exaggerations, inventions and outright lies in Mr. Degrelle's version of events. A psychiatrist on the program diagnosed him as suffering from megalomania and narcissism. **********''For us, he remains a war criminal, this person who persists in his errors,'' said Prof. Georges Schnek, who is president of the Central Consistory of Belgian Jewry. ''On the program he is a grotesque and stupid man, but I worry about the impact on those who still have a nostalgia for past power.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/03/world/anti-apartheid-editor-freed-with-restrictions.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-12-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 601, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Anti-Apartheid Editor Freed With Restrictions", "print_headline": "Anti-Apartheid Editor Freed With Restrictions", "body_text": " **********The editor of a prominent anti-apartheid newspaper financed by the Roman Catholic Church was conditionally freed from prison today after being held without charges for two years. **********But the journalist, Zwelakhe Sisulu, was immediately placed under tough new restrictions by the South African authorities. **********The Government also released seven other anti-apartheid workers, including Eric Molobi, coordinator of the National Education Crisis Committee, a group seeking to mediate among black parents, teachers and radical students.

And he may not leave the Johannesburg area without police permission. **********He is also prohibited from taking part in the activities of 10 organizations, including the United Democratic Front, the South African Council of Churches and the National Education Crisis Committee. **********Mr. Sisulu is best known for founding black journalist unions and pioneering a form of advocacy journalism that challenged common professional views about the importance of neutrality and objectivity. **********Aside from his most recent two-year term, part of which was spent in solitary confinement, he has been detained without charges or been put under house arrest several times."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/02/business/careers-selecting-a-specialty-in-medicine.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-02-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 702, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Careers; Selecting A Specialty In Medicine", "print_headline": "Careers; Selecting A Specialty In Medicine", "body_text": " **********ASTUDY by Glaxo Inc., the pharmaceutical company, confirms something that medical students have grappled with for years: Prospective doctors pick a specialty with difficulty, even a little agony. Glaxo discovered that ''an overwhelming majority of 80 percent of medical students'' believed they did not have enough valid information on which to base a decision. **********At the same time, 81 percent said that selection of a specialty was the most important decision they faced in medical school. Students usually must select a speciality during the third year of the four-year medical program. At that time, attention turns toward the type of residency and postgraduate training they will pursue. **********Traditionally, doctors have picked specialties on the advice of a relative in medicine, professors or other associates, or after making their own study of the field. For example, a proctologist said, ''I chose this specialty because it was in short supply, and I picked this county in New Jersey because there was only one other proctologist within 30 miles in most every direction.'' His practice is in Morris County. **********Now something helpful has been added - the Glaxo Pathway Evaluation Program, a three-hour workshop for third-year medical students, and a self-assessment loose-leaf binder in which personal characteristics can be matched against norms for various medical specialties. **********If choosing a specialty is difficult, there is also the problem of finding an area in which to practice. In addition, a choice must be made between individual practice, joining another doctor as a junior partner, or working for a health maintenance organization. Other options for a new doctor include research, teaching and working for a corporation or the Government. **********Dr. Stuart Bondurant, dean of the University of North Carolina School of Medicine and a member of the advisory group that worked on the program, called it ''not a quick fix'' but ''a process for making better decisions'' using real-world facts. **********Dr. Kenneth Tardiff, an associate dean at Cornell University Medical College, said, ''Half of the students postpone the decision until the last minute.'' He also pointed out that doctors sometimes changed specialties as their career goals evolved. He began as a neurosurgeon and now is a psychiatrist. **********Dr. Rita Charon said, ''I'm where I was - always an internist.'' She acknowledged, however, that choosing internal medicine was a hard decision, involving some anguish. She now is assistant professor of medicine at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons. **********Dr. Janis Mendelsohn, associate dean of students at the University of Chicago's Medical School, said that after two of the workshops held at Chicago, many second-year medical students asked to participate with the third-year students. **********This spring, Howard University's College of Medicine will use the program, according to Dr. George Nolan, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the school. Others that will use it include the University of Texas and Louisiana State University. **********Dr. Mabel L. Purkerson, associate dean at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis stressed that young doctors now faced much more competition in finding good places for training. **********The study materials also provide welcome information about which specialties will be in short supply in the 1990's and which geographic areas will have the most opportunities. Specialties where shortages are expected include anesthesiology, oncology, emergency medicine, hematology, physical medicine and rehabilitation, preventive medicine, psychiatry, sports medicine and geriatrics. **********In contrast, areas like gynecology and obstetrics, pediatrics, cardiology, pulmonary diseases and ophthalmology will be oversupplied with doctors in the next decade. **********So far, Dr. Ernest Mario, president of Glaxo, said, the company had borne the program's cost, although he did not know whether it would continue to do so as demand for it grows. There are 127 medical schools in this country and 16,500 third-year medical students."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/28/world/president-presses-contra-aid-plan.html": {"writer_name": "Julie Johnson", "pub_date": "1988-01-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 906, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PRESIDENT PRESSES CONTRA AID PLAN", "print_headline": "PRESIDENT PRESSES CONTRA AID PLAN", "body_text": " **********President Reagan began an intensive Administration lobbying effort today to win more than $36.25 million in aid for the Nicaraguan rebels.

Decision 'Tips the Balance' **********''I think that effectively tips the balance against his package,'' said Representative Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware, who was uncommitted before today. **********Mr. Carper said he had decided to vote against the President's request after taking part in closed-door meetings in which Democrats sought to forge a strategy and an alternative to the Administration's aid package. **********About 15 moderate Democrats met among themselves today and then a smaller group met with the House leadership to discuss their apprehensions about defeating the package without having an alternative plan. **********Representative Tony Coelho of California, the House Democratic whip, said the Democrats would seek a way to provide food, clothing and medicine to the rebels. **********The Senate is to vote on the aid request on Feb. 4. **********Facing what is sure to be a contentious legislative battle in the House, Mr. Reagan pledged today to make an all-out diplomatic effort for peace in the region and said he would personally consult with the presidents of four other Central American nations, asking them whether they believed the Sandinistas had lived up to their commitments under the peace plan. **********But in a speech delivered before a defense lobbying association here today, Mr. Reagan made no mention of consulting Congress, and a senior State Department official said Mr. Reagan had decided not to give Congress a direct say. Several members who are critical to the outcome of the vote had urged him to let Congress take part in the decision on whether military aid should be released after the March deadline. **********''If Congress cuts off aid to the freedom fighters next week,'' Mr. Reagan said, referring to the Nicaraguan rebels, ''there is little chance that the Sandinistas will bargain seriously.'' Aid Is Seen as Essential **********The speech clearly advanced the Administration view that renewed contra aid is essential to insure that the Managua Government will comply with the peace accord signed in August by the leaders of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala. **********''President Teddy Roosevelt once said diplomacy is utterly useless where there is no force behind it,'' Mr. Reagan said. ''I didn't come to Washington to preside over the Communization of Central America.'' **********He also said Secretary of State George P. Shultz might be sent to the region to enter into regional peace talks on a range of security issues. **********The contras themselves presented a peace proposal today that includes the withholding of some military aid but differs from the Administration plan in some details. The Associated Press said a contra leader, Adolfo Calero, made public a three-page ''Nicaraguan Resistance Proposal to the Sandinista Regime,'' which calls for placing any military aid approved by the Congress in escrow for 30 days. **********During the 30-day period, the statement said, the Sandinista Government should agree on a schedule for achieving national unity and on ''the specific determination of the geographical zones and modalities to be applied in the cease-fire, guaranteeing fully the integrity, security, mobility, communications and logistics of the belligerent parties.'' **********Neither side would be permitted to improve its battlefield positions or increase its armaments during the period, according to the proposal. It also set a 30-day deadline for agreement both on a cease-fire and internal liberalization and demanded a total and unconditional amnesty. **********In the Adminstration proposal, the $3.6 million to be set aside for military aid would be used to purchase such items as rifle ammunition, Redeye anti-aircraft rockets and other expendable munitions. **********On Capitol Hill today, a small group of Representatives, many favoring renewed contra aid, some still unsure, listened to Maj. Roger Miranda Bengoechea, a defector from the Sandinistas, advance the Administration view. **********''The vote will be very close and it will be decided by a thread,'' said Representative John Kasich, Republican of Ohio. **********Representative Jim Wright of Texas, the majority leader, met today at the White House with Mr. Reagan; Howard H. Baker Jr., the White House chief of staff; Lieut. Gen. Colin Powell, the President's national security adviser, and Kenneth Duberstein, the deputy chief of staff. **********Mr. Wright said he had told the President that the package ''would probably be rejected if there were any significant military money in it.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/05/business/edelman-bids-for-datapoint.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-04-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 261, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Edelman Bids For Datapoint", "print_headline": "Edelman Bids For Datapoint", "body_text": " **********In a revived effort to take the company private, the Datapoint Corporation announced yesterday that it had received a leveraged buyout offer of $6 a share, or about $60 million, from a management group led by Asher B.

Bills ARCO for $1.1 Billion", "body_text": " **********The Atlantic Richfield Company said today that the Internal Revenue Service had billed it for more than $1.1 billion in back taxes and interest in a dispute over how the company valued oil that it produced in Alaska from 1980 to 1983. **********ARCO said it would contest the bill, which is the second billion-dollar-plus assessment levied by the I.R.S. against a major oil company this year. In January, Texaco Inc. said the Government wanted it to pay $6.5 billion in back taxes. **********The ARCO tax dispute centers on the value assigned by the company to the crude oil it pumped from wells on Alaska's North Slope. The I.R.S. contends that ARCO assigned the oil a value lower than it should have at that point. A lower value at the well lessens the ''windfall profits'' tax that the company would have to pay, because that tax is based on a benchmark price derived from past production from a given oil field. Two-Tiered Mechanism **********The Texaco situation, however, related mostly to the two-tiered oil-pricing mechanism that was imposed on Texaco, the Exxon Corporation, the Chevron Corporation and the Mobil Corporation by Saudi Arabia from 1979 to 1981. Neither of the I.R.S. cases relates to settlements that Texaco, Exxon and other oil companies have agreed to pay the Energy Department for overcharging. **********Rival oil companies have long contended that ARCO was using unjustified internal pricing policies that minimized its taxes and allowed it to charge less for gasoline at its retail stations in the hotly competitive California market. Analysts said that the I.R.S. began investigating ARCO several years ago after complaints from other oil companies. **********ARCO now sells more gasoline on the West Coast than any other company, with a market share of more than 20 percent, analysts said. During much of the 1980-83 period, the analysts added, ARCO was often underpricing rivals by a cent or two a gallon at the pump. 'Price Advantage' Questioned **********''Everyone wondered how they got such a price advantage,'' said M. Craig Schwerdt, an analyst at Morgan, Olmstead, Kennedy & Gardner, a Los Angeles brokerage. **********Bruce Lazier, an analyst at Prescott, Ball & Turben Inc. in New York, said: ''To the extent you underprice your crude, you pay less of a windfall profit tax.'' **********Lower windfall profit taxes could in turn give the company greater pricing flexibility when it refined the oil and sold it as gasoline, jet fuel and other products. **********The tax bill received by ARCO consists of $557 million plus interest, which the company said would more than double the claim. ARCO said it was also subject to further assessment for a ''substantially lesser amount'' for oil produced in 1984 and 1985. **********In a statement, ARCO contended that its crude-oil pricing policies ''conformed to the economic theory for pricing Alaska crude oil widely held by highly regarded economists and by Federal and state government pricing experts.'' **********The company said that the Justice Department, the Energy Department and the Federal Trade Commission had previously concluded that the pricing theory used by ARCO ''was appropriate for establishing the value'' of North Alaska crude oil. **********ARCO, the nation's seventh-largest oil company, said that the I.R.S. claim was not a final figure and that it would try to resolve the dispute through continued negotiation. If the dispute ends up in court, ARCO said, it could take several years to resolve. **********A spokesman for ARCO, Albert Greenstein, said that the company had established a financial reserve for the bill.

But in the realm of trade, competition is intense not just to sell products, but to keep markets open and fair. At present, there is a sense of growing frustration about trade between the United States and Korea. **********Korea is now a major player in world trade. But in the realm of trade, competition is intense not just to sell products, but to keep markets open and fair. At present, there is a sense of growing frustration about trade between the United States and Korea. **********On the American side, our enormous trade deficit with Korea and the reluctance of the South Korean Government to quickly liberalize its trade policies are unacceptable. As a result, the United States can be expected to pressure Korea on those two items. **********On the Korean side, American pressure is triggering animosity. And this animosity toward the United States is enhanced by uncertainties over Korea's access to our market in the future. To move this relationship in a constructive direction, we believe the two Governments could take a number of helpful steps: **********Bilateral confidence-building measures are called for. A good jumping-off point for the United States is to forthrightly credit Seoul for the trade liberalization measures it has already taken. **********Washington has ample justification to continue pressing for market access in South Korea, particularly in the highly protected agricultural sector, and for further appreciation of the Korean won. We also want to see the Koreans change their import distribution system because now only certain certified companies can import and distribute the products. This distribution system effectively restricts American exporters' access to their customers. In addition, ''localization requirements'' force Korean producers to use locally manufactured inputs and as a result limit American exports. **********Korean negotiators insist that they are doing everything possible to resolve trade disputes with the United States. They point out, for example, that Seoul recently announced tariff reductions on 2,188 specific items. Left unmentioned by Seoul was the fact that close to 500 additional items remained untouched. Not surprisingly, the biggest omissions were to be found in just those product areas where the United States has been demanding expanded market access, for beef and agricultural goods. **********But in the aftermath of recent Cabinet shake-ups, the Government of President Roh Tae Woo may feel pressure to stiffen its negotiating stance with the United States. It has already encountered strong opposition at home for the concessions it has made to the United States. The job of selling the opening of Korea's markets to a skeptical domestic public will be made easier - and politically defensible - if the United States gives Korea recognition for the steps it has already taken. **********In addition, Washington should work with Seoul to devise indirect ways to reduce our trade deficit with Korea. The opening of markets in third countries provides a means of doing so. This could begin with Japan, with which Korea ran a merchandise trade deficit of $5 billion in 1987. **********Why should this be an American concern? Because Japanese import barriers divert large volumes of Korean goods to more open markets, notably the United States. Even if Japan were suddenly to liberalize its import regime, Korea's export drive in the United States would continue. But over the longer term, such a step by Japan would help create an alternative market for Korean goods. Our bilateral relations will also reap indirect benefits if Washington and Seoul work together closely to open other markets in the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations. **********Korea's program to spur domestic growth and consumption deserves American support. Over the long term, such an emphasis will allow it to reduce dependence on exports as an engine of growth, while lifting the standard of living. There are encouraging portents. Fully one half of Korea's gross national product growth in 1987 came from domestically generated demand. With salaries on the rise, personal consumption continues to increase. **********Of course, Korea has a way to go. Last month a Presidential commission on economic restructuring issued a final report supporting accelerated efforts to stimulate domestic growth. When it was at a comparable level of economic development, Japan was not even contemplating such a shift. **********But the matter cannot be left there. Restructuring efforts must now be directed toward freeing up competitive pressures in traditionally protected sectors, beginning with agriculture. Using 25 percent of the nation's work force - roughly four times America's proportion - Korea's agricultural system is ripe for reform. Granted, this will not be easy. But further delay in grappling with Korea's wasteful agricultural sector will, if anything, only exacerbate Korea's transition into a fully competitive, open economy. **********Finally, in light of Korea's impressive economic performance, Washington should encourage Seoul to accept economic responsibility in bilateral trade and security areas. The Reagan Administration recognized Korea's status as an advanced developing country earlier this year when it withdrew special tariff concessions granted to Korea under the generalized system of preferences, a program for less-developed countries. Korea already undertakes a substantial share of the cost for the combined defense of the Korean peninsula. It would be helpful to our relationship, however, if Korea were to move ahead to take even greater charge of its own defense and become a major participant in the proposed multi-national aid initiative program for the Philippines. **********These changes in American and Korean policies will not and should not lessen the demands by the United States and other countries for Korea to open its markets to agricultural as well as manufactured goods, for services as well as products, and to trade in full accord with established rules of fair trade. **********The policy changes called for above, however, will demonstrate to citizens in both countries that our Governments offer each other mutual respect and support. This improved atmosphere will, we hope, help propel Korea toward further economic advancement and at the same time move Korea toward full-fledged participation in a liberal trading system."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/19/business/business-forum-reagan-s-final-summit-conference-forecast-for-all-talk-no-action.html": {"writer_name": "Joel Kurtzman", "pub_date": "1988-06-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1798, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Interview", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Forecast Is for All Talk, No Action", "print_headline": "BUSINESS FORUM: REAGAN'S FINAL SUMMIT CONFERENCE; The Forecast Is for All Talk, No Action", "body_text": " **********The annual economic summit conference of the Group of Seven nations begins today in Toronto. Heads of state from the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada will meet, but most analysts are not expecting breakthroughs. Important items on the agenda include giving a greater role to gold in fixing exchange rates, phasing out agricultural subsidies and prompting the European countries to increase their rates of economic growth. In Toronto, the G-7 leaders will also be bidding farewell to President Reagan. Business Forum editor Joel Kurtzman talked with summit planners, past and present, and with analysts about what to expect from Toronto.  Herbert Stein  Senior fellow, American Enterprise Institute and former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. **********I don't have any expectations for the summit. I don't see that they have anything to do other than congratulate each other on how well things are going - and things are going well. They will recommit themselves to the fight against protectionism. I see reports about giving some role to gold with regard to currency exchange rates, but I don't see that as a reality. **********I don't think any of the conventional economic problems require them to do anything - and I hope they won't do anything. **********I don't think they should be discussing monetary policy. Each country should follow its own monetary policy. If they don't try to fix exchange rates then each country will do it on its own. **********Economic policy coordination has been the buzz word and I think it's an empty box. I don't think any country will adopt a policy for another country's benefit. **********I think summits are a good idea, but I don't think they should be economic. When the leaders get together they ought to talk about political problems. I'm not saying they shouldn't discuss economics, only that there are other forums. These times require that economics be left to the market.  James Tobin  Nobel Laureate, Sterling Professor of economics, Yale University. **********Not too much will happen in Toronto. There will be a lot of self-congratulations and some farewells to Reagan. I don't think they'll do anything very substantive. They will like the idea of maintaining the stability of the dollar - which I think is unwise. In the longer run, you won't be able to hold the dollar at rates agreed on over the telephone between our Treasury Secretary and their finance ministers. Our part of the bargain may be that the Federal Reserve has to raise interest rates. But our trading partners won't have much incentive to do much to stimulate their economies. We still need expansion overseas while we struggle to get our budget deficits down and fight recession. **********They should look at true policy coordination between Japan, Europe and the United States. They should talk about lower interest rates and fiscal stimulation overseas. Europe has been growing slowly and has never fully recovered from the 1982 recession. They ought to stimulate their economies and become big boys and take a role in the world economy. **********The summits were supposed to focus on the world economy. We need coordination on the macroeconomy. But the summits now focus on whatever is a topical event.  Daniel G. Amstutz  Ambassador, special envoy for agriculture, trade and development. **********There is no question that agriculture will be on the table at the summit. There are two major agriculture problems to be discussed. First, the countries with surpluses have built import barriers that make it impossible for them to take in any imports. There is also the subsidization of exports. **********The countries most hurt by export subsidies are the developing countries. These countries need an economic climate conducive to the growth of their own agriculture. Right now, because of import barriers and the export subsidies of the G-7 countries, there are great disincentives to agricultural development in the third world. **********The Tokyo summit agreed to get rid of these subsidies. Implementing legislation is now needed, which means that G-7 countries must deal with their own domestic politics. The summit will give the multilateral negotiations, like the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a push. But don't expect negotiations to take place at the summit. The summit is only designed to push the process.  Henry D. Owen  President of Henry Owen Inc. and former ambassador-at-large in charge of planning for the economic summit meetings in the Carter Administration. **********I don't think that there will be any real breakthroughs. The United States has to take the lead if something is going to happen and pledge a reduction in the budget deficit for there to be any action from Japan or Europe. I think there will be a let's not rock the boat attitude. **********The summit will focus on the long-term questions like restructuring the economies of Germany and Japan. The Japanese have extraordinarily high rates of savings and it is very difficult for them to move their savings into investments. The leaders might talk about the regulation of financial markets in Japan to make it easier for savings to be invested. **********The leaders might also talk about the rigidity of the work force in Germany, which makes it difficult to move labor, bring on new labor and also to get rid of labor. The structural trade problems will also be an issue - like eliminating all subsidies on agriculture for Europe, and getting reciprocity with Japan on financial services like banks and insurance. **********If the summit doesn't settle the issue of the German and Japanese trade surpluses and the American deficits, then these problems will become worse and will have to be settled by the next administration. If these are not settled they could make the possibility of renewed inflation and a recession more likely.  Robert D. Hormats  Vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International Inc. and former Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs **********This summit will will be aimed at building confidence that the leaders are working together to foster a smooth reduction in the United States trade deficit. There is a feeling that the process is going well in managing the exchange rate. **********I don't think that the leaders at the summit will achieve drastic results on agriculture. The Europeans are not in an expansive mood on this front so the problems will fester. **********In general, this is a summit that will be measured not in dramatic action but in laying out an agenda for the next three years or so. **********The leaders will consider economic policy coordination between the G-7 countries and the summit should give this notion political support. **********On third world debt, I don't think they'll make much progress on the broad issues. But they will make some progress on specific agreements to help the poorest countries. **********On East-West trade, they will discuss the desire of the Soviet Union and China to participate more in the world economy and in organizations like the GATT and about how to go about expanding trade. **********The Japanese and Europeans want to expand their ties quickly but the Administration doesn't want to go as fast. There is a danger here that we will replay some of the differences of the 1970's, when Europe wanted better trading relations with the Soviet Union and we didn't. There wasn't enough preparation done on this issue because no one predicted that the United States and the Soviet Union would have gone as far as they did at the Moscow summit. **********It is clear that Secretary Baker would like to see economic indicators, like commodity price changes and inflation rates, play a greater role in the coordination of economic policy between countries. This was laid out at the Tokyo summit and he would like to see it built into the system. The way it would work is that if your performance fell short on an indicator such as the inflation rate, it would suggest a need for a country to shift its policy. He would like to see commodities used as an indicator for the dollar exchange rates. **********The progress on the trade balance will be seen as an encouraging sign. However, we are still suffering from a very large current account deficit and this amount has to be financed. **********It is hard for a summit to reach new agreements. I think they have avoided setting ambitious goals for this summit. And the issues aren't at the point where the heads of state can reach agreement - there are still large gaps, especially with respect to agriculture. If the governments were in agreement on these issues, then the leaders could push them over the top.  Anne O. Krueger  Arts and Science Professor of economics at Duke University and former vice president for development economics at the World Bank. **********No one is expecting very much of anything. There won't be any new initiatives. The Administration has said they want to move as quickly as possible to phase out subsidies to agriculture. It's an issue where if everyone does it at once, it's a lot less painful. But I don't see any evidence of this happening. The Americans and Canadians want it; the Japanese and Europeans have political problems dismantling their systems of subsidies because of pressure from their farmers. **********We have the same pressures but the barriers here are not as high in the first place, so it is not as difficult to remove them. The Europeans are exporting subsidized wheat - dumping really. There are too many people working in agriculture in Europe and Japan, and to a lesser extent, there are too many working here as well. Right now we spend about $30 billion subsidizing our grain. The Reagan position is to go toward unified subsidies over the next few years and then phase them out. So far there is nothing but verbal support. **********I take the view that for the third world the most important thing the advanced countries can do is maintain an open trading system. Support from the summit for the Uruguay Round of the GATT is crucial if anything is to happen."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/16/business/10-states-join-liability-suits.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-06-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 239, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "10 States Join Liability Suits", "print_headline": "10 States Join Liability Suits", "body_text": " **********Leading United States insurers conspired to stop providing some kinds of liability coverage, touching off a nationwide insurance crisis, 10 states have charged in lawsuits that echo earlier suits. **********The new suits, filed Tuesday in Federal District Court, follow eight others filed in March.

But the companies and advertising agencies that are selling them this way may be missing out on the vast market for older Americans, according to a forthcoming study. **********The study by the Daniel Yankelovich Group, the public-opinion and market research firm, shows that older Americans, whom marketers have viewed as typically resistant to new technology, in fact reject many products simply because they are advertised primarily as time-saving conveniences. **********Only a third of Americans in their 60's, and fewer in their 70's, say they are ''always looking for new ways to save time,'' the survey found. Instead, people in retirement often have little but time, so they tend to look for activities that take up time, like cooking, and that enable them to leave the house, like going to the movies or the bank. Automatic Tellers Cited **********''The market isn't attuned to the needs of older people,'' said Daniel Yankelovich, the chairman of the research firm. He cited automatic teller machines. ''You have a technology designed for convenience and time saving, whereas older Americans are looking for something that's time filling,'' he said. **********The survey supplements a growing body of research indicating that marketers have reached older citizens improperly, if at all. There are 28.5 million Americans 65 or older, and 22 million between 55 and 64, according to Census data. **********For example, video cassette recorders are often positioned to appeal to the stay-at-home, or ''cocooning,'' instincts of Baby Boomers. But about 40 percent of all people between 60 and 80 do not look forward to evenings at home, the survey found. ''If I want to see a movie, I'd rather go out,'' one person told the questioners. A New View of Chores **********The survey also indicates that older people approach household chores differently from younger people. As early as age 60, men and especially women who may have viewed domestic responsibilities neutrally or unfavorably begin to find them more pleasant. Moreover, at age 70, more than half of all people begin to view chores as good exercise. The study concludes that ''shopping emerges as the ultimate chore turned pleasurable activity.'' **********''If you had products that took as long or longer, but were easier, more sociable and more pleasant, companies would be marketing to senior citizens' 'hot buttons,' '' Mr. Yankelovich said. **********Lloyd N. Morrisett, the president of the John and Mary R. Markle Foundation, the nonprofit organization that commissioned the survey, said that the study suggests that certain consumer technologies should be modified to appeal to senior citizens. **********For example, focus-group interviews indicated that senior citizens reject automatic teller machines because they like dealing with bank tellers. ''But A.T.M.'s can easily be redesigned to include other functions that would make them more appealing to older people,'' Mr. Morrisett said. An A.T.M. could be programmed to serve as an electronic bulletin board through which friends can leave each other messages. ''Older people desire that kind of social interaction,'' he said. Varying Definitions of Quality **********Mr. Yankelovich said the survey also indicated a difference between marketers' and older consumers' definitions of quality. ''The traditional way of building quality into a product is to load it with additional features - the more quality, the more complex,'' he said. ''But the features that would make products more meaningful to senior citizens would simplify them and relieve physical effort.'' **********For example, adding features to a microwave that can brown food and automatically start the oven often involves putting more and smaller controls on the operating panel. ''But these are not meaningful features for older people,'' said Mr. Yankelovich, who added that older people prefer microwaves and other equipment with fewer control buttons and larger lettering."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/08/world/turkey-moves-out-2000-iraqi-kurds.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Cowell", "pub_date": "1988-09-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1242, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TURKEY MOVES OUT 2,000 IRAQI KURDS", "print_headline": "TURKEY MOVES OUT 2,000 IRAQI KURDS", "body_text": " **********Turkey transferred at least 2,000 Iraqi Kurdish refugees to Iran against their wishes last week, Turkish reporters and witnesses in this mountainous border region say. **********More than 50,000 Kurds have fled Iraq because of a major Iraqi offensive against Kurdish guerrillas in the northern regions over the last two weeks. **********It is not clear whether the transfer into Iran was an isolated move by Turkey or part of a concerted campaign to move the Kurds there. Iran has long supported the Kurds' rebellion against Iraq. Only Temporary Refuge Given The influx of the Iraqi Kurds has put Turkey in a difficult position. It does not want to provoke criticism from abroad by seeming heartless toward the Kurdish refugees, but the Turkish authorities, who have problems with their own Kurds, have repeatedly said that they are providing only temporary refuge for the Iraqi Kurds. **********Diplomats have depicted the Iraqi offensive as a final drive to crush decades of revolt among its Kurdish minority. It began after the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war. **********Initially the fleeing Kurds, trekking over high mountains scarred with deep ravines, took refuge in valleys close to the frontier with Iraq. But Turkey, fearful of the proximity of Kurdish guerrillas to their Iraqi foes, has begun trucking them to camps away from the border. One of them is in this southeastern city, considered the unofficial capital of Turkey's Kurdish-speaking area. The Turkish authorities are faced with delicate choices in their handling of the Kurdish refugees, and critics have charged that their approach has shown ambiguities. While Turkey opened up its border to the Iraqi Kurds, it has made clear to them that it does not want them on its soil permanently. Critics of the Ankara Government say its welcome is offset by such actions as sending the Kurds on to Iran and denying international aid agencies access to the refugees. **********Foreign Minister Mesut Yilmaz, aware of European sympathies for the Kurds, said Tuesday: ''They will be asked whether they want to move to Iran or not.

The majority of the Kurds were being trucked across the border ''without knowing where they are heading,'' the newspaper said. Local Politician Quoted **********The paper quoted a local politician, Ibrahim Kaya, as saying the Kurds, including disarmed guerrillas, were being transferred ''against their will.'' **********The authorities in Ankara have offered no formal comment on the report. One West European witness said she had seen Iraqi Kurds, including young children packed into open trucks, being transferred the 20 miles to Iran and handed over to the Iranians at a border village called Alan. **********The Teheran authorities have said 7,000 Kurds fled to Iran, 2,000 of them through Turkey. **********Iran backed the Iraqi Kurds in the latest round of revolt against Baghdad. But the cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war prohibits Iranian soldiers from crossing the border with Iraq, severing a critical supply line and leaving the Kurds bereft of outside backing and facing a concerted assault by elite Iraqi forces. Iraq Offers Amnesty **********President Saddam Hussein of Iraq offered the fleeing Kurds an amnesty Tuesday, in a move regional specialists said was designed to defuse international condemnation and insure that no Kurdish dissidents remain outside his borders to plan further insurrection. **********The Turkish action in sending Kurdish refugees to Iran is apparently designed to reduce the number of Kurds on Turkish soil. **********Turkey, a NATO member seeking to join the European Community, is eager to promote its image as a democracy in the Western mold respecting refugees' rights. At the same time, Prime Minister Turgut Ozal is facing a referendum this month that has been cast as a vote of confidence. Turkey's Kurdish minority, numbering eight million, forms a sizable part of the electorate in this land of 50 million people. **********At the same time, Turkey is fighting its own insurgency against a separate group of Kurdish militants, and has pursued a foreign policy that tries to balance ties with two bellicose neighbors: Iran, which has traditionally used Kurdish dissent to harass the Baghdad Government, and Iraq, which wants to enlist Turkey's help in neutralizing the Kurdish threat. Turkey Bars Iraqi Pursuit **********Accordingly, Foreign Minister Yilmaz said Turkey had refused an Iraqi request for permission to pursue Kurdish guerrillas in Turkish territory. He said the official number of Iraqi Kurds who have fled to Turkey was 56,377, down from an earlier estimate of 62,937. He did not say if the discrepancy related to the reported enforced move to Iran. **********''They have a problem,'' a Kurdish lawyer here, who asked not to be identified by name, said of the Turkish authorities. ''They don't want the Iraqi Kurds to infect Turkish Kurds with their ideas of autonomy. And they don't want to get into a fight with the Iraqis.'' **********With Baghdad's reassertion of authority over border areas once called ''liberated zones'' by dissident Kurds, moreover, Iraq now controls a main access route for rebellious Turkish Kurds. Turkish newspapers said today that some of these Turkish Kurds had sought to infiltrate with the Iraqi refugees and had been apprehended. **********''It is very difficult for us,'' said a Kurdish businessman elsewhere in Turkey. ''The Iraqi Kurds are our relatives. We want to help them. We'd have gone to the authorities and said, look, we can give them food, medicines, houses. But the Government just says no.'' No Official Recognition **********Turkey does not officially acknowledge a Kurdish ethnic identity, while Iraq's Kurds have nurtured nationalist sentiment as part of their war against Baghdad. **********''The last thing the Turks want is to have their own Kurds thinking they could do the same as the Iraqi Kurds,'' said a Kurd who was interviewed by telephone in Western Europe and declined to be quoted by name. Turkey's Kurdish dissidents, grouped in the Kurdish Workers Party, a Marxist organization, have sought to feed on Kurdish dissatisfaction with Ankara's refusal to acknowledge them as a separate people. **********International relief agencies have said Turkey has not responded to offers of help. Western relief workers flying into the border area have also said Turkey has turned down offers of medical and other assistance. Turkish newspapers today quoted a spokeswoman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Judith Kumin, as saying Turkey had given no reply to the agency's offer of assistance. **********''What is going to happen to them?'' the Kurdish businessman said. ''The snow starts in the border area in late September. Winter is on its way. These people will be in tents. How will they survive?''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/14/business/company-news-sec-investigates-pillsbury-trading.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-10-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 189, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "S.E.C.

Some lawyers said they would not rest until she was put in jail. **********The lawyers, who once mounted a nationwide strike that brought a temporary halt to the Indian criminal justice system, accused Mrs. Bedi of ''dereliction of duty'' in reportedly failing to prevent attacks on them in January and February. **********Mrs. Bedi, who is 39 years old, had earlier become known throughout India because of many battles against the establishment. Many women looked to her as an example of advancement in traditionally male-dominated preserves. **********The first woman to join the Indian police force, Mrs. Bedi once personally led a charge against rowdy demonstrators. Later, while in charge of the traffic police, she ordered the towing away of cars throughout New Delhi, including the car of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. **********Now Mrs. Bedi and her many supporters charge that the lawyers singled her out because of her honesty and courage in again refusing to give special treatment to powerful groups. **********A typical letter to the editor said she had obviously ''interfered with things that she really shouldn't have, like criminals, illegal trade and other undesirable activities.'' **********Mrs. Bedi said in an interview that she would not give up her fights or her tactics. ''Mentally, I am preparing for a five-year battle,'' she said. ''All my life has been devoted to fighting injustice for others. This is the first time I've had to fight injustice for myself.'' **********Several groups, including women's groups, have come to Mrs. Bedi's defense and criticized the Government for transferring her, even though the shift was not considered a demotion. In her new post as director of investigations of narcotics traffic throughout the country, she may at least be less visible for a time, police officials say. **********The unusual fight between Mrs. Bedi and the New Delhi legal establishment began in January with the arrest and handcuffing of a lawyer for petty theft. Lawyers at the main court complex in the old part of the city immediately went on strike, charging that lawyers were not supposed to be handcuffed in such cases. **********The strike quickly spread nationwide and led to two violent clashes, in which the lawyers charged that Mrs. Bedi had failed to protect them. Her Office Is Stormed **********In the first, on Jan. 18, lawyers demonstrating at Mrs. Bedi's office accused the police of using excessive force against them. Mrs. Bedi said the lawyers had stormed her office, shouting obscenities and threatening to rip her clothes off, and that the police had used reasonable force in repelling them. **********A few weeks later, hundreds of other demonstrators, this time backing Mrs. Bedi, fought with a group of lawyers in a stone-throwing clash broken up by the police. Two dozen people were injured, and the lawyers accused Mrs. Bedi of laxity. **********A two-judge panel looking into the incidents reported evidence of police lapses but said it needed more evidence before it concluded that Mrs. Bedi was personally responsible. Mrs. Bedi charges that many lawyers have told her they backed her version of the events, but she said they appeared afraid to say so publicly. **********Defenders of Mrs. Bedi say that they expect her to remain in the public eye no matter what job she holds, and that she might eventually go into politics.

The group, consisting of the United States, Canada, Britain, Japan, West Germany, Italy and France, is scheduled to meet in Washington next week. **********As the dollar eased against all major foreign currencies save the Canadian dollar, gold prices moved modestly higher.

Simon, a foreign exchange trader at the Bank Julius Baer of Zurich. ''But what member of the group can deny such talk? To do so would pull the rug from under the dollar.'' **********While exchange traders tended to dismiss talk of pegging the dollar at roughly 125 yen, many traders and corporations with heavy short positions in the dollar moved to cover them in the event that the Group of Seven once again stages a coordinated intervention to support the dollar as a means of flexing its muscles on the eve of the meeting. **********This may explain why trading in the dollar was unusually light and generally confined covering short positions and other book-balancing moves, Mr. Simon said. He noted that the day's biggest price change was in the Canadian dollar, which dropped to 1.2490 to the United States dollar, from 1.2411 the day before. At the start of this week, the Canadian dollar was at a four-and-a-half-year high of 1.2340. **********Meanwhile, high British interest rates and fears of a further decline in the dollar caused European and other large corporations to convert more domestic currencies into sterling.

Strike Leaders Reported Seized **********Reports reaching here said security forces entered the steel mill at 2 A.M. and arrested the leaders of the strike. It was not clear if all operations had resumed at the plant.  [ The riot police set off percussion grenades in storming the Nowa Huta plant and rounded up 38 people, The Associated Press reported from Warsaw. The raid came only hours after the strike committee, which said it represented 15,000 of the 32,000 employees, was told it would have its first talks with management.

Wojciech Jaruzelski undertook a two-pronged effort against the strikes: **********A conciliatory statement was issued by the ruling Politburo, leading the church to believe it approved the mediation effort. At the same time, the Government spokesman, Jerzy Urban, accused the strikers of ''terrorist activities'' and denounced the founder of the outlawed Solidarity trade union, Lech Walesa, as a fomenter of revolution. Death Threats Are Cited **********The Government television and radio stations also accused the strikers of using death threats to force workers to join the walkouts, which were denounced as illegal. Reporters who spoke with strikers, plant managers and representatives of the Government-approved labor unions found no evidence to support that charge. **********The Lenin shipyard here was virtually deserted today. At the main gate, which was closed to the public at midmorning by scores of riot policemen, about 250 striking workers straddled the iron gates chanting Solidarity slogans and singing patriotic songs. **********Over a bullhorn, one worker said: ''We want money. Not that we want to buy big fancy cars, but just to support our wives and children. We work very hard. We deserve this.'' **********Facing the rows of policemen, he continued: ''We don't have any cannons, any tanks, any truncheons. We don't want to fight. We're here to make sure we'll be able to earn enough money in 8 hours, and not in 12 or more, to support our families.'' **********The Gdansk strikers are also calling for legalization of the local branch of Solidarity. **********At the seven other gates small bands of strikers stood guard, facing riot policemen across a wire divide. Some workers made sandwiches or opened bottles of beer for the rest. **********They looked tough, with their grimy faces and heavy overalls, but many were clearly frightened. **********A strike organizer, who came by with a reporter, was bombarded with questions by wide-eyed workers: ''What has happened in Nowa Huta? We heard rumors, is it over?'' **********The organizer, a veteran of strikes here in 1970 and 1980, was asked if the workers were afraid. ''Sure they're scared,'' he replied. ''If we can make it through one night, we can make it.'' **********Nodding toward the police, whose gray uniforms prompt the workers to call them ''smurfs,'' for the gray plastic toys popular here, he joked, ''They get 100,000 zlotys from Jaruzelski if they manage to slip in here.'' **********At the strike headquarters, in a grimy cafeteria next to the main gate, strike leaders conferred among themselves and with the church mediators throughout the day. **********Mr. Walesa, who stayed the night with the workers after signs increased that the Government might be preparing to use force, sat in the cafeteria, chatting with workers and foreign reporters. Sometimes he strolled through the yard in bright sunshine, between big chunks of structural steel. **********At 44, Mr. Walesa has back trouble and suffers from diabetes. He is on a 22-day sick leave. But now he has other problems. He is not the leader of the strike, for his advisers did not want him to link his name and prestige to a labor outbreak that had erupted spontaneously and whose success they could not guarantee. ''We did not think these spontaneous things would happen,'' Mr. Walesa said. ''But we promised we would always be with the people. I had no choice.'' Students Support Strikes **********The unrest of recent days confronts General Jaruzelski with a bleak outlook. There have been student rallies in Warsaw, Cracow and Gdansk supporting the striking workers. There is also no way of knowing how workers at other plants will react.  [ According to The Associated Press, strikes and protests were reported among bus and streetcar drivers in the northwestern cities of Szczecin and Police, and briefly by shipworkers in Gdynia. ]  The mood among the Gdansk strikers alternated between bright and dark. ''What's the worst thing that can happen to me?'' Mr. Walesa said. ''They can carry me out. We cannot have slaves as workers.'' **********Mr. Mazowiecki said that the strikers had proposed that three of their number meet with management. He said the offer was rejected.  Asked whether he thought the authorities would use force in Gdansk, he replied: ''The shipyard is a symbolic place. And the symbolic expression of using force would be much greater than at Nowa Huta. That is why one might think they would be more restrained. But the events at Nowa Huta mean it is possible.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/15/business/inventories-climb-slightly.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-04-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 343, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Inventories Climb Slightly", "print_headline": "Inventories Climb Slightly", "body_text": " **********Rebounding sales helped dampen growth of business inventories in February to a slight one-tenth of 1 percent after four big monthly increases, the Government reported today. **********The Commerce Department said inventories increased by only $825 million, pushing the total of unsold items on store shelves and backlots to a seasonally adjusted $715.9 billion. **********The small gain followed a series of much steeper increases that began when the stock market plunged.

This was a company, they said in effect, that could achieve strong results even in a sluggish computer market.

Elling of Merrill Lynch. ''Ironically, Digital seems penalized by its tremendous past performance. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1987, earnings rose 77 percent, to $8.53 a share. For the current fiscal year ending in June, earnings are expected to increase by 23 percent, to $10.50 a share.'' **********Mr. Elling rates Digital's stock as ''above average'' over the next 12 months and as a ''buy'' for the long term. **********For several months, analysts have been racheting downward their profit projections for Digital. A meeting with company executives in Marlboro, Mass., on Monday led to the latest reduction. Management indicated then that earnings for the final fiscal quarter would be around $2.50 a share, against $2.29 a year earlier, and that earnings for the year would come to about $10.50. **********''I am using those numbers now,'' said Miss Peterson of First Boston. ''Previously, my estimates were $2.60 for the quarter and $10.70 for the year.'' Most other analysts trimmed their estimates in similar fashion. **********Before the meeting, Digital introduced its VAX 8800 line of mainframe computers, which are envisioned as a challenge to the International Business Machines Corporation. Since their introduction about three years ago, the VAX generation of computers has proved a huge success in the mid-sized area and fostered a steady stream of new products and enhancements. **********I.B.M. still dominates the computer field with products ranging from personal computers to large mainframes, while Digital's strength has been concentrated in the middle range. **********Carol E. Muratore of Morgan Stanley & Company said she was leaving her estimates for Digital's earnings unchanged at $2.55 a share for the quarter and $10.70, or slightly less, for the year. She regards the latest adjustments occasioned by the meeting with management as ''not a big deal.'' **********More important, Miss Muratore said, is that Digital's stock is selling at ''a cheap price.'' She has carried a buy rating on the shares for some time and, as a long-term investment, she prefers it to I.B.M. ''I. B. M. can no longer be valued as a growth stock,'' the analyst said.

Lewis is a winner. The 21 Burger Kings he and a partner own in the Philadelphia area generate profits of more than $3 million a year. But Mr. Lewis is not entirely happy with the Burger King Corporation and its owner, the Pillsbury Company. **********''Burger King is a strong restaurant concept that has survived in spite of itself, in spite of bad promotions, poor marketing strategies, inconsistent operations and shoddy management,'' Mr. Lewis said. **********Other Burger King franchisees are equally critical. ''For years Burger King has been under pressure from Pillsbury to produce profits at the expense of our own bottom lines,'' said Bill Pothitos, a franchisee in Montreal. And Manny Garcia, a franchisee in Florida, said, ''I don't think Pillsbury ever had the long-term interests of Burger King in mind.'' An Unfortunate Time for Dissent **********Pillsbury, in short, is facing a community of angry Burger King franchisees, and their discontent is mounting at a critical time. The Minneapolis-based food and restaurants giant has rejected a $5.2 billion takeover bid from Grand Metropolitan P.L.C., the British conglomerate. To remain independent, merger specialists say, Pillsbury will have to undertake a restructuring, including an overhaul of Burger King. That will require franchisees' support, which will not be easy to obtain. **********For instance, a week ago Pillsbury announced that it would spin off Burger King and have it borrow heavily to finance a special shareholder dividend. Franchisees fumed. Arguing that any further leveraging of Burger King would doom the chain, they agreed to use a regularly scheduled meeting on Tuesday to consider alternatives. Among the options they will consider is a leveraged buyout led by franchisees. **********There have been disputes between franchisees and their corporate parents before, but to hear outside experts tell it, they have not been nearly as bitter as the one between Pillsbury and its Burger King operators. Part of the reason: as a group, Burger King franchisees are not doing well. Although some, like Mr. Lewis, say they are pleased by results, many franchisees report flat sales and shrinking profits. Typically, they blame Pillsbury. **********Their main complaint is that Pillsbury has not invested enough money in the operation. **********''If Pillsbury believed in the system, it would have reinvested in the system,'' said Bill Spence, a franchisee with 35 restaurants in Ohio and Illinois. The Company's Contribution **********The Burger King Corporation contributes to the chain in several ways. It is responsible for designing and arranging for advertising and promotions, although it does not pay for them. It provides franchisees with training materials. And it serves up a steady stream of research on everything from where to buy a more efficient deep fryer to what color surroundings fast-food diners like best. **********More than anything, though, investment by the corporation means building new restaurants and managing them or leasing them to franchisees. Those are two ways Burger King restaurants are established. The third and most common way is that a franchisee builds his or her own restaurant. **********The franchisees complain that, in recent years, the chain's growth has come almost entirely from the franchisees, not from the corporation. **********They offer these statistics: of the nearly 2,000 Burger King restaurants opened since 1984, only 233 are company-owned. The remainder were opened by franchisees. **********Only 74 of the new restaurants were financed and built by Burger King and leased to franchisees. **********Since 1980, the portion of Burger King restaurants operated by the company has slipped to 15 percent from 20 percent. At McDonald's, the percentage has risen to 25 percent. **********There are 5,578 Burger King restaurants worldwide. McDonald's has 10,223. **********A Burger King spokeswoman said the company stopped building because many franchisees prefer to own their real estate. Franchisees, however, charge that Pillsbury no longer views Burger King restaurants as solid investments. Burger King's Revolving Door **********The franchisees think that the turnover of executives that has plagued Burger King is partly to blame for the lack of corporate investment. Since Pillsbury acquired the chain in 1967 from its founder for $19 million, Burger King has had eight presidents and six chairmen. **********Franchisees say it is critical that the future owner of Burger King start opening restaurants itself at a faster clip. That would demonstrate the new owner's commitment to the business, and it would increase the amount of advertising dollars available, because all Burger King restaurants (company- and franchisee-owned) contribute 4 percent of their gross sales to a national advertising fund that the company administers. **********Advertising, which is critical to the success of any fast-food operation, has been another sore point with the franchisees. Over the years Burger King has had some effective ad campaigns, but not on a steady basis. **********The ''Herb the Nerd'' campaign, begun in November 1985, was a notable failure. A social misfit who wore white socks and black pants, Herb was supposed to be the only person never to have eaten a Burger King ''Whopper.'' **********''There was absolutely no relevant message,'' said Mr. Spence, the franchisee based in the Middle West. ''We ended up having a nerd for an advertising campaign.'' A Change of Ad Agency **********Frustrated, Burger King dropped J. Walter Thompson, its ad agency of 12 years, about 14 months ago and hired N. W. Ayer. Franchisees have not been happy with the initial results. **********In mid-September, for instance, Burger King began a promotion in which customers scratching off the surface of a checkers playing board could win everything from free burgers to $1 million. The goal: to generate enough new traffic in Burger King restaurants to more than offset the cost of the promotion. To hear franchisees tell it, however, the advertising accompanying the promotion failed. Many franchisees reported flat sales in October. **********''It didn't motivate people to go to Burger King over McDonald's or even over eating dinner at home,'' said a leading Burger King franchisee in the East Coast who asked not to be named. ''We gave away food to our regular customers who otherwise would have paid full price.'' **********The franchisees think that what they view as Pillsbury's lack of commitment to the business has also hurt their ability to borrow money. It takes an average of $1 million to establish a Burger King - $40,000 for the initial franchisee fee and $960,000 to buy the land, erect the building and equip a kitchen. Franchisees say they had no problem borrowing when Burger King was building restaurants itself and leasing them to franchisees. But since Burger King started building fewer restaurants, franchisees say, bankers have not been as willing to lend. The Lenders' Concern **********Some bankers say they have become more wary of lending to franchisees in light of the stormy relationship the restaurateurs have with their parent corporation. **********''The cooperation between Pillsbury and its franchisees that should give comfort to a lender seems to be diminishing,'' said John Faber, a vice president of Shawmut Bank in Boston. **********Some people say that Burger King's problems are a natural result of being part of a huge conglomerate whose divisions are constantly competing for resources. As long as Pillsbury pursues businesses as diverse as frozen peas and refrigerated dough, these people say, Burger King will not receive the attention or money it needs. **********''Burger King is never, ever going to realize its great potential as a subsidiary company, whether under Grand Met, Pillsbury, Pepsico or anybody else,'' said Jerry Ruenheck, a former Burger King president. ''It would be wonderful if Burger King were a freestanding, publicly traded company.'' **********That will happen if Pillsbury succeeds in spinning off the chain. But Grand Met, intent on acquiring Pillsbury and keeping the company whole, is convinced that it can mend Burger King by investing in new outlets and advertising and that it can reap handsome rewards. Franchises' Financial Profile **********The calculations go something like this: **********The typical Burger King restaurant generates about $1 million a year in revenues and pays about 3.5 percent of that to Pillsbury to use the Burger King name. If the average Burger King were as successful as the typical McDonald's, producing $1.5 million in annual revenues, franchise royalties would rise by $17,500 a restaurant. If such increases were achieved across Burger King's 4,471 franchisee-owned restaurants, the increase in royalty income would be about $80 million a year, more than Burger King's 1988 operating profit. **********Franchisees would also be smiling. On $1 million in sales, the typical Burger King operator earns about $140,000. Increasing revenues by $500,000 would raise profits by $70,000. **********No wonder, then, that franchisees talk wistfully of a time when Pillsbury and the franchisees got along more harmoniously."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/10/business/the-executive-computer-a-lonely-road-for-a-modem-maker.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Lewis", "pub_date": "1988-04-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1118, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Lonely Road for a Modem Maker", "print_headline": "THE EXECUTIVE COMPUTER; A Lonely Road for a Modem Maker", "body_text": " **********PONY EXPRESS, telegraph, telephone, overnight letters, computers and modems - a constant progression of communications technology, fueled by the belief that faster is better. Faster transmission is of no value, however, if the message is incomprehensible or if the accuracy suffers. **********''General Custer phoned, sir,'' the Army clerk might have said to the commander. ''The line was bad - lots of crackling - but it sounded like he said he was being chased around a horn by 10 sows and some Indians.'' **********And the commander might well have replied: ''Sounds like he's been drinking again, eh, corporal? Well, he'll have a headache tomorrow.'' **********Modern technology has greatly expanded the potential for garbling messages. The faster the transmission, the greater the sensitivity to errors caused by snaps, crackles, pops and echoes on public telephone lines. That unfortunate condition is carried to the extreme when high-speed modems operate on conventional telephone lines. **********The interference wasn't too much of a problem when modems were transmitting data at 300 bits per second, but at 2,400 b.p.s. and up it is a major problem, because the higher the speed the more likely the message will be derailed when it hits a bump. The emergence of the 9,600 and 19,200 bit modems as business tools has heightened the concern. **********In an effort to provide faster and more reliable communications on public phone lines, Hayes Microcomputer Products Inc. developed its V-Series modem, with which it hopes to establish the standard for high-speed communications. Hayes is certainly the standard at the low end of the market, where ''Hayes compatible'' is to modems what I.B.M. compatible is to personal computers. But while the V-Series devices are impressive, it is unclear if they will become a standard. Because at the high end of the market, Hayes is bucking the trend. **********The V-Series differs from earlier Hayes modems in three major ways: speed, which is enhanced by compressing data, error control and automatic feature negotiation. **********That negotiation basically means that a V-Series modem checks to see if it is talking to another V-Series modem. When two modems connect, a sound like two whistling hisses at different pitches can be heard. The modems are exchanging information about one another, a process called handshaking. If you closed your eyes and shook hands with a 2-year-old, you might infer from the size and firmness of the grip that a conversation on particle physics would be inappropriate. In similar fashion, the V-Series decides whether it is speaking at its own level or whether it must slow down and shut off some features. **********If it senses another V-Series modem, it operates at full capacity, including data compression and error correction. Data compression squeezes more information into less space, usually at a 2-to-1 ratio. As a result a modem rated at 9,600 b.p.s. can pump twice as much information, or 19,200 b.p.s., under ideal circumstances. Different types of data compress differently; some compression techniques, oddly enough, might actually expand certain files. Hayes claims that its compression technique automatically adapts to the type of data being sent, whether it is spreadsheet, text, data base or something else, adjusting the compression for maximum efficiency. **********Data compression also demands error control, because a single bit out of place in a compressed file will throw all that follow out of sequence. Hayes's error control protocol makes sure that the information arrives at the destination just as it was sent from the source. **********How does a modem in Los Angeles know that the information it is receiving from New York somehow picked up a few extra zeroes when it passed through a thunderstorm in Kansas? **********Higher-speed modems usually communicate synchronously, passing data in blocks or chunks, rather than asynchronously, which is sending data character by character, with a lot of extra housekeeping information. The V-Series modem sends a block of data, called a frame, and at end of each frame is something called a cyclical redundancy check, or C.R.C. This C.R.C. is expressed as a mathematical value that has been calculated from the data. **********The receiving modem accepts the data and does its own C.R.C. calculation on the frame. If the calculation does not exactly match the value that is appended to the frame, the modem sends a message back requesting that the frame be re-sent. Assuming that lightning doesn't strike twice in the same place, even in Kansas, the frame ought to make it through intact the next time. This process checks each frame in the file until both modems are satisfied that what is received is what was sent. The probability of making the same error twice is practically nil, and so the system is considered error-free even on noisy lines. **********The error-control system used by Hayes is based on a complex set of rules, the ''LAP-B link level portion of X.25,'' developed by the Comite Consultatif International Telephonique et Telegraphique. That committee is part of the International Telecommunications Union, an agency of the United Nations. The committee tries to promote international standards for data communications. Modem companies adhere to these standards with the same spirit that nations adhere to U.N. resolutions, which is to say, selectively. **********HAYES, in pinning its error-correction to the LAP-B protocol, is going it alone. At least 100 other brands of modems follow a protocol called M.N.P., for Microcom Networking Protocol, which was developed by Hayes's rival and nemesis, Microcom Inc. of Norwood, Mass. M.N.P. is also supported by such public dial-up networks as GTE Telenet and Tymnet. Both protocols are effective and technically snazzy, but they are, in effect, apples and oranges. **********If an international standard in error-correction protocols is to be adopted - a draft report from a C.C.I.T.T. study group is to be edited later this month for consideration in the fall - it is likely to be M.N.P., the de facto standard, or LAP-M, a new protocol different from LAP-B, or both. LAP-B and LAP-M are similar, of course, but protocols are not horseshoes or hand grenades, and close doesn't count. **********To comply with the standard, should it be adopted, a modem would have to be able to use protocols. That puts Hayes in an awkward spot, because it supports neither one.

In the United States, he worked briefly as a salesman for Collier's magazine and then bought a bankrupt pill manufacturer, the Acme Tablet Company, in 1940. **********Mr. Lowey's first slow-release product was a salt tablet for troops in the Korean War. The troops, who were taking salt to retain water, frequently became ill by taking large doses at one time. The inventor encased salt granules in cellulose pellets, and compressed them into tablets that dissolved over 10 or 12 hours. **********In 1953, Mr. Lowey applied the same principle to encase nitroglycerine, used to alleviate angina attacks. By releasing small quantities of the drug into the bloodstream over a sustained period, instead of in one large dose, the new tablets made it possible to use nitroglycerine as a preventive treatment. **********Over the years, other pharmaceutical companies patented more advanced time-release tablets, but Mr. Lowey has also made improvements. **********In 1987, Mr. Lowey patented a 24-hour tablet based on a composition that attaches to the gastrointestinal wall until it becomes fully absorbed in the bloodstream. The attachment, he explained, prevented the body from eliminating the tablet, which typically takes less than 12 hours. **********Mr. Lowey's latest patent covers a method of insuring the uniformity of such tablets. Previously, the inventor said, granules of the cellulose base and the active ingredient tended to separate while being fed through tablet-compressing machinery. As a result, different batches of pills showed slightly different concentrations and different release times.

On Friday, Judge Parker blocked the airline from proceeding with plans to dismiss 4,000 workers, accepting the arguments of three unions that the airline was violating Federal labor law. Ruling on Cutbacks **********Judge Parker said he would rule today on whether Eastern could proceed with its cutbacks, which included the elimination of service to 14 cities. Eastern announced on July 22 that it would no longer have a hub at Kansas City, cutting its 53 daily flights there to 6, as part of a broad reduction in service. **********A few days later, Braniff announced that it was expanding in Kansas City. Piedmont Airlines has already added some service at Kansas City. **********Eastern, when it first announced the cutbacks, said it needed to reduce its operating expenses and would return to its roots on the East Coast and in the Caribbean. **********But Eastern's unions asserted that the airline's management was stripping the airline of its assets as part of a plan to put pressure on the unions for wage and benefits concessions. The unions' leaders also suggested that the Texas Air Corporation, which owns Eastern and Continental Airlines, wanted to switch some Eastern assets to Continental, which is largely nonunion. **********Three unions - representing the pilots, machinists and flight attendants -then sued in Federal District Court, asserting that the Railway Labor Act, which covers the airline industry as well, prevents Eastern from transferring assets without negotiating with the unions affected. **********A person close to Texas Air yesterday discounted reports that Eastern might file for bankruptcy protection if Judge Parker ruled against it. While Texas Air looked at such an option, he said, it was not planning a filing because that would limit its options in regard to Eastern. **********This source said that Judge Parker would decide today whether to ask the unions to put up a higher bond than the $75,000 they have posted so far in bringing the suit. **********Eastern's lawyers have contended that the bond should be higher since Eastern's costs of keeping on the 4,000 employees it wants to lay off is about $7 million a month. The Texas Air source said the money in the bond could be used to compensate Eastern for the costs of retaining the employees if the carrier won its case on appeal. **********If the bond is significantly increased, it could make the unions more reluctant to pursue the suit. **********Eastern has already taken steps to phase out its Kansas City operations. Its flights there are no longer listed in computer reservation systems and most passengers who bought tickets for flights on Eastern after Sept. 1 have been issued tickets on other carriers. **********John Burke, the president of Burke Travel, a Kansas City travel agency, said that even if Eastern were forced to resume its flights at Kansas City, most passengers would not change their bookings. **********Eastern could thus face the prospect of flying largely empty planes. **********Judge Parker's ruling Friday had little effect on passengers, Mr. Burke said, since most had already been rebooked on other carriers and there was enough capacity to meet the demand of the slow travel season. **********Don McGuire, Braniff's vice president of public affairs, said the carrier planned to go ahead with its plans to build a hub in Kansas City even if the judge ruled that Eastern must continue its flights."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/08/business/us-petroleum-data.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-09-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 239, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Petroleum Data", "print_headline": "U.S. Petroleum Data", "body_text": " **********In millions of barrels except refinery utilization"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/12/business/executive-changes-364788.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-09-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 221, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "body_text": " *********** Cushman & Wakefield Inc., a real estate subsidiary of the Rockefeller Group Inc., named Stuart L.

A school spokesman said yesterday, however, that, to the best of his knowledge, the gift of Mr. Shad, a Business School alumnus, was not connected with the decision to have a mandatory ethics course. **********Now that Harvard has moved decisively to make ethics part of its education for candidates for the master of business administration degree, other top management schools will consider it, educators said yesterday. 'Makes Rest of Us Thoughtful' **********At Northwestern University's Kellogg Graduate School of Management, Lawrence G. Lavengood, who teaches a course that includes ethics, said: ''Anything Harvard does makes the rest of us thoughtful. I daresay there will be consideration of it,'' referring to the idea of requiring the course for all students. **********At the Wharton School, which recently received a grant from the Exxon Corporation to incorporate more ethics into Wharton's curriculum, Joanne Ciulla, an ethics professor, said she hoped that other schools would require ethics courses. **********Stanford University, which has had a separate elective ethics course in its M.B.A. program for more than five years, said it had no plans to make the course a required one. It added that a course entitled ''Business and the Changing Environment,'' which is required, already includes a four-week section on ethics."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/31/business/business-and-health-nursing-shortage-is-costing-billions.html": {"writer_name": "Milt Freudenheim", "pub_date": "1988-05-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 813, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Business and Health; Nursing Shortage Is Costing Billions", "print_headline": "Business and Health; Nursing Shortage Is Costing Billions", "body_text": " **********AN ACUTE shortage of nurses in hospitals and nursing homes has added billions of dollars to the nation's escalating expenditures for health care. **********Of the nation's 1.9 million registered nurses, the most ever, at least 1.5 million are currently working in the profession. But hospitals and nursing homes still need at least 150,000 more nurses. **********Hospitals will spend $3.1 billion this year to recruit and train nurses, said Carolyne K. Davis, head of a Federal commission that is studying the situation for the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Otis R. Bowen. **********In Boston, where the shortage is especially acute, employment agencies are asking hospitals to pay commissions of $8,000 to $10,000 for each nurse hired. And Southern California hospitals are paying the equivalent of $85,000 a year for temporary nurses provided by employment agencies. **********For the lack of nurses, many large hospitals, especially in large cities, have had to take beds temporarily out of service, forfeiting revenues. For example, the University of Michigan Hospitals system estimated that it had lost more than $2 million in net income since October after temporarily leaving 66 beds empty. **********There have been cyclical nursing shortages for years. The last one, in 1979 and 1980, was remedied when nurses' pay scales were raised, on average, 13 percent. But experts say the current shortage will be harder to solve because of changes in the health care field. **********As the Federal system of paying pre-set fees for Medicare patients took effect in 1983 and 1984, hospital beds were left empty and some nurses were dismissed. The hiring soon resumed as hospitals cut payrolls, eliminating medical technicians and aides while seeking to maintain standards by giving additional duties to registered nurses. **********As a result, hospitals are using more registered nurses - about 80 for each 100 patients - than ever before. Nurses are helping to operate high-technology devices and to monitor the increasing proportion of patients in intensive-care units. **********Dr. Davis and other experts have proposed various remedies, starting with raises, flexible benefits and child-care services for nurses. **********New York-area nurses won double-digit increases in recently signed contracts, raising starting pay to $29,000 - higher than that of police officers and firefighters. The national average for beginning nurses is about $22,000. **********In the past, most nurses have not received the kinds of rewards for experience and education that teachers and other professionals have. This is also changing: in California and New York City, experienced nurses with special expertise earn $55,000 a year, according to Judith A. Ryan, executive director of the American Nurses Association. **********But higher pay alone will not attract students back to college nursing programs, Dr. Ryan said. Enrollment in nursing courses has fallen, as have government scholarships for student nurses. Recently, hospitals and nursing homes on both coasts have offered to pay tuition fees for employees who study to become registered nurses or licensed practical nurses. The current shortage is expected to last for several years. **********Meanwhile, to make better use of the nurses on their staffs, hospitals may have to relieve them of tasks that could be performed by nonprofessionals, said Joan Moss, director of the Center for Nursing of the American Hospital Association. She said surveys had shown that nurses are less concerned about income than about gaining professional status, including sharing authority for determining how to care for patients. **********To relieve the pressure on nurses, the American Medical Association is suggesting a new category of support worker, to be known as registered care technologist. After nine months of training, they would take over some support jobs, like giving back rubs, helping patients walk and making beds. **********But the national nursing organizations have criticized the A.M.A. plan, arguing that nine months of training would not be sufficient for technicians responsible for the welfare of patients. ''It is a foolhardy approach,'' said Linda Aiken, a University of Pennsylvania professor and a member of Dr. Bowen's nursing commission. **********Dr. Aiken thinks that the industry could solve its problems by using nurses more efficiently. For one thing, she said, many hospitals have been slow to buy computers, which could simplify the record-keeping required of nurses by Medicare and other insurance cost-containment programs. **********Hospital spokesmen said they would need increased reimbursement from Medicare and other insurers, both to raise nurses' pay and to hire new employees to assist nurses. ''What we are getting now is not reflecting the dollars out the door that we are paying to stay in business,'' said Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Hospital Association of Greater New York."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/14/business/shift-on-ltv-pension-plan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-07-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 261, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Shift on LTV Pension Plan", "print_headline": "Shift on LTV Pension Plan", "body_text": " **********The LTV Corporation announced today that the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation would resume control of three of the Dallas-based company's pension plans and their assets. **********The plans have been the subject of dispute between the steel and energy company, which is reorganizing under Federal bankruptcy protection from creditors, and the Government agency, which insures pension benefits. **********The pension agency took over LTV's steel company pension plans, which were $2 billion in debt, in January 1987 after the company terminated them, making the agency LTV's biggest creditor. **********But the agency tried to restore LTV's responsibility for the plans the following September, after a new LTV labor contract with the United Steelworkers of America restored some benefits previously cut. **********A Federal judge on June 22 refused to uphold the pension agency's decision to force LTV to reassume the pension obligations, stating that the agency had not presented a strong enough case for the move. **********LTV has contended since filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection two years ago that it cannot successfully reorganize if it is held responsible for the $2 billion shortfall of the pension plans. **********Company executives said the resumption of the pension agency's responsibility should not affect LTV Steel retirees or their benefits.

Today, the joint statement said that the committee would resume hearing Administration witnesses next week as the result of Mr. Shultz's letter.

Biden Jr. of Delaware, a Democratic member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, asserted today that the letter from Mr. Shultz failed to address the ''essential issue'' of whether an future Administration can revise its interpretation of a ratified treaty without Senate approval. **********Mr. Biden said he would push ahead with his proposal to attach a binding condition to the new missile treaty to affirm his legal arguments. And the one-paragraph statement by Mr. Byrd and Mr. Nunn indicated that the two Senators had reserved their right to support such a binding condition or to take some other unspecified action. **********The dispute between the Reagan Administration and some Senate Democrats stems from a long-standing debate over the interpretation of the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty, which restricts the testing and deployment of anti-missile systems. **********These Democrats assert that the Reagan Administration has challenged the Senate's constitutional role in approving treaties by developing a new ''broad'' interpretation of the ABM treaty, which would allow an expanded pattern of anti-missile testing in space. This is because the Administration's interpretation conflicts with what the Nixon Administration told the Senate when the ABM treaty was ratified in 1972, Senate Democrats say. **********Senate aides have said that they expect Mr. Nunn to cite Mr. Shultz's letter to argue that the Administration has backed away from legal arguments for its new ABM treaty interpretation.

Now studies of the October crash by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Brady Commission and others conclude they were right. The main new instruments are stock index futures, representing the average price of a large bundle of stocks, and the Designated Order Turnaround system, which allows whole market baskets of individual stocks to be traded on the stock exchange in a single swift transaction. The main new techniques fostered by these instruments are arbitrage between stocks and stock index futures and ''portfolio insurance,'' whereby selling of financial futures is triggered if stock prices fall by some predetermined amount. **********Most clients using portfolio insurance, the most obvious culprit in the crash, did not fare well because the apparent safety provided for an individual investor evaporated when many investors tried to use the same technique together. Because of this experience, the formal use of portfolio insurance has been sharply reduced since the crash. However, even in the absence of formal insurance, the very efficiency that makes stock index futures and the D.O.T. system attractive to some - the ease with which whole baskets of stocks can be bought or sold - maintains the risk of a new selling wave. **********Although they may add to market efficiency in a narrow sense, the new instruments are counterproductive to the extent they destabilize markets or direct investors' attention toward guessing the short-run ups and downs of markets and away from properly valuing the stocks of individual companies. Indeed, by their very nature, trades through stock index futures or the D.O.T. system ignore any relative evaluation of individual companies. **********Two of the Brady Commission's proposals are aimed directly at reducing price volatility and its by-products. One would narrow or close the discrepancy between the 50 percent margin now required to buy stocks and the margin of only 10 percent required to buy futures contracts on a bundle of stocks. The S.E.C. report and virtually all other groups studying the crash supported such margin reforms. The second Brady proposal would make the Federal Reserve a central regulator, with authority over all markets that relate to stocks, and with the authority to suspend trading under certain conditions. The S.E.C. report argued the S.E.C. should be the central regulator and did not support trading halts. **********The effects of stopping all trading in a crisis are hard to predict. Permanent reforms might therefore be modeled on plans, recently instituted by some individual exchanges, that are less drastic and perhaps more to the point in that they focus on the use of efficient new instruments. The New York Stock Exchange will halt trading of large blocks on the D.O.T. system if the stock averages move more than a prescribed amount in a day. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, on which the major stock index contract is traded, has instituted daily price limits beyond which futures trading would halt. **********Changes such as these would be more impressive if they came from a central agency with responsibility for all stock-related markets. This agency would enforce even-handed margin requirements across markets and arrange for a more rational and unified clearing system between markets. Whether the central authority should be the Federal Reserve, as the Brady Commission suggested, or some other agency, is another matter. Chairman Alan Greenspan does not want the Federal Reserve's role as ''lender of last resort'' to the banks to extend, even implicitly, to stock markets. Besides that, the Federal Reserve has no staff or expertise in the area. The S.E.C. seems the natural agency to take on these broader responsibilities, as its chairman, David Ruder, has suggested. But it would have to accept the responsibility to enforce the trading restraints that are needed. **********Some object that, if our markets are constrained, the business will simply go offshore, where it will flourish unfettered by our regulations. That fear seems overdone. We can hope that American leadership would bring parallel and cooperative reforms in other financial centers. As for less-established foreign markets, should they try to lure business by ignoring our reforms, they will appear too risky to become important. **********Recommendations such as those discussed above will meet stiff opposition from those with a stake in markets that would be restrained as well as from those economists who simply believe all markets should be free of any regulation or government interference. But on a broader view, putting some sand in the wheels, whether by making some kinds of transactions more difficult or, under some circumstances, letting circuit breakers stop some forms of trading altogether, is just what is needed."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/01/business/dow-off-1.24-weakness-in-dollar-a-factor.html": {"writer_name": "Phillip Wiggins", "pub_date": "1988-11-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 509, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dow Off 1.24; Weakness in Dollar a Factor", "print_headline": "Dow Off 1.24; Weakness in Dollar a Factor", "body_text": " **********Concern about the soaring level of takeover activity and early weakness in the dollar helped depress stocks across a broad front yesterday. **********The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 1.24 points, to 2,148.65, after being down more than 15 points in morning trading.

It placed the earliest use of fire by early hominids, precursors of modern man, in the same time period as the one in South Africa, almost a million years earlier than had been thought before then. **********The Kenya discovery relied on indirect evidence in the form of charred clay from an open archeological site. While this evidence pointed strongly to a fire made by hominids, experts say, the charring could also have come from a natural fire. **********The new evidence comes from a cave occupied over hundreds of thousands of years by two species of hominids, Dr. C. K. Brain, an archeologist at South Africa's Transvaal Museum, and a colleague report in the current issue of the British journal Nature. Moreover, it appears to fix the discovery of fire as a practical tool with some precision, at least in that part of Africa. Momentous Discovery **********That discovery is considered by some the most momentous in human prehistory. ''Once you master the technology of fire,'' Dr. Brain said in a telephone interview yesterday, ''you start on a road that led right to now. Everything we take for granted is really connected to the technology of fire.'' **********The burned bones were found in several distinct layers of limestone that at various levels contained the remains of both Homo erectus, a direct ancestor of modern humans, and a somewhat less advanced hominid known as Australopithecus robustus that Dr. Brain describes as a ''large ape man.'' This line is believed to have died out about a million years ago. **********''For a long time,'' he said, ''these hominids used the cave, and there's no evidence of fire.'' The charred bones showed up in a stratum that represents a relatively brief 100,000 years of prehistory and appeared in succeeding layers. ''Once they started making fires, they did it repeatedly,'' said Dr. Brain. ''We have up to 20 levels, one upon the other.'' **********Dr. John A. J. Gowlett of the University of Liverpool, who made the 1981 Kenya discovery while with Oxford University, said the new discovery was ''the latest and one of the most solid chunks of evidence'' in a long line that is gradually establishing the era when fire was discovered. ''We don't have absolute proof,'' he said in a telephone interview, ''and you don't get absolute proof from single sites.'' **********However, he said, ''probably the majority of people working on this feel it's firming up.'' **********Before Dr. Gowlett's discovery in 1981, also reported in Nature, the earliest strong evidence of fire had been in association with a very few sites, such as one at Zhoukoudian, China, put at about 500,000 years ago. Site Is Near Pretoria **********Dr. Brain's new discovery, at the Swartkrans cave about 35 miles west of Pretoria, resulted from excavations made there from 1985 through 1987. It was not possible, he said, to determine whether the ape man or the early human ancestor, Homo erectus, made the fires. ''One assumes it was the more advanced intellectual hominid, because it was a big discovery how to do this.'' But he said it could have been both. **********The find provides the first evidence that a controlled fire took place before Australopithecus robustus became extinct about 1 million years ago, Dr. Brain said. ''It is sort of the last glimpse you have of the ape man,'' he said. **********Dr. Brain was a longtime associate of Dr. Raymond A. Dart, a pioneer in the study of human origins who died last week. **********''He predicted that Australopithecus had used fire,'' Dr. Brain said. ''What we have done, really, is just to vindicate his intution that fire was used within the ape-man period, but not where he expected.'' **********The Swartkrans discovery was aided by microscopic and chemical analysis of 270 fragments of charred bone, which found them to have been heated to a range of temperatures that occur in campfires. Those temperatures were consistent with those produced in experimental campfires made from branches of white stinkwood, the most common tree around Swartkrans. Traces of the tree were found in the fossil deposits, Dr. Brain said.

But he added that the gap between inflation rates in the New York region and in the rest of the country ''is no wider now than it was for most of last year.'' **********''I don't think this can be called a significant widening of the gap,'' Mr. Ehrenhalt said. ''Not yet at least.'' **********The monthly increase in the region was sharpest in the housing sector where overall prices rose 1.4 percent, as did homeowner costs. Over all, residential rents rose 1 percent, but renters' total costs, including utilities, increased by 2.5 percent. **********The jump in housing costs, an increase of 9.8 percent over the last 12 months, reflects both a shortage of housing and the generally strong local economy, Mr. Ehrenhalt said. **********The month also saw increases in the price of groceries, led by meat, poultry, fish and eggs, but the 1.3 percent increase was not as high as December's sharp jump of 1.9 percent. **********A steep decline in clothing costs partly offset the other rises. Prices of women's and girls' apparel fell by 4.6 percent for the month, following a record 7.4 percent drop in December, the steepest monthly decline in 35 years. **********Prices of clothing for men and boys also fell, by 1.9 percent. Mr. Ehrenhalt attributed much of the clothing price decline to seasonal factors, mainly post-holiday sales. **********The commissioner also noted that the cost of medical care was up a sharp nine-tenths of 1 percent, breaking eight months of relative quiet. Assistant commissioner Jesse Benjamin said medical costs often surged in the first few months of the year but he could not explain this. **********Over all, Mr. Ehrenhalt blamed the service sector, including housing and medical care, for ''leading the inflation parade.'' **********''Services are up 7.1 percent since January 1987,'' he said. ''Commodities went up only 4 percent in the same period.'' **********This is a marked change from last year, he added, when energy costs played the key role in inflation in the region. In contrast, energy costs rose only two-tenths of 1 percent last month. ''The energy index was quiet,'' Mr. Ehrenhalt said. **********The data are based on a survey of prices in New York City and 26 surrounding counties, including northeastern New Jersey, southern New York State, several counties in Connecticut and all of Long Island."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/27/business/prospects-venture-capital.html": {"writer_name": "Joel Kurtzman", "pub_date": "1988-03-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 634, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Venture Capital", "print_headline": "PROSPECTS; Venture Capital", "body_text": " **********When Congress eliminated the favorable treatment of capital gains in 1986, many thought it would hurt venture capital companies' ability to raise money.

CHET BORGIDA  Director of capital markets group, Grant Thornton. **********During 1987 an enormous amount of money was raised that has not yet been invested.

The scarcest resource is not capital, but talented venture capital professionals who can guide companies as they grow. **********The quantity and quality of the deal flow is also exceptional.

Traditionally, a good company is sold at an initial public offering. But it is only in the last month that the I.P.O. market has returned. Because of the crash, venture capital companies have not been able to liquefy their holdings. This has substantially brought down the valuations of new companies. **********There has been a trend to look beyond private companies to young companies that are already public.  TED H. MCCOURTNEY  General Partner, Venrock Associates. **********The loss of favorable capital gains is a hindrance to the financing of new companies. Most new companies are financed by individuals at the earliest stage. Loss of capital gains has made entrepreneurs less motivated to take the risk of forming a new business. **********There is evidence that venture capital is moving away from high tech but Silicon Valley is still strong. **********The I.P.O. market is just now beginning to come back for high-quality companies. But venture investments take a long-term horizon. It is not so important when a company goes public. But what is important is the value of the company when it does go public.  DAN BLANCHARD  Partner, Investments Orange Nassau Inc. **********Venture capital companies are not leaving high tech, but they are more open to looking at non-technology companies. Specialty retailing, broadcasting, newspapers, cable television, and rental businesses are attracting venture capital because they offer favorable rates of return. Smaller markets - $50 million to $100 million - with only a few competitors are attractive for new companies. These markets are too small for big companies to enter the way I.B.M. entered and then dominated the personal computer market. **********There are more entrepreneurs out there.

Manuel Antonio Noriega, who is a product of two years of American military education and many years of working with American officers. But Washington has been unable to persuade him to refrain from what it describes as corruption. **********''Noriega was always difficult to teach,'' said an American officer with access to intelligence assessments. ''He never wanted to take anything from the United States. He thought he knew it all.'' **********The problem, moreover, runs deeper than General Noriega. Over the last 40 years, the United States has trained 6,700 Panamanian officers, including many serving today. Yet they have shown little regard for the military and political values taught in United States military schools. Armies 'the Major Player' **********As in Panama, military forces, notably the armies, have long been the most powerful institutions in many Latin American nations. In other cases, military leaders have shared power with a handful of landowners and bishops of the Roman Catholic Church. **********Gen. Fred W. Woerner, who commands American forces in Latin America from headquarters in Panama, told reporters during a recent visit to Washington: ''When I look at the military in Latin America, it is, has been and forever will be a major player in the total life of those nations. It is important to have a relationship with that.'' **********Since the end of World War II, the United States has sought to influence Latin American armies through American officers, particularly through extensive training that included American values. But the results have been less than scintillating. **********For instance, the United States has trained 13,500 Colombian officers and noncommissioned officers since 1950. But the Colombian Army, American officers said, is close to disintegrating in the face of terrorists, insurgents and cocaine traffickers. Ambivalence in Honduras **********When American soldiers from the 82d Airborne and the Seventh Infantry Divisions were sent to Honduras in March in a show of force against Nicaragua, Honduran military leaders were ambivalent about their presence. Yet 5,800 Hondurans officers have been schooled by the United States. **********In El Salvador, where 5,400 officers have been trained by American military instructors, most of them in recent years, the army has made scant progress in putting down a Marxist insurgency. The United States has also trained 9,300 officers in Peru, a nation under heavy Soviet influence today. **********The United States has taught 5,700 Nicaraguan officers, though none since 1979, but that effort has provided little influence with either the rightist Somoza regime that was overthrown in 1979 or the current Sandinista regime. **********Nor does the future look much better. General Woerner told Congress recently, ''We are creating a successor generation of younger Latin American officers who will have no meaningful U.S. experience as they assume positions of authority.'' **********He asked Congress for money to place teams of 25 American officers in as many Latin American nations as possible. ''I would like to see a return to what we had,'' he told reporters, ''a structure out there that puts young dynamic American officers and noncommissioned officers into the school systems, into the major units and centers, transferring our values as professionals.'' So far, the request has been largely ignored. Several Reasons Cited **********United States officers with experience in the region cited several reasons for a steady decline in American influence with Latin American armies: *********** Vast cultural differences, especially on the role of an army in national life. American officers believe that armed forces are subordinate to civilian authority. Latin American officers believe they are obligated to restore order in the face of turmoil. *********** Fundamental differences in military needs. American officers are trained to think primarily of a threat to industrial allies from the Soviet Union. Latin American officers are more concerned with threats from neighbors. *********** A gradual reduction in American aid for Latin America and particularly in the number of American officers posted there. At its peak in 1966, the United States had 769 military people in Latin America. Today there are 92, not counting 55 military trainers in El Salvador. *********** Poor career prospects for American officers who specialize in Latin America. Moreover, most American officers are trained in technology that has little application in Latin America. *********** What many Latin Americans see as inconsistency in Washington's policy from one Administration to the next. Opening the Door to Others **********Summing up, General Woerner told Congress: ''U.S. sanctions, administrative barriers and low funding ceilings have already opened the door to Soviet, French, British, Chinese, Taiwanese, Israeli and Brazilian arms sales and, with that, the loss of opportunities for American access, communication, influence and commerce.'' **********Amid such gloom, some American officers said at least one objective had been accomplished. ''We did professionalize them,'' an officer said, referring to the increasing sophistication of officers in several countries, including Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. **********General Woerner said in Congress: ''In 1976, authoritarian military government and dictatorship were the rule. Today, with the exception of Chile, Panama and Paraguay, military governments have disappeared, replaced by freely elected governments.'' **********With that, he told reporters, the armies had ''stepped out of the role of arbiter or determinant of the political process and stepped into a very new role, that of guarantor.'' **********Much of the effort to influence the officers has been through military training. The School of the Americas, established in 1946, trains junior officers in basic leadership and middle-grade officers in staff work. All courses are taught in Spanish. **********The school was in Panama until 1984, when it was moved to Fort Benning, Ga., to comply with the Panama Canal treaties. Panama continued to send officers to the school until last year. **********Altogether, nearly 50,000 officers and noncommissioned officers have been trained in the school. General Noriega took infantry, intelligence and jungle operations training there as a lieutentant from 1965 to 1967. **********Each year, a few middle-grade or senior Latin American officers who speak English go to the Army's Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., or the Army War College at Carlisle Barracks, Pa. Others study at the Inter-American Defense College here."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/27/world/white-house-seeks-36-million-in-aid-for-the-contras.html": {"writer_name": "Joel Brinkley", "pub_date": "1988-01-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 717, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WHITE HOUSE SEEKS $36 MILLION IN AID FOR THE CONTRAS", "print_headline": "WHITE HOUSE SEEKS $36 MILLION IN AID FOR THE CONTRAS", "body_text": " **********The White House will ask Congress for $36.25 million in aid for the Nicaraguan rebels over the next several months, including $3.6 million to buy weapons, senior Administration officials said today. **********Under the White House plan, approved by the President today, the military aid would be held in escrow until March 31 and released only if the contras and the Sandinista Government have not reached agreement on a cease-fire by then. **********This final figure, arrived at after several days of consultation with members of Congress, is less than the President had wanted, a reflection of the stiff Congressional opposition the Administration request will face. Democrats Express Opposition **********Last fall, Secretary of State George P. Shultz said the Administration wanted $270 million to be spent over 18 months, or about $15 million a month. The actual request, to cover a period ending roughly July 1, comes to less than $10 million a month. **********Still, Congressional Democrats said they would oppose the plan, to be submitted to Congress on Wednesday.

Holding military aid in escrow ''is a built-in incentive to the contras not to agree to a cease-fire,'' the aide said. ''I think we can beat this.'' 'Isn't Going Anywhere' **********Representative Tony Coelho of California, the Democratic Whip, said the request ''isn't going anywhere.'' **********And Representative David E. Bonior, the Michigan Democrat who heads the House Nicaragua task force, said, ''This isn't a moderate request at all.'' **********''The delay on the military aid is just a gimmick that won't fool anybody up here,'' he said. **********But not all the opponents were quite so adamant. Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat who has been a leader of Senate opponents of contra aid, said the proposal ''is certainly more appealing'' but added that ''any assistance is a mistake.'' Reagan Confers With Senators **********To change the opponents' minds, President Reagan wants to give Congress a role in the decision on whether the military aid is to be released when the escrow period ends. This morning he met with several senators who are considered swing votes on the issue, and they told him the House of Representatives would defeat the request if that decision was left to the White House alone. Mr. Reagan's aides were consulting lawyers this evening to see how Congress might be included in the decision. **********The White House also says the Administration will consult informally with the Central American presidents, excluding President Daniel Ortega Saavedra of Nicaragua, on whether the military aid should be released. **********The Los Angeles Times, citing Administration officials, reported today that President Reagan intended to send Mr. Shultz to Central America to dramatize the appeal for contra aid. **********Officials said today that Mr. Shultz might be sent to Central America to meet with the region's leaders. But they said that no decision had been made and that Mr. Shultz would not be likely to go until a cease-fire was in place. **********Under the White House plan, the military aid would be used to buy rifle ammunition, Redeye antiaircraft rockets and other expendable lethal supplies. The nonmilitary aid would be used for food, clothing, aircraft and transportation of supplies. **********The $36 million figure actually understates the cost of the package. The White House is also requesting $20 million for self-insurance of the aircraft used to ferry equipment to the contras. Officials say that if a contra supply plane crashes - as one did Saturday - the cost of replacing it would come out of that fund. **********In addition, the Government spends money for surveillance of Nicaragua by satellite, SR-71 Blackbird reconnaissance aircraft, unmanned aerial drones and other means.

Goods outside those two volatile categories rose four-tenths of 1 percent, which economists said matched the average increase of the last three months and was about twice the average monthly rise during 1987. 'Pretty Potent Brew' **********''It looks like we are putting together a pretty potent brew for inflation,'' said James E. Annable, chief economist at the First National Bank of Chicago. ''The increases in producer prices fit with what you would expect based on economic theory.'' **********Based on increases in producer prices and the overall strength of the economy, consumer prices could be rising at a 5 percent to 6 percent rate by the end of the year, Mr. Annable said. Consumer prices rose by 4.4 percent in 1987 and 1.1 percent in 1986. **********Beryl W. Sprinkel, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, was less alarmed about the latest month's data. He said inflation ''remains quite restrained and will rise by about 4 percent this year, maybe less.'' **********Even with the large increase in March, the finished-goods index has barely increased in the last six months, growing at an annual rate of two-tenths of 1 percent. Other Increases Offset **********In February, it fell two-tenths of 1 percent as lower prices for food and energy more than offset increases for other goods. **********Although warnings of higher inflation in the last year have proved to be exaggerated, economists and financial analysts have continued to sound the alarms. Based on theory and experience, they expect higher inflation because of both an increase in prices of foreign imports, reflecting the dollar's fall, and an increase in wages to catch up with last year's 4.4 percent inflation. **********The March increase was larger than the financial markets had expected and caused a quick plunge in bond prices. The interest rate on 30-year Treasury bonds rose to just under 9 percent, the highest level since Jan. 14. **********''The bond market was surprised and is recognizing that inflation simply is not going to be as good over the next six months as it has been over the past six months,'' said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Bank. **********Mr. Fine added that it was premature to expect the Federal Reserve to push short-term interest rates higher as it did in March, but he noted that speculation was widespread that the central bank would tighten its monetary policy. **********Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber Inc., said the strong growth in American exports in the last year had made some industries more prone to raise prices ''because they are now operating at close to full capacity.'' He added that concern over recent increases in producer prices was heightened ''because the pickup has come at a time when the manufacturing sector of the economy was not really booming.'' **********A March increase of one-tenth of 1 percent in industrial production that was reported yesterday by the Federal Reserve was the latest sign that the nation's factories were producing goods at a much slower rate in the first quarter than they did last year. **********Economists expect that factory output will increase in coming months as businesses begin ordering more goods after reducing the larger-than-desired level of inventories held at the end of 1987. **********Mr. Sprinkel of the Council of Economic Advisers acknowledged that recent increases in producer prices, excluding food and energy, were of some concern. But he said a more rapid rise in inflation was not likely because the Federal Reserve was ''unlikely to engage in inflationary actions'' and because growth in demand from businesses and consumers was modest enough that there was little chance of a bidding war that would push prices higher. **********Thomas R. Tibbetts, Assistant Commissioner of the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, said the recent producer price data were ambiguous enough to argue about whether the numbers sugggested rising inflation or a pattern of stable prices. 'Important Development' **********But he concluded that, ''on balance, considering recent increases in prices for goods in the intermediate stage of production and the broad base of the increases in finished goods prices for March, it is an important development and a harbinger'' of future developments. **********Prices of intermediate goods, which need further processing before they are ready for sale, rose seven-tenths of 1 percent in March and increased at an annual rate of 7 1/2 percent in the last six months. According to the Labor Department, the impetus for higher prices of intermediate goods has come primarily from such manufacturing industries as metals, paper and petrochemicals. **********''The increase in energy prices is probably the most disquieting development,'' Mr. Tibbetts said. ''There was nothing in our survey to reflect the increases in oil prices the past week or so.'' The announcement last weekend that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would meet later this month with other oil-producing nations in an attempt to cut back production has roiled the oil markets enough to cause the price of oil futures traded in New York to rise to $18.37 a barrel yesterday from $16.88 a week ago. Division on Lasting Changes **********Many economists, including Mr. Sprinkel, noted that increases in inflation caused by higher oil prices or declines in the value of the dollar, which raise the price of imported goods, were essentially one-time changes with no lasting effects. **********Other analysts, however, warn that inflation because of oil and imports cannot be lightly dismissed if they endure long enough to create an inflationary psychology that leads to higher wages and the beginning of an inflationary spiral. **********Even a one-time inflation shock causes problems for economic policy makers, especially those at the Federal Reserve. They must choose between supplying the economy with enough additional money to accommodate the higher prices or hold money growth in check, even if that results in slower economic growth."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/11/business/bally-selling-game-unit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-07-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 134, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bally Selling Game Unit", "print_headline": "Bally Selling Game Unit", "body_text": " **********The Bally Manufacturing Company said Friday that it had agreed in principle to sell its coin-operated amusement game manufacturing business to Williams Industries for $8 million.

Economists and other experts were divided on whether the latest trade figures represented a positive development. **********Some economists said the slower pace of both imports and exports indicated a welcome slowdown in the economy that might relieve some pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates further to counter a possible speed-up in inflation. 'A Little Moderation' **********''It does suggest we're seeing a little moderation,'' Evelina M. Tainer, a senior economist at the First National Bank of Chicago, said of the trade numbers. She added that ''there still is an improving trend'' in trade. **********Other analysts disagreed. Even though the economy showed signs of settling back into a more sustainable growth path during the summer, this now appears to have been only a temporary lull partly as a result of the drought. Most of the recent indicators, including stunningly strong November employment growth reported on Dec. 2, have been buoyant to strong. **********Indeed, other figures published by the Government today continued to show little evidence that the economy slowed in November. Industrial output jumped a brisk five-tenths of 1 percent, the capacity utilization rate climbed two-tenths of 1 percent, to a nine-year high, and business inventories rose at their slowest rate in five months. On Tuesday, the Commerce Department said retail sales rose a hefty 1.1 percent last month. **********In addition, Robert A. Brusca, the chief economist for Nikko Securities Company International Inc. in New York, expressed concern about what he contended had become a worrisome lack of continued improvement on the trade front. **********''It's very clear,'' he added. ''Trade progress has ground to a halt.'' **********Sooner or later, he said, the Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates to overcome the effects of rising prices for imports resulting from weakness in the dollar. An increase in rates would reduce the demand for goods and services, including imported ones. Strategy Session Held **********Since March, the Federal Reserve, concerned about the economy's strength and inflation, has moved on several occasions to raise interest rates, a process that has now brought about an increase in the prime lending rate of banks. The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee today concluded a two-day strategy session amid speculation that another round of interest rate rises might be imminent. **********Several European central banks moved today to raise rates, with others appearing to be preparing to follow suit. **********Today's economic reports, including the trade figures, combined to push down the stock and bond markets, as well as the dollar. **********The trade figures themselves provided little comfort to the optimists as the United States deficit with Japan soared to $5.5 billion from $4.1 billion in September and as the overall September deficit was revised to a level $200 million higher than was initially reported. Moreover, much of the October improvement was accounted for by lower oil prices, which subsequently appear to have turned up, analysts pointed out. **********The aggregate figures for exports, imports and the trade deficit are adjusted for seasonal variations while those for individual countries and commodities are not. **********Commerce Secretary C. William Verity Jr. sought to portray the trade data in an optimistic fashion but in doing so he acknowledged that the trade deficit remained ''very large'' and that its elimination ''poses a major challenge.'' **********Imports during October fell by about $650 million, or 1.7 percent, to $38 billion, reflecting lower purchases of capital, consumer and automotive goods and higher imports of industrial supplies and foods, feeds and beverages. **********Some analysts said they would not be surprised if imports rose again for November because an increasing proportion of fashion-sensitive and other Christmas merchandise was being brought in by air, undermining the seasonal adjustment factors. **********Exports, meanwhile, fell about $325 million, or 1.1 percent, during October, to $27.7 billion. This resulted from declines for industrial supplies, foods and other consumer goods and increases in ''other'' merchandise. Vehicles and capital goods were about unchanged, the Commerce Department reported. 28 Percent Export Surge Nearly half of the economic growth of the United States so far this year has resulted from a 28 percent surge in exports. Imports climbed 8 percent over the first 10 months, Mr. Verity also pointed out. **********The sharply higher October deficit with Japan was not considered alarming by itself, but some analysts were also noting that Japan reported earlier this week a swelling of its trade surplus for November. The correlation between the American deficit for one month and the Japanese surplus for another month, however, is not close. **********Imports of new Japanese cars, the American figures showed, climbed to $2.1 billion in October from $1.4 billion in September, accounting for about half the bilateral deterioration. **********The deficit with Western Europe, meanwhile, rebounded to $1.5 billion in October from about $900 million while the deficit with the four newly industrialized Asian areas edged down about $100 million, to $3 billion. The deficit with two of the four, Taiwan and South Korea, narrowed while that with Hong Kong and Singapore rose. Decline in Oil Costs **********The American oil bill eased to $3.1 bilion from $3.3 billion as an increase of seven million barrels of imports was more than offset by a decline in the average price per barrel to $13.46 from $14.60. Oil accounts for almost one-third of the trade deficit. **********The deficit in manufactured goods, not seasonally adjusted, widened to $13.6 billion in October from $11.4 billion in September, today's report also showed, while the surplus in agricultural commodities remained unchanged at the recent high level of $1.4 billion. **********The deficit with Canada, the nation's biggest trading partner, edged up to $1 billion, from a revised $900 million in September.

The search for a consensus still has a way to go, they said, and both France and the United States face presidential elections this year. **********The goal of the summit meeting, rather, is evidently to pull the allies together and prevent the fissures that have appeared in the wake of agreement to eliminate medium- and shorter-range missiles from becoming any deeper, and to show a common front at a time when public opinion throughout Western Europe has become increasingly taken by Mikhail S. Gorbachev and nuclear disarmament. **********In particular, the allies would like to allay any fears that a serious dispute is developing with West Germany, where the new treaty has revived old fears of facing a disproportionate share of military risk, an angst that been dubbed ''singularization.'' An Emphasis on Unity **********To prevent any friction, the meeting is expected to set aside the more contentious issues, such as the modernization of short-range weapons, and to wrap others in compromise formulas. At the same time, the NATO leaders will try to focus on the successes of the six years since they last met, such as the treaty, the cooperation in the Persian Gulf, the relative calm of the peace movement and the progress toward an accord to halve Soviet and American intercontinental missiles. **********North Atlantic Treaty Organization officials were reported to be working hard to complete a summit statement on the need for a balance in conventional forces, focusing on the East-West meetings now under way in Vienna to shape a mandate for new negotiations on conventional arms ''from the Atlantic to the Urals.'' **********A common front was needed at this time, the officials said, because of preparations for Mr. Reagan's visit to Moscow in May or June. The President had hoped to sign an agreement there halving the superpower arsenals of intercontinental missiles, but the treaty may not be ready in time. **********Mr. Reagan, who is coming to Brussels with several hundred officials and aides, may use the meeting to try to shape his legacy as the American leader who presided over both the revival of Western military might and the turn to disarmament. **********In a reflection of both of the importance of the meeting and of the presidential campaigning gathering steam at home, France will be represented in Brussels by both President Francois Mitterrand and Prime Minister Jacques Chirac. Short-Range Modernization **********What had loomed as the most divisive issue at the summit meeting was defused last week when Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany persuaded Mr. Reagan not to press the scheduled modernization of short-range nuclear missiles. **********Since the signing last December of the agreement that eliminated missiles with ranges of more than 300 miles, the West Germans have become increasingly concerned that remaining short-range rockets and artillery shells are targeted largely on East and West Germany. **********Though Washington and other allies have argued that there are innumerable other air-, land- and sea-based nuclear weapons threatening other NATO countries, and that in any event some 300,000 allied soldiers stationed in West Germany share the Germans' predicament, the sense of ''singularization'' has grown among Germans of both right and left. **********The result has been to pit West Germany against its allies on the issue of tactical weapons, which most NATO members believe are critical to maintain a credible defense against the Warsaw Pact's preponderance in men and tanks. Though Mr. Kohl has not called for their elimination, alone among the allies he has called for negotiating a ceiling on their number, while resisting their modernization. **********The issue came to a head at a recent seminar in Munich, at which Mr. Kohl and other officials argued the dangers of ''singularization'' while the United States Defense Secretary, Frank C. Carlucci, hinted that America would wonder about keeping troops in Germany if they did not have tactical nuclear weapons to defend themselves. The clash evidently convinced some of the Americans present of the danger of pushing Mr. Kohl into a corner. A 'Full Understanding' **********In any case, on his return from Washington last week, Mr. Kohl announced that he had reached ''full understanding'' that tactical weapons would not be modernized until NATO fashioned an ''overall concept'' of arms controls. He said the Brussels meeting would give such a framework ''new impetus.'' **********The quest for a new strategic concept is likely to dominate NATO planners for some time to come. When NATO held its last summit meeting in 1982, the alliance was racked by fierce popular opposition to the deployment of new American missiles in Europe. **********This time around, it is the elimination of that entire class of missiles that has served to raise many fundamental questions long smoldering within the alliance: the Soviet numerical superiority in conventional arms, America's role in the alliance, the public demands for disarmament, and the viability of NATO's current military strategies. **********The debate has been complicated from one side by the new politics of Mr. Gorbachev, which have helped blur the perceived outline of the Eastern foe in public opinion. The Russians also have been quick to fan differences within NATO, most recently when Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, suggested in Bonn that the Kremlin was also opposed to tactical weapons."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/15/business/week-in-business-cost-of-borrowing-is-heading-upward.html": {"writer_name": "Steve Dodson", "pub_date": "1988-05-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 982, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Cost of Borrowing Is Heading Upward", "print_headline": "WEEK IN BUSINESS; Cost of Borrowing Is Heading Upward", "body_text": " **********The prime rate went up by half a percentage point, to 9 percent. After weeks of increases in other rates, the move by banks to raise their base lending rate was no surprise. Nevertheless, the financial markets took it as confirmation of a discouraging trend. At 9 percent, the prime is where it was before the stock market crash of October. The prime influences the borrowing costs of small and medium-size businesses and consumers. The Federal Reserve influences the borrowing costs of the banks, and there were signs of a squeeze.

Mr. Trump was to have retained the Taj Mahal casino being built in Atlantic City. The Griffin camp said Mr. Trump was trying to ''sweeten the deal for himself'' by revising terms on Taj Mahal expenses.

The Japanese were active buyers and demand was strong enough that yields were easing by week's end.

But all except Bear, Stearns said they would continue to do such trading for their customers. The trading tries to take advantage of differences between the price of stock index futures and the prices of the stocks that make up the indexes. It involves rapid trading of huge numbers of shares and has been widely criticized as a cause of volatility in the market. Pressure for an end to the practice has been building. At least one large corporation, American International, disclosed that it had put out the word, before the five firms announced their decision, that it would deal only with investment banks that quit such trading. *********** A whopping loss in Texas at one institution accounted for much of the $2.4 billion decline in capital reported for the nation's savings and loan associations in March.

In the final quarter, these funds managed to outperform the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index for the first time since the second quarter of 1983. **********''The average equity fund declined 20.43 percent in the latest quarter, or less than the 22.75 percent drop in the index,'' said A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services. ''The funds benefited by holding some cash, but the index stays fully invested.'' **********The Lipper organization released its 1987 performance survey yesterday. Results are computed on a total return basis, which assumes that all dividends and interest are reinvested. **********In 1987, for the fifth straight year, general equity funds lagged behind the S.&P. index. The funds posted a return of 0.47 percent. In fact, without dividend reinvestment they would have produced a negative return. The S.&P. index ended 1987 with a return of 4.94 percent. **********Two of the three best-performing funds in 1987 get their investment advice from the Oppenheimer Management Corporation. Jon Fossel, president of the corporation, offered this outlook: ''Three to six months out, we see the stock market higher than it is today. Beyond that period, our crystal ball gets clouded.'' **********Oppenheimer Management, which is not related to the brokerage house of Oppenheimer & Company, is owned by British and Commonwealth Inc., a financial services firm based in London. The Oppenheimer Ninety-Ten Fund, an option growth fund, produced a return of 93.56 percent as last year's top performer. The Oppenheimer Gold and Special Minerals Fund, ranking third among all 1,389 funds, gained 71.59 percent. Milton Berg manages both portfolios. **********The second-best performer was the DFA Japan Small Company Fund, up 87.76 percent, whose investment adviser is Dimensional Fund Advisors of Santa Monica, Calif. ''We are asset allocators -not stock pickers,'' explained Jeanne Sinquefield, the executive vice president. ''Our portfolio holds between 500 and 600 of the smaller-capitalization stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.'' This fund is open only to institutional investors. **********It was a year when shareowners did better by investing abroad, thus benefiting from the dollar's decline against other currencies. International stock funds returned 13.95 percent, after gaining 53.25 percent in 1986. **********World income funds, which invest mainly in bonds of foreign governments, did even better than international stock funds last year as they rose 20.80 percent. **********Just as equity funds were hit hard by the October debacle, fixed-income funds were rocked by a surge in interest rates during April and May. Fixed-income funds showed a return of 1.27 percent - or less than money-market funds, which averaged returns of more than 5 percent. **********Gold funds were the year's most profitable sector for investors. Benefiting from inflation fears and growing disenchantment with stocks, gold funds rose 35.66 percent. **********Oddly enough, Oppenheimer Gold and Special Minerals took a fairly cautious view of gold stocks, according to Mr. Fossel. ''On Oct. 19, when the stock market broke, the fund was more than 50 percent in cash,'' he said. ''By early November, it was 90 percent invested. However, we tilted the balance in favor of special minerals and invested in copper, nickel, molybdenum and steel stocks, making only modest commitments in gold.'' **********The Ninety-Ten Fund managed by Mr. Berg keeps 90 percent of its assets in conservative money market instruments, while 10 percent can go into more speculative put or call options. Betting that the stock market was poised for a drop, Mr. Berg bought put options on the S.&P. 100-index in September. By Oct. 20, one day after the collapse, he sold these puts and switched to all cash in the option portfolio. **********The year's poorest performer was the 44 Wall Street Equity Fund, which over time has tended to perform either very well or very badly. In the 1986 fourth quarter, it had the second-best record among all funds. The fund generally invests in a small number of stocks and has often favored technology issues. Its portfolio manager is David H. Baker Jr., who operates out of the Cayman Islands. He was unavailable for comment.  But Lawrence Auriana, portfolio manager of the Kaufman Fund, 1987's second-poorest performer, was more obliging. ''Our largest position and our biggest loser was Chantal Pharmaceutical, a development-stage drug company,'' he said. ''This stock went from $10 in December 1986 to $2.875 bid at the end of last year.'' **********The year's third-worst performer was Fidelity Select Brokerage, a sector fund that concentrates on brokerage and financial-related issues. At the end of October, its larger holdings included Dreyfus Corporation, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch and American Express. The investment adviser is Fidelity Investments of Boston.

Those imbalances, especially a huge American trade deficit and large surpluses in Japan and West Germany, have unsettled the world's financial markets. and have been cited as causes of the October stock market collapse. Unexpected Growth **********In their communique, the ministers said growth was continuing at a faster pace than had been expected earlier in the year, that world employment has increased and that inflationary pressures were being contained. Because of the coming American elections and the expectation that Canada will have elections this fall, many economists had expected the Group of Seven officials to give themselves high marks on their management of economic conditions. **********Officials from the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Italy, Britain and Canada attended the meeting, one of several gatherings leading up to the annual conference of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, which officially begins here next week. **********The huge debt burden on developing nations will be the main topic at those meetings, and today the Group of Seven welcomed a new plan to ease that load. **********In their communique, the finance officials said they were committed to pursuing policies ''that will maintain exchange rate stability.'' In recent months those policies have included massive intervention in the currency markets by central banks and changes in interest rates. The measures appear to have successfully influenced the volatile foreign-exchange markets this year, preventing disruptive swings in the value of the dollar. **********In a news briefing today, a senior United States Treasury Department official said the language regarding exchange-rate levels ''seems to me a rather clear statement of confirmation of the desirability of the status quo.'' Plaza Meeting Began Process **********In ratifying the current level of the dollar, the finance ministers were continuing a three-year experiment in economic cooperation and exchange-rate management that began in September 1985 when the finance ministers signed an agreement at the Plaza Hotel in New York that sought to drive down the level of the dollar. At that time, American officials were concerned that the strength of the dollar was swelling the nation's trade deficit and encouraging protectionist trade measures. **********The dollar closed Friday at 134.33 Japanese yen, well below its level of September 1985, but 9 percent higher than the end of last year, when central banks bought massive amounts of dollars because they thought it had grown too weak. In addition, the dollar closed in Friday's trading at 1.8735 West German marks, 19 percent higher than at the end of 1987. **********The managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Michel Camdessus, created some friction with officials of the Group of Seven this week when he suggested that the dollar might be too strong. ''The recent upward movement of the dollar is not what could be considered as the most desirable development,'' he said on Thursday, adding that the stronger dollar would ''make somewhat more difficult'' the process of reducing the huge American trade deficit. **********A stronger dollar makes imported goods cheaper in the United States, increasing America's appetite for these goods and raising the trade deficit. At the same time, it makes American goods more expensive overseas. Concern Over Deficit **********Many economists fear that if the American trade deficit does not drop significantly, the dollar could plunge, throwing the world's financial markets into havoc. **********Clearly referring to the United States, the communique said, ''Where external and budget deficits are still large, the strengthening of the fiscal position will be essential.' **********Senior Treasury Department officials denied that this meant the Group of Seven was calling on Washington to raise taxes. One called the statement ''a reference to the fact that the United States is committed to reduce its deficit further.'' **********Regarding West Germany and Japan, the communique said ''strong domestic demand growth is required,'' meaning those nations should seek to stimulate domestic consumption to increase imports and to spur growth at home and abroad. **********The ministers praised the coordination of their policies. The statement said this coordination is achieving the group's objectives of correcting trade imbalances and sustaining economic growth that is not inflationary. **********The statement said recent interest rate increases have demonstrated the will to resist inflationary pressure. ''As a result, there is little evidence of a general inflationary threat,'' it said. **********This was the first Group of Seven meeting attended by the Nicholas F. Brady, the new United States Treasury Secretary. He will also be among the more then 10,000 financial officials and bankers from 151 nations attending the World Bank and I.M.F. meetings, which run Tuesday through Thursday. Those international agencies seek to maintain order in the world economy and promote the development of poor countries. **********For many finance officials here, the main issues are the mountain of debt owed by third world nations and the huge trade imbalances among the industrialized nations. Little Deficit Decline Seen **********In a report detailing its economic outlook, the I.M.F. said Washington's trade deficit would decline hardly at all next year. It said the current-account deficit - which includes the merchandise trade deficit and the flow of invisible services -would be $128.7 billion next year, compared with an anticipated $128.9 billion this year. Last year, the American deficit in the current account was $154 billion. **********The economic report also revised upward the growth prospects for the industrial world, saying economic output would grow a robust 3.9 percent this year. In April it had predicted that the industrialized nations' economies would grow only 2.8 percent. I.M.F. economists did not revise upward their forecast for the developing nations, forecasting a growth rate of 3.6 percent. **********Many third world officials said this week that their burden of making debt repayments and low commodity prices were holding back their industrial growth. There were also frequent complaints that the I.M.F.'s programs that push debtor contries to adjust their economic policies, by adopting austerity programs to encourage growth and help them pay back their debts, are too painful for their populations. **********''This process may not be sustainable. It can carry with it very explosive consequencs,'' said Bernard Chizero, Zimbabwe's Finance Minister, chairman of the World Bank's Development Committee. **********Finance Ministers of the Group of 24, consisting of debtor nations, also issued a statement today, stressing ''the urgent need for increased real resource transfers to developing countries.'' **********In the Group of Seven statement, the ministers reiterated their support for a ''growth-oriented, case-by-case'' strategy for dealing with the developing world's $1.2 trillion in foreign debt. **********In a new development, the communique welcomed an arrangement worked out this week by the 17 largest creditor nations to give some debt relief to the poorest nations."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/28/world/iraq-to-spur-talks-says-it-may-develop-new-port.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Lewis", "pub_date": "1988-10-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 726, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Iraq, to Spur Talks, Says It May Develop New Port", "print_headline": "Iraq, to Spur Talks, Says It May Develop New Port", "body_text": " **********A senior Iraqi official says his Government will develop a new port on the Persian Gulf if Iran continues to reject its proposals for reopening a blocked waterway when gulf peace talks resume in Geneva next week. **********The official, Ismat Taha Kittani, the United Nations delegate, said Iraq was ready to reopen and expand the small deep-water port at Al Zubair to the west of the blocked waterway, the Shatt al Arab, and make this its principal outlet to the gulf if peace talks remain deadlocked. The port is reached from the gulf through the Khor Abdallah channel. **********Mr. Kittani said in an interview Wednesday that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq first started to explore alternatives to reopening the Shatt al Arab a few weeks ago. **********The idea, which has already been mentioned by the Iraqi press, is widely seen by Western diplomats as a way of increasing pressure on Iran to agree to dredge the Shatt al Arab. The waterway is blocked by silt, sunken shipping and unexploded ordnance left over from the eight-year war between Iran and Iraq. A cease-fire has been in effect since August. Principal Outlet to Gulf **********Before the war, the Shatt al Arab was Iraq's principal outlet to the sea, linking the port of Basra with the gulf. Developing an alternative port at Al Zubair would allow Iraq to leave the Shatt al Arab blocked indefinitely. But it might also condemn the gulf peace talks to an indefinite stalemate, diplomats say. **********Iran and Iraq have been fighting for centuries over the ownership of the Shatt al Arab, which serves as their border. When he invaded Iran in 1980 at the start of the gulf war, President Hussein abrogated the 1975 Algiers Treaty, which divided ownership of the waterway between the two countries, and demanded full sovereignty over it. **********Mr. Kittani said Iraq is ready to abandon Basra as a port if Iran refuses to reopen the Shatt al Arab on its terms and restore freedom of navigation in the gulf. **********''We can do without Basra if necessary,'' he said. ''Iran wants to turn Iraq into a landlocked country by keeping the Shatt al Arab closed. But they won't succeed. We will build a new port.'' **********He said Iran would be forced to sacrifice its port of Khorramshahr if the Shatt al Arab remains closed to shipping. ''Before the war about 80 percent of Iran's imports came through Khorramshahr,'' he added. Cost Put at $1.5 Billion **********Mr. Kittani said reopening the Shatt al Arab would cost at least $1.5 billion.

The founder of the firm that became Shearson Lehman Hutton worked out a $1.65 billion deal under which his Commercial Credit Group will merge with Primerica, the parent of Smith Barney, Harris Upham. Primerica, the former American Can Company, has been transformed into a financial services conglomerate by Gerald Tsai Jr., who made a fortune during the stock market's ''go-go'' years of the 1960's. Mr. Weill began building his Wall Street firm in the 1960's and in 1981 sold Shearson to American Express for $1 billion. In 1986 he bought into Commercial Credit, which provides consumer loans. The new company will be known as Primerica, and Mr. Weill will hold the top offices. The combination will bring together 1,800 branch offices that could offer a wide array of consumer financial services. *********** Civilian unemployment edged up in August to a 5.6 percent rate, compared with 5.4 percent in July. The unemployment rate for the populatioin including the military rose to 5.5 percent for the month, from 5.4 percent in July. The Labor Department report said that the number of people without jobs in the civilian labor market rose by 226,000, to 6,851,000, while the number of those employed rose 121,000, to 115,180,000. A survey of payrolls also offered evidence of an easing in the boom-like conditions of late spring and early summer. The survey put the number of new jobs in August at 219,000, a little below what many economic analysts had been expecting. That number in July had been 283,000. **********Other signs of a cooling in the economy included a decline of eight-tenths of 1 percent in the index of leading indicators for July, the steepest drop in eight months. The index, an indicator of the economy's direction, had been up in June, by 1.4 percent. . . .New-home sales in July had their steepest drop in seven months, falling 4.7 percent. The median price of a new home was up 5.6 percent, to $123,500 . . . Factory orders fell 3.5 percent in July, with most of the drop in the highly erratic military-goods sector . . . Construction spending rose by a relatively robust 1.2 percent in July, after slumping in June . . . *********** Stocks and bonds rallied sharply on the news that the jobless rate had risen in August. The sign of a cooling in the economy helped allay fears that too-robust growth would add to inflationary pressures and force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates some more. After the report on Friday, bond prices leaped enough to drop the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond from 9.31 to 9.04 percent. That was the bond market's best day since the flight-to-quality rally after the stock market crash in October. On Friday, the stock market took off too, with the Dow Jones industrial average soaring 52.28 points, to close at 2,054.59. Four previous days of seesaw action meant that Friday's jump gave the Dow a gain of 37.16 points for the week. *********** Oklahoma got attention from the Federal regulators of savings and loan associations. The Federal Home Loan Bank Board put up $1.2 billion to complete a deal in which 14 of that state's most troubled institutions will be reorganized into six large institutions. It was the fifth such big bailout in the last two weeks, with most of those deals being done in Texas. *********** Gould will be bought by Nippon Mining in a $1.1 billion deal that is the fourth-largest Japanese acquisition of an American company. Gould, an old-line industrial company, had been trying to become a maker of computers, semiconductors and military hardware, but recently has been selling many of its newer operations. *********** The contest for Irving Bank lost one of its players as Banca Commerciale Italiana withdrew its bid. The Italian bank said it was unwilling to go along with a Federal Reserve ruling that would have forced its parent company to comply with American banking regulations. The Banca Commerciale offer - $775 million for 51 percent of Irving - had been worked out with Irving management as an alternative to a hostile offer of more than $1 billion from Bank of New York. Irving said it would seek another ally in the battle that began nearly a year ago. *********** A Federal judge allowed Eastern Airlines to proceed with plans to close its Kansas City, Mo., hub and sharply reduce service in the western United States.

After the summit meeting here in December, the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said: ''The first thing that must occur is a pullout of Soviet troops, and then we'll talk about U.S. aid. But it would not be simultaneous.'' U.S. Has Leverage **********It is not clear exactly when Mr. Reagan learned of the commitment, but remarks by the President and aides around the time of the summit meeting suggested that he had either not been briefed or had not understood the American position on the timing of the aid cutoff. **********The United States retains considerable leverage over the final shape of an agreement, since Washington has made the cutoff of aid to the Islamic guerrillas contingent on a Soviet withdrawal plan acceptable to the Administration. Once the plan is accepted, however, the end of American aid and the start of the pullout are to take place simultaneously 60 days later. **********Given President Reagan's vocal backing of the guerrillas, some officials say they would rather wait to cut off weapons supplies until well after the 115,000 Soviet troops begin their departure, to make sure it is real. **********But the officials see no way now to reopen the question of timing without risking a collapse in the efforts to fashion an accord on a withdrawal. Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, said on Monday that Soviet troops could begin a 10-month pullout on May 15 if agreement is complete by March 15. He also endorsed the idea that a disproportionate number of Soviet troops might leave in the first few months of a pullout, in response to concerns by American officials over a long withdrawal. **********The commitment to make the aid cutoff simultaneous with the start of the withdrawal was given in December 1985. Otherwise, one official said, ''There would have been no impetus for anybody to negotiate.'' **********The commitment was reportedly put forth by Michael H. Armacost, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, who then cleared it with Secretary of State George P. Shultz and sent it to the White House. There, officials say, it was cleared by Donald Fortier, head of political-military affairs for the National Security Council, who died in August 1986. Why the matter was not put before President Reagan is not known. **********''There was a certain hypothetical quality to some of this'' at the time, a senior State Department official said. Different World Situation **********Other officials pointed out that the international situation was significantly different in 1985, when few people thought there was much prospect of a negotiated Soviet pullout. **********The negotiations have been conducted indirectly between Pakistan and Afghanistan through the mediation of Diego Cordovez, a United Nations Under Secretary General. Mr. Cordovez announced this week that what he hopes will be a final round of talks will convene in Geneva on March 2. **********The American role, agreed to in December 1985, would be to serve as a guarantor of the accords that emerge from the Geneva negotiations. These include a declaration that the United States will not interfere in Afghanistan's affairs, implying an end to military aid to the guerrillas, contingent on an acceptable pullout timetable. **********Pakistan has felt increasing pressure to help reach an agreement to end the eight-year war.

Gorbachev's term for economic and political restructuring, approved by the extraordinary Communist Party conference last week and published today for the first time. The resolution and five others on such topics as legal reform and changing the bureaucracy, were distributed in translation by the official press agency Tass. **********Under the impact of the ideas and deeds of perestroika our society is being consolidated, while the creative energy of the working class, the farmers and the intellectuals is on the upswing. People have come to believe in perestroika and speak in favor of promoting it and making the revolutionary changes irreversible. **********Democratization and glasnost have changed cardinally the ideological, political and social climate. **********The economic improvement of the country has begun, and its turn towards meeting the vital requirements of the people is under way. New methods of economic management are growing more effective, industrial amalgamations and enterprises are beginning to work on the lines of cost-effectiveness and self-recoupment in compliance with the law on the state enterprise (amalgamation). **********The law on cooperatives in the U.S.S.R. has been drafted, extensively discussed and adopted. New and progressive forms of shop-floor labor relations based on contract and lease arrangements, and also self-employment are coming into their own. The organizational structures of management are being remodeled to provide most favorable conditions for effective economic management of primary economic units. **********The work launched at the party's initiative has made it possible to resume the growth of the real incomes of the working people. Practical measures are taken to step up the output of foodstuffs and consumer goods and expand housing construction semicolon and the reforms of education and medical care are under way. Intellectual and cultural activities are giving a powerful impetus to the country's advance.... **********Thus, perestroika is entering ever deeper the life of Soviet society, having an increasingly transforming effect on it. **********At the same time the conference notes that perestroika is a contradictory and hard process accompanied by the struggle between old and new. And though positive tendencies are evident and the first results have already been achieved, a cardinal change in economic, social and cultural development is yet to occur. The mechanism of retardation has not yet been totally dismantled and replaced by a mechanism of acceleration. ... **********The economic structure remains, on the whole, cost-intensive. Scientific and technological progress is yet slow, and the plans for increasing the national income and resource-saving are not fulfilled. There is no noticeable improvement in product quality. The country's finances are still in a bad state. Tensions remain in the supply of foodstuffs and consumer goods, and the population's demand for the services is not fully met. The housing problem remains acute. ... **********At all stages of public, state and economic activity there are still many people who do not want or cannot part with the command style of administration, and painfully react to everything new. There are many others who are frightened by the scope and depth of perestroika, who would prefer to stop halfway and limit the revolutionary content of perestroika by half-measures. **********At the same time, there have been attempts to speed up the developments artificially and skip whole stages, and there have been calls for doing everything at one go, with no regard for objective preconditions and the level of social consciousness. **********To overcome the bureaucratic methods of management typical of the command style of administration, the conference resolutely supports the course of transforming the functions and style of work on the ministries and other central agencies, eliminating excessive links and transmitting their rights to the local level, substantially reducing the apparatus and raising the qualification of the personnel employed in it. It is impermissible to procrastinate in this matter. **********Many party organizations, which have failed to assess properly and in due time the causes behind retardation, and which bide their time, displaying indecision in combatting outdated and mastering new forms and methods of work, fall short of the tasks set by perestroika. ... **********The conference considers that top priority is to be given today to a fundamental reform of the political system, precisely this system is expected to open up new possibilities for promoting perestroika in every area of public life and guarantee that it is irreversible. 2. Accelerated solution of the vital problems of people's well-being is the most important task in the socio-economic sphere. **********In the first place, food supplies for the country's population should be improved substantially. This is a major socio-political question. **********The shortest way to solving it is to tap the potential fo the collective and state farms in full, by spreading diverse forms of contract and lease arrangements, building a far-flung network of cooperatives both in the framework of the existing farms and in relations with other enterprises and sections of the economy. It is necessary to take urgent measures to improve the transportation, processing, storage and sale of farm produce, effectively use the means allocated for modernizing existing and building new enterprises in this sphere. ... **********Any attempts to command collective and state farms should be stopped immediately. They are capable of solving independently the problems involved in their internal economic activity, determining the forms of relationships among them and the forms of production servicing. **********The fundamental questions of modern agrarian policy are the remodelling of the countryside in social terms, improvement of the working and living conditions there and providing the countryside with the necessary material and technical resources.... **********Using the possibilities of the new mechanism of management it is necessary to speed up the saturation of the market with diverse commodities and services, and enhance work everywhere to increase the output of consumer goods. ... **********The conference approves of the measures being taken greatly to increase the volume and rate of housing construction and improve its quality in order to accomplish the task set by the 27th CPSU Congress of providing practically every family with a separate flat or a house by the year 2000. **********Noting that the expansion of state-financed, cooperative and individual housing construction and the initative displayed by work collectives and local soviets in building housing are being held back today by the weakness of the construction industry and first of all the shortage of building materials, the acute shortage of specialized machines and equipment, the conference is of the opinion that these problems should be solved by government bodies of the USSR and the union republics without delay. ... **********As the economic reform is being developed and deepened, it is essential to complete the building of a new economic mechanism and let every work collective, every worker know the principles of the reform. We must make people much more interested in the best end result, utterly overcome equalization tendencies, adhere more boldly and everywhere to the principle of remunerating work in accordance with its quantity and especially quality, to rule out a possibility of living a comfortable life while doing shoddy work. **********The conference emphasizes that the solution of all the economic and social tasks can be insured only on the basis of the conscientious and highly procutive work of Soviet people. ... 3. Revolutionary perestroika is impossible without invigorating in every way the intellectual and cultural potential of society, without progress of science and technology, without increasing the scientific-technical contribution by scientists and engineers, without raising their prestige and improving the conditions of their work, without a modern standard of the entire system of education and without a growth of the people's general and political culture. ... **********Deep-going changes are indispensable in the social sciences, which should finally overcome dogmatism and the isolation from life. It is their duty to creatively elaborate pressing and long-term questions of developing socialism, problems of world development and increase their actual contribution to politics and society. **********The conference is in favor of further democratising the sphere of science and culture, of creating and developing a material base for this sphere in line with the requirements of restructuring society. The party supports the diversity of search for and the artistic vision of truth, competitiveness, innovation and continuity and expects workers in science, literature and art to be most active, devoted and have a sense of high responsibility to the people. ... **********The conference draws attention to the need to solve with greater vigor the problems that directly concern the interests of women. They should be better represented in governing bodies from bottom to top. It is necessary to raise the role of women in society and political life, to protect and defend the prestige and rights of mothers, create conditions for their discharge of their duties, and to show more consideration for young families. 4. The conference approves the proposals on the reform of the political system set forth in the report by Mikhail Gorbachev, and is for their implementation in practice. **********The delimitation of functions performed by party and government bodies and the revival of the sovereignty of soviets from bottom to top is of key significance. Together with the reform of the judiciary system and other institutes insuring a legal regulation of relations between the state and citizens, protection of the political, economic, social and personal rights of all members of society, this is ultimately directed at completing the creation of a socialist state committed to the rule of law in which unconditional observance of law by all and everyone will be the highest principle. **********The reshaping of supreme power in the state, which provides for convocation of Congresses of People's Deputies of the U.S.S.R., the functioning of the bicameral Supreme Soviet on a regular basis, the introduction of the post of president of the Supreme Soviet, a democratic use of their prerogatives and a constitutionally regulated interaction of all higher echelons of power, including the council of ministers of the U.S.S.R., are viewed by the conference as the main preconditions for an effective functioning of the political system. ... **********The solution of the tasks of perestroika that are of crucial importance to the country and socialism requires a growth of the party's guiding role and new criteria of assessing its performance of this role. **********The C.P.S.U. will never again allow a repetition of anything resembling the periods of the personality cult and stagnation which deep deformations in socialist society, held back its development for whole decades and resulted in huge loss of life and countless moral and ideological losses. ... **********The conference views as correct the Soviet leadership's approach to the problem of removing the threat of war by means of an open and constructive dialogue and through disarmament, which opened the way to signng the INF treaty and put on a practical plane the talks on nuclear, chemical and conventional arms. **********The conference fully approves of the decision to withdraw troops from Afghanistan on the basis of the Geneva accords and of relations with that neighbor country as with an independent, neutral and nonaligned state. **********Foreign-policy activity should contribute ever more to releasing the country's resources for peaceful construction, for perestroika, and be closely tied in with the democratisation of society, including-making and verification of compliance with the decisions made."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/21/world/cambodia-peace-plan-eludes-asian-nations.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-10-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 196, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Cambodia Peace Plan Eludes Asian Nations", "print_headline": "Cambodia Peace Plan Eludes Asian Nations", "body_text": " **********Officials from Southeast Asian nations failed today to agree on a plan to end the 10-year-old Cambodian conflict, but the participants pledged to meet in December to try again. **********The main stumbling block at the four-day meeting was Vietnam's insistence on linking its promised troop pullout from Cambodia to preventing the Khmer Rouge from returning to power and ending arms aid to the Cambodian guerrillas.

Then arrange for the printing of a four-page magazine section, or signature, and deliver it to the binderies of the client magazines. **********With these economies of scale, the individual advertisers escape the premiums that the publishers must charge for gearing down for small regional editions. **********With Time, Newsweek, U.S. News & World Report and Sports Illustrated, Media Networks Inc. offered advertisers constant exposure for a month by running the signatures in a different magazine each week. **********The monthly buy for the Woman's Lifestyle Network will give the advertiser two issues of People, whose readers are predominantly women, and one ad in each of the other three magazines. **********According to Mr. Lang, who is working on the project with Donald M. Elliman, publisher of People, the rates are being set for each market so as best to compete with local newspapers and broadcasters. **********The program is starting in September in 10 markets, and 10 more markets are to be added in each of the next two years. **********The largest market in the first batch is Boston, where total combined circulation comes to 338,000. The cost of an ad in all four books, including the double play in People, will be $16,895. In the smallest of the 10 markets, San Diego, with a circulation of 128,000, the price will be $7,668. **********The other markets are Atlanta, Dallas/Fort Worth, Denver, Detroit, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Phoenix/Tucson, San Francisco and Tampa/St. Petersburg. The primary target is women 18 and older. The 10 markets' circulation will be 2.2 million, and it is estimated that 10 million women will read the magazines. **********Media Network Inc. was sold to the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company in 1977, and Mr. Lang continued there until 1983. A former associate there, Floyd Sembler, who left as a vice president at the same time, is coming aboard as general manager of ADI Networks. **********The company is projecting gross revenues of $3 million next year and nearly $20 million by 1989. **********Advertisers generally use national magazines as an umbrella over local efforts because their penetration of individual local markets is not great enough to affect retail sales. So a national magazine ad must be augmented with local promotion. Mr. Lang is seeking to avoid that."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/19/business/market-place-analysts-suggest-targets-in-food.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1988-10-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 762, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Analysts Suggest Targets in Food", "print_headline": "MARKET PLACE; Analysts Suggest Targets in Food", "body_text": " **********THE startling bid Monday of $90 for each share of Kraft Inc. stock sent the stock of other food companies soaring yesterday. Led by Kraft, which shot up $28.125, to $88.25, Gerber Products rose $4.375, to $57.75; CPC International $2.25, to $55.50, and General Mills $2.125, to $54.50. Borden Inc and Quaker Oats also gained. **********Besides Philip Morris's bid for Kraft, there have also been unsolicited offers in recent weeks for the Pillsbury Company and the Holly Farms Corporation. **********''The bids for Pillsbury, Holly Farms and now Kraft have led to a sense among investors that something is building up in the industry,'' said Robert J. Cummins, associate managing director at Wertheim Schroder Inc. ''When very sophisticated people make these bids, the idea spreads that perhaps they know something and the industry is undervalued.'' **********Mr. Cummins recalled how, in 1985, after RJR announced plans to buy Nabisco, Philip Morris followed several months later with an announcement of its plan to buy General Foods. The rivalry between RJR and Philip Morris is so intense, he said, that some speculators are buying food company stocks in the hope of picking one they believe RJR might buy to stay abreast of its archrival. **********Although the stable earnings of food brands makes them especially attractive to companies that arrange leveraged buyouts, none of the bids announced so far has come as part of a leveraged buyout arrangement. **********Grand Metropolitan P.L.C., which bid $60 a share for Pillsbury earlier this month, is a British company seeking to establish a base in the world's largest single market, the United States. Like other foreign companies investing in the United States, Grand Metropolitan recognized that the sharp drop in the American dollar in the last three and a half years made American assets more attractive. **********Tyson Foods, which has bid $900 million in cash and stock for Holly Farms, wants to expand its 13.5 percent share of the poultry market. The acquisition of Holly, which has an 18 percent share of fresh chickens sold in supermarkets, would improve Tyson's position in that market, where it has only a 5 percent share. **********Kraft, with its large group of well-known brand names, represents another move by Philip Morris to diversify its business away from tobacco. **********''The value of a brand name has never been higher,'' said John M. McMillin, food industry analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities. At a time when companies are more willing than ever to incur heavy debt, he said well-known food products were extremely attractive ''because they have the innate ability to produce a stable earnings stream when the economy is good and when the economy is bad, in drought years and non-drought years.'' Mr. McMillin said the Philip Morris bid for Kraft ''augurs well for the entire industry.'' Even after yesterday's gains, he said Gerber, with its 72 percent share of the baby food market, and CPC, with such leading brands such as Hellman's mayonnaise in the United States and Knorr soups and spices in Europe, might still attract takeover bids. **********John McGuire, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company, said that Kraft and Pillsbury were not the only companies that could be attract a take-over bid. He said Gerber, General Mills, Quaker Oats and Borden were among the largest companies ''who have thoroughly cleaned up their businesses and now promise 12 percent to 15 percent earnings growth in and out of a recession.'' **********''These are businesses that over the past five to eight years had management changes and have a clearer focus on their high-growth and most profitable businesses,'' Mr. McGuire said. **********Apart from growth in earnings, analysts said the food companies with leading brand names also enjoyed above-average profitability that enabled them to accumulate cash beyond that needed for dividends, advertising and new-product development. The excess cash is one more attraction to acquiring companies, especially those that borrow heavily to finance purchases. **********The appeal of food stocks has not developed suddenly. Since midyear, Mr. Cummins said, major stocks have increased by about 15 percent, excluding yesterday's sharp gain in Kraft.

Manuel Antonio Noriega, is more besieged and isolated than ever. But he has shown no further willingness to end the 10-month political crisis in his country by voluntarily relinquishing power. **********The Panamanian economy is in ruins, with banks closed, the poor going hungry and a general strike scheduled to begin Monday. The Noriega regime has no diplomatic support to speak of. Even the Panamanian military, once viewed as unswervingly loyal to its Commander in Chief, showed in a mutiny last week that it can no longer be viewed as blindly devoted to the General. **********But as his options narrow and his empire crumbles, General Noriega continues to cling tenaciously to power. The breakdown Saturday of talks with the United States that were intended to negotiate his departure was only the latest sign that General Noriega would not contemplate stepping down on any terms but his own. Proving Himself Strong **********''Virility is proven by remaining in power,'' General Noriega said last fall. Nothing in the General's behavior since Feb. 25, when he unceremoniously ousted Mr. Delvalle as the President was attempting to dislodge him, indicates any change in that attitude or any reluctance to rule by force. **********The political opposition is convinced that General Noriega's departure is a matter of when, not if. But no one is bold enough to predict the date or the conditions of the General's exit. **********In the interim, conditions in Panama, once the most prosperous and peaceful country in the Central American isthmus, have worsened dramatically and much of the General's little remaining support has evaporated. Banks closed on March 3, forcing the country to live on barter and cash arrangements. The bank closures led to the suspension of paychecks for 140,000 civil servants, a move that pushed them into an alliance with the political opposition. **********But the most significant development, in the judgment of Panamanian political figures and of diplomats and military experts here, is the appearance of fissures in the 15,000-man Panama Defense Forces. Last Wednesday, a barracks rebellion was aimed at the overthrow of General Noriega. It was quelled after loyal troops rushed to the military headquarters here. **********The attempted coup was led by Col. Leonidas Macias, the Chief of Police, who was thought to be a staunch Noriega loyalist. When President Delvalle ordered General Noriega to step down last month, it was Colonel Macias who went on television to say the Defense Forces would support General Noriega and that Mr. Delvalle would have to go. **********Since Wednesday, three of the 19 members of the General Staff of the military have been forced into retirement, along with several other senior officers. As many as 100 officers, most of them members of the police or of the military intelligence, are reported to be under investigation for aiding or abetting the coup. **********''Ever since this crisis began, Noriega has been able to go to sleep at night knowing the military, the institution that really counts, is with him,'' one diplomat said. ''I don't think he can do that anymore.'' **********After the failure of negotiations between the General and two State Department emissaries who came here late last week, the likelihood that General Noriega would arrive at an accommodation with the United States and with the political opposition has decreased. **********On two previous occasions during the last six months, General Noriega had appeared willing to step down if an acceptable arrangement could be made. In both cases he reneged at the last moment, according to Panamanian political figures and to diplomats here. **********The opposition leader, Carlos Gonzalez de la Lastra, expressing a sentiment common among Panamanians, said Thursday night that General Noriega was ''just trying to buy time'' by talking with the United States and that nothing would come of the talks because ''he is a liar and has never kept his word.'' More Economic Pressure **********The opposition and many diplomats here said they believed that the diplomatic frustration would bring Washington around to the same point of view, leading to a widening of the economic pressure that has had such a devastating effect to date. **********''I would imagine the Americans must be fairly exasperated at this point,'' one European ambassador said today. ''Noriega has simply deceived them too many times, and I think they are now forced to conclude there is simply no negotiating with this man.'' **********Some civilian members of the ruling Democratic Revolutionary Party, set up by Brig. Gen. Omar Torrijos Herrera as a political vehicle for the military, are also beginning to waver. In private, they have said they fear that unless General Noriega leaves, the entire Torrijos legacy will be fatally discredited. General Noriega has presented himself as the ideological heir to General Torrijos, who died in a plane crash in 1981. **********Members of the governing party have also said that General Noriega was taken by surprise when the United States, refusing to recognize Manuel Solis Palma as President Delvalle's replacement, froze Panamanian Government funds on deposit in American banks. Untutored in economic affairs and hamstrung by an economy based on the dollar, the military leader has been forced to confront a problem that is beyond his ability to manipulate. Aid Sought From Abroad **********Over the last month, General Noriega has sought desperately to find money from abroad to enable his Government to function. But allies such as Cuba, Nicaragua and Libya, all of which have economic problems of their own, have refused to help him, and there are now rumblings that General Noriega is considering abandoning the dollar, Panama's legal tender, and printing a new currency that would have nothing to support it. **********Already strained by the personnel shakeup under way, the military must contend with a growing list of responsibilities, many of which are outside its area of competence. All public utilities have been placed under military control, and the Government has decreed a ''state of urgency'' that could generate further strains if invoked to put down the general strike. **********With no prospect of improvement until General Noriega is gone, no one here rules out the possibility of another attempt by the military to overthrow their leader. By doing this, the theory runs, the military could salvage at least a limited role for itself in a Panama ruled by a democratic and civilian Government. **********''In some places, like Argentina, these things happen much more quickly and violently,'' one military expert said. ''Here, you're watching a coup in slow motion.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/09/business/salomon-loses-74-million-in-quarter.html": {"writer_name": "James Sterngold", "pub_date": "1988-02-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 721, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Salomon Loses $74 Million in Quarter", "print_headline": "Salomon Loses $74 Million in Quarter", "body_text": " **********Salomon Inc., the parent of one of Wall Street's largest securities firms, announced late yesterday that it lost $74 million in the fourth quarter because of trading losses stemming from the stock market collapse and a series of moves to restructure its troubled operations. **********Salomon's loss would have been substantially higher if not for a $60 million gain, before taxes, on the sale of its mortgage banking business and a $78 million tax benefit. One bright spot was Salomon's Philipp Brothers commodity trading subsidiary, which earned a surprisingly strong $57 million before taxes. **********Salomon also announced that its board had adopted a ''poison pill'' plan that would make the company, which faced a potential takeover threat last year, more difficult to acquire by a hostile bidder. **********Last year Salomon Brothers, the company's brokerage subsidiary, took a number of major steps to rein in bloated costs and regain control over its businesses, including closing down two major operations, laying off 800 staff members and dropping its commitment to build an expensive new headquarters. The firm is considering further important management shifts, which may be announced as early as today, according to a number of professionals close to Salomon. **********According to the sources, the key move will involve the promotion of Jay F. Higgins, head of the corporate finance department, to Salomon Brothers' office of the chairman. He will join John H. Gutfreund, Salomon's chairman; Thomas W. Strauss, president, and William J. Voute, vice chairman. **********Mr. Gutfreund would not comment on the management changes last night, and a spokeswoman, Caroline Davenport, would only say that a final decision had not been made. **********The office of the chairman was created by Mr. Gutfreund in late 1986 to distribute the burden of running the complex global company. Lewis S. Ranieri, who had been head of mortgage securities and a member of the office of the chairman, was dismissed last summer. Important Symbolism **********Mr. Higgins's promotion would carry important symbolism within Salomon Brothers by placing a corporate finance expert at the highest levels of the firm. Currently, the other members of the office of the chairman come from the firm's strong trading divisions. **********Salomon's loss during last year's turbulent fourth quarter was in contrast to an $81 million profit in the 1986 period. For the year, one of the rockiest ever on Wall Street, Salomon earned $142 million, a steep 72.5 percent decline from $516 million in 1986. **********Analysts described Salomon's results as close to what they had expected. **********The Salomon Brothers unit had a $90 million loss before taxes for the quarter, in contrast to $126 million gain in the 1986 fourth quarter. For the year, Salomon Brothers' pretax earnings fell to $261 million from $787 million. **********The Phibro Energy unit reported pretax earnings of $4 million in the fourth quarter, down from $15 million the year earlier. Philipp Brothers' $57 million in pretax earnings for the quarter marked a sharp increase over a break-even quarter in 1986. **********Salomon executives said that, while Philipp Brothers was performing better after a major shake-up two years ago, its quarter was regarded as extraordinarily strong. **********For the quarter, Salomon Inc.'s earnings included, before taxes, a $100 million write-off for the termination of its interest in the new headquarters project, $67 million for the restructuring of its businesses, and a $79 million loss from its role in underwriting shares in British Petroleum. **********Salomon Inc.'s quarterly deficit was in contrast to per-share earnings of 53 cents in the 1986 period. For all of 1987, Salomon earned just 86 cents a share, down from $3.32 in 1986. **********Salomon announced its earnings and the poison pill plan after the stock market closed yesterday.

''Are you dreaming? It's an impossible dream.'' King Hussein's Move Cited **********For the last week, Israel has been preoccupied with discussion of the idea that Palestinians are about to declare independence, now that King Hussein of Jordan has relinquished any claim to the West Bank.  [ In Amman, Jordan, a Palestine Liberation Organization delegation ended three days of talks with Jordanian leaders and said in a statement that agreement had been reached that Jordan would take no further measures to end its influence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The P.L.O. statement also reasserted a desire for confederation with Jordan after a Palestinian state has been established. The statement said ''both sides came to agreement that Jordan will provide all facilities and measures that serve the interests and the life of our people in the occupied territories.''  [ A P.L.O. Executive Committee member, Abdullah Horani, told reporters that Jordan would continue to keep open the Jordan River bridges to the West Bank, would continue to issue Jordanian passports to West Bank residents and would maintain its overseeing of West Bank schools. ]  P.L.O. figures have been quoted as saying they are considering the idea of a declaration of independence. They have said they may set up a government in exile, and if they do, it is likely that they will get official diplomatic recognition from the Arab nations and other countries that do not recognize Israel. **********There are reports that some in the P.L.O. are considering other ideas too, such as setting up some form of provisional government inside the occupied territories. But details are sketchy. **********Israelis dismiss the proposal for a declaration of independence. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir calls it ''a crazy idea since there is no chance whatsoever that it will be realized.'' **********''I have the sense that the idea is an abortive concept,'' Mr. Shamir said. ''All the camps in Israel - the large camps, at the least - view it as a great danger to our very existence.'' Israelis Set Off Debate **********Paradoxically, it was the Israelis who inadvertently started public discussion of the idea two weeks ago, when they arrested and imprisoned a Palestinian militant, Faisal al-Husseini. Israel said he was working to support the uprising on behalf of the P.L.O. **********The authorities searched his office and found a draft Palestinian declaration of independence. The Government promptly leaked the document to the Israeli press as a means of discrediting Mr. Husseini, who has a following among some leftist Israelis. **********Instantly the Israeli newspapers were filled with articles about the draft declaration. Political leaders including Mr. Shamir and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres were commenting on it at length. And for the first time since King Hussein's decision to sever ties with the West Bank, the idea of declaring Palestinian independence grew into a major subject of talk among Arabs in the occupied territories. **********But to the underground leadership of the uprising, the document in Mr. Husseini's files ''was very preliminary, an original draft'' and ''had no circulation, no standing,'' one of the Palestinians close to the leadership said. **********''It caused problems for certain of our factions,'' he said. ''Some were angry that the Shin Beth knew about it before they did. But for Israel and the world, this became the document.'' Shin Beth is the Israeli domestic security service. **********The paper found in Mr. Husseini's files was drafted in large part by Jerome Segal, a professor of philosophy and public policy at the University of Maryland, in College Park, Md., who says he believes that ''a two-state solution is not only the just way out of the conflict but the only stable way to bring peace.'' Professor Segal, who is Jewish, gave the draft to Mr. Husseini during a visit here last spring, and even he was surprised by the attention it suddenly received. **********''I'm sort of amazed it became such a sensation,'' he said in an interview. ''The interesting thing is that it was drafted before the King Hussein initiatives, but it suddenly took on a whole reality of its own after the Israeli Government leaked it.'' **********Though the uprising's leaders had no hand in drafting the document, and some were not even aware it existed, nonetheless ''it has had its positive effects,'' one of the Palestinians close to the leadership said, adding: ''The idea is now registered in a lot of Palestinian minds. It has had a great unifying effect.'' **********Last week, a commentary in the daily newspaper Haaretz said, ''Now the Prime Minister's office realizes that leaking the document worked like a boomerang.'' **********Today, an editorial in Yedioth Aharonoth, Israel's largest daily newspaper, said, ''Our political leadership should now take seriously the possibility that a Palestinian government in exile will be established and prepare accordingly.'' Cabinet Discusses Issue **********The Israeli Cabinet today discussed the idea that the P.L.O. might declare a government in exile, and officials were told that Yasir Arafat, the organization's Chairman, might make the declaration before the European Parliament, the United Nations or the Palestinian National Council, which meets in Algiers next month. Gaza Man Dies of Wounds **********The Cabinet meeting occurred during a weekend of continued violence in the occupied territories. Today, a 21-year-old Gaza man died of wounds sustained over the weekend, and on Saturday a 12-year-old boy was killed in the West Bank, bringing the number of Palestinian dead in the uprising to at least 217. Tonight, the Israeli military authorities closed most of the Gaza Strip and confine all residents to their homes. **********Across the occupied territories, Palestinian opinion is mixed on whether declaring independence and establishing a government in exile is a good idea. **********Dr. Gabi Baramki, vice president of Bir Zeit University in the West Bank, said that in his view ''it's time to establish a government in exile, but this should be be preceeded by a declaration of independence.'' 'It's Up to the P.L.O.'' But Dr. Haidar Abd-al-Shafi, head of the Red Crescent medical society in Gaza and a founder of the P.L.O., said: ''We ought not take hasty steps on this issue. I would not participate in calls to force a declaration of independence.'' **********One of the Palestinians close to the leadership of the uprising said the leaders had decided that independence ''will never be declared from here; it's up to the P.L.O.'' **********Details of how the government in exile would operate and what it would represent are still under discussion, he and others said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/03/business/finance-new-issues-utility-stock-sale.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-03-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 119, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Utility Stock Sale", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; Utility Stock Sale", "body_text": " **********The Western Massachusetts Electric Company, a subsidiary of Northeast Utilities, is offering $53.5 million in preferred stock through Salomon Brothers Inc.

Indeed, it was the bond market's failure to respond positively on Friday to both a steep rise in the dollar and a better-than-expected report on the nation's trade deficit in May that heightened the fears of investors in fixed-income securities. **********''Normally, the bond market would have soared on news that the dollar had risen to an 11-month high against the mark and a nine-month high against the yen,'' said Douglas J. Schindewolf, fixed-income market economist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. ''Even the slight improvement in the trade deficit would have been constructive. Instead, the bond market only offered a token positive response, which was probably caused by pre-weekend covering of short positions.'' Offsetting Encouraging News **********Mr. Schindewolf noted that the combined improvement in the trade deficit and stronger dollar would have been particularly encouraging to foreign investors in dollar-denominated fixed-income securities. ''But the inflation fears now seem to be offsetting both the expected further rises in interest rates and whatever further gains the dollar may achieve,'' he said. ''This is why the bond market shrugged off the latest rise in the prime lending rate.'' **********While the prime lending rate was raised to 9.5 percent from 9 percent last week, the bond market expected the move because banks had been paying steadily higher costs for funds in recent months. In fact, the key rate that banks charge each other for funds closed at 7.75 percent Friday, in spite of an infusion of reserves into the banking system by the Federal Reserve. At the start of 1988, these funds traded at an average rate of 6.5 percent. **********As a result, the yield on the bellwether Treasury long bond, the 9.125 percent issue due 2018, rose to 9.14 percent Friday, from 9.08 percent, despite the strength of the dollar. At 9.14 percent, the yield is only 9 basis points above that on 10-year Treasury notes, indicating investor preference for shorter maturities. Doubts About Treasury Auction **********The bond market has also been unsettled because there are still doubts that the Treasury will receive authorization in time to auction new 30-year bonds at the next refunding in early August. Recently, doubts that the authorization would be granted by Congress bolstered prices of the long bond. But last week many investors did not seem to care about a potential shortage of long bonds. **********The long bond is a particularly sensitive bellwether because it is a major trading instrument that investors favor more for potential price appreciation than interest income. **********Meanwhile, short-term rates, which are more directly controlled by Federal Reserve operations, continued to move higher. The discount rate on the 90-day Treasury bills rose to 6.72 percent on Friday, from 6.66 percent a week earlier, while the six-month issue rose to 7.06 percent, from 6.98 percent. Eugene J. Sherman, chief economist at the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, which lends mortgage and other funds to savings and loan institutions and savings banks, also expects the cost of credit to rise further. 30-Year Fixed Mortgage at 10.44% ''While there is not a direct connection between the prime rate and mortgage borrowing costs, the rise in the prime rate tells us that all credit costs are moving higher,'' Mr. Sherman said. ''Thus we can expect mortgage rates to rise and certainly the cost of home equity loans.'' **********The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage rose to 10.44 percent for the week ended Friday, from 10.38 percent the previous week, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation said Friday. The average adjustable-rate mortgage rose to 7.82 percent, from 7.79 percent. **********Home equity loans have been the most popular vehicle for consumer borrowing because interest payments on such loans remain tax deductible. ''While the overall growth in consumer borrowing has been relatively moderate this year, which some economists think will hold down inflation, the fact is that the volume of home equity loans is exploding,'' he continued. Home Equity Loans at $95 billion **********At the end of 1987, the Fed put total home equity loans at $75 billion. Mr. Sherman said the volume had soared to $95 billion at midyear and was expected to grow by at least the same rate in the second half. **********''What all this tells us is that consumers, the driving force in our economy, are still on a spending binge, despite the fact that the traditional yardsticks used to measure this spending say this isn't so,'' he noted. ''At the same time, industry is increasing its capital spending.'' **********Not only will the current drought in the Farm Belt, the worst since the Dust Bowl days of the early 1930's, drive up prices and inflation, but the strengthening of domestic and overseas economies will also drive up the cost of industrial raw materials, Mr. Sherman pointed out. He also noted ''the increasing competition among manufacturers for the shrinking pool of skilled labor.'' **********''Even the recent strength of the dollar is not as positive a factor for interest rates and inflation,'' Mr. Sherman cautioned, ''because the foreign exporters who were able to cut their margins to compensate for the decline in the dollar between 1985 and early this year may not be able or willing to do so now. Thus, we may have to pay more for imported goods.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/24/business/bigger-stake-seen-in-bank.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-11-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 276, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bigger Stake Seen in Bank", "print_headline": "Bigger Stake Seen in Bank", "body_text": " **********Georges Pebereau, the president of Marceau Investissements, said he would probably increase his stake this week in Societe Generale, France's third-largest commercial bank and the only one that is publicly held, to more than 10 percent, from 9.16 percent. **********The announcement came amid continuing conjecture that the French Government is using Marceau to accomplish a backdoor renationalization of the bank. **********Societe Generale, which has assets of $153 billion and is larger than all American banks execept Citicorp, was privatized in 1987 by the Government of Jacques Chirac.

Analysts were baffled at the move, saying that investors may not understand the extent of the stock dilution that will occur as part of the company's reorganization plan as it comes out of bankruptcy. **********''People remember the classic bankruptcy turnarounds and think this will be one of them,'' said Stephen J. Dobi, an analyst at Salomon Brothers. ''It won't be. There will be massive dilution.'' **********The company's current common stock, which will be subject to a 1-for-8 reverse split when Manville completes its reorganization, traded as high as $3.125 at one point during the day. The last legal hurdle to the restructuring was removed on Monday when the Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal of the plan, which is expected to be completed by the end of 1988. Company Surprised at Move **********Manville officials reacted with surprise to the stock activity. **********''We wonder if people are losing sight of the fact the securities are highly speculative,'' said William Bullock, a Manville spokesman. **********Phillip Schaeffer, co-director of a bankruptcy fund at Cowen & Company, and an investor in Manville securities, said he thought part of the rise might have resulted from pressure on those who had sold the stock short. In such a case, known as a short squeeze, traders who have sold borrowed stock in the expectation of a price drop are forced to cover their positions by purchasing shares. Mr. Dobi, however, said he believed there was little if any of that. ''It appears the demand is coming from small retail accounts,'' he said. **********Analysts noted that Manville's preferred shares, which rose 87.5 cents, to $28.875, provide a less expensive way to buy a stake in the reorganized Manville. Each current preferred share will be exchanged for a new preferred share plus 2.16 new common shares. Mr. Schaeffer estimated that the new preferred shares were worth $8 to $9 a share and that the new common would trade for $8 to $10 a share. He said that meant the old preferred was worth about $25.28 to $30.60, while the current common was worth $1 to $1.125 a share. 15 Percent of Shares Traded Mr. Dobi said he believed the current common share was worth about $1, or about eight times estimated 1989 earnings. **********Manville now has 24 million common shares outstanding, of which 3.6 million, or 15 percent, were traded yesterday.

They scrambled to put together an ''interim season'' that would include reruns, coverage of news and sports events, series that had been completed but shelved, and other programs that could be made outside union jurisdiction. The strike would increase the defection of viewers to cable, they said, with a consequent reduction of advertising revenue and a further weakening of the networks. **********With the strike over, the television industry plans to return to work today, and while it is anybody's guess how many viewers were lost as a result of the strike, the predictions of calamity almost certainly were premature. Indeed, at the end of the 1988-89 season, the networks may be in a stronger position than they anticipated. **********For one thing, advertisers bought $3.2 billion worth of network time -$100 million more than last year -despite the fact that the fall season would unquestionably be affected by the strike. Behind that decision was the networks' guarantee of delivering a big enough audience - even if that meant running ads more often than originally agreed, on shows that failed to get good ratings. **********But ABC and NBC also planned strong fall packages with specials (the baseball playoffs and the first half of ''War and Remembrance'' on the former; the Olympic Games and the World Series on the latter). CBS programmed some series it could make without the striking writers. And now that the strike is over, the networks will also be able to phase in their first-choice shows. The resulting strong audiences, they hope, will mean little time, if any, returned to advertisers. **********What is more, those first-choice shows can now be run through the end of the conventional season along with - and in some cases instead of - the mini-series and replacement programs that the networks usually put on during the crucial May ''sweeps,'' when ratings are used by advertisers to establish prices for the next quarter. **********''The reality is that what you have on at the start of a season is what you collectively think is your best, and what you have saved is what you don't have as much faith in,'' David F. Poltrack, vice president for marketing at CBS, said last week. ''Most midseason replacements do as poorly as the programs they replace. The real cost of replacement, in most cases, is increasing costs without increasing revenues.'' **********''The new product can go through May,'' Mr. Poltrack said, adding that he thought CBS had also managed to come up with strong early-season programming. ''So in effect, there is no need for midseason backup programming.'' **********Executives at ABC and NBC were unwilling to discuss their seasons before this week, when they will announce the latest versions of their 1988-1989 television schedules. But Mr. Poltrack offered this perspective on the industry: ''I think it's pretty definite that you won't see the traditional January changes. There will be less holes, and that could be a significant financial savings.'' **********All that may augur well for the networks, but the picture is slightly different for the producers supplying the programming. If the season unfolds as Mr. Poltrack suggested, it could include what the studios may come to regard as a silent spring: fewer midseason replacements would mean fewer programs in production. **********''Obviously, part of our business every year is our midseason show,'' said Stephen J. Cannell, the producer of ''The A Team'' and ''Sonny Spoon,'' among other programs. ''I've put a lot of shows on at midseason. If we get canceled with a couple of series and can't get a midseason show on, we've lost some business.'' **********One show that Mr. Cannell hopes will make it onto CBS at midseason is ''Lame Duck,'' an hourlong drama about a hip young Californian elected to replace his ailing, conservative father in Congress. **********If midseason programs like ''Lame Duck'' fail to get on, Mr. Cannell said, ''People will trim their overhead; people will lose jobs.'' He added, however, that the studios themselves were not in jeopardy: only the healthiest can afford to make such costly shows to begin with, he said, banking on future syndication for a return on their investment. Such crapshooting - and the stake of writers in that gamble - was a major issue in their strike against the producers.

''I want to make some money.'' **********Mr. Ouyang, 26 years old, has just finished his Ph.D. in precision engineering, the youngest person to do so at this university. He said he had decided, against the advice of most of his professors, to form his own company to peddle high-technology research to industry, to embrace an entrepreneurial ethic in a Communist state. Quandary for Universities **********His decision reflects the quandary of higher education in China. Many of the country's universities, already pressed for money, are seeing their funding decline still further and are suddenly failing to keep their best graduates on teaching faculties. At the same time, a growing number of advanced degree holders who have shunned academia are going jobless in an economy that finds it difficult to place educated and talented people. **********Most state industries and institutions, accustomed to receiving assigned allotments of graduating college students, are too inflexible to cope with freelance job-seekers, especially those with higher degrees. Indeed, holders of master's and doctor's degrees looking for work commonly talk of not even getting to the point of an interview in their job searches. **********It is rare to strike out on one's own, a risky proposition in a society where individual initiative generally means severing the umbilical cord of guaranteed housing, medical care and income. **********But Mr. Ouyand said he is not worried. Theory and Practice **********''I'm trying to find a new way to make full use of my talents,'' Mr. Ouyang said. ''Scientific research is divorced from research in China. For example, in this university, there's a lot of advanced engineering, a lot of advanced scientific and technological projects. But after these projects are finished they're just put away. Nobody uses them.'' **********''One of the problems is the traditional role of intellectuals in our society,'' he said. ''They pay attention only to theory, not to application. We have to change this.'' **********''Take my project, for example,'' he continued. ''I've worked out a way to improve the accuracy of measuring the size of objects to a very high tolerance. Basically, I've found a way to raise the precision of sophisticated measuring without much cost. But even though this work is at international levels, there is no way to promote its use in factories in China.'' **********''Obviously in this situation there is a need for a way to introduce the achievements of research to industry,'' he said. ''That's what I want to do.'' **********So earlier this year, after finishing his dissertation, Mr. Ouyang took the 90-minute train ride to Beijing to visit companies in the capital's high-technology district. **********''I needed money to start my company,'' he said. ''At first I wanted to set up a technology research company. But I met the managing director of the Beifang Computer Company, and he said there already are non-governmental research units in the country. He said there was a need to make research applicable to industries.'' Bureaucratic Problems **********The Beifang company agreed to provide 100,000 yuan, about $27,000, in investment and rights to three of the five seats on the board of directors. Almost immediately though, Mr. Ouyang was confounded by Tianjin's, and China's, law and bureaucracy. **********''There weren't any clear rules for setting up a company like this,'' Mr. Ouyang said. ''So we talked to the city for a month and a half to explain what we wanted to do. Tianjin wants to set up a high-tech area, so we explained how we could be part of that. They finally agreed.'' **********The young engineer also ran into criticism from faculty members who thought he should stay at the university as a researcher. Although none of his critics would talk about their reservations about Mr. Ouyang, the China Youth News reported on the controversy on campus earlier this month. **********''Some professors said they couldn't understand what Ouyang thought he was doing,'' the newspaper reported. ''They thought he could contribute more to the state and the university, as well as himself, by working hard at the university. Moreover, China has few people with Ph.D.'s like him.'' **********Even Mr. Ouyang's parents, both professors of engineering, were opposed to his entrepreneurial inclinations. ''They always thought I should be a professor,'' the young man said. ''It took some time but now they've changed their minds.'' Making Way for the Young **********Research students at the school rushed to Mr. Ouyang's defense. ''There are a lot of middle-aged and old teachers on the faculty,'' one was quoted by the youth news as saying. ''When would their positions ever be given to younger people? Could the biggest research projects be given to the young? We'd rather be the head of a chicken than the tail of a phoenix.'' **********Mr. Ouyang has scrounged some office space in a building just off campus and said he is spending most of his time trying to orient himself to the world of business. **********''Of course there are going to be difficulties,'' he said. ''Things like the market situation and many other fields are still very new to me, someone whose head has been in books for 20 years.'' **********With the support of an influential senior professor, Mr. Ouyang has arranged to concentrate on commercializing the research from Tianjin University. Engineering projects conducted in university laboratories and workshops are to be evaluated by Mr. Ouyang and his staff and packaged so that they can be sold to industry. **********''Our first-year goals aren't too much,'' he said. ''Since we don't have too much experience in business yet, our goal is to raise some more money and then market one or two projects from the university. The major work is to figure out the market situation, how to link engineers and enterprises.'' Hopes to Continue Research **********Mr. Ouyang, despite his sudden conversion to entrepreneurship, still wants to continue engineering research on his own and has kept his privileges in university laboratories. **********He took a visitor to the workshop where he spent three years working on his doctorate, a room with a large Japanese-manufactured measuring probe, a laser measurement device and a computer. **********After checking the machine and its knobs, he bent to throw the main power switch. Nothing. He tried once more, clicking the H-shaped switch firmly into the socket. Again, nothing. **********''Well,'' he sighed, ''no electricity. This is another problem China has. There's not enough electricity. Even here we haven't got what we need.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/11/business/retailers-seek-to-use-scanners-more.html": {"writer_name": "Isadore Barmash", "pub_date": "1988-01-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 676, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Retailers Seek to Use Scanners More", "print_headline": "Retailers Seek to Use Scanners More", "body_text": " **********For a dozen years, general retailers and apparel and textile manufacturers have envied the supermarket industry's black-and-white bar code, which has helped speed customers through checkouts. But the vast number of general merchandise items -in many different sizes and shapes -had seemed to be an obstacle to wider use of bar-code scanners. **********Now, a group headed by representatives of some of the nation's largest retailers and merchandise suppliers has released a report on ways the apparel and general merchandise industries can adapt electronic scanners. The report predicted significant gains in both profits and in customer service for companies using the bar codes to improve their ability to track and exchange information. **********The issues of coding, scanning and exchanging electronic data will be discussed this week in New York at the annual convention of the National Retail Merchants Association, which started yesterday. Some of the speakers helped prepare the report. 'Unprecedented Scale' **********''Coded product tags will make electronic networking possible on an unprecedented scale,'' the report said. ''This development should prove a boon to America's hard-pressed apparel and textile trades.'' **********The report was prepared by the retail and wholesale group of Deloitte Haskins & Sells, the large accounting firm, under the sponsorship of the International Mass Retailing Association. The association includes executives of Sears, Roebuck & Company, the K Mart Corporation, the Dayton Hudson Corporation, Levi Strauss & Company and the J. P. Stevens Company. **********These companies all use various forms of the bar code and scanning devices and are working to refine the combination to improve efficiency, according to Al D. McCready, national director for retail and wholesale trade at Deloitte Haskins & Sells. **********Two types of scanners are in use: the fixed, or flat-top, unit used in supermarkets and the hand-held scanner ''gun'' used in other types of stores. Mr. McCready said that the hand-held scanner appears to be growing in popularity because of its flexibility, greater efficiency and lower cost. Toys ''R'' Us Inc., the nation's largest toy chain, recently installed a hand-held system with backup computers in many of its stores at a total cost of $30 million. Setting a Standard **********Mr. McCready said the preparers of the report hope that other companies, large and small, will adapt the scanning and bar-code method. The group has recommended standardizing how a universal product code is used. That would encourage the use of industrywide standards for labeling raw materials like cloth and yarn. **********One problem with clothing labels has been where to place the bar code. ''Do you sew it on, or use a nylon bar loop?'' Mr. McCready asked. The committee's report favored hanging tags on clothing with a bar code in the center and the price at the bottom. **********Another recommendation was to establish a common format for electronic information within related industries so that the computers of retailers and suppliers can easily communicate with one another. Wal-Mart Stores, the nation's fourth-largest retailer, has set up computer-to-computer systems with J. P. Stevens and Levi Strauss, Mr. McCready said, but most other companies do not have similar systems. **********The group also urged the development of equipment that can handle a vast number of items. ''The problem in implementing equipment is that while supermarkets have between 15,000 and 25,000 separate items to sell and replenish,'' Mr. McCready said, ''companies on the order of a J. C. Penney have probably about 1.4 million different items.'' **********James R. Williams, the president of the National Retail Merchants Association, said that his group and many of its members have endorsed the use of a universal product code and that apparel and general merchandisers are making progress on using bar codes effectively."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/22/business/company-news-lufthansa-to-buy-four-airbus-jets.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-07-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 126, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Company News; Lufthansa to Buy Four Airbus Jets", "print_headline": "Company News; Lufthansa to Buy Four Airbus Jets", "body_text": " **********The West German airline Lufthansa said it would buy four Airbus jets for a total of about $270 million.

A year ago, when the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 508 points in a single day, she put off the purchase. **********But like many New Yorkers who had feared the worst, she has discovered that things are pretty good. So she selected the $1,995 floor-length beaver coat. ''It wasn't that we were starving,'' she said of her earlier caution. ''We both make good incomes. It was the extras.'' **********In the days after the stock crash, it seemed logical that the market would drag New York City's prosperous economy down with it. Service businesses that supported the brokerage trade would wither. Corporations would flee. Up to 70,000 highly paid Wall Street workers would lose their jobs. Those who remained employed would spend less out of uncertainty. Soon, the city's fanciest restaurants, Manhattan condominiums and tax revenues would feel pinched. A Post-Crash High **********For the most part, it didn't happen. Yesterday, to top it off, the market hit a post-crash high. And today new measures intended to help prevent another collapse will take effect.  [ Pages D12 and D5. ] **********''On the whole, it's been a relatively soft landing,'' said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. Robert Dye agrees. He is a director of the WEFA Group, which made dire projections after the crash. ''Our Black Monday study was probably a little bit pessimistic,'' he said. **********Some predictions have come true, especially the much-feared impact on the city's tax revenues, which are running $10 million a month below post-crash projections. But otherwise New York has not seen anything close to the forecasts by WEFA, an economic forecasting firm employed by New York City. **********So what went right? **********Brokerage firms' branch offices, some of them out of the city, often took the brunt of the cuts. And new hiring by the brokerage firms offset the highly publicized layoffs. Thus, while some 20,000 pink slips were handed out, net employment at securities and commodities firms shrank by only 12,000, a 7.5 percent fall from a peak of 160,000 just before the crash and roughly equal to the prior year's gain, the labor bureau said. Variety of New Jobs **********Many of these generally well-educated castoffs found a variety of new jobs: at foreign banks, which have steadily taken up the slack in the commercial real estate market; at the city's hotels, for which the weak dollar has reaped a tourism bonanza, and in a robust business service sector - everything from legal advice to career counseling. **********In other words, the Wall Street contraction is expected simply to slow the city's growth, not wipe it out. Citywide employment should be up slightly this year. And WEFA estimates that total personal income in the city will increase 7.2 percent, to $143 billion, in 1988, versus an 8.8 percent rise in 1987. **********The evidence also casts doubt on the notion that the market plunge was a searing psychological trauma. Because of low enrollment, the Learning Annex, an adult education company, canceled a course it planned to offer last spring on ''How to Deal With the Post-Crash Blues.'' 'I Can't Complain' **********''There were some ups and downs, but I don't think it will have a permanent effect on our lives,'' said Adam Arias, who was meeting his wife, Ann, another Wall Street worker, at a park bench yesterday for an outdoor lunch. **********A year ago, when they both had better-paying and slightly more demanding jobs, they might have splurged on a local restaurant, but then, a year ago, Adam was working too hard to break for lunch, either. ''We see a lot more of each other. said Mr. Arias, who joined the Bank of New York, though not as a supervisor, after losing his operations job at E. F. Hutton. ''I can't complain.'' **********Luxury goods and services, though, show signs of hurting from a lull in spending. Fur Vault Inc., a chain of retail fur stores, has yet to recover after customers like Ms. Feinberg sat out its normally big winter season. ''Prior to the crash our sales were running about 30 percent ahead of the previous year,'' said Jack Balsam, Fur Vault's treasurer. ''Then after the crash they dropped below the previous year.'' **********World Yacht Cruises, which runs luxury boat rides off Manhattan, has long been popular with the Wall Street set, which accounts for 35 to 40 percent of all bookings. Sales volume in dollars is running 20 percent ahead of 1987, although groups are spending less on frills such as 10-piece orchestras, said August Ceradini, the company's president. **********''New York has become more like Kansas City,'' said Steve Barnett, chairman of Research and Forecast Inc., a company that studies consumer behavior. He said he had observed an embarrassment about greed among consumers and a return to traditional tastes, everything from a resurgence in gray flannel suits at the expense of flashy European cuts to a growing aversion to trendy ''throwaway'' watches. Dining Out as Much **********Gauging the health of the restaurant business has been difficult, but a recent survey by Tim Zagat, co-publisher of the restaurant guide that bears his name, hints that people are eating out more than they realize. **********Sixteen percent of the 3,500 diners he surveyed reported that they had eaten out less often over the last year, and only 3 percent said they had eaten out more. But when those same patrons were asked how often they dined out, the average was 4 meals a week - the same as last year. **********As for the residential real estate market, the common perception was that it was one of the worst casualties, but that notion appears flawed. Sales of Manhattan condominiums perked up 3.9 percent in the first half of 1988, the Real Estate Board of New York said. Sales of cooperatives also seem healthy, but they are more difficult to track since they are technically stock sales. Average prices also rose, disappointing some New Yorkers like Philip Keevil, the merger and acquisition chief at S. G. Warburg & Company. No Apartment Bargains **********Mr. Keevil and his family fit snugly into the seven-room Manhattan co-op they have lived in for 11 years - and then only by having one son sleep in a converted maid's room. The Keevils spent six months earlier this year looking for a bargain in a larger apartment but quit without finding one. ''Everybody was waiting for this famous crash in apartment prices, and it hasn't happened,'' he said. **********To be sure, experts do not think the city will escape unscathed. Wall Street workers earned an average of $69,553 in 1987, roughly double the citywide average, said Mr. Ehrenhalt of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Thus, while they make up about 5 percent of New York City's private-sector work force, they account for over 11 percent of the $83 billion payroll. **********But 1988 wages are expected to be more modest, and the drop could have serious repercussions. ''When you lose jobs with the average pay of the securities sector, you're really knocking off people with hefty amounts of discretionary income,'' said Alair Townsend, New York City's Deputy Mayor for finance and economic development. A New Caution **********Cheryl Goldstein, a former Wall Street worker, is a prime example. **********Before she lost her job as a credit analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company in May, Ms. Goldstein and her husband consulted the Zagat restaurant guide at least four times a week. ''That was our bible,'' she said. She is now working as a career consultant - a job change she is pleased with, even though she makes less. **********While they still make a comfortable living, the couple has virtually stopped going out on weekdays, skimp on entertainment and scaled back a vacation. ''The biggest change was just having to think a little bit before spending,'' Ms. Goldstein said. **********Besides shrinking staff sizes, Wall Street firms have tightened up in other ways. The Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation, for instance, now insists that its investment bankers request corporate rates when they book hotel rooms, and it has balked at paying more than $200 a night. **********''A hotel is a hotel,'' said Vince DeGiaimo, the firm's chief administrator for investment banking. ''Bankers by nature would have the Taj Mahal. They feel that with the fees they make, costs shouldn't matter. We're trying to change their thinking.'' Doubling Up in Taxis **********Donaldson also shaved $80,000 from the $1.2 million it pays annually for late-night taxi use. Now a newly hired dispatcher makes sure passengers are downstairs when the cab arrives and doubles up riders when possible. **********The crash has also added fuel to a long-simmering debate about whether the economy is sufficiently diverse. **********Some, like Mr. Ehrenhalt, worry that New York, while far from a one-crop town, is too dependent on the large financial firms. ''New York's fortunes have become so closely tied to Wall Street, where are the growth industries if this one doesn't resume growth?'' he asked. **********Karen Gerard, a former Deputy Mayor and now a consultant, thinks the city should stick to what it knows best - the financial industry. A Dangerous Dependence **********The crash, however, demonstrated that being too dependent on Wall Street can be costly. Mostly in response to the crash, City Hall has already pruned 1,900 police officers, 630 sanitation workers and 155 traffic control agents from its rolls to reduce services by some $290 million in fiscal 1988 and 1989, and it has raised taxes modestly as well. **********For those moves, it won praise and higher debt ratings, a feat for which Mayor Koch personally took the credit. Referring to the bond rating agencies' reports, he said recently, ''When you read 'management's willingness and ability to respond,' substitute 'E.I.K.' That's the chief executive officer. That's me.'' **********But the city's troubles are not over. Between the drop in Wall Street's corporate profits and the corresponding fall in wages, tax withholding is running $10 million a month below the low post-crash estimates. ''When your most important industry is suffering, it is inevitable your economy is going to suffer,'' said Paul Dickstein, the city budget director."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/02/world/question-for-indonesia-who-will-be-no-2.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "1988-03-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 546, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Question for Indonesia: Who Will Be No. 2?", "print_headline": "Question for Indonesia: Who Will Be No. 2?", "body_text": " **********An assembly created to elect the next President and Vice President of Indonesia opened an 11-day session here today with a subdued ceremony, but amid lively public speculation over who will fill the second-highest position. **********President Suharto, the only candidate for the top job, is virtually certain to remain in office for another term.

On the back of a flatbed truck they hauled a sign proclaiming, ''We Have Won Again'' and giving the official tally from the May 8 election: 11,499 votes for their candidate, Carlos Paez Falcon, and 11,051 for his opponent, Benigno Franco Coronado. **********Mayoral elections are of limited interest to many Mexicans, but the struggle for office now going on in this bleak industrial city of 150,000 people, 125 miles south of the Rio Grande, has attracted national attention. **********Mexico's presidential elections are less than two months away, and the result of the dispute over the election tally here is expected to help set the tone of the July 6 national vote, which pits the dominant Institutional Revolutionary Party, in power without interruption since its founding in 1929, against five opposition candidates. **********In virtually every important election in the past, the governing party, widely known as the P.R.I., has been accused of manipulating vote totals and thereby assuring victory by the widest of margins. P.R.I. leaders have proudly adhered to a tradition they call ''carro completo,'' or a clean sweep of all elective posts. **********But soon after he was nominated last fall as the P.R.I.'s presidential candidate, Carlos Salinas de Gortari said he recognized that ''Mexico requires absolute respect for free and clean elections.'' In a speech last month, he elaborated on that concept, promising ''transparent elections'' in which ''we will accept our defeats.'' **********Party leaders here, however, do not think that Mr. Salinas has them in mind when he talks about learning to live with the occasional defeat. Nor does it bother them that two left-wing parties that ran mayoral candidates of their own, the Mexican Socialist Party and the populist National Democratic Front, have accused the ruling party of fraud and announced that they recognized the right-of-center National Action Party, known as the PAN, as the winner of the mayoral election. **********''Of course it would be a victory for the policy of modern politics,'' the local leader of the ruling party, Ramon Verduzco Gonzalez, replied when asked about Mr. Salinas's pledge. ''But he also said that we are not going to give away victories that have not really been won, and that is what is happening here.'' **********The recent election here was the second attempt in little more than six months to choose a mayor. Balloting held on Oct. 25 had to be nullified after the P.R.I.-controlled state electoral college concluded, without citing anyone by name, that ''generalized violence'' and vote tampering had occurred. **********Photographs and videotapes from that election that are now in the possession of opposition parties show vans, including several bearing the insignia of the P.R.I. or labor unions affiliated with it, unloading the same group of men at several polling stations, where they are alleged to have voted several times. The opposition also complained that party officials had stuffed the ballot boxes with the ballots of voters who in fact had stayed home. Role of a Steel Company **********The opposition parties are similarly dissatisifed with the way that the May 8 election was handled. They concede that assigning soldiers and police officers to polling stations helped prevent the partisan clashes that contributed to October's electoral mess, but complained that the presence of the security forces did not prevent a repetition of voting abuses. **********Complaints this time center on the partisan role allegedly played by Altos Hornos de Mexico, a state-owned steel company that is the largest employer here. In a letter addressed to ''All employees of Altos Hornos'' and distributed just before the election, the director of the company urged ''Monclova and its inhabitants to take advantage of the exceptional circumstances that have been foreseen by Carlos Salinas de Gortari and Eliseo Mendoza Berrueto,'' Governor of Coahuila State, who is a member of the P.R.I. **********Officials in the ruling party argue, however, that the opposition padded vote totals and that the P.R.I.'s unofficial vote tally should be certified. ''They always accuse us of irregularities, since we are the party of the majority,'' Mr. Verduzco said. ''But all parties in Mexcio, including the PAN, practice electorial fraud.'' **********At the moment, the matter is still in the hands of the State Assembly, which functions as the electoral college and must decide which of the competing claims it will recognize. The decision has been slow in coming, which has led the press and opposition politicians to conclude that political machinations are occuring at the highest levels of the ruling party and the Government. **********''Nominally, the State Assembly will decide this matter,'' said Francisco Rodriguez Alcantar, a former coal miner who is a PAN state deputy. ''But the reality is that the official party deputies are waiting a decision to be taken in Bucareli,'' the street in Mexico City where Interior Minister Manuel Bartlett Diaz has his office. **********Discipline within the ruling party is such that even a decision favorable to the opposition will not be challenged. **********''I am prepared to accept the results, whatever they may be,'' Mr. Franco said. ''I just hope the other parties have the same attitude, because we need to change the image Monclova has throughout Mexico as a city of conflict.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/27/business/golden-days-for-arbitrage.html": {"writer_name": "William McBride", "pub_date": "1988-03-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1840, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Golden Days for Arbitrage", "print_headline": "Golden Days for Arbitrage", "body_text": " **********A WALL STREET trader interrupted a telephone interview last week to check on the status of the takeover battle for Federated Department Stores. The news was good. Campeau had raised its bid to $73 a share from $68. ''And I bought in late, two weeks ago, at 66,'' he reported. ''Not a bad gain.'' On Wall Street, the talk of big deals and easy money is back. And risk arbitragers, the traders who specialize in betting on takeovers, are riding the market again, trying to capitalize on the fact that takeover plays represent one of the few clear-cut opportunities in today's stock market. The hardy firms that survived October's dark days and the tribulations of the insider-trading investigations now find themselves in a charmed world: There seems to be a new deal every day, and there are fewer arbitragers in the race, which means their profits can be greater. And many of today's buyers are blue-chip companies, which are more likely to close the deals than the rowdy raiders who dominated the takeover world before the market collapsed. **********''You have companies with big pocketbooks, who are interested in the long term,'' said Alan B. Slifka, managing partner of Halcyon Investments, a New York arbitrage partnership that is rebuilding after the losses it sustained last fall. ''It's a smorgasbord of opportunity.'' **********Since the beginning of the year, some participants estimate, arbitragers at major investment firms and independent, so-called boutique operations have recorded returns ranging from 15 to 30 percent. By contrast, the Dow Jones industrial average is up about 9.5 percent for the year. Even in low-risk deals, where profits are normally not celestial, arbitragers have been raking in solid profits. ''You've had 50 percent annualized returns on sure things,'' said Guy Wyser-Pratte, head of the arbitrage department at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. **********The bottom-line implications are rosy. ''A lot of these operations will have the best quarter in their history,'' predicted Martin A. Weinstein, managing director of Kubera, a New York arbritrage firm that he founded on March 1. **********Most arbitragers expect the takeover binge to continue this year, although they say the pace may slow. But they expect to see their profit margins shrink as more players return to the arbitrage game, drawn in by today's large profits. ''This just can't continue,'' said the head of arbitrage at one Wall Street brokerage, who asked not to be identified. **********Among the casualties of the market crash, arbitragers were the first - and worst - hit. Even with the latest takeover wave, the number of players and the amount of money committed to risk arbitrage is still below its pre-crash levels, participants say. So far, most arbitragers have yet to completely recoup their losses from 1987's second half, according to the head of one arbitrage firm, who asked not to be identified. ''These people are nowhere near whole,'' he said. **********The arbitrage community says its troubles in 1987 started last summer, when Representative Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, put forward proposals designed to clamp down on hostile takeovers. The proposals, which have since been abandoned, would have ended tax deductions for interest on debt used in takeover battles. Many arbitragers still bitterly complain that the Rostenkowski proposals, which cooled some of the takeover activity that had been fueling the market's broad rise, paved the way for the crushing October debacle. Many highly touted takeover issues - including Dayton Hudson, GAF, Telex and Allegis - fell far more than the market, some as much as 60 percent. **********The result: heavy trading losses for arbitrage departments at big brokerage firms and for smaller, so-called boutique operations. The smaller concerns saw their capital halved in some cases, according to reports from Wall Street. Some big brokerages simply retreated to the sidelines. L.F. Rothschild, which had been considered a major force in the business, cut back the amount of funds devoted to its arbitrage operations to one-tenth pre-crash levels, Wall Street players said. Smith Barney dissolved it arbitrage operation. ''You had an industry second-guessing itself,'' said Mr. Weinstein, whose experience reflects the shakeout. Before the market collapse, he ran Comdisco Equities, a unit of Comdisco Inc., an Illinois computer sales and leasing company. But losses in his operation totaled $100 million at one point, a figure, to be sure, that was not out of line with losses at other arbitrage firms. He parted company with Comdisco and set up Kubera, named for a Hindu god of wealth, with four Comdisco colleagues. **********The trimming of arbitrage ranks after the crash has meant that there was drastically less money available to pursue takeovers. One Wall Street firm's researcher, who did not want to be identified, estimated that arbitragers commanded about $15 billion in buying power before October. The crash trimmed that to about $6 billion to $7 billion, and since the crash the total has probably risen to about $10 billion, he said. **********BUT the financial clout of the arbitragers was on the wane before October, in part because of the elimination of Ivan F. Boesky as a force. The indictment of Mr. Boesky, in the fall of 1986, in an insider-trading scandal and the winding down of his operations took $2 billion to $3 billion out of arbitrage activity, participants estimate. **********Ripples from the scandal continue. Last month, Jamie Securities Inc., an arbitrage firm that had been a major force in the takeover speculation, said it was considering dissolving after the arrest of its managing partner, John A. Mulheren Jr. Mr. Mulheren, who has been a target of the insider-trading investigation, was arrested this winter by New Jersey police on a weapons charge. At the time, police said he told them he was on his way to kill Mr. Boesky. **********The scandals and the post-crash losses have left many people in the arbitrage community reluctant to talk on the record; they do not want to get into the limelight again. But it is clear that many arbitragers are doing well again, buoyed by deals with inviting ''spreads,'' the difference between the latest bid and the price at which the stock is trading. The spread is a measure of the profit potential in a deal. **********When a bid is announced, sometimes the share price will leapfrog over the bid price if investors see it as the opening salvo in a battle that will draw higher offers. Last week, investors greeted the American Stores Company's $45-a-share bid for Lucky Stores Inc. by bidding up Lucky's stock to $46.75, a jump of $14.50. Investors were saying that, despite the fat premium offered by the buyer, they expected a higher bid. **********AT some point, though, the stock price falls below the most recent bid, reflecting a risk that the deal will not go through on those terms or that it will not close quickly. For example, the day that Campeau sweetened its $73 bid for Federated Department Stores, the target company's stock rose to only $69. **********The arbitrager constantly monitors this spread, trying to size up the intentions of the contending companies and evaluate the status of the bids. The aim is to lock in the spread when the deal looks solid, or bail out at profitable levels if trouble begins to appear. Often that means talking to the companies and seeking the views of attorneys and securities analysts. It's a business that requires nimble, well-informed traders. **********The amount of money available to bet on takeovers can affect the spreads. When a lot of money is chasing a few deals, that shoots a stock up closer to the bid price. Spreads tend to narrow and so do arbitrage profits. But the opposite conditions prevail now and players are making big profits. ''Now that much of the risk arbitrage capital has dissipated,'' said Mr. Wyser-Pratte, ''that leaves it open to the remaining players.'' **********When spreads are wide, even late-comers can make profits if they are willing to take the risk. Speculators who bought Federated's stock at $69 a share last week, for example, stand to make $5 a share, or a 7 percent return, if Campeau's bid succeeds. If the Campeau deal were wrapped up in 30 days, that would amount to an annualized gain of about 84 percent. **********The risk, of course, is that the bid will falter or be withdrawn, or that Federated will invoke a defense that results in a protracted battle. That could quickly eat up the gains. The basic rule of arbitrage is that the longer the transaction takes, the greater the risk. **********The recent activity has started to bring people into arbitrage who had not been major players. Earlier this year, for example, George Soros, the founder of Quantum N.V., an offshore fund, brought on five arbitrage specialists who had worked for corporate raider Asher Edelman. **********But the question of how long the profits will be sustained remains open. Some worry that the takeover game is already a bit too hot. One sign is that investors are increasingly pushing the target company's stock price far beyond the bid price, as in the case of Lucky Stores. That is an indication that investors are assuming there will be other bidders. **********A second sign is the wave of rumors about potential targets. Most arbitragers just bet on announced deals. But there are more so-called ''whisper'' stocks, a sign that the public is becoming fascinated with takeovers again.

But the governing party lost its parliamentary majority in April for the first time, introducing a new requirement for politics here -the art of compromise. **********While the ruling and opposition camps have managed to stave off major crises so far, the opposition's upper hand in the legislature is apparently grating on some members of the ruling party. **********Ten days ago, Yoon Giel Joong, the party's chairman, told reporters that opposition and ruling parties should form a coalition to revise the Constitution to introduce a parliamentary form of government. On Saturday, Kim Yong Gap, a Cabinet minister, accused opposition parties of encouraging leftism and suggested that the Government was powerless to stop dangerous radicals unless the Constitution was revised to permit the president to dissolve the legislature. Trial Balloons Seen **********Both men said they were not speaking for the ruling party but expressing their own views, something the party's politicians can now do under President Roh Tae Woo, whose style is less authoritarian than that of his predecessor, Chun Doo Hwan. **********Yet political commentators here suggested that the statements were trial balloons, reflecting the frustrations of certain sectors of the ruling party. **********Mr. Kim's remarks have stirred more concern because he is thought to represent the rightist wing of the party. **********''I think there are quite a few people within the establishment who feel that all consideration is being given to left-of-center vocalists, and that the opposition is playing up to them too much,'' said a longtime military-watcher here. **********The ruling party, while not endorsing constitutional change, is rebuffing opposition calls for Mr. Kim's resignation and seconding his concern about the growth of radical ideologies in South Korea's freer political climate. **********''There are an increasing number of middle class conservatives - a majority - who are uneasy about the growth of radical leftism in society,'' said Choi Chang Yoon, a legislator and senior member of the ruling party. ''Many people want measures to block this radical leftism, and in that sense, I am in full agreement with him.'' Reporters Are Blamed **********Mr. Choi said that Mr. Kim had told him he was not insisting on constitutional revision, and that reporters had overblown his remarks. Mr. Choi also denied suggestions that the ruling party was frustrated with the opposition's parliamentary power. **********Opposition leaders accuse the party of trying to cheat them out of their legislative victory. ''This is a betrayal of the people's mandate,'' said Kim Dae Jung, leader of the largest opposition party. ''All this speculation on the part of the ruling party will cause great confusion and instability.'' **********The discussion comes at a time when many South Koreans are relieved that power-sharing has so far produced not the governmental paralysis of Korea's brief experiment with parliamentary democracy in 1960 but compromise. **********''I think the political situation is far better than was expected,'' said Shin Myung Soon, professor of political science at Yonsei University. ''If we compare with the past, the situation is very unstable, but I think many people think that this may be part of democratic politics.'' **********The opposition has flexed its new power and scored several victories, but has also compromised in several cases. **********For instance, after the President vetoed an opposition bill that would have forced witnesses to testify before legislative investigatory committees, the parties agreed on a compromise that subjects witnesses who twice refuse to testify to prosecution on contempt charges. 'Courtesty' Exemption for Chun **********In the teeth of a ruling party boycott, the opposition forced through an order forbidding former President Chun, his wife and 14 relatives from leaving the country while they are investigated for corruption. The Justice Ministry exempted Mr. Chun and his wife from the order out of ''courtesy'' to a former President. **********Political quarrels may temporarily subside as both ruling and opposition camps try to observe a truce during the Seoul Olympics in September. **********Ruling party trial balloons are just one indication, however, that both sides are preparing for a public relations battle after the Olympics. Neither camp has found solutions to two explosive issues - investigations of charges of corruption during Mr. Chun's tenure and the bloody Government suppression of an uprising in Kwangju in 1980. **********In both cases, opposition parties are demanding that Mr. Chun testify before special investigatory committees. On Friday, ruling party members walked out of the Kwangju committee as the opposition passed an order summoning former President Choi Kyu Hah to testify. His testimony could create a precedent that would make it harder for Mr. Chun to refuse. **********It is in the days after the Olympics, ruling and opposition parties agree, that the power-sharing will face its most severe tests."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/28/business/mexico-s-plans-for-air-service.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-04-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 149, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mexico's Plans For Air Service", "print_headline": "Mexico's Plans For Air Service", "body_text": " **********The Government today announced a major restructuring of air service after a two-week strike and bankruptcy at its Aeromexico airline.

HAWLEY thought he was giving up some sparkling jewels last summer, when Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. spun off its specialty stores into a publicly traded company called the Neiman-Marcus Group Inc. **********Sales and profits at the stores had been climbing steadily for nearly a decade. Moreover, to hear Mr. Hawley tell it, Carter Hawley had been steadily pumping money into sales promotion, maintenance, all of the things that are vital to keeping an expensive store's image gleaming. ''These were strong and dynamic businesses,'' said Mr. Hawley, Carter Hawley's chairman and chief executive. **********But apparently, one man's gleam is another's tarnish. To the executives of the General Cinema Corporation, which owns nearly 60 percent of the Neiman-Marcus Group's stock, the Neiman-Marcus chain is like an aristocratic old estate that has fallen on hard times. The good name is there, they say, but everything's gone a bit to seed. **********''I personally went through all the stores with the exception of maybe two or three,'' said Robert J. Tarr Jr., president and chief operating officer of both General Cinema and the Neiman-Marcus Group. His conclusion: ''The chain had been suffering from a lack of cash infusions.'' **********Since then, the Neiman-Marcus Group has been sprucing up the 81-year-old Neiman-Marcus chain, which accounts for 75 percent of the Group's sales. (The Group also owns Bergdorf-Goodman, an exclusive specialty store on Fifth Avenue in New York and Contempo Casuals, a chain of more than 200 stores catering to young women.) It is refurbishing stores, retraining sales people, and otherwise spending money in hopes of increasing sales per square foot immediately and increasing market share in years to come. **********The expenditures, coupled with newly conservative accounting practices and generally depressed sales in much of the retailing industry, have meant some pretty severe earnings drops. For the third quarter ended April 30, the Neiman-Marcus Group's net earnings were $4.29 million on revenues of $276.5 million, down from net income of $10.2 million on sales of $259.6 million the year before. Thomas H. Tashjian, an analyst with Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. in Los Angeles, estimates that the company lost more than $1.1 million in the fourth quarter. And that's before it pays General Cinema more than $6 million as dividend on its preferred stock. **********Neiman-Marcus's executives seem relatively unworried about the poor showing. ''Ultimately, we'll be getting 20 percent return on assets, and operating earnings will be up to 10 percent of sales,'' said J. Atwood Ives, vice chairman and chief financial officer, who, like Mr. Tarr, holds his titles at both General Cinema and the Neiman-Marcus Group. ''But we would be mortgaging the future if we didn't build a strong infrastructure and reinvest in the business now.'' **********Analysts say that attitude is characteristic of General Cinema, a $1 billion company whose revenues have come primarily from soft drink bottling and movie theaters, and which owns 18.4 percent of Cadbury Schweppes. The company has a reputation for buying well-known consumer businesses and investing in them for long-term growth. **********''They are long-term players when they take on a new business,'' Mr. Tashjian said. ''The mentality of General Cinema is to either redeploy assets or improve them to make them more productive.'' **********Clearly, General Cinema sees lots of room for improvement at the Neiman-Marcus stores. It has hired Allen I. Questrom, a retailing executive who has run Bullock's, Rich's and other units of Federated Department Stores, to be chief executive of the chain. Mr. Questrom, who will assume his new post on Wednesday, could not be reached to discuss his plans. But he is stepping into a company that is already buzzing with of activity. **********Seven of Neiman's 22 stores are in the midst of top-to-bottom remodeling; nearly all of them are getting new fixtures and carpeting. At all of them, space is being reallocated. Designer sportswear, a highly profitable department, is getting more space, as is men's wear, a category that Mr. Tarr said has been ''seriously underdeveloped'' at Neiman. The new space will be carved out of children's clothes, epicure products and a few other departments that Mr. Tarr and his colleagues think are less important. **********Leading suppliers say they already see a difference. ''They are definitely getting more focused as far as their displays go,'' said designer Donna Karan, whose clothes are sold at both Neiman's and Bergdorf's. ''They are learning how to sell the garments in the best updated way.'' **********Promotion and service are getting overhauled, too. Neiman-Marcus is doing more high-fashion advertising in newspapers, Mr. Tarr says, and is increasing the staffing at its gift wrap and other service departments. It is also emphasizing some promotional programs started under Carter Hawley - its InCircle program, for example, which gives customers points for spending more than $3,000 a year in the stores. The points are good for trips or gifts. **********The Neiman-Marcus Group, which just 10 days ago said it was buying Horchow Mail Order, a Dallas catalogue company, is building a new distribution center for the Neiman chain's own mail order business. The new center will be much larger than the existing one, and will incorporate fairly sophisticated computer-reorder systems. **********In the stores, policies for handling returned merchandise have been liberalized. And commission programs for salespeople have been changed so that they now have a financial incentive to obtain from the distribution center any merchandise a customer may have seen in Neiman's catalogue that is not generally stocked in the stores. **********There are also more salespeople on the floor now - and, more important, they are more informed about the merchandise. ''If you are asking someone to buy a $1,500 outfit, it is not unreasonable to assume the customer will have questions,'' Mr. Tarr said. He has installed an incentive system for department managers that is based primarily on increased unit sales, but that he insists will get them to spend more time with customers. **********Analysts approve of what they see happening. ''The terrific potential has yet to be realized at the Neiman-Marcus Group in terms of enhancing sales and operating profits, but they are really getting the company rolling again,'' said Stacy Ruchlamer, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton. **********Ms. Ruchlamer has not made any official recommendations on the Group's stock, which has been trading around $15 for several weeks. Mr. Tashjian does not believe it is a ''buy'' right now because of persistent weak earnings, but he does not think shareholders should sell. ''We expect a recovery in the long term, directly tied to the improvements they are making now,'' he said. ''Neiman-Marcus was being used as a source of cash, and what we are seeing now is a reinvestment on the part of Neiman-Marcus in itself.'' **********IT IS all rather bewildering to Mr. Hawley, who wonders if the new owners aren't busily fixing things that weren't broken. What neglect, he wants to know. What lack of cash? **********''I've read that we spent too little on sales promotion, that we milked the specialty stores, that we skimped on maintenance,'' he said. ''It's all pretty difficult for me to understand, particularly since the facts are easily ascertainable from the annual reports.'' **********Mr. Hawley does point to some rather impressive numbers. For example, he notes that from 1981 to 1986 Carter Hawley spent $200 million on its three specialty store chains, $140 million of which went to the Neiman-Marcus stores. ''How could anyone call Neiman-Marcus a cash cow for us?'' Mr. Hawley asked. ''We were a net investor to the tune of about $90 million during those five years.'' In contrast, he says, the company's department stores, which include the Broadway, Emporium Capwell, Weinstock's and Thalhimers, generated about $112 million more in cash flow than they absorbed in capital expenditures. **********Although more than half of the capital expenditures went to opening new stores, about $80 million went into maintaining existing ones. Mr. Hawley says that maintenance costs at the Neiman-Marcus chain averaged about six-tenths of 1 percent of sales, about average for a specialty store chain. Annual sales promotion budgets ran about 4.1 percent of sales for the Neiman-Marcus stores, rather high for the industry. **********Mr. Hawley was doing something right. Sales for the specialty stores combined grew at an annual compound rate of 17 percent a year in those last five years of Carter Hawley's ownership. **********A lot of that growth came from new stores, but the growth rate for stores that had been open for at least a year was still 7.5 percent. Moreover, the specialty stores' profitability went up at an annual compound rate of nearly 30 percent. **********Few retailing experts quarrel with those numbers. But many say that what was missing during Carter Hawley's ownership was a feeling of excitement, of fashion innovation. **********Neiman-Marcus, which had its roots in the somewhat flamboyant culture of the Dallas rich, was once known for its extravagant special events and its stock of wildly expensive, exotic gifts. It was Neiman-Marcus that Frederick Wiseman featured in his critically acclaimed documentary, ''The Store.'' Shoppers who wanted a one-of-a-kind item or a dress that was sure to generate conversation - and who wanted salespeople to lavish attention on them - went to Neiman-Marcus. **********The store's reputation, helped by its widely circulated catalogue, went far beyond Dallas. When Carter Hawley acquired Neiman-Marcus's three Texas stores in 1969, it immediately started expanding nationwide. It opened at least one new store a year throughout the 1970's and two stores a year through the early 1980's. **********The expansion program stopped when Carter Hawley found itself the target of a takeover attempt by The Limited, another retail chain. General Cinema served as Carter Hawley's white knight. When Carter Hawley restructured last year, General Cinema swapped its Carter Hawley stock for its share of the Neiman-Marcus Group. **********RETAILING experts say that despite the troubles besetting its parent company, the Neiman-Marcus chain never lost its reputation for quality. But, they say, its image as a leader has suffered badly. ''Ten, twelve years ago everyone was talking about Neiman-Marcus as in the forefront of fashion and prestige,'' said Avijit Ghosh, editor of the Journal of Retailing, published by New York University's business school. ''Now you hear that about Bloomingdale's. Maybe Carter Hawley was spending a lot of money but just wasn't generating the right kind of excitement.'' **********Ronald L. Rotter, an analyst with Morgan, Olmstead, put it more bluntly. ''Under the Carter Hawley regime, they lost their entrepreneurial vim and vigor,'' he said. **********General Cinema is trying mightily to restore it. As soon as existing stores are up to standard, it wants to get expansion going again. Plans call for opening two new Neiman-Marcus stores a year between 1990 and 1995. **********It would like to expand Bergdorf's, too, although its executives admit that will be a lot more difficult. The Fifth Avenue store, which accounts for about 12 percent of the Group's revenues, caters to a highly sophisticated, affluent customer who likes to dress for dinner and who is willing to spend heavily for exclusive items. It is a concept that simply does not work well in many places outside New York City. A few years ago Carter Hawley opened a Bergdorf's in an affluent section of White Plains. The store failed. It was converted into a Neiman-Marcus - a store with a less formal feel - and sales soared. **********''To open a successful Bergdorf's you have to have the right location, the right merchandise serviced on an exclusive basis, the right staffing and the right management at once,'' said Mr. Tarr. ''That's not always easy to find at the very beginning.'' Although he does not rule out the idea of another Bergdorf's in the United States, Mr. Tarr says his inclination is to seek that proper mix somewhere in Europe. **********The General Cinema executives must make some serious decisions about Contempo, too. The chain, which has been steadily working its way East from its West Coast base, is suffering badly from what retailing insiders call ''low fashion excitement'' throughout the junior contemporary market. Contempo had a net operating loss last year, and is not yet showing signs of recovery. Although some analysts suggest that the Group should sell Contempo, Mr. Tarr says he wants to hold it a while longer. ''As long as we have it, we might as well see what we can do with it,'' he said. **********The big question is whether General Cinema will eventually buy the rest of the Neiman-Marcus Group. Under its agreement with Carter Hawley, it cannot buy more shares piecemeal until January 1993. It can tender for the entire company, but if its offer is not accepted by 50 percent of the other shareholders, it cannot buy any. **********Mr. Tarr and other General Cinema executives refuse to comment on their plans. Much, of course, will depend on how well their refurbishing and expansion programs work - and how attractive the Neiman-Marcus Group might look to anyone else. General Cinema has always said that its philosophy is to sell anything that the market values higher than it does. Depending on the takeover climate in a few years, Neiman-Marcus may find itself with yet another owner."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/25/world/vichy-journal-fading-of-a-spa-incurable-or-will-a-face-lift-do.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Greenhouse", "pub_date": "1988-07-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1097, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Vichy Journal; Fading of a Spa: Incurable?

Or Will a Face Lift Do?", "body_text": " **********Despite the gallons and gallons of mineral water consumed, the daily showers in warm spring water, and the occasional mud bath or two, the Queen is showing her age. The Queen of Spas, that is. **********In its Belle Epoque, this town in central France, blessed with 200 mineral springs, was by far the world's most famous and popular spa, attracting everyone from Napoleon's mother and the daughters of Louis XV to dozens of Arab princes and Indian maharajahs. Illustrious writers, actors and singers also came to drink and bathe in Vichy's waters, which are said to help cure digestion and liver ailments, skin problems, migraine headaches and rheumatism. **********Since 1960, however, this proud town has deteriorated rapidly. The number of tourists and ''curists'' (those who come to be cured) has plunged by half. Residents often complain that the town has lost its vigor and glamour because most of today's visitors are over 60, many of them poor, many of them spending their days sipping mineral water and sitting around the well-shaded parks. These vistors often get France's social security system to help pay for their hotel, meals and therapy when they come to Vichy for 21-day cures. **********''I've been coming here for 25 years because the waters help my liver ailment, but Vichy isn't as nice as it was back then,'' said Philippe Gachon, a retired municipal worker from the Loire Valley. ''There used to be opera, ballet or some other attraction every night, but now it seems they don't make much of an effort. Maybe it's because there aren't as many people coming any more.'' A Thing of the Past **********In a sense, Vichy is a victim of modern times. Advances in pharmacology have allowed people to take pills for their ailments instead of making the pilgrimage to Vichy. Air travel made it easy for people to take a jet to the French Riviera, skipping over Vichy. **********''The appearance of Brigitte Bardot in St.-Tropez, and her making sex, sea and sun so popular didn't help Vichy at all,'' said Antoine de Galembert, president of Compagnie Fermiere de Vichy, the company that has managed the state-owned mineral springs and bottled its waters since winning the concession in 1853. **********Another problem is Vichy's bad image from World War II when it was the capital of the collaborationist Government of Henri Philippe Petain. Residents often say Vichy was no better or worse than the rest of France, having its share of collaborators as well as members of the Resistance. **********''The town still faces some prejudice from the war,'' complained Mayor Jacques Lacarin. ''We didn't invite Petain in. He chose Vichy because it was easy to set up a government here. We already had 15,000 hotel rooms and a communications network that reached around the world.'' **********After seeing the number of curists drop from 33,000 in 1958 to 18,000 a year at present, the Vichy Company finally decided it was time for a change. The company, a subsidiary of the Perrier Group since 1972, has announced plans to build a modern $50 million health and beauty center. As part of the effort, the city and state are spending more than $10 million to help renovate Vichy's Grand Casino and spa. Fountain of Youth?  ''We saw that something had to be done,'' said Mr. de Galembert, the new president of the Vichy Company. ''We want to attract a younger, more upscale clientele.'' **********The hope is that the new health and beauty center will become a fountain of youth for Vichy by building on the town's ''health'' reputation. That reputation dates from when the Romans bathed in the warm springs here in 50 B.C. **********Perrier officials plan to spend millions of dollars to publicize the center. Guests will pay about $3,000 for a 10-day visit, room and board included, and will receive a checkup, consultations on health, diet and beauty treatments, and if they desire, an exercise regimen. Townspeople Can't Agree **********The center hopes to attract 7,000 people in 1991, the year it is scheduled to open, and 15,000 in the year 2000. The building will have a glass skin and will be arch-shaped, with 200 luxury hotel rooms, the beauty and health center, and swimming pools on the horizontal to be built over Vichy's Avenue des Etats-Unis. **********The plans for the center have split this town of 30,000, a split that seems like a war between the generations. Most young residents think the center is a great idea because it will put some spring back into Vichy's step. Showing frustration about the graying of the town, one young store owner joked that Vichy used to be a Cannes Festival each summer, but now has become a ''Canes Festival.'' **********But many older residents say the town is fine as is. Many fear the center will bring in noisy youngsters who will carouse late into the night. In addition, many Vichy residents, especially older ones, fear that the project will not work and that their tax contributions will go down the drain. Some Old Grudges **********''I'm worried that it won't attract enough people,'' said Georges Ton, a long-time Vichy resident who is retired from his job at a munitions plant. ''It will cost too much. We need something that will attract regular people.'' **********What is more, many townspeople bear an old grudge against the Vichy Company because it has dominated the town for so long and done little to help it. The company owns the thermal treatment center, the opera house, the casino, Vichy Sporting Club, a golf course, and the Parc des Sources, which was built by Napoleon. **********''They should have done this whole project 20 years ago,'' said Jean-Pierre Bouvier, owner of a sweet shop, dating from 1863, when Emperor Napoleon III came here for a cure. Still, Mr. Bouvier is optimistic. **********Mr. de Galembert is also confident that the project will succeed, even boasting that it will lure back people who had succumbed to the charms of St.-Tropez and Cannes. ''Sex, sea and sun are finished,'' he said. ''Nowadays sex means AIDS, the sea is polluted and sun means cancer. People are looking for another life style. They're growing more concerned about their health.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/17/world/7-die-in-clash-in-pakistan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-04-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 141, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "7 Die in Clash in Pakistan", "print_headline": "7 Die in Clash in Pakistan", "body_text": " **********A clash between local tribesmen and the paramilitary police in northwest Pakistan has left 7 people dead and 17 wounded, reports said today.

The Federal Home Loan Bank Board Monday said the Robert M. Bass Group Inc. would lead the bailout of the insolvent institution, which is based in Stockton, Calif. **********All of which indicates that Robert Bass is coming into his own in 1988. An heir to his uncle's oil fortune, Mr. Bass enjoyed a privileged youth. He attended two prep schools, Phillips Andover Academy and Governor Dummer Academy. He was a student at Yale University and then at Stanford University Business School in 1972. **********In 1974 Mr. Bass returned to Texas and a spot at Bass Brothers Enterprise, the investment vehicle created for Robert and his brothers Sid R., Lee M. and Edward P. by their father Perry in 1960. **********Tales of rivalries between Robert and his brothers have often marked speculation about the brothers in recent years. In 1983, Robert broke away from his brothers and formed the Robert M. Bass Group Inc. to pursue deals on his own.

For instance, Mr. Bass won a hard-fought public relations campaign opposing the expansion of a Fort Worth freeway overpass that he thought would jeopardize the city's historic district. **********With the recent string of successes under his belt, Robert Bass has probably become ''the richest of the clan,'' according to a February issue of Forbes magazine, which estimated his personal net worth at about $1 billion. His investments are clustered in financial services, the information industry, cable television and real estate. **********But Mr. Bass is not adverse to owning a few diversions as well.

Its roof caving in and walls askew, the cabin is all that remains of a community that took its name from a gunfight between two fur trappers in the 1920's. **********For a traveler riding a tug downriver to the Arctic Ocean, Little Chicago seemed redolent of the adventure marking the history of Canada's far north. But to Capt. Henry Oakley and the 12-man crew of the Jock McNiven, a 780-ton vessel that pushes barges laden with the fuel and equipment needed to sustain life in the Far North, the sights along the river are little more than distance markers on the long, solitary voyage to the sea. **********''When you've been up and down this river a few dozen times, it's all pretty familiar,'' said Captain Oakley, 54 years old. Since he started as a deckhand on river boats, he has had 33 years' experience, 17 of them as a captain on the Mackenzie River. Checking the blinking red and green lights on the echo sounder, he satisfied himself that there was enough water beneath the barges to avoid the jagged rocks lurking in the channel, then fell into a silent vigil. **********A 2,635-mile ribbon of cold, murky water that flows northward through the forests and tundra of the Canadian Arctic, the Mackenzie and two rivers that feed it, the Peace and the Finlay, form the longest continuous water flow in North America after the Mississippi River system. **********Like the Mississippi in an earlier age, the Mackenzie plays a crucial role in opening up a vast, largely unpopulated area - 1.3 million square miles of resources-rich land and water, the Northwest Territories. **********This summer, when drought in the great plains lowered the Mississippi's water level and forced a reduction in barge traffic, the spring runoff from the Rocky Mountains that provides much of the Mackenzie's vast flow kept this river at normal levels. But barge traffic on the Mackenzie, too, was down sharply from the highs recorded earlier in the decade, largely because of freight cutbacks associated with the decline in oil and gas exploration in the Canadian Arctic resulting from low world prices. **********The Northern Transportation Company, operator of all but a handful of the tugs and barges that ply the Mackenzie, hopes the situation will improve soon as oil companies with dwindling reserves in North America begin returning to frontier areas with known pools of oil and gas. In the meantime it has fallen back on the bread-and-butter business that has sustained it for more than 50 years: carrying the food, fuel and equipment that lets the Canadian north survive. **********Counting the staff at its headquarters in Edmonton, Alberta, the barge company has fewer than 300 employees, many of them seasonal. Without them, however, most activity across the Canadian Arctic would quickly cease. Because many communities lie beyond the reach of roads and air freight is too expensive for all but the most urgently needed goods, everything from baby food to the giant steel superstructures of oil rigs must come north by sea - about 80 percent of it on the Mackenzie River barges. Keeping Arctic Lamps Burning **********''We keep the lamps burning across the entire Arctic,'' said Kirk Vander Ploeg, the company's terminal manager at Norman Wells, the site of an oilfield and refinery operated by Imperial Oil Ltd., the Exxon Corporation's Canadian subsidiary. During halts at the town, the barges take on almost all of the Arctic's fuel - millions of gallons of aviation kerosene, specially treated diesel fuel that stays liquid down to 60 degrees below zero, the bunker oils that fuel power generators and gasoline for everything from snowmobiles to the longboats used for Eskimo whale hunts. **********Although Northern Transportation has a virtual monopoly in all three of its major operating areas - the 1,100-mile voyage down the Mackenzie from the company's northern terminus at Hay River, Northwest Territories; east and west along the Arctic coastline from Tuktoyaktuk, where the Mackenzie meets the Arctic Ocean, and up the west coast of Hudson's Bay from Churchill, Manitoba - the company has seen its total tonnage slip precipitously in the 1980's. **********From its establishment by the Canadian Government in 1934, the company has ridden peaks and troughs in Arctic development. One boom came in the late 1950's when John Diefenbaker, then the Prime Minister, was pushing his ''northern vision.'' Another came with a surge of oil and gas exploration in the early 1970's, a surge that was repeated in the early 1980's when the Government granted more than $6 billion in subsidies to encourage exploration. Downturn in Amount of Freight **********But oil and gas activity has slumped with world prices, and with it the amount of freight moving north. **********This year Northern Transportation expects to ship a total of 178,000 tons, 55 percent less than the record of 399,000 tons shipped in 1972 and barely half of this decade's peak, the 383,000 tons shipped in 1982. **********The company has also been hurt by the opening in 1979 of the Dempster Highway, a $100 million road that runs 450 miles from Dawson City in the Yukon to Inuvik on the Arctic Sea, and by the ''ice roads'' that mining companies extend across the frozen lakes and tundra in the winter. **********With business down 20 percent this year alone, Northern Transportation has laid up all but 8 of its 30 vessels, and many of its 140 barges. Seasoned crew members have been forced to find work elsewhere, and the company's house organ, The Link, has urged fortitude: ''We must wait patiently. There's been a steamship line in Canada's north for 55 years. There have been times of low water, seasons of heavy ice and other obstacles to challenge our resourcefulness. None of it has ever stopped us.'' Whether the company is profitable at lower tonnage levels is hard to say: Northern Transportation issues no figures. After half a century of Government ownership, the company was sold under the privatization policy of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Conservative Government. Company's Eskimo Ownership **********Instead of selling it to one of Canada's major transportation conglomerates, the Government chose to transfer ownership in 1985 to two community-owned development corporations established by Eskimos. **********The Government set a bargain price, $21 million, on a company with assets that had a potential value of many times that. But the new owners, the Inuvialuit Development Corporation and the Nunasi Corporation, representing 20,000 Eskimos in the eastern and western Arctic, have had to contend with falling revenues almost from the moment of the takeover and are now pinning their hopes on indications that several oil and gas companies that have abandoned Arctic exploration may be about to return. **********At present, only Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. is actively searching for oil in the Beaufort Sea. But the Amoco Corporation's Canadian subsidiary, Amoco Canada Ltd., having completing its takeover of Dome Petroleum, the Canadian-owned oil giant, recently announced that it would return to the region next year to drill two exploratory wells on Dome leases. And Imperial Oil is expected back this winter to resume drilling in the huge onshore gas reserves it has found in the Mackenzie River delta. Awesome Array on the River **********Even in these lean times, a Northern Transportation tug-and-barge lineup makes a mammoth sight. In a configuration of the kind adopted by the Jock McNiven for its northbound journey in August, a single tug can push up to nine 250-foot barges arrayed in rows of three, equivalent to three football fields end to end. Including 5,000 tons of fuel carried in the barges, the freight delivered to Tuktoyaktuk in a single shipment can total more than 8,000 tons. **********The deck cargo aboard the Jock McNiven included an icebreaker's anchor chain weighing more than 100 tons. Alongside were stacks of prefabricated building materials, several pickup trucks, a forklift, a 50-foot trailer and a whaling boat. **********And there were containers for the Hudson's Bay stores that are the hub of many Arctic communities, carrying everything from crates of Coca-Cola to television sets. **********Hidden in other containers were hundreds of tons of equipment for the American and Canadian military, which jointly operate the chain of early-warning radar stations across the Arctic from Alaska to Greenland. Demanding, but Rewarding, Work **********During a four-day, 550-mile voyage from Norman Wells to Tuktoyaktuk, involving a handful of villages, the only other river activity consisted of two Canadian coast guard ships and three motorboats carrying Indian and Eskimo fishermen. Once a pair of foxes appeared on the shoreline, watching keenly as the tug passed by. **********Currents can be strong, and visibility can plunge to zero amid drifting smoke from forest fires and heavy fogs. But the biggest hazard, particularly in Arctic channels north of the mainland, comes from the ice. **********For the crew members, toiling 12 hours a day, the work can be demanding. But the welcome awaiting them when they reach remote communities like Sach's Harbor and Spence Bay, 1,000 miles east of Tuktoyaktuk, helps compensate for the strain. **********Mr. Vander Ploeg, the terminal manager at Norman Wells, used to work as a purser on the Arctic runs. He recalled how the arrival of the barges, with a year's supply of food and fuel and toys, led entire communities to gather on the beach. **********''We'd come to town and find the schools and stores shut down, with everybody on the shoreline waiting for us and cheering,'' he said. ''It was the highlight of the season.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/26/business/business-and-health-hmo-troubles-with-medicare.html": {"writer_name": "Milt Freudenheim", "pub_date": "1988-01-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 899, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Business and Health; H.M.O.

Most of the members of those health maintenance organizations that gave up on the Medicare program have transferred to other prepaid plans. **********A number of the 133 H.M.O.'s still in the program have lost money on Medicare patients, and many such groups are cautious about seeking the business. In addition, the H.M.O.'s will be operating under new requirements imposed by Congress. **********In December, as part of the budget reconciliation bill, Congress said that if the prepaid plans decide to terminate services, they must see to it that their members have equivalent health insurance for six months, so that members can arrange to maintain some of the extra coverage they get under the H.M.O. program. **********Advocates for the elderly have also complained that some H.M.O.'s have raised their monthly fees for Medicare members.

Billings, legislative director of the Group Health Association of America, a trade group. The association successfully lobbied for a 13.5 percent average increase in the premiums that Medicare pays to medical plans. The premiums are based on 95 percent of the average amount that Medicare spends on people who pay doctors and hospitals in the same county on the traditional fee-for-service basis. With sharply rising doctor and hospital charges, this base has also been increasing. **********Twenty-nine of the 159 prepaid plans that contracted to serve Medicare patients withdrew from the program last year, according to Kevin E.

Several were in rural areas, where costs of care were relatively high and Medicare premiums were lower than in the cities. **********''The business is based on economies of scale,'' Mr. Moley said. More than 500,000 people, over half the national enrollment, are served by 10 large H.M.O. companies. **********The vast majority of the 30 million elderly and disabled Americans eligible for Federal Medicare insurance are covered on the traditional fee-for-service basis. **********One of the biggest health maintenance organizations, the United Healthcare Corporation, said it had done well while providing for its 150,000 Medicare enrollees. ''We've been able to make a profit at it,'' said Kenneth L. Simmons, vice chairman and chief operating officer of United Healthcare, in Minnetonka, Minn. Bob Ditmore, president of United, said the company had learned from seven years of experience with Medicare patients. **********In the early days, elderly Medicare patients spent 11 to 12 days in the hospital, he said. By making arrangements to help them convalesce at home, he added, the average hospital stay has been reduced to 6.5 days - although still almost twice the 3.5 to 4 days in the hospital for patients under 65 years of age. **********In another example of watching costs, he said that United makes sure that as soon as possible after a hip replacement operation, the patient is moved out of an $800-a-day hospital room to a rehabilitation center in a nursing home that charges $100 to $150 a day. **********Mr. Ditmore said the system worked best in health maintenance organizations with their own staff physicians, who know the system and support it. He noted that in one of United's groups, which contracts with independent physicians to care for Medicare patients, costs were higher. ''So we had to raise our premiums,'' he said. **********Nationally, the average monthly charge to Medicare members of H.M.O.'s is $36 to $37, a 30 percent increase from $27.66 last year, according to Mr. Moley of the Office of Prepaid Health Care. **********But the higher charges are still lower than the premiums for many private supplementary insurance policies bought by Medicare-eligible people, he said. And the health maintenance organizations often provide such extras as payment for prescription drugs and unlimited hospital stays. **********The American Association of Retired Persons, an advocacy group with 26 million members, is concerned about the rise in fees. ''We want to know if the increased charges are creating barriers to care for people who might not be able to afford them,'' said Stephanie Kennan, a legislative representative for A.A.R.P. ''We need more data,'' she added. ''We want to know if the increases are a trend or just a blip.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/28/business/big-board-s-plan-curbs-use-of-new-stock-units.html": {"writer_name": "Kurt Eichenwald", "pub_date": "1988-12-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 513, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Big Board's Plan Curbs Use of New Stock Units", "print_headline": "Big Board's Plan Curbs Use of New Stock Units", "body_text": " **********The New York Stock Exchange has issued a proposal that would allow companies listed on the Big Board to break their stock into new securities as part of a new type of corporate reorganization. **********But the proposal contains some significant restrictions, including the amount of stock that could be broken up and the treatment of voting rights of the remaining shares. **********The proposal to the Securities and Exchange Commission addresses the innovation announced earlier this month by Shearson Lehman Hutton. Under the strategy, corporations buy back shares with ''unbundled stock units,'' a package of securities that includes bonds and two new securities whose value will be based on the company's dividends and share prices. Possible Alternative **********The unbundling plan is seen as a possible alternative for corporations to the restructuring that is required to fend off takeover attempts. If the plan is successful, it could have the effect of raising stock prices. **********Unbundled stock units are composed of three securities: a bond, a preferred share and a warrant. The units provide investors additional protection should a company do poorly over the next 30 years. **********Four major corporations - the American Express Company, the Dow Chemical Company, Pfizer Inc. and the Sara Lee Corporation - have announced plans to undertake such a reorganization. Shearson officials have said other companies are considering such a step. Restrictions Proposed **********While the Big Board's proposal would allow a corporation to engage in such stock buybacks, it also imposes restrictions, including several related to the voting rights of outstanding stock. **********Among the restrictions is that no more than 25 percent of the total outstanding stock could be bought back and converted into unbundled units from the date of the first offer. **********According to the exchange's filing, the limit on the amount that can be purchased is intended to prevent the creation of an ''insider group.'' Such a group might gain control of the company if the other stockholders exchanged their shares, leaving the remaining few with large percentages of the outstanding stock. **********The Big Board apparently also has some concern that the technique could be used to disenfranchise shareholders. The proposal says that such exchanges will only be permitted if they do not adversely affect the voting rights of the stockholders who do not accept the exchange. **********It is unlikely that any company will be faced with such problems in the early stages of stock unbundling. The idea has received a lukewarm response from institutional investors, and some critics have contended that the companies trying to issue the securities may have to mark down the price to persuade investors to accept them. **********The Big Board's proposal also requires that shareholders be allowed to exchange their shares for the new securities on an individual basis and without a shareholder vote."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/15/business/airlines-moving-to-scale-back-underground-fare-discounts.html": {"writer_name": "Agis Salpukas", "pub_date": "1988-11-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1365, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Airlines Moving to Scale Back Underground Fare Discounts", "print_headline": "Airlines Moving to Scale Back Underground Fare Discounts", "body_text": " **********For years, knowledgeable travelers have been plugged into a thriving underground economy in which airline tickets to prime destinations abroad are sold for about one-third to one-half the cost of even the lowest discount fares offered by United States airlines. **********The good deals, however, may be much harder to get in the future. Even before United States carriers started eliminating a whole range of discount fares, some carriers started to cut back severely on the number of seats sold through what are called consolidators or wholesalers. **********The domestic fare changes, now due to go into effect in about a week, will raise travel costs by about 35 percent for a fifth of the nation's travelers, Wall Street analysts say.  [ Page D1. ]  At times, the wholesalers' underground economy has been huge, fueled mainly by modest newspaper advertisements and word of mouth. In the spring of 1987, for example, Pan American World Airways was so eager to fill seats it thought would otherwise go empty that, the airline says, it sold about 40 percent of its tickets through wholesalers. But now Pan Am is leading the way in cutting back on sales to consolidators. **********Trans World Airlines, which with Pan Am accounts for 30 percent of air travel by Americans abroad in the busy North Atlantic market, also sells seats to consolidators as well as to foreign carriers. **********Since September, Pan Am's main strategy against the wholesalers, who have long been tolerated by the industry as a necessary evil, has been to set fares so low that they are close to the prices consolidators offer. Other airlines, like T.W.A. and most overseas carriers, have followed Pan Am's lead, causing some consolidators to lose business; the degree of their losses will not be known until spring, when bookings are made for the busy summer travel season. **********Some consolidators say airlines are also beginning to cut back on the number of such companies they deal with - a move that is squeezing the wholesalers further. **********The consolidators, however, have been through tough times before. Some say that although they might lose business, the inescapable need for airlines to dispose of surplus seats insures their survival. Tough to Stay Competitive **********David Harris, president of the Unitravel Corporation of St. Louis, one of the largest consolidators in the country, acknowledged that his business had declined somewhat; it will be tough to remain as competitive if Pan Am keeps the low fares in effect into the spring, he said. **********Mr. Harris added, however, that he and other consolidators still retained a small edge: though dollar savings will be smaller, wholesalers can often sell seats without restrictions like weekend stays and advance purchase requirements that are attached to the deep discounts offered by airlines and travel agents. **********Pan Am's cut-rate flight to London this fall is a case in point: a $298 round trip, with the restrictions including a 45-day advance purchase requirement. **********Even Pan Am officials acknowledge that consolidators will still have a niche in the business, because airlines cannot avoid misjudging the volume of future travel. Thus, the primary reason why consolidators are in business is the need by airlines for an outlet through which seats can be sold without undercutting their regular fare structure. **********The practice is similar to the policy of a clothing manufacturer who regularly sells designer jackets at high prices to department stores while the same jacket with its label removed is often available at a discount outlet for a lot less. A 30-Day Lead Time **********Consolidators usually get their blocks of seats only about 30 days in advance of a flight, after the airline has estimated how much space remains unsold through its regular sales outlets, mainly travel agents, who account for about 80 percent of sales. **********For most travelers, the business of consolidators and how it operates has remained largely hidden from view, and not entirely by accident. That perhaps helps to explain why it has attracted its share of shady operators whose customers often end up in small-claims court trying to get their money back for seats that never materialized. **********On the average, however, the wholesalers have been in business for several years and deliver what they promise, although the level of service may vary greatly. **********''We give them what they pay for,'' said Mr. Harris of Unitravel, which employs about 80 people in a highly automated office with 36 WATS lines. Policies at Unitravel **********Mr. Harris sells his bargain-rate seats mostly through travel agents, who pass on the savings to their clients; he keeps the customers' money in escrow accounts until the trip is completed, he said, a practice that is not the norm in the industry. Unitravel will also buy a seat at a higher price in the event a cheaper seat cannot be delivered as promised. **********Then there are the victims of unscrupulous consolidators who often try to squeeze the last dollar out of customers and at times resort to fraud. **********Robert Speer, a business executive in Manhattan, saw a newspaper advertisement this summer offering a low, low fare to London. He called the company, North American Tours, and was promptly told, No problem. Two tickets? Fine. For two round-trip tickets, he was told, just mail a $200 deposit and $644 more 30 days before the departure date. **********Mr. Speer never got the tickets. He and eight other people who had paid their money never got off the ground. Since then he has been trying to get his $844 back. North American Tours' phones have been disconnected. Mr. Speer said its lawyers had told him that they had not been paid their fees and no longer represented the company. **********A lawyer for the concern, who spoke on condition that he and his firm not be identified, said he knew of at least 26 people who had not been paid back a total of about $25,000. He said he had heard indirectly that the owner of the company had moved to Greece. **********More tickets sold to consolidators can mean smaller revenues and profits to the carrier. Last year, for example, when Pan Am was still reeling from the huge loss of traffic to Europe in 1986 because of terrorist attacks, it hedged by allowing consolidators to sell about 40 percent of its seats at the height of the travel season. **********The move, prompted by fears that many travelers would again avoid Europe, proved to be a major miscalculation. Although traffic was much better than expected, Pan Am was stuck because it had already sold so many of its seats at low prices to consolidators. The carrier's third-quarter profits, in what is traditionally the best quarter, were a puny $1 million. 'Too Much at Wholesale' **********Seeking to avoid repeating the mistake, Pan Am this year revamped inventory control of its seats, centralizing authority under Peter McHugh, vice president of marketing. The space made available this year to consolidators was slashed to 15 to 20 percent. The seats were also made available much closer to departure time, making them harder to sell. **********''We were selling too much of our product at wholesale prices,'' Thomas Plaskett, chairman and president of Pan Am, said recently. He estimated that the carrier had been losing about $175 million a year by turning too quickly to consolidators. Now, he said, the carrier would rather give the opportunity to sell more cheap seats back to travel agents, or keep them for the airline itself. **********The move has built good will among travel agents, who generally resent consolidators for getting to make sales they think they could have made themselves. Nevertheless, many travel agents buy the cheap seats from wholesalers, then resell them at a higher price to customers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/08/world/30-mph-for-motorcade-0-mph-for-the-rest-of-the-drivers.html": {"writer_name": "James Barron", "pub_date": "1988-12-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 724, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "30 M.P.H. for Motorcade, 0 M.P.H. for the Rest of the Drivers", "print_headline": "30 M.P.H. for Motorcade, 0 M.P.H. for the Rest of the Drivers", "body_text": " **********Mikhail S. Gorbachev's motorcade whizzed through Manhattan at 25 to 30 miles an hour yesterday. But for thousands of other motorists, driving was no less nasty, brutish or short than usual. **********To clear the way for the motorcade, the police blocked off a 120-block area for an hour in the evening rush. That left streets such as 42d Street, Broadway and Third Avenue, which are usually jammed with commuters heading for bridges and tunnels, so empty that some pedestrians suggested that the air smelled fresher than usual. **********Elsewhere, long lines of cars were stranded behind police barricades, with engines idling and drivers straining to see the motorcade. **********City officials said driving should have been easier yesterday. They said traffic was unusually light, apparently the result of commuters who heeded warnings to leave their cars at home. That left some intersections virtually deserted. #15% Drop in Traffic ''Queens Plaza looked like the Sahara,'' a Transportation Department spokesman, Victor Ross, said. ''The only thing that was missing were the camels.'' **********Mr. Ross said the drive from his home in Flushing, Queens, to his office at 40 Worth Street in lower Manhattan normally took 30 minutes. ''I left at 7:30 and was there at a quarter to 8,'' he said. **********But motorists who hit the road when Mr. Gorbachev did ''got caught,'' said a deputy transportation commissioner, Samuel I. Schwartz, because of the barricades. **********''It's little consolation to them that there was a 15 percent dropoff in traffic,'' Mr. Schwartz added. **********What with all the police cars in front and the other limousines bringing up the rear, Mr. Gorbachev's motorcade stretched 1,500 feet. ''It covers four New York City blocks at any given time,'' Mr. Ross said. #20 M.P.H. Elevator Ride ''It looked like a new-car show,'' Brendan Murray, an office manager for a Wall Street brokerage concern, said. ''I hope he got a good laugh out of it. He got half a hundred stockbrokers to stand out here for an hour and a half, and all we saw were his cuff links.'' **********At the World Trade Center, Mr. Gorbachev joined the chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Philip D. Kaltenbacher, and the executive director, Stephen Berger for a 20-mile-an-hour elevator ride to the top of the 110-story tower. That was only a bit slower than Mr. Gorbachev's ground speed. **********At the top, he had a view of New Yorkers who were going nowhere fast. The Brooklyn Bridge was packed with cars from one end to the other. Mr. Schwartz said a tractor-trailer had flipped over on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway two miles from the bridge. The result was a four-mile backup. **********Later, when Mr. Gorbachev headed uptown on the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, the motorcade exited at 42d Street and drove to Third Avenue and then north to 59th Street, where it made an unscheduled halt at Bloomingdale's. Stopping and Turning Back **********Mr. Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, left their car and waded into a crowd of startled spectators, where they began shaking hands. **********Back in the car again, the Gorbachevs headed west, and then south, on Broadway. As the line of black Soviet-made limousines approached Times Square, advance elements of the motorcade - 24 police motorcycles and two vans - were ordered to stop and turn back as they approached the juncture of Broadway and Seventh Avenue. The police radio crackled with orders of, ''Everybody stop, all elements halt!'' **********For a moment, there was confusion about what had happened, other than the fact that the police escort had somehow outrun the motorcade by at least two blocks. It quickly became clear that Mr. Gorbachev had stopped again, this time at 50th Street and Broadway, where he got out of his car to wave at spectators who had gathered behind police barricades on the sidewalks. **********''We had just discussed that he might stop in Times Square,'' Chief of Department Robert J. Johnston Jr. said later.

Last month, Dr. Venis met with an accountant to discuss incorporating his practice, because ''I've finally gotten to the point where I'm making some money, so I started thinking about where to put my money and how to protect what I've got.'' **********His research so far has uncovered no compelling reasons to incorporate. ''There just aren't as many advantages for professionals to incorporate as there used to be,'' he said. **********Most experts agree. Recent changes in Federal tax law - which made top individual tax rates lower than those for corporations, and curbed the ability of corporations to defer income - are forcing doctors, lawyers, architects and other professionals to re-examine their decision to do business as a corporation. Indeed, some are racing the clock to restructure their businesses under favorable transitional rules that expire at year-end. **********''From a tax standpoint, I don't see any reason to incorporate anymore,'' said Edward Mendlowitz, partner in the New York accounting firm of Mendlowitz Weitsen. **********From a legal point of view, however, incorporating still can be a good business move. And professionals practicing in the standard form of a P.C., as the corporations are called, enjoy more liberal rules on benefits than do colleagues who are in partnerships or on their own. **********Traditionally, one incentive to incorporate was the lower tax rate. In recent years, the top corporate rate was 46 percent. Since individual income tax rates were 50 percent or higher, professionals could let money accumulate in the corporation at lower rates. Today, however, the top individual rate is 28 percent (although some high earners pay 33 percent on a portion of their income), while the corporate rate has dropped to 34 percent. **********Moreover, most corporations pay 15 percent on the first $50,000 of income, 25 percent on the next $25,000 and 34 percent on the balance. But the omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 eliminated graduated tax rates for professional service corporations, which now pay a flat 34 percent tax on all earnings. **********In addition, professionals frequently used their corporations to defer taxes by selecting a fiscal year for reporting the business's income. To prevent this kind of maneuver, the recent tax law changes generally forbid these corporations from using taxable years different from those of their shareholders. Those corporations that continue to use different reporting periods must comply with new rules that mitigate the value of the deferral. ''The deferral game is basically over,'' said Jeffrey B. Gotlinger, a tax principal with Arthur Young in New York. **********But other popular features of incorporation are far from over. While the corporate form is not a complete shield against liability, professionals typically receive more protection than they would in a partnership arrangement. If the business goes bankrupt, for example, creditors normally can reach only corporate assets, not the shareholder's personal assets. **********Unlike a partner, a shareholder in a professional corporation usually cannot be held liable for the negligence and malpractice of fellow shareholders. Similarly, the corporation may be able to sign a lease for office space or equipment without exposing individual shareholders to liability. **********Doing business as a corporation also makes it easier for professionals to transfer their practices, because the transfer involves shares of stock rather than tangible assets, said Murray B. Schwartzberg, a tax manager with the accounting firm of Spicer & Oppenheim in New York. **********In addition, professional corporations are used to assure the continuity of the business. Technically, a partnership is legally terminated by the death, resignation or addition of a partner and must be formally reconstituted to continue. By contrast, a corporation has an existence separate from its shareholders. **********Nonetheless, as a result of all the recent changes, many professional corporations have elected to become what are called S corporations, said Gerald Reich, a tax attorney and partner in the actuarial firm of Shore & Reich in New York. An S corporation, named for the subsection of the tax code that authorizes it, is a hybrid. Stockholders are taxed directly, as if the business were a partnership, to take advantage of lower individual tax rates. But shareholders still enjoy the legal protection that is afforded regular corporations. **********The problem with S corporations, however, is that they cannot get certain fringe benefits that are available to regular corporations. A regular corporation, for example, can form a medical or disability plan and take a deduction for the amount of the contribution. In addition, shareholders could contribute slightly more to their pension plans, and can borrow corporate pension funds. **********No matter which type of company form is selected, professional corporations can be expensive. Legal and accounting fees incurred to comply with Federal and state corporate rules may increase a shareholder's operating expenses from what they had been in the partnership form. **********Corporations must keep a set of books, which add about $1,000 in annual accounting fees, while payroll filings and compliance costs add about $1,500 more, Mr. Mendlowitz estimated. Incorporation also makes the business subject to more scrutiny from state regulators, he said. **********Because of the high costs, some professionals may seek to step back into a partnership. They can face substantial liquidation costs, however, in the form of potential ''recapture'' of investment tax credits and accelerated depreciation. This means that certain ordinary business deductions that had been taken by the corporation are taxed when the business is dissolved. And the business itself would incur some costs to transfer assets, for example. **********As an incentive for existing businesses to make the change, the 1986 tax act contains transitional rules, which expire at the end of this year, that allow professionals to liquidate their corporations with less severe penalties than they would otherwise face. **********As a general rule, when a corporation liquidates and distributes its assets, any gain is subject to tax paid by both the corporation and the shareholder. But certain corporations worth $5 million or less will escape double taxation if they are liquidated before the end of the year; the tax saving is phased out and lost completely for businesses worth $10 million or more. **********Because accounts receivable - generally the biggest asset held by professional corporations - do not qualify for tax relief, only corporations that own buildings or other assets that have appreciated substantially will profit from this special provision. For them, ''it makes sense to liquidate now,'' Arthur Young's Mr. Gotlinger said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/12/world/state-department-official-meets-president-paname-special-new-york-times.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-01-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 144, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A State Department Official Meets President of Paname Special to The New York Times", "print_headline": "A State Department Official Meets President of Paname Special to The New York Times", "body_text": " **********William G.

But such highly publicized partial tenders have put some companies into play inadvertently. **********The classic case involved Dome Petroleum Ltd.'s 1981 offer for one-quarter of Conoco's shares, which Dome thought it could later swap for Conoco's controlling interest in a Canadian oil and gas subsidiary. The hostile offer was doubly unappreciated at Conoco when it caused an unflattering stampede: shareholders tendered nearly two-thirds of their shares. Predators, noting the shareholders' lack of confidence in management, pounced and E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company acquired Conoco in the ensuing bidding war. **********Since then, corporations have sought to avoid similar stumbles when buying back their shares. Some decide instead to purchase shares on the open market, at best a slow-going alternative unlikely to satisfy a dissident or impatient suitor. **********The Gillette deal suggests a way around the problem. Gillette has awarded 16 million put options to shareholders, one for every seven shares they own. Each put gives shareholders the right to sell to Gillette before Sept. 19 one Gillette share for $45, about $5 more than the stock's market value before the announcement. **********The structure avoids putting the offer to a referendum, which could increase vulnerability to a takeover. ''You eliminate the problem of having a large oversubscription, which can be embarrassing or troublesome,'' said Eric Gleacher, one of Gillette's top advisers at Morgan Stanley. **********Puts do not entirely avoid the oversubscription problem since shareholders can also broadcast their disenchantment by bidding up the price of the puts, although the degree of unrest would be less clear to predators. **********Investors' ability to unbundle the put option and the stock should also fortify Gillette against takeover attempts. The company's loyal shareholders can keep their shares and still profit from the buyback by selling their puts, which trade at about $11 apiece.

''It doesn't pressure them to give up their investment, as a self-tender does,'' said David Fausch, Gillette's spokesman. **********While Coniston does not get preferential treatment, the plan does seem designed with that firm in mind. Any attempt by Coniston to dispose of its block of 7.5 million shares on the open market would almost certainly depress Gillette's stock price and erode Coniston's already slim paper profit. The puts, however, could cushion some of the market impact. Assuming that Coniston could corner 7.5 million of the 16 million puts in circulation - enough to liquidate its entire stake - at current prices, the investment firm could lock in a $26 million profit on its $240 million investment. **********Here's how: Coniston paid an average of $32 a share for its Gillette shares after expenses. Thus, on the 1.12 million shares it sells through the puts it received directly from Gillette, Coniston should clear $13 a share - the $45 purchase price less $32 - or $13 million. If Coniston acquires the right to sell the remaining 6.4 million shares for an additional $11 a share, Coniston's average cost per share would approach $43. On those shares, Coniston would clear only $2 apiece, or $12.8 million. **********Paul E. Tierney Jr., a Coniston principal, would not say whether that was his company's plan. He did say that puts were ''a shade better'' than a partial tender or open market purchases for his investor group, but argued that it would be hard to buy that many puts at attractive prices in the few weeks before the expiration date. About 300,000 puts change hands daily - one twenty-fifth of the amount Coniston would need - and concentrated buying would drive up their price. **********At the very least, the structure should allow Coniston to shrink its stake enough to enjoy some tax benefits it might not otherwise realize. Coniston would need to acquire 1.24 million puts on the open market - an amount more within its reach -in addition to its initial allotment to be assured that it qualifies for capital gains treatment, which is more advantageous than the rules on dividend income. The firm has already picked up an additional 114,000 of the put contracts since they began trading, according to a recent Coniston filing. **********Featuring puts in a buyback program had been impractical until this year, when the tax laws changed. Millicom Inc., a telecommunications company, was the first to spot the opportunity created by the new tax code and has used puts in two previous share buybacks."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/08/world/crime-parley-lures-a-thief.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-04-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 160, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Crime Parley Lures a Thief", "print_headline": "Crime Parley Lures a Thief", "body_text": " **********The Justice Minister said today that his car was stolen while he was attending a conference here on crime.

A plaque hanging on a wall outside a classroom notes that the school is ''one more contribution'' from the Matta family ''to the education of Honduran youth.'' **********''He spent more than $20,000 of his own money to build this school, for no other reason than a desire to help the poor,'' said Isaac Carcamo, the school's principal. ''The building itself, the furniture, the equipment, the books in the library, the fence around the playground, all these things are expressions of the generosity of Mr. Matta, and we are grateful for them.'' Toys and Cookies **********On Children's Day, April 30, the teachers said, Mr. Matta was especially generous to their 313 pupils, who come from one of the poorest barrios in Danli. ''Last time, he sent over 10 pinatas, all sorts of toys, and cookies and refreshments for the children,'' said Maria Dolores Rodriguez, a teacher at the school. **********Across Honduras, Mr. Matta has built a similar reputation through many other acts of charity. Since returning to his homeland in early 1986, after escaping from a Colombian prison, Mr. Matta has made large donations to build or maintain schools and hospitals and homes for the elderly and to support athletic teams and community groups. **********So well known is Mr. Matta's largess that until his seizure by the Honduran police on April 5 and his delivery to the United States a few hours later, poor people looking for financial help flocked to his lavish and heavily protected home in the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa. Mr. Matta would often come to the entrance of his mansion and hand out small sums of money to those outside. Aid to the Needy **********''If you didn't have money for medicine, you could go to his house and get it from him, or he would call the pharmacy and guarantee payment,'' said Juan Rivera, a peasant who once went to Mr. Matta's home seeking aid for an epileptic son. ''If you were crippled and needed crutches, you could count on him to help you.'' **********Government officials and foreign diplomats in Honduras, however, argue that Mr. Matta's generosity is nothing more than clever public relations intended to undermine the efforts of the Honduran and American governments to build a case against him. They describe him as the liaison between the Medellin cocaine cartel, based in Colombia, and drug dealers in Mexico. They estimate that his personal fortune exceeds $1 billion. **********Mr. Matta's delivery to the United States led to several days of protests, culminating in an attack on the United States Embassy on April 7 in which five people were believed to have died. Damage was put at $6 million. Strategic Largess **********The authorities acknowledge that Mr. Matta's efforts to buy influence and admiration in Honduras have been remarkably successful. Although he has been accused of making enormous secret payments to the Honduran military and to the police, Mr. Matta appears to have gained wide benefit from the much smaller but no less strategic gifts that he has made to public causes. ''Because he spends a lot of money on the poor, he is seen as a sort of Robin Hood figure,'' a European diplomat in Tegucigalpa said. ''There's a lot of good will for him in this country because of what he's done.'' **********Even when Mr. Matta's efforts at charity are not successful, he seems to gain sympathy from them. When he promised $25,000 last year to the Honduran Telethon, which aids a number of causes, his offer was rejected, but a heated debate ensued. **********Mr. Matta's lawyer, Carlos Lorenzana, took the offensive, charging that the Telethon decision was an ''ignoble action.'' Mr. Lorenzana described Mr. Matta as ''a man with a good heart'' and ''a faithful observer of the laws of this country,'' an argument that continues to find many supporters among Hondurans. Wealth in Emeralds **********Officially, Mr. Matta is said to have first struck it rich when he discovered a deep vein of emeralds in the mountains of Colombia in the late 1970's. As a ''man of initiative and business vision,'' Mr. Lorenzana said, Mr. Matta ''entered the construction business, ranching and farming,'' amassing his fortune entirely through legal means. **********Mr. Matta, who is in his early 40's, grew up in a poor section of Tegucigalpa vowing to make something of himself. At the age of 16, he made his way to the United States, where, as an illegal immigrant, he worked as a farm laborer in Texas and a supermarket clerk in New York City. **********Mr. Matta was said to have been deported from the United States five times, but each time he returned with a new identity. His determination and his ability to outwit the powerful, be they Hondurans or foreigners, is another element that explains his appeal, according to Honduran politicians and foreign diplomats. 'A Honduran Type' **********''He is a very Honduran type, an Indian kid who grew up on the streets, left the country poor and came back rich,'' said Manuel Acosta Bonilla, a prominent Tegucigalpa lawyer and political leader. ''His money may not have come from the best of sources, but to many people that makes him something of an antihero, like Al Capone in the United States.'' **********Within Honduras, however, Mr. Matta has invested large amounts of money in legitimate enterprises, including hotels, cattle ranches, factories and a tobacco plantation and processing plant in Danli that employs several hundred people. In a country with the second-lowest per capita income in the hemisphere, one grappling with an economic crisis, this is enough to win Mr. Matta public esteem. **********''The only thing I am doing is creating sources of employment for thousands of Hondurans,'' Mr. Matta said in January after he was called to testify before a judge over accusations that he was an agent of the Medellin cartel. ''I employ between three and four thousand workers, and I pay them well.'' **********Outside Mr. Matta's Honduran-Cuban Tobacco Company, there was concern that his arrest would hurt the local economy. The manager of Mr. Matta's factory, a Colombian, has been deported, and although construction of a new and larger plant continues, onlookers like Santos Florencio Duarte, a peasant who lives nearby, worried that things would not be the same with Mr. Matta gone. **********''Everybody here is aware of the controversy, but we don't know how he got his money,'' Mr. Duarte said. ''All we know is that he is a good businessman and helps the poor.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/02/business/car-sales-rise-in-japan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-09-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 136, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Car Sales Rise in Japan", "print_headline": "Car Sales Rise in Japan", "body_text": " **********Sales of vehicles in Japan increased 14.5 percent in August from a year earlier, to 263,629, according to preliminary figures released today by the Japan Automobile Dealers Association.

Mr. Roh asked the nation Saturday to forgive Mr. Chun's ''misuse of state power in the past era.'' But he avoided issuing a formal legal pardon to his predecessor and political mentor, who apologized earlier for extensive wrongdoing during his rule. **********Early reaction from political leaders, and from South Koreans who turned out Saturday to watch the ritualistic weekend battle between students and riot police, suggest Mr. Roh's speech and Mr. Chun's earlier apology have so far failed in their main objective. They have done little to dampen the public's growing appetite for details of the Chun rule's corruption and brutal suppression that could still lead to the arrest of the former President. 'I Feel We Are Being Fooled' **********''The speech was insufficient to me,'' Koo Jae Hyun, a 38-year-old university professor, said Saturday as he and his young son shopped at a mall in downtown Seoul and policemen shot tear gas at protesters outside. **********''The order was wrong,'' Mr. Koo said. ''Before we talk about forgiveness we must have a full investigation. I feel we are being fooled by the Government.'' **********Much the same view was expressed by other South Koreans, who said that while they were uncertain whether Mr. Chun should be arrested, they were taken aback by Mr. Roh's suggestion that legislative hearings into the Chun administration should be ended in the next five weeks. **********Leaders of the opposition parties, who control the Legislature and thus the hearings, said after the speech that there was little chance that the gripping, televised inquiry would be wrapped up as quickly as Mr. Roh hoped. **********If so, Mr. Roh's political crisis could go on for some time. For weeks now he has been trying to separate himself from the Chun administration, and in his speech Saturday he laid out a number of reforms, including an amnesty for hundreds of political prisoners still in South Korean jails. A Threat to Current Leaders **********But in a nation whose politics remain haunted by its violent past, Mr. Roh has also been trying to quell inquiries into Mr. Chun that still pose potentially large threats to Mr. Roh and his Cabinet. The inquiries are potentially explosive because they could implicate senior Government and military officials who, like Mr. Roh himself, were intimately involved in Mr. Chun's repressive Government. **********Continued investigations, Mr. Roh suggested Saturday, could imperil South Korea's progress toward democracy and are ultimately doomed to frustration. Some details, such as Mr. Chun's handling of millions of dollars in political funds, much of it apparently extorted from businesses, will never be known, he said, adding, ''I have come to the conviction that there is no choice but to accept the former President's own explanation and put the matter to rest.'' **********Other Government officials said that Mr. Roh was hoping that if the investigations are ended and Mr. Chun is not arrested, he might be able to avoid issuing a formal pardon to his predecessor. ''It could all go away,'' a Government spokesman said. Thousands of Protesters **********But that seemed unlikely on the streets of Seoul. Thousands of students protested Saturday, largely peacefully, for the arrest of Mr. Chun. Periodically they were charged by an unusually large force of riot policemen, who forced them back with pepper gas, a mix of tear gas and a skin irritant. **********The protesters were mostly students, whose street violence, Mr. Roh said in his speech, will now ''be resolutely dealt with'' because ''law and order is directly linked to the death or survival of our democratic society.'' **********The students, however, still enjoy some measure of broader support. ''Even if we cannot joint them, in spirit we are there with them,'' Shing Kyung Sook, a 24-year-old housewife, said Saturday. Mr. Roh's speech, she said, was ''not following the people's will.'' **********''I think Chun should be arrested and bear much pain,'' she said, ''because he caused much.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/28/world/mubarak-in-us-seeks-peace-efforts.html": {"writer_name": "David Shipler", "pub_date": "1988-01-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 918, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mubarak, in U.S., Seeks Peace Efforts", "print_headline": "Mubarak, in U.S., Seeks Peace Efforts", "body_text": " **********President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt was reported today to have appealed to Secretary of State George P. Shultz to step up American peace efforts in the Middle East during this time of clashes between Palestinian Arabs and Israeli troops. **********Beginning three days of talks in Washington on military, political and economic issues, the Egyptian leader was also said to have discussed overall American and Arab strategy in the Iran-Iraq war, including possibilities for additional Egyptian and American help in the defense of Kuwait. **********Mr. Mubarak's visit, which is to include a meeting Thursday with President Reagan and Congressional leaders, comes amid a growing sense of urgency about the situation in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. **********Since early December, at least 38 Palestinians have been killed by gunfire from Israeli troops who have been trying to put down the unrest in the occupied territories. A policy announced last week of using beatings instead of live ammunition against Palestinians there has resulted in soldiers entering homes to beat Arabs and break bones. The tactics have provoked expressions of concern from some leaders of American Jewish organizations that usually give Israel unconditional support. Palestinians Meet With Shultz **********Two Palestinians met with Mr. Shultz today and gave him a letter urging that an international force be sent to protect the Arab residents of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. ''Our people are in urgent need of immediate international protection from the brutality of Israel's military authorities,'' said the letter, handed over by Hanna Siniora, editor of the East Jerusalem newspaper Al Fajr, and Fayez Abu Rahme, a prominent Gaza attorney. ''Uncivilized and oppressive measures are being employed by Israeli occupation forces to quell the just uprising of our Palestinian people.'' **********The State Department forbid photographers to take pictures of Mr. Shultz and the Palestinians. A department spokesman attributed the decision to a lack of time and denied that it was aimed at playing down the meeting. **********An interfaith group of about 500 American Jews, Moslems and Christians today announced the formation of a committee to press for Middle East peace. They issued a call for the United States to redouble its efforts and endorsed the concept of an international conference, which has been proposed by King Hussein of Jordan and accepted by the Reagan Administration. **********Although the Israeli Foreign Minister, Shimon Peres, has endorsed the idea, the Prime Minister, Yitzhak Shamir, has resisted, arguing that it would give the Soviet Union and radical Arab countries like Syria too much influence over the peace process. Group Has Dual Goals **********The group, the U.S. Interreligious Committee for Peace in the Middle East, emphasized both ''Israel's right to secure borders and peace with her neighbors,'' and ''the Palestinian people's right of self-determination.'' **********''These two goals - Israel's security and Palestinian self-determination -are mutually and inextricably interdependent,'' said Ronald J. Young, a former Middle East representative of the American Friends Service Committee, who organized the interfaith group. **********The diversity of the group was illustrated by an appearance at a news conference of Rabbi Arthur Hertzberg, professor of religion at Dartmouth College, and Al-Hajj Dawud Assad, president of the Council of Mosques, U.S.A. **********''What has been going on is not an outbreak in its own right,'' Rabbi Hertzberg declared. ''It is a symptom of 20 years of occupation.'' **********Mr. Assad survived the massacre at Deir Yassin, the Arab village near Jerusalem attacked in 1948 by fighters from Menachem Begin's Irgun Zvai Leumi underground unit and the Stern Gang. He said that despite losing 38 members of his family at Deir Yassin, ''My religious duty, my Moslem faith and Koran, tell me that we should dialogue with the People of the Book.'' Talks on Aid Programs **********In addition to the peace efforts, President Mubarak is reportedly discussing the vast United States aid program to Egypt, which has provided $13 billion in economic assistance since 1974. He met today with Secretary of Defense Frank C. Carlucci, Secretary of Agriculture Richard E. Lyng and Secretary of the Treasury James A. Baker 3d, as well as with Mr. Shultz. **********As the only Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel, Egypt enjoys a favored position in the American aid program. It will receive more than $2.2 billion this year in military and economic assistance. **********But Egypt is burdened by a military debt of $4.5 billion to the United States at interest rates of about 14 percent. American officials say Egypt will probably decline an offer for refinancing at lower interest rates because it hopes to persuade the United States to forgive the debt.  Jewish Group Affirms Support **********In New York, Morris B. Abram, chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, offered his organization's unequivocal support for Israeli policy in the occupied territories. **********''Israel has the right and responsibility to protect the security of its people and the integrity of its institutions,'' Mr. Abram said at a news conference.  He also released a telegram from Prime Minister Shamir that said ''we have not and will not'' adopt a policy of indiscriminate beatings to deal with the violence."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/29/business/briefs-585088.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-07-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 158, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Debt *********** ARCO Chemical Co. filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a shelf registration of up to $450 million of debt. *********** Western Investment Real Estate Trust is issuing $75 million of 8 percent convertible subordinated debentures priced at par and due in 2008 through Edward D.

So is the cost of hunting for a new job, going to night school or traveling to a midwinter convention in balmy Palm Beach, Fla. - provided a good business connection can be shown. **********Although job-related deductions present many people with opportunities for reducing their tax bills, such deductions are no longer so abundant. **********Wining and dining and entertaining clients is now only 80 percent deductible. And employees and executives will have a more difficult time deducting any job-related expenses on 1987 returns because of the tough new eligibility standards set by the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The miscellaneous category of itemized expenses, which includes employee business expenses, is now deductible only to the extent the expenses exceed 2 percent of adjusted gross income. **********The long list of eligible employee business expenses will help some taxpayers surmount the 2 percent threshold. And some taxpayers - the self-employed, struggling artists and the handicapped - may even be able to circumvent it. **********Self-employed taxpayers, including people with sideline businesses, may be able to get around the 2 percent deductible floor by claiming certain expenses on Schedule C, where income and deductions from sole propertiorships are reported. The 2 percent floor does not apply to Schedule C deductions. Even non-itemizers with self-employment income can take advantage of this opportunity. **********''People can claim deductions on Schedule C to the extent they can justify expenses that are properly allocable to that business,'' said Gerald Padwe, national director of tax practice at the accounting firm of Touche Ross & Company.  Special Exception Made For Performing Artists **********Performing artists may also be able to deduct their work-related expenses without regard to the 2 percent floor, and they do not have to itemize their deductions to do so. Congress provided this exception in recognition of the special situation of actors, musicians and other performers who tend to have especially large work-related expenses, such as agent commissions. The exception applies only to performing artists who had adjusted gross income last year of $16,000 or less and who meet certain other guidelines. **********The new law also allows handicapped employees to deduct all of their impairment-related work expenses. **********For taxpayers who relocated to take a new job or were reassigned by their company to a different region, the new law allows moving expenses to be claimed without regard to the 2 percent floor. Only itemizers, however, are now allowed to claim the deduction. **********Everyone else will have to search for eligible expenses to be able to get over the 2 percent threshold. Expenses that employees incur personally for their job or to enhance their professional standing are eligible. **********The Internal Revenue Service does not give employees carte blanche to deduct any expense they may have incurred on the job. Auditors have refused to allow deductions in cases where employees chose to absorb personally expenses that are normally reimbursed by the company. **********''If they are reimbursable and you choose not to put in for them for one reason or another, then the I.R.S. can argue that it's an employer's expense and you don't get any deduction at all,'' Mr. Padwe said. The courts have repeatedly sided with the I.R.S. on the issue.  A Signed Agreement Can Establish Expenses **********To safeguard job-related deductions, tax professionals suggest that executives and other employers who are expected by their company to absorb such expenses as entertaining clients should have a written agreement to that effect signed by the employer. **********The list of employee business expenses includes dues for membership in unions or professional associations, subscriptions to professional and trade publications, the cost of purchasing and cleaning uniforms, small work tools, business phone calls made from home and even the cost of renting a tuxedo to attend a business-related function. **********Hunting for a new job can be a deductible pursuit, from the cost of traveling to an interview to the expense of printing resumes and mailing them out. People hoping to switch careers will not be able to count on the deduction, however, and neither will students looking for a first job. To qualify for the deduction, the prospective job has to be in the same line of work as the taxpayer's current job. **********Going to night school can also be deductible if the courses are to maintain or improve skills required in one's present job. But if the courses are intended to qualify the student for a new career, the costs are not deductible. **********Commuting is not a deductible expense unless the worker happens to hold more than one job. In such cases, the cost of travel between the two job sites is deductible. **********Country club dues are partly deductible if the club is used for business more than half the time.  Strict Rules Put Stress On a Business Purpose **********Some of the perquisites of corporate life, like travel and entertainment costs, can also be deducted, provided a business purpose can be substantiated. But the rules are stringent. And given the potential for abuse, the I.R.S. tends to scrutinize the travel and entertainment area closely to make sure the expenses are not actually more personal than business in nature. **********Framers of the 1986 tax law concluded that entertaining customers and clients was as integral to the conduct of business in America as advertising. But the lawmakers also felt that business meals and entertainment include a measure of personal benefit. So Congress decided to limit the deduction for business meals and entertainment to 80 percent. **********Employees who are fully reimbursed by their company for such expenditures generally need not worry about the 80 percent rule. They do not have to give up 20 percent of their reimbursement to the I.R.S. Only the company loses 20 percent of the deduction. Such employees do not have to pay tax on 20 percent of their reimbursement. **********One exemption from the 80 percent limitation consists of certain banquets where a speaker is featured. Congressional tax writers, aware that politicians speak at a lot of banquets, inserted this exception. The exception expires at the end of this year, shortly after the 1988 election campaign. To qualify, the banquet has to be part of a convention, seminar or similar business meeting attended by at least 40 people, with more than half of the participants from out of town. **********Otherwise, taxpayers get only an 80 percent deduction for business meals - and they have to work harder at meal time to earn it. Under the old law, not a word of business had to come up in converstion when dining with a customer. So long as the setting was conducive to a business discussion - meaning there was no floor show - the entire conversation could have been about politics, religion or sex and the meal would still qualify for a deduction. **********Under the new law, a substantial and bona fide business discussion has to take place before, during or after the meal. This requirement has long applied to entertainment expenses. **********Of course there is no need to engage in a soliloquy when dining alone on a business trip, but the cost of the meal is still only 80 percent deductible.  Ritual of Taking Turns Picking Up Lunch Tab **********Those who made a habit of going out to lunch with business associates should think twice about writing off all the meals on their 1987 returns. The I.R.S. has no tolerance when colleagues take turns picking up the luncheon tabs and then list them as a business expense. Even when serious business discussions were involved, the courts have sided with the I.R.S. in cases where luncheon meetings with regular associates were routine. **********''If you make it a ritual, you're really looking for trouble,'' said Gerald Portney, a former associate chief counsel at the I.R.S. and now a principal at the accounting firm of Peat Marwick Main & Company. ''When you do have lunch with a business associate, make sure you have got the physical documentation to substantiate it - not only where you were, who was there and the date but also a notation as to what the business purpose was.'' **********Taking a customer to a Broadway play, a ball game or a concert can be even less than 80 percent deductible if a premium was paid for the tickets. The deduction is limited to 80 percent of the face price of the ticket. Any extra fee paid to a broker or scalper is not deductible. **********Business trips are deductible even if a bit of vacationing was added to the itinerary. But adding a bit of business to a vacation trip does not make a deductible trip. To deduct the cost of transportation, the primary purpose of the trip must be business. Overseas travel involves more stringent and more detailed guidelines.  NEXT: Interest deductions.  PHONING THE I.R.S. **********The Internal Revenue Service operates a telephone assistance program to answer taxpayer inquiries about Federal income tax returns. Taxpayers may call 800 424-1040 for information and 800 424-3676 to request tax forms.

R. Grace & Company, the American chemical concern. ''I really am sad, because they are missing an opportunity.'' **********But executives of several American companies here say there are other reasons why their sales have not soared or their prices are not much lower: *********** Many subsidiaries are not free to set their own prices and their executives say that their headquarters in the United States have been slow to allow them to cut prices in tandem with the dollar's fall. *********** American companies selling consumer products often cannot control the final prices in stores; that is up to Japanese distributors who, preferring to make more money, may not pass along American price cuts. *********** In Japan, product quality and a close relationship with customers have traditionally played a bigger role than price in winning business. *********** Many American companies manufacture their products in Japan and thus have not benefited from the weaker dollar. *********** The products of such newly industrialized Asian countries as South Korea remain much less expensive than American goods. **********These reasons help explain why imports of American products rose a modest 8.2 percent last year as measured in dollars. **********''People thought that if the yen were a little bit higher, the face of the world would change,'' said John P. Stern, a senior representative here of the United States Electronic Industry Japan, a trade association. ''But of the 350 United States electronics companies out here, I know of only one that claims substantial extra business because of the strong yen. Several say there is less pressure against Japanese competitors in the United States, and a number are doing better against them in Europe.'' **********The experiences of American companies in Japan vary widely. **********Some - such as Ore-Ida, the maker of frozen potatoes, and Advanced Micro Devices, the semiconductor manufacturer - hail the weaker dollar and believe it has helped them to compete. By allowing Advanced Micro Devices to cut prices, the weak dollar has enabled the company to increase sales of a custom semiconductor known as a programmable logic device, said James Shinn, general manager of the Japan office. **********Other American corporations -such as the Monsanto Company, which sells silicon wafers used to make semiconductors, and Ralston Purina, the pet food company - say the rise of the yen has not affected their businesses significantly. Costs in Japan Rise **********Worst off are small high-technology companies and others that have had trouble coping with the flip side of the weaker dollar: The already high cost of operating in Japan has climbed even higher in dollar terms. **********While the cost of running a modest office in Japan, with one expatriate and one secretary, used to be about $500,000 a year, Mr. Stern said, it is now about $1 million. Mr. Stern said he knew of several companies that closed their Tokyo offices as the rising yen compounded other problems, such as slack demand or difficulty in breaking into the market. **********American companies offer a number of reasons for their relatively high prices in Japan. **********The higher cost of the PS/2 personal computer reflects the higher cost of doing business in Japan, said Mac Jeffery, an I.B.M. spokesman. He noted that Japanese customers demanded such additional services as installation and testing. **********Mr. Jeffery added that the computer's price was set when the yen's value was 160 to the dollar; now it is about 128 to the dollar. Moreover, the computers that I.B.M. sells here are imported from Australia, whose currency has not fallen as much against the yen as the dollar has. Distribution System a Factor **********Other companies, such as Parker Pen, cite Japan's distribution system. Parker, which was acquired a few years ago by a British concern, imports a pen from the United States at a cost of 2,500 yen and offers it to distributors for 5,000 yen, according to Toshio Hayashi, president of Parker Pen Japan. **********But by the time the pen reaches the stores, passing through wholesalers, secondary wholesalers and retailers, its price is 10,000 yen, or $77.94. The company has cut prices by about 30 percent for many of its products and its sales have risen, but Mr. Hayashi said the key to additional price cuts rested with the distributors. **********''We are a small operation,'' he said. ''We must rely on wholesalers. ''In Japan it is very difficult just to get into the distribution system. It requires rebates, a lot of human contact and even under-the-table payments. This is really a non-tariff barrier.'' It is unclear to what extent American companies decided to keep prices relatively high to gain greater profits rather than market share. But Mr. Stern said that while some of them were simply greedy, others were making a defensible strategic decision. ''They want to make hay while the sun shines,'' he said. ''Many feel that once the Japanese make that product themselves, they'll never get any more orders, so they are trying to recoup their investment before they lose market share entirely.'' **********By contrast, many Japanese companies in the United States have chosen over the years to keep their prices low, undercutting their competitors and forgoing profits for market share. **********Grace and some other American companies that have lowered prices substantially have had no choice: Japanese customers, especially industrial concerns, have insisted on the cuts. 'We Had to Go Along' **********''We sell chemicals to automobile companies, and they are having a difficult time with the strong yen,'' said Mr. Makino of Grace Japan. ''They are conducting cost-reduction programs, and we had to go along to survive.'' **********Monsanto, which has cut the yen prices of its silicon wafers by 20 percent in the last 18 months, is one of the companies that have found that price alone does not guarantee a sale here. ''Price is fourth or fifth down the line of purchasing priorities,'' said Charles W. Cook Jr., vice president of Monsanto Japan. ''It's quality, quality and service and then relationships and then price.'' **********The strong yen has not significantly helped the competitive position of American companies that have factories in Japan. Like their Japanese competitors, the yen has made their plants more costly to operate than plants in other countries. And while imported components or raw materials may now cost them less, the same is true for their Japanese competitors. **********''The strong yen has been neutral because our competitors are benefiting'' also, said Stephen Crotty, director of marketing for Purina-Taiyo Pet Food Ltd., a Ralson Purina joint venture in Japan.

Tootsie Roll, the maker of chocolate-centered Tootsie Pops, was No. 2 in the business. **********A privately held company based in Colts Neck, N.J., Charms had sales of $38 million in 1987. Its lollipop line includes Blow Pops, which have a bubble-gum center. It also makes Charms, square candies that compete with Life Savers, and Sour Balls.'A Stronger Position' **********''We feel that this acquisition will give us a much stronger position in the hard-candy market,'' said Mrs. Gordon, Tootsie Roll's president since 1978. **********Debt-free and flush with cash, Tootsie Roll has been seeking to complement its strong growth with acquisitions, the Gordons said. **********''Our theory has been to buy the leading brands or sub-brands,'' Mr. Gordon said. ''Charms has a strong franchise and a fast-growing bubble-gum product. During the last six years the company has doubled its sales.'' **********Mrs. Gordon and her family control 48 percent of Tootsie Roll. Her father, William B. Rubin, bought control of the company in the 1930's. Mr. Gordon succeeded him as chairman and chief executive in 1962. **********Under Mr. Gordon's leadership, the company moved its center of operations to Chicago, from Hoboken, N.J., and acquired several other brands, including Mason and Bonomo hard candies and taffy in 1972 and Cella chocolate-cherry candy in 1985. **********The deal is the latest of a number of acquisitions in the candy industry. The Hershey Foods Corporation recently agreed to buy Cadbury-Schweppes P.L.C.'s United States candy business for $270 million. Earlier this year, Nestle S.A., the Swiss food conglomerate, beat Jacobs Suchard, a Swiss confectioner, in a battle for Rowntree, the British candy maker. **********Though small in comparison with such candy giants as Hershey and M & M/Mars, which control about 70 percent of the $8 billion industry, Tootsie Roll has enjoyed considerable success. **********During the last five years, Tootsie Roll has had a compound growth rate of 26 percent, with average income of 13 percent of sales and a return on equity of 21 percent, said Elliot L. Schlang, an analyst at Prescott, Ball & Turben Inc. in Cleveland. Last year, the company earned $14.5 million on sales of more than $114 million. **********''They run a tight ship; their product is superb,'' Mr. Schlang said. **********Tootsie Roll still makes a penny roll from the original formula, along with 3-cent, 5-cent, 10-cent and 40-cent versions, the Gordons said. The name Tootsie Roll was chosen by the Austrian immigrant who founded the candy company in 1892; his daughter's nickname was Tootsie. **********Although Tootsie Roll's stock dropped 75 cents, to $30.25, on the announcement of the acquisition on Tuesday, analysts agreed that the company's future was bright. The stock regained 25 cents yesterday to close at $30.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.Rising Consumption **********Americans are consuming more candy each year. Per-capita consumption has increased to 19.5 pounds from 16.1 pounds in 1980, according to the Commerce Department. **********The Gordons have four daughters, who range in age from 19 to 36.

Prime Minister Brian Mulroney signed an agreement that will give 39,000 Indians, Eskimos and people of mixed ancestry living along the boundaries of the Arctic Ocean ownership of an area the size of Texas. **********The agreement, signed today at Fort Rae, in the Northwest Territories, was part of what has been described as the biggest land transaction since the Alaska and Louisiana purchases in the 19th century. **********In all, the nonwhite people living in Canada's north are expected to gain title to 260,000 square miles, about 7 percent of the land area of Canada, the largest country in the world after the Soviet Union. Voice in Development **********The agreements would give the nonwhites a strong voice in the development of another 1.1 million square miles in northern Canada, nearly 30 percent of the country's total area of 3.8 million square miles. The accord would cede control of the land for ''traditional'' activities like hunting and trapping. **********Nonwhites will have a major role in setting the terms for mineral development, including the search for oil and gas. **********As a crowd of 500 Indians swayed to the beat of drums, Mr. Mulroney described today's agreement as the start of a new era in relations between Canada's majority population and its nonwhite minority, which makes up 500,000 of the country's 25.5 million people. **********''Decades from now, Canadians generally and northerners in particular will point with pride to this event today as one that contributed to the evolution of Canada as a land of fairness and justice,'' Mr. Mulroney said. Plagues of Troubles **********Among nonwhites, the settlement of the land issue is regarded as a landmark in the battle against the troubling levels of alcoholism, broken families and illiteracy that have plagued the Indians in the north. **********''Once we have our own land, we can make a start on regaining the dignity of our peoples,'' said Stephen Kakfwi, one of the Indian leaders who pushed the hardest for today's agreement. **********The agreements will have a far-reaching effect on the Canadian north, an area that has a major influence on the country's national character, including its art, literature and poetry. But the complicated and drawn-out deal between Ottawa and the nonwhites has attracted only passing attention in the southern parts of the country, where more than 90 percent of Canadians live. **********Negotiations leading to the land settlements have dragged on for more than a decade. They began after the nonwhites won a series of court rulings that led the Government of Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau to discuss granting large chunks of Canada to the Indians and Eskimos. Huge Tract for Indians **********The deal signed by Mr. Mulroney involves 13,000 Indians and people of mixed Indian and European ancestry who live in an area stretching from the northern boundaries of Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia to the Arctic Ocean. **********Although details remain to be worked out, the agreement granted the Indians and other nonwhites title to more than 70,000 square miles of land and a cash settlement over 20 years of more than $400 million. **********Under an accord concluded earlier this summer, the 6,500 Indians in the Yukon will gain title to nearly 16,000 square miles of land and receive a cash settlement of nearly $200 million. **********This follows a deal made in 1984, when 35,000 square miles of land and $150 million in cash went to 2,500 Eskimos living along the rim of the Arctic Ocean, where the borders of the Northwest Territories and the Yukon meet. Large Eskimo Deal **********The largest deal of all, still being negotiated, is expected next spring. That will settle the claims of 17,000 Eskimos who live elsewhere in the Northwest Territories, in the vast terrain that includes almost all of Canada's Arctic islands. As sketched out by officials who have been conducting the talks, that deal would grant the Eskimos 136,000 square miles of territory and $525 million in cash. **********The land settlements have run parallel to other talks in which Government officials are trying to settle land claims by Indian groups in the southern part of the country, mainly in Alberta and British Columbia. But the amount of land at stake in those talks, while substantial, is far smaller than the area being granted to the nonwhites in the north. **********There has been much bitterness surrounding the effort to settle the northern claims. Many whites in the Northwest Territories, who slightly outnumber the nonwhites as a percentage of the overall population, oppose any special privileges for the indigenous people. A Push for More?  And some nonwhites, including William Erasmus, president of the Assembly of First Nations, an umbrella group representing the country's Indians and people of mixed race, have vowed to use the talks on fixing the details of the settlements, including the exact areas to which the nonwhites would gain title, to push for still larger areas of land. **********Negotiations will continue on unresolved issues, including the demand by the indigenous people for an end to the stewardship exercised by the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and the establishment of full rights of self-government for nonwhite groups. **********It is unclear how these demands will be reconciled with another long-term vision in the north, the granting of provincial status to the Yukon and Northwest Territories, which are under the control of Ottawa."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/04/business/business-forum-venture-capital-individual-investors-need-tax-breaks.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Patricof", "pub_date": "1988-12-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1068, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Individual Investors Need Tax Breaks", "print_headline": "BUSINESS FORUM: VENTURE CAPITAL; Individual Investors Need Tax Breaks", "body_text": " **********When I entered the venture capital industry in the late 1960's, it was largely an investment vehicle for wealthy individuals willing to make risky investments in exchange for profits and a lower capital-gains rate. **********Since then, venture capital has blossomed into a $30 billion industry, with money coming primarily from institutional investors. This industry provided America's high-growth companies with nearly $4 billion in financing in 1987 alone. Along the way, venture capital financed innovations in computers, medicine, biotechnology and communications that contributed so much to this country's recent economic vitality. But in the process we've lost an important ingredient, the involvement of the individual investor. **********Individual investors started to move away from a primary role in venture capital during the 1970's. Large institutional investors were better able to meet an increased demand for capital at the early stages of a venture investment - the start-up phase. At the same time, individual investors gradually moved from the start-up phase to an expanded role on the ''back end,'' where shares of emerging growth companies are sold in initial public offerings. **********It was a good system. Not only could you finance companies privately, but, as recently as 1983, you could take companies into the initial public offering market with very short track records and little or no revenues but strong growth potential. Interest in initial public offerings kept individual investors involved at an earlier stage than they are today while still supplying entrepreneurs with the capital needed to start companies and develop new technologies. **********But all that changed with the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The elimination of the capital-gains tax differential removed any incentive for individuals to make early-stage investments, even on the back end of a venture investment. As a result, the new-issue market for young companies, which had been in decline since 1983, slowed to a trickle. The stock market crash of October 1987 only accelerated the move by individual investors away from speculative initial stock offerings to less risky securities that pay attractive dividends or interest. **********The lack of a viable initial public offering market is only the most obvious symptom of a larger problem. A company needs capital most when it has the least to offer in revenues and earnings - not to mention products. But that is when professional venture capitalists have traditionally been most active and when the risks and rewards are greatest. **********But in today's environment, a company has few opportunities to find other sources of capital until it has proven itself. As a result, the venture capitalist has to determine from the start whether he is prepared to take the company through its entire growth cycle. Given the less than vibrant new-issue market for early-stage companies, that cycle may be a long one. **********This has unintended consequences. Not only does it place a burden on start-up activity, it results in high-growth companies selling out to larger companies. **********Unfortunately, this set of circumstances means that the riskiest investments are less likely to be made and that the number of high-growth companies is likely to be lower. It also means that new technologies may remain unexplored altogether. **********If we are to remain competitive in world markets in the 1990's, we need to bring the individual investor back into early-stage investments - both on the front and back ends. **********A first step could be targeted tax credits. A tax credit of, say, $25,000 or 25 percent of the individual investor's tax liability - whichever is less - would mean that risk-taking individuals would no longer have to wait years until a company either paid off or showed a loss to recover a portion of their investment. **********The same kind of tax-credit incentive, within certain size limits, could encourage corporations to get research and development projects out of the lab and into commercial development by setting up companies in which individual investors held 80 percent or more of the equity. A further incentive for both corporations and individual investors would be a lower tax rate on gains when early-stage investments are sold. **********There would have to be some restrictions on these tax incentives. These restrictions might be limited to investments in companies that are no more than five years old, and they might also require investors to hold these investments for at least one year to obtain favorable capital-gains treatment. **********An alternative strategy would be a capital-gains rate indexed to decline the longer an investment is held. That way, investments in early-stage companies, which take longer to mature, would not be penalized. Another incentive would be to delay payment of capital gains if the profits are reinvested in another young company - much as profits on the sale of a house are not taxed immediately if they are used to purchase a new home. **********These are not radical solutions to the problem of bringing back the individual investor to the venture capital market. Until 1986, capital gains were taxed at a lower rate and companies did receive tax credits for plant and equipment investments. **********These incentives would carry a cost, of course. But in the long run, the tax revenues from the development of new companies and new jobs should more than offset the immediate cost of these reforms. **********I realize there are some who will say that the budget deficit will not allow such creativity. Perhaps not, but it is ironic that one of the remaining tax incentives is the deductibility of interest costs which makes leveraged buy-outs a highly desirable financing technique. While buyouts have made important contributions to strengthening the productivity of American business, they essentially reallocate ownership of mature businesses. It is young companies that will produce the jobs and technologies of the future. **********It comes down to a hard economic choice: Either do something to create an environment in which investors again begin to think long-term, or risk being passed by other countries in the development of new products like higher-temperature superconductors, pharmaceuticals, neural computers and other forefront technologies.

In response, the Pentagon is beginning to argue for broad industrial policies that would benefit high-technology industries as a whole, hoping that the rewards would reach sectors of the economy that directly serve the military. **********Richard DeLauer, who was Under Secretary of Defense for research, development and engineering during the first half of the Reagan Administration, said in an interview today that, although he attended dozens of interagency meetings on industrial policy while he was in office, he never felt that he exerted much influence in his role as a Pentagon representative. **********''I don't think our influence was as strong as it should be,'' said Dr. DeLauer, who participated in the science board study. ''I don't think the security issue is adequately represented.'' **********At the same time, he warned that the Pentagon should not assume that a national industrial policy would solve the Pentagon's problems. **********A widely held aversion to political control of the economy is just one element that could stand in the way of the new thinking. Other resistance is likely to be encountered from Government agencies that now control economic policy as well as among Pentagon bureaucrats who favor the status quo, according to Defense Science Board members. **********But Dr. DeLauer said the new approach, while no panacea, has important implications because the Presidential candidates, Michael S. Dukakis and George Bush, are seeking ways to bolster national security without increasing military spending. **********''Both candidates, in my view, could make a lot out of it if they bothered to acquaint themselves with it,'' Dr. DeLauer said. In the election campaign, Governor Dukakis has made more of a point than Vice President Bush of linking economic policy to national security. **********The Pentagon's own studies of economic security have, at times, echoed Mr. Dukakis's themes. A Pentagon report in July disputed ''the most common view,'' which is held by Mr. Bush, that foreign investment benefits the United States because it creates jobs in this country. That view, the Pentagon report declared, overlooks the fact that foreign owners tend to maintain control over critical manufacturing technologies. **********The new report by the Defense Science Board warns the Pentagon: ''We are, and will remain, dependent on foreign resources for critical components of our weapon systems. We cannot eliminate foreign dependency in this era of a globalized defense industry. We can and must eliminate the apparent loss of leadership in key defense technologies.'' **********Rather than calling for costly programs to sponsor research or investment programs directly, the board called for linking economic policies to military strategies. **********In addition to the formation of an Industrial Policy Council, the report also specifically said that the Defense Secretary should be made a permanent member of the the Economic Policy Council, the Cabinet's group for making economic policy. **********In a letter accompanying the report, which was written by the panel during meetings this summer, the head of the group, Mr. Fuhrman, said its ''foremost recommendation'' was to enact policies that would bridge the gap between the nation's military strategy, which emphasizes technical superiority, and the ability of industries to maintain a technological advantage. **********Among the panel members were William J. Perry, a former senior defense official who is now an investment banker at Hambrecht & Quist in San Francisco; Norman R. Augustine, a senior executive at the Martin Marietta Corporation, and John Deutch, who is provost of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. **********The themes in the advisory panel's study were also expressed in the July report by the office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Robert B. Costello. Like many of the other studies, it found ''serious indications of decline in sectors of the industrial base that are fundamentally important to national security and to continued American leadership in advanced technologies.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/26/business/key-rates-795088.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-03-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 190, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "KEY RATES", "print_headline": "KEY RATES", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/25/business/business-people-iroquois-brands-chief-resigns-and-sells-stake.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1988-05-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 437, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Iroquois Brands Chief Resigns and Sells Stake", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Iroquois Brands Chief Resigns and Sells Stake", "body_text": " **********Terence J.

Nicaragua has done little, while El Salvador and Guatemala are just beginning to collect comprehensive data and identify carriers. **********The first known case here, that of a homosexual dentist from San Pedro Sula in northern Honduras, was diagnosed only three years ago. Dr. Enrique Jose Zelaya, the chief epidemiologist for the Honduran Ministry of Health, said investigators found that the dentist became infected with the AIDS virus in San Francisco, which he visited eight times in the two years before his diagnosis, and that he spread it here among his sexual partners. 'Getting More Dangerous' **********Since then doctors have confirmed 182 more cases, about 75 percent of them in the area around the town where the dentist lives. Dr. Zelaya estimated that there could be 14,000 cases within the next three years - if the disease's geometric rate of progression is not reduced. **********''It's very serious and getting more dangerous,'' said Dr. Zelaya, coordinator of the National Commission on AIDS. **********Public health authorities, who met here recently in the region's first conference on AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, said they have confirmed 122 other cases in Central America. Since efforts to track the disease are just starting, they say there are probably far more undiagnosed cases. **********Unlike the United States, where the disease strikes homosexuals in disproportionate numbers, 70 percent of the Honduran AIDS victims say they are heterosexual, public health authorities say. The spread of the disease seems to follow the pattern set in Africa, where heterosexual intercourse is considered a primary mode of transmission. **********Dr. Zelaya noted that genital infections and sores are several times more common in Central America than in the United States, and he said he thought such infections might ''open the door to the virus.'' He said studies show that almost 65 percent of the AIDS victims are men. **********Several doctors at the AIDS conference said discrimination against homosexuals in Latin America may prevent homosexual AIDS victims from acknowledging that they are homosexuals. Problem of a 'Macho Culture' **********''Homosexuality is as prevalent here as in any other country, but it's not acknowledged because of the stigma in the traditional Latin macho culture,'' said Dr. Leonardo Mata, a virologist and chairman of the Costa Rican National AIDS Commission. **********Medical officials in the region note that some aspects of Latin culture contribute to the spread of the disease. Male promiscuity is widely considered a point of pride even among married men, and there is almost no tradition of donating blood, except to family members. **********Patients get blood by buying it. Hoping to sell their blood, 50 or more raggedly dressed donors line up on most mornings outside the maternity and infant hospital in downtown Tegucigalpa. When they are lucky enough to find a customer, they earn $12.50 a pint, a small fortune in this country, one of the hemisphere's poorest. **********''We are totally dependent on blood sales,'' Dr. Zelaya said. Until July, however, only 4 of the 21 public hospitals screened blood for AIDS. The United States Agency for International Development has paid for a $350,000 testing program, which has tripled the number of hospitals screening blood. But many of the country's rural clinics and private hospitals still do not test for the virus's antibodies. **********That has allowed the virus to spread unchecked. A recent study by the Ministry of Health found almost 4 percent of the samples tested in San Pedro Sula contained antibodies to the AIDS virus, considered a sign of infection with the virus. A Mistake Is Suspected **********Some officials suspect that there was a mistake in this study. The study in Tegucigalpa found that 0.38 percent of the samples contained AIDS antibodies, only a tenth of what was found in San Pedro Sula. The lower number is still considered an extremely high rate of infection. **********That has led to concern that the disease will spread to epidemic proportions. Encouraged by the Agency for International Development, Honduras has responded by increasing spending on programs to promote monogamy and condom use. **********The educational pioneer in the region has been Dr. Mata, the Costa Rican. Using mostly private money, he has distributed over a million copies of a translated pamphlet, ''Don't Die of Ignorance.'' **********But Dr. Mata acknowledges that the program has failed to reach high-risk groups like homosexuals and prostitutes. ''In some cases we haven't even tried,'' he said. ''Then there is also the fear of alienating the Catholic Church by advocating the use of condoms.'' **********Dr. Tito Alvarado, a Honduran specialist on infectious and tropical diseases, said the region's governments face almost unconquerable hurdles in the fight against the disease. **********''The level of sex education is almost nil,'' he said. ''We're thinking about how to approach these people, but at the moment we don't know how. There's widespread ignorance. Even doctors think that AIDS is transmitted by everything and are panicking.

At Issue: How to Deliver Aid **********Negotiators for both sides say this round of talks has centered on the question of what changes are needed in Nicaragua to persuade the contras to lay down their weapons and rejoin civilian life. In addition, they are discussing ways to deliver food, clothing and medicine to contra fighters during the current cease-fire. **********Sandinista officials wanted the aid to be delivered by the International Committee of the Red Cross. The contras have rejected that proposal, and the two sides appear to be nearing agreement to allow the Pan American Development Foundation, an arm of the Organization of American States, to deliver the aid. **********Contra leaders have maintained that they will not agree to prolong the cease-fire beyond this week if no accord is reached here. **********Negotiators said the question of giving the opposition access to Nicaraguan television, which is now a Sandinista monopoly, was also discussed today. The Government said it is willing to allow the opposition to broadcast programs on existing channels, but not to open a new channel.

Workers are putting final touches to the building, which is a block from North Broadway and Main Street, at 10 Stewart Place, as the first buyers move in. **********The developer, RAD Properties of Boston, purchased the site in 1986 from Caspi Development of Armonk, N.Y., which created the luxury urban concept in a suburban setting.

Apartment layouts have unusual angles and shapes rather than the typical rectangular layout. Corner residences have large curved expanses of glass. **********The layouts are designed to be flexible. An entrance foyer, for example, can serve as a dining area, and the area intended as a dining alcove can be turned into a den or study. Each apartment has a balcony. **********Sales, which began a year ago, were greatly depressed by last October's stock market crash, said Basel R. Dalloul, the managing director of RAD Properties. But recently interest has picked up, he said. **********Buyers of the 80 units that have been sold are an even mix of young professionals, many of whom commute to Manhattan, and of older couples who have sold houses in the community and now want security and services. **********The building will be run somewhat like a luxury hotel, with a concierge to provide a wide range of services from arranging for theater tickets to storing deliveries of groceries. **********But the key feature at Stewart Place, according to the developers, is the 5,000-square-foot penthouse health club with its 36-by-15-foot indoor swimming pool, whirlpool, sauna, lounge and outdoor sun decks. The club was designed and will be professionally managed by the Manhattan-based American Leisure Corporation. The cost is included in the common charges, which range from $225 to $543. **********The lowest-priced, 780-square-foot, one-bedroom, one-bath apartment is $171,900. Two-bedroom, two-bath, 1,175-square-foot units start at $231,900, and prices go as high as $490,500 for a three-bedroom, three-bath, 1,888-square-foot penthouse. There is underground parking for 263 cars. One space is included in the price of each unit, and extra spaces are available for $12,000 each. **********Opinions are divided as to how much of a market there is in White Plains for what developers call ''Manhattan style'' buildings. Edward Steinberg, the city's Commissioner of Planning, says luxury buildings with lavish amenities have limited appeal because of their cost. **********Around the corner from Stewart Place, Michael DeNigris of Woodside, Queens, stays with tradition and promotes lower maintenance costs. **********His development, a brick, 71-unit, six-story condominium, 21 Lake Street, ''is being built like a 1950's brownstone with 14-inch-thick masonry walls that won't need repair for a hundred years,'' he said. **********The layouts offer large kitchens and lots of closets that will appeal to people who are selling houses, Mr. DeNigris said. The units are also intended to attract young couples who prefer to find amenities like a pool in the community at lower cost. **********The Lake Street building has a security system, a doorman and heated indoor parking. A 749-square-foot studio starts at $157,000, and a one-bedroom, one-and-a-half bath, 760-square-foot unit begins at $167,900. The most expensive unit, a two-bedroom, two-bath, 1,681-square-foot apartment, is $330,900. Common charges range from $138 to $283. **********Sales began nine months ago.

''Now he has neither so they have a mutual interest in joining forces.'' **********Mid-level talks aimed at a reconciliation between the P.L.O. and Syria have been under way for a year, but another envoy here said the ''Syrians are playing a fairly cynical game because there is a lot more in it for the P.L.O. than for Assad.''

Mr. Charles's statement said: ''Although, because of the fragmented and scattered nature of the wreckage, the investigation of the structural aspect of the accident is a slow process, no evidence of a structural failure has so far been found.

Under the new crackdown the army has beaten hundreds of Palestinian men, women and children with clubs, fists and rifle butts over the last few days in a new, officially declared policy of force intended to put a halt to a month and a half of unrest in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. **********Soldiers have been going from house to house beating people in the sealed-off refugee districts of Rafa, Khan Yunis, Nusseit and Jabaliya in the Gaza Strip, according to foreign relief workers and Palestinian residents. **********Scores of Palestinians were reportedly beaten in the Nablus area of the West Bank today, and in Ramallah on Wednesday, as the army sought to force striking shops to open. 'They Just Beat Anybody' **********''People are really terrified,'' a Western relief worker in Gaza said by telephone tonight. ''This is the most effective thing they've done yet. They just beat anybody who is in their way.'' **********''The first priority is to use force, might, beatings,'' Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said of the new policy. **********Palestinians and foreign relief workers in refugee districts say the policy appears to have been in effect for about a week, resulting in hundreds of beatings, some in street clashes and others in house-to-house searches. But it is only in the last few days that it has been publicly articulated by officials and commented upon in the press. **********The newspaper Davar quoted a senior military official in the areas as saying, ''There is much sensitivity in the Israeli Defense Forces to the possibility that the orders given to the soldiers - to use force and even to hit - during the demonstrations may serve as a precedent which can be misunderstood by the soldiers, and it can develop further and cause aggressive tendencies in military people.'' **********In the Jabaliya refugee district in Gaza, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency's medical clinic treated 52 people, 5 of whom had to be hospitalized, for bruises, cuts that needed stitches, and fractures after house-to-house beatings on Tuesday, according to the acting director of United Nations projects in the area, Angela Williams. 'Savage Brutality' **********On Wednesday the clinic treated 27 more people after another round of beatings. The injured included a 65-year-old man who was hospitalized with broken bones, and several women, including one 60 years old, and a 12-year-old girl. **********Ms. Williams quoted the physician in charge, Dr. Samir Badri, as saying he was ''shocked by the savage brutality.'' **********''Its quite clear that it was house to house because we have as many as four or five people from the same family, and we have the blocks where they live,'' Ms. Williams said. **********Two other Western relief workers reported seeing a jeep full of soldiers stopping a youth who appeared to be between 12 and 14 years old on Gaza City's main street two nights ago. They said they saw one of the troops order the youth to put his right hand against a metal signpost, then strike it hard with his police nightstick. **********Defense Minister Rabin, outlining his policy the other day, said ''no demonstrators have died from being thwacked by soldiers dispersing riots in the areas.'' **********Indeed, one goal of the strategy, along with that of declaring curfews and military zones closed to journalists, appears to be to avoid what is described here as the negative image being created by foreign press coverage. **********By stopping the use of firearms, the army has stopped the daily death toll, which had been a staple of the coverage. At least 38 Palestinians have been killed since the protests started last month. Avoiding Television Cameras **********The beatings usually occur in the sealed off areas, frequently at night, thus avoiding television coverage that is regarded by the Government as particularly harmful. **********''We've gone in with force, beating without playing games - but without using arms,'' Mr. Rabin said. ''From this no one has died yet, and we also have fewer injured. I prefer a photo of curfew over shooting, burning tires and petrol bombs.'' **********The army commander in the occupied West Bank, Gen. Avram Mitzna, said, ''The use of force to disperse demonstrations has proved itself.'' **********''When there are demonstrations like today, when young people go into the streets and prevent merchants from opening their stores, we will grab whom we can and some of them will be beaten,'' General Mitzna said, adding: **********''They'll have to understand that they can't get up at 9 or 10 A.M. and make stone-throwing and tire-burning their national sport and expect no consequences.'' **********The newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth described the new policy as ''focal treatment, meaning using a lot of force in the same place, beating inciters, forcing merchants to open their businesses and forcing youngsters to clean the village or neighborhood of stones, blockades and burned tires.'' The New Tactic **********A military correspondent for The Jerusalem Post, Joshua Brilliant, wrote that the military had decided that beatings would be more effective than arresting demonstrators. He wrote: **********''A detainee sent to Fara'a Prison will be freed in 18 days unless the authorities have enough evidence to charge him. He may then resume stoning soldiers. But if troops break his hand, he won't be able to throw stones for a month and a half.'' **********''It is unclear how legal such actions are,'' Mr. Brilliant said, adding, ''some soldiers still don't have riot control equipment and are presumably expected to kick Palestinians and hit them with bare fists and rifle butts.'' **********Mr. Brilliant said the new tactic - following on successive strategies centered on the use of rubber bullets and tear gas, the arrest of about 2,000 Palestinians, and putting refugee centers under curfew - indicated ''clearly the defense establishment is at a loss as to how to quell the uprising.'' **********The newspaper Hadashot quoted soldiers today as saying their commanders had been instructing them in the use of clubs and that they had been getting what one described as ''professional advice'' from the paramilitary border police. Only a few weeks ago the army said it was investigating the border police for running roughshod through the Balata refugee district. **********''We handle the clubs just as we do the ammunition,'' one soldier was quoted as saying.

At first, company officials said that the 55-year-old executive had died of ''a sudden illness.'' But when newspapers here reported that Mr. Kairamo took his own life, Nokia executives did not deny it. Then, with concern from investors growing, the company issued a brief statement insisting that his ''death was unconnected with Nokia's business.'' **********Mr. Kairamo's legacy is a risky corporate plan that has increased Nokia's sales an estimated 60 percent this year, to $5.4 billion, mainly on the strength of two major acquisitions. The company is betting that it can thrive in the cutthroat field of consumer electronics against a powerful group of European and Japanese rivals. So far, the big acquisitions have proved difficult to swallow, with pretax profits expected to drop about 40 percent, to $173 million. New Chief Executive **********Responsibility for Nokia's performance is now shouldered mainly by Simo Vuorilehto, the new chairman and chief executive. Mr. Vuorilehto, 58, rose within Nokia from the paper business and had been chief operating officer and Mr. Kairamo's right-hand man since 1986. He is described as a quiet, hardworking executive who lacks Mr. Kairamo's flamboyance and strategic flair. In the view of some analysts, he may be just what Nokia needs these days. **********''Kairamo was the visionary guy and Vuorilehto was the one who made things work,'' said Gerald Nordberg, chairman of Nordberg Capital Inc., a small New York-based investment bank that specializes in Scandinavian companies. ''And for the next couple of years, with Nokia having bitten off so much, Vuorilehto is the right guy for the task they face.'' **********Nokia is one of many Scandinavian corporations trying to become entrenched within the European Community in preparation for the full integration of the 12-nation community at the end of 1992. **********Nokia has two main goals. It wants to insure that as a corporation from a country that is not part of the European Community it will not be shut out when the community begins the march toward a barrier-free market in 1992. And it wants to build up a Pan-European manufacturing and marketing base to take advantage of the unifying European market. Expansion Began in the 70's **********The company's move from its origins as a pulp mill in the northern Finnish city of Nokia 123 years ago into an electronics powerhouse began in the 1970's with a series of relatively small steps. It acquired several modest-sized companies, began to supply components to major computer makers and entered emerging businesses, like mobile telephones. **********In recent years, Nokia's shift to electronics and foreign markets has accelerated, mostly because of growth in the mobile telephone business and its acquisition of several Scandinavian consumer electronics companies. Today, for example, the company's Nokia-Mobira unit is estimated to be the world's largest producer of mobile telephones, with roughly 13 percent of the global market, slightly ahead of the Motorola Corporation of the United States and the Nippon Electric Corporation of Japan. **********In the United States, Nokia-Mobira's mobile phones are marketed mainly through a joint venture with the Tandy Corporation and sold under the Radio Shack label. Indeed, many of the Finnish company's products are sold under an array of brand names, which is why the Nokia name is not better known internationally. Big Moves in Past Year **********Nokia's biggest moves have come in the last year. Last December, Nokia announced that it was acquiring West Germany's Standard Elektrik Lorenz A.G., a large manufacturer of color televisions and video recorders, for an undisclosed price. The West German purchase more than doubled Nokia's television production, to 2.2 million a year. **********Today, Nokia is the ninth-largest maker of television sets in the world and third in Europe, trailing Philips N.V. of the Netherlands and Thomson S.A. of France. **********Last January, Nokia took over the data systems business of Ericsson A.B., the big Swedish electronics company. The acquisition of Ericsson's production and marketing operations for personal computers, data terminals and minicomputers makes Nokia Data the largest computer company in Scandinavia and the seventh largest in Europe, with numerous business and banking customers. Challenge of Standard Elektrik **********Analysts believe that it will be easier for Nokia to digest the Ericsson operations than Standard Elektrik. The Swedish computer business seems to mesh nicely with Nokia, and Ericsson did a lot of streamlining before it sold out. The transformation of Standard Elektrik into the core of a Pan-European television maker, however, appears to be a far greater challenge. **********Standard Elektrik is almost entirely German in its management and market reach and is saddled with a couple of inefficient operations, notably an out-of-date television tube factory in Esslingen, outside Stuttgart, West Germany, said Brian Knox, an analyst for Kleinwort Grieveson & Company in London. **********The cost and difficulty of trying to prod the suddenly bloated consumer electronics business into shape accounts for Nokia's drop in profits this year. Company executives predict that the consumer electronics business will return to profitability by 1990, but analysts question that forecast. 'A Lot of Skepticism' **********''Nokia has expanded that electronics business dramatically overnight,'' said Mr. Nordberg of Nordberg Capital. ''And there is a lot of skepticism that Nokia can turn it around quickly.'' **********Despite the skepticism of outsiders, Mr. Vuorilehto insists that the strategy laid down by Mr. Kairamo was the right course. And he dismisses the view, even held by some within the Nokia ranks, that perhaps Mr. Kairamo went too far too fast. **********In an interview, Mr. Vuorilehto described a European television industry that is undergoing rapid change. Production, he said, is consolidating into fewer hands in preparation for 1992 and increased competition from Asian manufacturers. At the same time, there is the prospect that satellite television in Europe, which is just beginning, will vastly increase programming available to viewers and thus increase the demand for televisions. Very few European households have more than one television set. Confidence of New Chief **********In that context, Mr. Vuorilehto explained: ''We had to move quickly. We had no choice because the outside world is changing so rapidly. We needed the resources.'' **********''I believe we have made the right decision,'' he added, ''and it will be successful.'' **********The key will be how adept Nokia proves to be in meshing the various segments of the consumer electronics business into a single unit with a Pan-European approach to manufacturing, marketing and parts sourcing. **********''The challenge for Nokia will be in integrating the national corporations or fiefdoms, and that will be no mean task,'' said Eric Friberg, director of the consultants McKinsey & Company in Brussels. ''For it is only after you have done that successfully that you reap the benefits of an integrated European market.'' **********To accelerate that process, Nokia has moved the headquqarters of its consumer electronics business to Geneva and hired Jacques Noels, a senior executive recruited from Thomson, to run it."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/17/world/new-mafia-drive-seen-in-sicily-ex-mayor-s-death.html": {"writer_name": "Roberto Suro", "pub_date": "1988-01-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 763, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Mafia Drive Seen in Sicily Ex-Mayor's Death", "print_headline": "New Mafia Drive Seen in Sicily Ex-Mayor's Death", "body_text": " **********A former Mayor of Palermo was shot to death on a crowded city street this week in what officials say is a signal that the Mafia has taken the offensive again, less than a month after a mass trial convicted 338 defendants of Mafia crimes. **********The victim, Giuseppe Insalaco, who was mayor for just four months in 1984 before resigning with a dramatic denunciation of city hall corruption, had provided investigators with important information about links between the Mafia and powerful Sicilian politicians, according to his associates.  [ La Repubblica, a Rome newspaper, reported Saturday that a prosecutor has asked a judge to indict four former mayors of Palermo on corruption charges based in part on information gained from papers belonging to Mr. Insalaco. The four were identified as Vito Ciancimino, Giacomo Marchello, Carmelo Scoma and Nello Martellucci. ]  Mr. Insalaco, 46 years old, was driving in rush hour traffic in Palermo on Tuesday when two men on a motorscooter hit him with four shots from heavy-caliber pistols, the police said. **********Four other Mafia killings have been committed in Palermo since a verdict was reached in the Mafia maxi-trial, as the mass trial has became known, on Dec. 16, according to the police. **********Today, a policeman charged with killing a Mafia suspect in custody was killed in Palermo. The policeman, Natale Mondo, 36, was shot as he raised the metal shutters of a toy shop run by his wife. The killers escaped in a car. **********The police said the three other recent victims were all men suspected of belonging to underworld clans, while Mr. Insalaco was the first prominent citizen to be killed since before the trial began in February 1986. **********At a judicial ceremony in Palermo, Prosecutor General Vincenzo Pajno said that for a time Mafia bosses had forbidden major crimes ''to avoid repercussions in the maxi-trial,'' but that this inhibition had now passed. **********Abdon Alinovi, president of a parliamentary commission that investigated the Mafia until its mandate was allowed to run out last year, said the killing of Mr. Insalaco was an ''alarming sign'' that ''the Mafia has reorganized itself and is probably undertaking a new strategy.'' **********In recent months Sicilian magistrates have speculated that a new leadership has taken over the Mafia to replace the men who were jailed as a result of the maxi-trial. **********One sign of this came last Saturday, when unknown gunmen killed a cousin of Michele Greco, who was convicted in the maxi-trial of ordering multiple homicides as the supreme boss of the Sicilian Mafia. Such a killing would have been unthinkable when Mr. Greco was exercising his full authority. **********The trial focused on clan wars, the heroin trade to the United States and the killings of Government officials in the early 1980's. Later investigations have turned to the more delicate subject of the Mafia's link to Sicily's political establishment, especially the Christian Democratic Party, which is the largest party in Italy and on the island. **********Mr. Insalaco, himself a Christian Democrat, became Mayor on April 13, 1984, during a move to clean up Palermo politics. He resigned 94 days later, complaining publicly that he did not have enough support from his own party or other political forces to halt corruption in the awarding of city contracts to local companies that provided services like street maintenance. His successor, Elda Pucci, who also had a brief, frustrating tenure, said this week that Mr. Insalaco went before the parliamentary anti-Mafia commission in 1984 and ''accused certain powerful political figures of Mafia involvement, and there began his decline.'' **********In 1985 an anonymous letter to the Palermo prosecutor detailed Mr. Insalaco's role in a corrupt land sale in the late 1970's. He was arrested and briefly jailed and was to go on trial this year. **********Testimony from Mr. Insalaco helped produce the indictment of Vito Ciancimino, another former Mayor, who is the first important figure in the Christian Democratic Party to be charged with a Mafia crime, according to investigators. Mr. Ciancimino will be one of about 125 defendants in a Mafia trial due to begin in the spring that will focus on political corruption."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/26/business/public-services-found-better-if-private-agencies-compete.html": {"writer_name": "Louis Uchitelle", "pub_date": "1988-04-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1624, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Public Services Found Better If Private Agencies Compete", "print_headline": "Public Services Found Better If Private Agencies Compete", "body_text": " **********One of the most promoted economic ideas of the 1980's holds that private companies can provide public services more efficiently than government. **********But those with experience in ''privatizing'' services in the United States, mostly local governments, are now reaching a different conclusion: The key to efficient public services is not replacing government agencies but pitting them against companies in continual competition. **********For example, Phoenix, a pioneer in privatization, has cut garbage-collection costs by forcing its sanitation department to compete against companies. The private sector had the edge in the early 1980's, but the sanitation department has regained it: This month the department outbid Waste Management Inc., the last company collecting trash in the city. **********In Florida, the commissioners of Bay County, dissatisfied with the way the sheriff's office ran the county jail, invited outsiders to bid for the job. The Corrections Corporation of America won with an offer of $26 a day per prisoner. The sheriff's best offer was $36. **********The Tallahassee, Fla., fire department tried to raise the fees it charged to respond to alarms in surrounding Leon County. But when the county commissioners sought bids from the Rural/Metro Corporation, the department lowered its rate increase and expanded its services. 'It's the Competition' **********''It isn't that the private sector or the public sector is better; it's the competition between the two of them that works,'' said John D. Donahue, a public policy expert at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. **********Geoffrey Bogart, an official of the International City Management Association, an organization of appointed officials, added, ''Contracting, in many cases, is turning out to be a useful tool in providing cost-effective services.'' **********So far, the experience with privatization has been mostly in contracting services from business at the county and municipal level. The next big step could be giving to families some state funds now used for public school education or to build public housing. Under this scenario, parents would pick what they considered the best school for their child, public or private. That school would get their state money. In housing, state money would go toward rental of a home anywhere in a city. **********Privatization might never get this far. But it has clearly gained a foothold after a decade of experimentation. While garbage collection is the service most opened up to competition, the pri-vate sector has become involved in many others in hundreds of cities. These include data processing, firefighting, vehicle maintenance, street light repair, hospital management and park maintenance. **********Whether government or business ends up performing these tasks, the competition between them has contributed to a reduction in the portion of the work force employed by government. It has fallen to 14.9 percent of the total work force last year, from a record 17.1 percent in 1975. **********Part of the drop comes from government restricting employment. And when business wins a contract, it often replaces government jobs with private ones paying less in wages or benefits. **********These cutbacks clash with what some consider a higher purpose for government - ''the socially important role of providing good jobs to people who might otherwise not get them,'' as Paul Starr, a Princeton University sociology professor, put it. The approach dates back to the Depression, when the Federal Government created tens of thousands of public works jobs. **********Today, governments are a major employer of black Americans; they employed 23 percent of the blacks who held jobs last year, compared with only 14 percent of employed whites. 'A Disproportionate Impact' **********''If you shrink government jobs it is going to have a disproportionate impact on minorities and women,'' said Linda Lampkin, research director of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. **********Unions, which represent half of public sector workers, say governments use the threat of privatization to wring concessions from civil servants. **********Ronald Butler, chief executive of Rural/Metro, says local firefighters have in several instances agreed to concessions to keep his company from displacing them. ''They'll take salary freezes and even layoffs, anything to keep us out,'' he said. **********To the Reagan Administration and conservative economists, however, privatization has not gone far enough. In their view, governments should set standards, but the work should be done by the private sector. Competition among companies, with profit as the prize, is the key to cost-efficient services, they argue. Only welfare programs, the military and police forces probably should be excluded, says David F. Linowes, chairman of the President's Commission on Privatization, which issued recommendations last month. Started With the Jail **********But while the philosophical debate rages, practical considerations are driving privatization. **********In Bay County, Fla., the process started with complaints about substandard conditions in the county jail in Panama City - complaints that the sheriff's office, which ran the jail, was not resolving, said Larry Davis, a county official. The commissioners put the jail's management up for bids in 1985, and awarded a 20-year contract - one that can be canceled annually -to the Corrections Corporation, a Nashville company. The rate, now $29 a day per prisoner, also covers the $3.4 million cost of a new jail to relieve overcrowding. **********The company built the jail in six months. If the county had the task, Mr. Davis said, ''we'd probably still be hunting for an architect.'' **********In Phoenix's case, companies had won contracts to collect the trash of half the city's homes by the early 1980's. Since then the Sanitation Department has pared its costs by one-third, enabling it to recapture lost work, said Ronald Jensen, director of public works. But companies will be able to bid on future contracts. Costs Reduced **********To lower its costs, the Sanitation Department switched to the larger trucks used by private contractors, reducing the number of trips to the dump. It also developed trucks with mechanical arms that pick up trash bins from the sidewalks. The automated vehicle can be operated by one person; a non-automated truck requires two or three. **********Sometimes, the private sector's advantage is simply lower wages. Many cities no longer even try to use civil servants as guards and janitors, or to maintain public golf courses or highway median strips. ''The issue here is wages, pure and simple,'' Mr. Jensen said. ''Our janitors get $6 or $7 an hour, while the private sector pays close to the minimum wage'' of $3.35. **********In other cases, however, the private sector often pays the same wage as governments, but uses fewer workers and gives them fewer benefits. ''The hit is almost always in the pension plan,'' said Ms. Lampkin, the union official. **********The Petrocello Contracting Corporation, which collects trash from one-third of the homes in Newark, has only a small permanent payroll. It hires people daily from a pool of workers who receive the same hourly wages as city workers, but less in overtime and some benefits. The city workers are full-time employees. Fewer Firefighters Used **********Rural/Metro's operations in 20 communities, mostly in the Southwest, are also intended to provide service with fewer people than municipal fire departments employ. Its hourly pay is as high as municipal pay, but its pension is in riskier company stock. **********Rural/Metro, based in Scottsdale, Ariz., operates with two platoons of paid firefighters in each town. Cities typically use three platoons and give firefighters 48 hours off between each 24-hour standard shift. Rural/ Metro's firemen get only 24 hours off. **********Rural/Metro also fields platoons that have only half the full-time workers that municipal platoons employ, said the company's Mr. Butler. Unpaid volunteers and some paid part-timers make up for the shortfall, he said, maintaining that they are so well trained that the quality of service is the same. **********The bottom line is that Rural/ Metro serves Scottsdale, its largest customer, at a fee equal to $30 or $40 for each person in the community, compared with $50 to $70 for municipal fire departments of similar size, according to Roy Pederson, Scottsdale's city manager. Rise in Costs Feared **********But government officials say costs can rise if they become too reliant on companies. For example, they say if street sweeping is turned over to one contractor and the city sells its sweepers, the contractor might double or triple the fee when the contract comes up for renewal. **********To avoid this, cities often divide the business by districts. Some are retained by government agencies; the others are contracted out, as Newark has done in garbage collection. In another approach, the city withdraws from a service - as Garden Grove, Calif., withdrew from street sweeping - but gives each district to a different contractor to guarantee competition. **********Some government officials argue that the private sector does not belong in sensitive services.

Gerald Corrigan; A Crisis Manager Takes on the Mechanics of the Market", "body_text": " **********WHEN the declines in stock prices reached alarming proportions last October, the first phone calls by bankers and securities dealers were to E. Gerald Corrigan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. **********Although Mr. Corrigan was little known to the general public, his lumbering 6-foot, 2-inch frame and gravelly voice were familiar and comforting to Wall Streeters. A protege of Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, he is a 20-year veteran of the Fed and was well known to bankers and securities dealers even before he became president of the New York Fed at the start of 1985. **********Mr. Corrigan had already tested his mettle as a crisis manager in other situations where problems in one sector of the financial markets threatened to spread rapidly to others. He played a key role in easing the 1980 silver crisis precipitated by the Hunt Brothers, for example, and sorted out the mess in 1982, when the collapse of the Drysdale Government Securities threatened the stability of the Treasury bond market. **********''He has a lot of influence, and his opinions may count a bit more than some others' because he has been around so long and fought so many wars,'' said Gary Stern, a friend of Mr. Corrigan and his successor as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. **********From his 10th floor office on Liberty Street, just two blocks north of Wall Street, Mr. Corrigan, plays a special role as the Fed's eyes and ears on the financial markets. The Fed's mandate to guard the safety and soundness of the financial system has traditionally fallen most heavily on the shoulders of the New York bank, with its close view of multinational banks and global markets. **********Mr. Corrigan had been watching and listening carefully in the days before Black Monday. With steep declines in stock prices during the first two weeks of October, he said, tensions were already high. When the explosion came on Oct. 19, the challenge for the Fed was to make sure that the stock market panic did not become a case of financial gridlock. If other sectors of the financial markets were to freeze, the damage to the economy would be far more serious than just a drop in stock prices. **********Drawing on his experience in earlier crises, Mr. Corrigan knew that his most essential tasks were to stay informed and to allay fears of the unknown. Working the telephone like a maestro, he kept Washington abreast of the latest developments and assured the financial community that the world was not coming to an end. He personally urged bankers in New York not to adopt a siege mentality and to continue lending to creditworthy securities firms, even though the amounts were far larger than normal. In Washington, meanwhile, the Fed issued a statement reminding the financial markets of ''its readiness to serve as a source of liquidity to support the financial system.'' **********As events unfolded, the Fed's intangible psychological support proved more important than the cold hard cash it could have provided. Spurred by the New York Fed's moral suasion, the banking system handled the special credit needs created by the stock market crash. Large banks in New York City, for example, increased their loans for purchasing and carrying securities by nearly $5.5 billion, to more than $12 billion, in the week ended Oct. 21. John Reed, chairman of Citicorp, the nation's largest bank holding company, recalls that loans to securities firms jumped to $1.4 billion on Oct. 20 from a normal level of $200 million to $400 million. Most of the loans, including many to the largest securities houses, were secured and paid off over the next few weeks. **********While the New York Fed's actions during October enhanced Mr. Corrigan's image in Washington and the financial community, he insists that crisis management is ''not one of the things I get the most satisfaction from.'' **********He is prouder, he says, of his attempts to improve ''the plumbing'' of the nation's financial system, by which he means everything from better regulation and bank capital requirements to improved back-office clearance and funds-transfer systems. **********In a speech a few months ago, he said that during October the greatest threat to the financial system's stability came from the danger of a major default in one of these clearing and settlement systems for securities. But years before any red flags were raised by the October market crisis, Mr. Corrigan was the most prominent Federal regulator to speak publicly about the myriad lending and credit arrangements used in trading in stocks, bonds, futures and options. **********The crash, which touched major markets around the world, simply reinforced Mr. Corrigan's earlier inclination to devote more resources of the New York Fed to understanding how markets work and how they are changed by new technology and securities. **********''He has an impressive hands-on understanding of the payment system and bank supervision,'' said Anthony Solomon, chairman of S. G. Warburg Securities and Mr. Corrigan's predecessor at the New York Fed. **********For all the prestige of his office, Mr. Corrigan, 47 years old and a father of two, is an unassuming man, more comfortable with rolled-up shirtsleeves than starched cuffs. Acquaintances say he is equally at ease in the protocol-bound dining room of London's Overseas Bankers Club or at an informal meeting of the National Cattlemen's Association. (The connection with ranchers and the occasional presence of Mr. Corrigan or Mr. Volcker at meetings of the cattlemen stems from a love of trout fishing. The ranchers have access to some of the best streams in America.) He left a clear mark on bank regulation earlier this year when the Fed and bank regulators in 11 other countries agreed on uniform standards for bank capital levels, adjusted for the risks involved in various banking activities. For years regulators had seen the need for such a standard, but until Mr. Corrigan took the lead in pushing negotiations - first with the Bank of England - it seemed a Utopian ideal. **********WHILE his general accomplishments as a central banker can't be mounted on the wall next to his cherished 10-pound rainbow trout, Mr. Corrigan gets high marks from bankers and financiers, despite their disagreement with some of his policies. **********''He has had a very good, extensive tour of duty and brings to the job a real understanding of how the Fed works and what it is supposed to do,'' said Dennis Weatherstone, president of J. P. Morgan & Company. ''He is a believer in solutions rather than suggestions. When he has an idea, he will think through the mechanics of how it will work - unlike a lot of other people who don't have a history of working in practicalities and get nervous about implemention.'' **********Mr. Corrigan's impulse to master the details of big projects was evident long before he rose to prominence at the New York Fed. **********At Fordham University - where his economics Ph.D. thesis was entitled ''An Analysis of Demand, Cost and Price Interactions in the Manufacturing Sector from 1955 to 1967'' - he worked on a project to survey the economy of the Bronx. ''Jerry took charge of things, from recruiting students, to managing the field work and writing much of the first draft,'' said Joseph Camarassano, then a Fordham professor heading the project. **********When Mr. Corrigan joined the New York Fed as an economist in 1968, his capacity for hard work - which he admits might be a legacy of the rigors of Jesuit instruction at both Fairfield College in his native Connecticut and at Fordham - led him up to a variety of administrative jobs. The posts were frustrating at times, he recalls, because he wanted to be more involved in public policy issues. But they allowed him to become familiar with all the bank's activities. **********By the time Mr. Volcker came to the New York Fed as president in 1975, Mr. Corrigan was a powerful figure in the bank, holding the post of secretary. The friendship formed with Mr. Volcker over home-made spaghetti dinners grew, and Mr. Corrigan accompanied his boss to Washington when Mr. Volcker was named chairman of the Federal Reserve Board in 1979. **********Among his duties in New York and Washington during the Volcker years was the overseeing of an immense project for the Fed's Pricing Committee. Its task: to set charges for services such as check-clearing and electronic funds transfers that the Fed had previously provided free of charge. As a result, Mr. Corrigan knows details about the sending and receiving of money that are beyond the ken of many bank presidents. **********LEAVING Washington in 1980 to become president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank, Mr. Corrigan turned his attention to broader issues. Writing in longhand on yellow legal pads, he produced articles that are still studied by economists. **********His 1982 paper ''Are Banks Special?'' was a harbinger of his 1987 proposal about how regulators might approach the blurring lines between banking and financial services firms. In that proposal, as in 1982, he claimed the banks' special role in collecting deposits and making loans means they should be kept distinct from other businesses. **********According to his 1987 proposal, commercial companies - manufacturers and retailers, for example - should be allowed to own financial companies, but not banks. Financial firms and banks could combine under the proposal, but would then be subject to the Fed's oversight. **********Mr. Corrigan's grand scheme has not been readily accepted in Congress, and it has features that bankers and securities dealers find objectionable. But it is a comprehensive plan for a restructuring of the financial industry, which, over the past few decades, has seen piecemeal change accompanied by gaps in regulatory oversight. **********Mr. Corrigan recognizes the dilemma of the ''moral hazard,'' where Government regulators must choose between bailouts that might encourage reckless behavior and inaction that might allow a problem to spread. But, he said, speaking to the Senate Banking Committee in December, there are serious gaps in existing regulations for non-bank firms. The system, where operating companies are regulated but holding companies are not, has resulted in ''a large, unsupervised, financial black hole into which any or all activities can be shifted at the convenience or whim of management.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/09/world/soviet-sets-may-15-as-goal-to-start-afghanistan-exit.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Taubman", "pub_date": "1988-02-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1606, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SOVIET SETS MAY 15 AS GOAL TO START AFGHANISTAN EXIT", "print_headline": "SOVIET SETS MAY 15 AS GOAL TO START AFGHANISTAN EXIT", "body_text": " **********Mikhail S.

[ In Washington, Administration officials expressed wariness about Mr. Gorbachev's statement, saying other issues besides the timetable had to be resolved before the United States would agree to end aid to the Afghan guerrillas. The other issues include the order in which Soviet units withdraw and the precise details of a cease-fire to be observed during the pullout, officials said. Page A15. ]  Link to Rebel Aid Cutoff Mr. Gorbachev's statement, which was read over national television by a broadcaster who interrupted regular evening programming, also said that a withdrawal was not contingent on the composition of any future Afghan Government. **********Repeating Moscow's position that the withdrawal and a cutoff of Western aid to the Afghan rebels must be linked, Mr. Gorbachev said the return home of Soviet soldiers ''is, quite naturally, linked with precluding interference in Afghanistan's internal affairs.''  [ Text of statement, page A14. ]  Indicating that he believes agreement on that point has been reached with the Reagan Administration, Mr. Gorbachev said that ''prerequisites for that have now been created to a mutual satisfaction.'' Large Early Withdrawal **********The offer narrowed but did not eliminate differences with Pakistan and the United States over the timetable for a Soviet withdrawal. Pakistan has called for an eight-month schedule as part of a package of agreements that would end the Soviet troops' eight-year stay in Afghanistan. **********Apparently accepting a key condition for a political settlement set by Washington, Mr. Gorbachev said Moscow would plan its withdrawal so that the greater proportion of its troops would leave at the beginning of a withdrawal period. **********''That too could be done. The Afghan leadership and we agree to it,'' he said in a statement released by the official press agency, Tass, and read by the announcer on Soviet television this evening. **********He did not offer a specific formula for phasing the removal of the Soviet troops in Afghanistan, believed to number about 120,000. **********''All of this creates the necessary conditions for signing the settlement agreement in the very near future,'' Mr. Gorbachev said. Possible Obstacles to Peace An end to the war could still be blocked by a number of factors, including a failure to bridge the remaining gap over a withdrawal timetable, disagreement over exactly how many Soviet troops should leave in the initial phase of a pullout, and a sudden increase in fighting that might threaten the security of departing Soviet troops. **********Even if Soviet forces withdraw, the outlook for peace among Afghanistan's warring tribes and political factions seems uncertain at best. **********The Gorbachev statement seemed aimed at reducing remaining obstacles to a settlement while positioning Moscow to hold the United States and its allies, particularly Pakistan, responsible for any breakdown in the diplomatic process. **********Western analysts said it would help clear the way for a settlement but did not guarantee that one would be reached. 'An Important Step' **********''The statement is an important step, especially the setting of a date certain for withdrawal, but it is also clearly drafted to maximize pressure on Pakistan to accept the deal that's now on the table,'' one Western diplomat said. **********Mr. Gorbachev said his statement was intended to clarify Soviet positions before the resumption in Geneva later this month of United Nations-sponsored negotiations to end the war. **********Mr. Gorbachev officially confirmed what Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze indirectly suggested after a trip to Afghanistan last month, when he said a withdrawal was not contingent on the composition of any future Afghan Government. **********''We are convinced that it is not,'' Mr. Gorbachev said. 'None of Our Business' **********To underscore the point, he rejected suggestions that Moscow help with the formation of a viable coalition government. **********''Our answer is firm and clear: Don't expect us to do it; it is none of our business, or yours, for that matter.'' **********The firm language seemed intended as a clear signal, if one was still needed, that Najibullah, the Afghan leader, should not count on Soviet support to stay in power. **********Some Western diplomats said that Mr. Gorbachev, reportedly concerned that Mr. Najibullah had tried to impede the peace negotiations in recent months to delay a Soviet departure, wanted to spell out Moscow's position himself. **********Mr. Gorbachev said at the beginning of the statement, ''The Soviet leadership considers it necessary to set forth its views and to make its position totally clear.'' 'Nonaligned and Neutral' **********Mr. Gorbachev said, ''Most often it is being said that the future peaceful Afghanistan will be an independent, nonaligned and neutral state. Well, we would only be happy to have such a neighbor on our southern borders.'' **********Calling the Afghan war ''one of the most bitter and painful regional conflicts,'' the Soviet leader said he hoped a resolution would lead to the settlement of similar conflicts elsewhere. **********In a departure from standard procedures apparently intended to draw attention to the statement, regular evening television programming in the Soviet Union, including a broadcast of the movie version of Mikhail Sholokhov's novel, ''And Quiet Flows the Don,'' was interrupted. **********Less than 90 minutes later, the statement was repeated in its entirety on the main evening news program, ''Vremya.'' 'Our Soldiers in Afghanistan' **********Clearly sensitive to internal Soviet concerns about the war and its costs at home, Mr. Gorbachev spoke briefly about ''our boys, our soldiers in Afghanistan.'' **********''They have been doing their duty honestly, performing acts of self-denial and heroism,'' he said. ''Our people profoundly respect those who were called to serve in Afghanistan.'' **********''The memory of those who have died a hero's death in Afghanistan is sacred to us,'' he added. **********Indirect negotiations between Afghanistan and Pakistan, currently in their seventh round, have been conducted since 1982 with the help of a United Nations Mediator, Diego Cordovez, an Ecuadorean who is Under Secretary General for Political Affairs. **********Mr. Cordovez spent recent weeks shuttling between Islamabad and Kabul, the Pakistani and Afghan capitals, in preparating for reconvening the talks in Geneva. Most Issues Settled **********Mr. Gorbachev, in an assessment shared by Western diplomats, said most terms for a political settlement of the war have been worked out. **********Mr. Cordovez has helped put together a four-part agreement under which Pakistan and Afghanistan would agree not to interfere in each other's internal affairs and work out the repatriation of the 2.9 million Afghan refugees in Pakistan. **********In addition, as part of the package Afghanistan would agree to a firm timetable for a Soviet withdrawal and other countries, specifically the United States and Soviet Union, would provide international guarantees that the agreements would be honored. **********The primary outstanding issue in recent months has been the timetable for a Soviet pullout, with Moscow and Kabul, not always in step, moving the period down from 16 to 12 and now to 10 months. Kabul Irritates Ally **********Soviet officials have expressed irritation with what they view as stalling tactics in Kabul, which last September proposed a 16-month withdrawal timetable when Soviet officials were saying privately that Moscow was ready to accept 12 months. **********Mr. Gorbachev, in a warning apparently directed at Pakistan and its leader, Gen. Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, said the progress toward a settlement ''does not mean that no one could now obstruct the settlement, or push the talks backwards.'' **********He added, ''But we would not like to think that some states or political figures might want to be held accountable by the Afghan nation and other nations for scuttling a settlement.'' **********Mr. Gorbachev sounded confident that an agreement to end outside aid to the Afghan rebels could be adequately policed, suggesting that some form of United Nations verification program could be established. **********Last month, President Najibullah told Western reporters in Kabul that international inspection teams based in Kabul and Islamabad would be formed to monitor the cutoff of aid. **********In a move that Western diplomats said suggested momentum in the peace talks was building, Yuli M. Vorontsov, a Soviet deputy foreign minister, arrived in India today and is expected to travel to Islamabad later this week. **********It has been nearly a year since there were direct talks between Moscow and Islamabad about the Afghan war, and diplomats here have said that a visit by Mr. Vorontsov to Islamabad would be a signal that the closing phase of the negotiations had begun.

Pace of Change Has Slowed **********But the pace of change has slowed since President Lee took office, with major policy decisions put off until the party congress. Now, with new leadership in place, party members and political experts said Mr. Lee would be able to make more changes in the days ahead. **********The party congress made few important policy decisons except to loosen controls on trade, investment and visits to mainland China.

'Continues in His Job' **********A few minutes before the President spoke, his spokesman, Jose Ignacio Lopez, said General Caridi ''continues in his job.'' **********General Caridi announced the end to the rebellion after a day in which he sent hundreds of loyalist troops backed by tanks and artillery to the gates of the base held by the rebels. He said the rebels, led by Col. Mohammed Ali Seineldin, were going to surrender their arms and remove the mines they had placed around the base in Villa Martelli in the western suburbs. **********But there was no immediate sign that that was occurring. General Caridi raced out of the base after meeting with the rebels in the late afternoon and drove into the center of the city for meetings with President Alfonsin and Defense Minister Horacio Jaunarena. **********The rebellion began Friday when troops following Colonel Seineldin took over the Infantry School at the Campo de Mayo base, about six miles from Villa Martelli. Later, they moved to Villa Martelli. Army Shakeup Demanded **********Colonel Seineldin, who recently returned to Argentina from as assignment as a military trainer in Panama, demanded a shakeup in the army leadership and the release of former military leaders now serving sentences for the torture and political killings that occurred during the 1976-83 military regime. **********These are longstanding grievances of the Argentine armed forces, whose members feel they deserve ''vindication'' instead of prosecution for the methods they used in putting down the leftist insurgency of the mid-1970's. **********This is the third army rebellion that the Alfonsin Government has confronted over this festering issue. The first, in April 1987, was settled peacefully only after political leaders agreed to halt human rights trials of mid- and lower-level military officers. But the act of Congress left intact the convictions of former military junta members and other top officers. **********As about 20 tanks and dozens of trucks carried the troops in battle gear to Villa Martelli, crowds gathered along the highways to watch in heat that exceeded 95 degrees. Rebels Fire Tear Gas **********The rebels periodically released tear gas to deter journalists and fist-waving demonstrators gathered at the entrance to the base. At the same time, loyalist troops went door to door in the populous neighborhood of houses and small apartment buildings to urge people to evacuate for their safety. Most chose to remain. **********Some shots were heard at various times during the day, but they appeared to involve rebels and demonstrators, not loyalist troops. Officials said an 18-year-old civilian man was struck by a bullet and killed and an 18-year-old woman was seriously wounded. **********Although General Caridi said he was going to obey the President's order on Saturday to ''suffocate'' the rebellion, there were signs that he encountered resistance from within the army to using force against comrades. Gen. Roberto Dominguez, commander of the Third Army Corps in Cordoba, 450 miles northwest of Buenos Aires, said that the Fourth Air Transport Brigade under his command had refused to take part in the operation against the rebels, but he denied that he or his troops had joined the rebellion. **********After General Caridi's announcement of a settlement, the loyalist forces began to withdraw from Villa Martelli. **********General Caridi was named to command the army in the midst of the April 1987 rebellion when the previous army leadership and many other officers refused to move against the rebels or were viewed as being insufficiently loyal to the President in the matter. Sympathizer of Rebel Colonel **********Since then, General Caridi has fought an uphill battle to gain the loyalty of the army officer corps. In addition to the issue over the prosecutions for human rights abuses, he was hampered by the Government's tight finances, which have made it impossible to satisfy army demands for better salaries and equipment. **********Colonel Seineldin, whose name comes from Druse-Lebanese parents, is identified as a sympathizer of Col. Aldo Rico, who led the two previous rebellions. Colonel Rico is imprisoned for those actions, and one of Colonel Seineldin's demands was his release. After the latest uprising began, the army moved Colonel Rico from Magadalena prison near the capital to Mar del Plata, 350 miles down the coast. **********Political leaders who met with the President during the day said he had described Colonel Seineldin as ''a crazy running loose.'' **********Colonel Seineldin, 54 years old, was reportedly passed over for promotion to general because of his known sympathy for Colonel Rico, but it was not clear whether that was part of the motivation for the uprising. **********The Alfonsin Government used a now familiar method to confront the rebellion. It urged people to demonstrate in the plazas and sought, and received, expressions of support from foreign governments and opposition political leaders here. **********On Saturday night, an estimated 30,000 people gathered in front of the Congress, which went into permanent session."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/19/business/business-people-2-man-team-aims-to-put-coleco-back-on-track.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1988-07-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 491, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "2-Man Team Aims to Put Coleco Back on Track", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; 2-Man Team Aims to Put Coleco Back on Track", "body_text": " **********J.

Mr. Delvalle was then ousted by the National Assembly, which the general's forces control, and went into hiding. The assembly named Manuel Solis Palma as the new President. **********Mr. Delvalle issued a proclamation from his hiding place this week ordering all Panamanian assets frozen; that proclamation has been the foundation of the economic campaign against the Noriega regime. The State Department has termed the proclamation a legitimate act by the lawful Panamanian President. **********Moreover, a State Department spokesman strongly suggested today that the United States was preparing to use the proclamation as a basis for withholding payments on the American lease of the Panama Canal.

''We are consulting with Treasury and the Canal Commission on how to proceed with this request.'' **********State Department officials said the board of directors of the Panama Canal Commission was due to make a scheduled payment next week of nearly $7 million. The United States holds five of the nine seats on the board and thus controls any decisions. **********The strategy behind the economic campaign is to deny Mr. Noriega and his political associates cash to meet the payroll for the military and civil service, which form the general's base of support. Administration officials are hoping that this will topple the Noriega regime, as other forms of pressure from Washington have not.

''And when a country is, as we understand it, strapped as the Noriega regime is strapped, every dime counts.'' **********The State Department document to be sent to the banks certifies that Mr. Delvalle remains President of Panama and that they could face legal problems if they made payments to any other than his representatives. A Question of Liability **********Another official said no bank would disburse funds to a Noriega representative after the State Department declaration that Mr. Delvalle is the lawful head of state because it would be liable in Federal courts for money paid to anyone else. **********A spokesman for Bankers Trust said tonight that the bank was aware of the State Department's action but would have no comment while its lawyers prepared a response.

The machines will flip hamburgers, bag french fries, spread pizza dough, fry chicken, bake biscuits, stuff burritos and deliver drive-in orders to cars in about half the time and at about half the cost that human workers require. **********''The fast food industry has no alternative; it will have to robotize,'' said Joseph Durocher, professor of hotel administration at the University of New Hampshire's Whittemore School of Business and Economics. ''No longer can they afford the luxury of having human workers standing at the beverage bar with a cup or watching hamburger patties on a grill.'' **********The move is a direct response to a growing shortage of workers in the industry, experts said. **********Professor Durocher said that with unemployment as low as 3.1 percent in some areas in the Northeast, there are fewer workers willing to prepare fast food for the minimum wage of $3.35 an hour, generally what the chains pay, when they can earn as much as $8 or $10 an hour in manufacturing. **********Analysts at the On Premise Institute, a market research firm in Burbank, Calif., estimate that the fast food industry is 250,000 workers short of the 6 million needed to keep the industry running smoothly. **********Scott Allmendinger, food editor of Restaurant Business magazine, a trade publication, said the recent changes in immigration laws, which make it more difficult for employees to hire illegal aliens, have exacerbated the labor problem. ''We are losing a group of high-quality employees, mainly from Latin American countries, who would work hard at a variety of fast food jobs,'' Mr. Allmendinger said. **********Mike Lorelli, Pepsico's executive vice president of marketing and sales, said, ''Our research indicates that the critical problem of a dwindling labor supply will continue to affect the restaurant industry, in fact becoming worse in the years ahead.'' **********Responding to the labor shortage, Pepsico, which owns Kentucky Fried Chicken, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, has developed a prototype of a new automated beverage dispenser. It takes 15 seconds to deliver a 16-ounce drink. Orders are punched in at the cash register by a clerk. A computer sends the order to the dispenser to drop a cup, fill it with ice and the appropriate soda, and place a lid on top. The cup is then moved by conveyor to the customer. **********Pepsico plans to test-market the prototype later this year. **********In 1987, fast food restaurants with limited menus, like McDonald's, Burger King, and Kentucky Fried Chicken, had revenues of about $55 billion. They declined to say how much they invest in technological research and development, but McDonald's and Pepsico said their investments were sizable. **********The critical link in the future automation of the fast food restaurant will be a computer connecting the customer at the cash register and the machines that prepare the food, Professor Durocher said. For example, when a clerk punches ''cheeseburger, large french fries, and small soda'' into the cash register, the computer would signal a device to put a hamburger patty with a cheese slice on the grill. The french fryer would fill a large bag, and the beverage dispenser would pour a small drink. **********In some ways, the revolution in fast food technology is well under way. Many fast food restaurants already have such devices as automated french fryers and computerized ovens that have allowed them to serve customers faster. And most of the major fast food chains are seeking new machines that will help control rising labor costs. **********Charles Rubner, a spokesman for McDonald's, the nation's leading fast food chain, said the company was developing a wide variety of new technologies. Last year, McDonald's introduced a grill that cooks hamburgers on both sides simultaneously. **********Richard P. Mayer, Kentucky Fried Chicken's chairman and chief executive, said: ''We don't foresee a lot of robots or automatons running around our restaurants - we are in the service industry where human contact is important. But with the advent of more sophisticated equipment, there will be fewer people who will do more in a more hospitable environment.'' **********As an example, Mr. Mayer said that his company's technical center had developed microprocessor-based controllers that keep the temperature in ovens and fryers at the correct level to insure consistency of the product. Before such special electronics, the ovens and fryers had to be painstakingly calibrated daily. **********With the new computer-controlled circuitry, when a worker places a tray of biscuits in an oven and returns 5 minutes later to insert another tray, the computer calculates the heat loss and raises the temperature to accommodate the second tray. **********Another product that has received attention in the industry is the Vittleveyor, a food delivery system that allows restaurants to provide customers with multiple drive-through lanes. **********The Vittleveyor is a conveyor belt system that carries food vertically or horizontally. After placing an order at the drive-through microphone, a customer pulls up to a stall, puts money in a capsule and sends it into the restaurant. A clerk puts the food order and change on the Vittleveyor and sends them back to the stall. **********Terry Robert, director of marketing and sales for E. F. Bavis Associates, which manufactures the system, said the Vittleveyor allows the restaurant to serve more drive-through customers faster because there is more than one line. Analysts estimate that as much as 50 percent of fast food business comes from drive-through customers. The Vittleveyor delivery system is being used by Arby's restaurants in the Midwest. **********Roger Rydell, director of public relations for Pizza Hut, said the chain was developing ovens that would cut cooking time in half. **********He also said that Pizza Hut was installing personal computers in each restaurant to assist with work schedules and inventory and that tests were being made with a computerized order pad that would relay orders instantaneously to the kitchen and cash register."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/08/business/finance-new-issues-ohio-to-back-71-million-in-pollution-control-bonds.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-09-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 209, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ohio to Back $71 Million In Pollution Control Bonds", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; Ohio to Back $71 Million In Pollution Control Bonds", "body_text": " **********The Ohio Water Development Authority and the Ohio Air Quality Development Authority are tentatively offering $71 million of pollution control revenue bonds for a Duquesne Light Company project through underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company. **********Each authority's issue will be a special obligation of the State of Ohio and is being issued to provide funds for water pollution control and solid waste disposal facilities and air pollution control facilities.

Standing at the crest of one of Stamford's tallest hills, this 110,000-square-foot square tower was originally intended to be a nursing home. But the developers ran into financial problems, and before completion in the early 1970's, the lenders took it over and operated it as the 99-room Executive Monarch hotel while awaiting a buyer. **********In 1981, the hotel was bought by Ramesh D. Dipchand, North American director for the Harilela group of companies, a diversified corporation based in Hong Kong. ''What we found was that there were almost no hotels in Stamford,'' Mr. Dipchand said. ''Room rates had reached over $100.'' Thus for an acquisition price of $7 million and $6 million more for renovations, he said, ''we felt we couldn't lose.'' **********But others had also seen the growing market for hotel space in Stamford, and by 1985 about 2,000 hotel rooms had been added in a city that had had only 400 when Mr. Dipchand bought his hotel. His losses were $5,000 a day, Mr. Dipchand said. **********He had two options: swift conversion of the hotel to condominiums or a return to the original concept of a nursing home. Condominiums looked more enticing, he said, because the market for units that year was white hot. **********With the help of Bertram Lee Whinston, a Stamford architectural firm, plans were drawn up to convert each 420-square-foot suite into a one-bedroom condomimium. It could be done, it was found, simply by adding one wall and a fuller kitchen. Communal rooms on each floor were divided to form larger one- and two-bedroom units, for a total of 162 units. A suite of offices and a restaurant are being completed at the street level. **********Mr. Dipchand said he was spending up to $5 million more for these changes, which include more substantial wiring and exterior improvements. **********Prices were originally set at $130,000 for the one-bedroom units and $190,000 for the two-bedroom units, with common charges set at $135 a month. But buyers did not line up. ''They were tiny units by Stamford standards,'' said Arlene Hall, vice president of the local offices of Merrill Lynch Realty. ''No more than a pied-a-terre.'' Moreover, by the fall of 1986, the market was cooling. **********Prices were therefore slashed, to $105,000 for the one-bedroom units and $145,000 for two bedrooms. Buyers were also offered free common charges for the first year of ownership, plus the existing hotel furnishings and room service from a Chinese restaurant that was moving into one of the commercial units. ''It all helped,'' Ms. Hall said. ''These apartments became some of the least expensive in that part of town.'' Now only 30 units remain unsold. **********The same conversion scenario was not repeated around the corner, at the seven-story, 42-suite hotel called the Bedford. Built two years ago by William M. Ivler for $6.5 million, the hotel, it quickly became apparent, was to fall victim to the same oversupply that had plagued Mr. Dipchand's hotel. However, Mr. Ivler had drawn his architectural plans with a later conversion in mind, just in case. **********Thus he had only to develop an offering plan. In addition, at an average of 700 square feet each, these units were much roomier. But timing was the enemy this time. By the summer of 1986 the market had already weakened substantially for the luxury condominiums in the $225,000 price range that Mr. Ivler was offering. He had also set the common charges relatively high - $450 a month on average - since he planned to include many of the planned hotel services, expecting these to add to the appeal. **********It did not work. So he chose to withdraw rather than lower prices, maintaining that in his case price cutting would not help. ''There was no market,'' he said. But it may have been more complex than that. ''The problem was more in the high common charges than the prices,'' Ms. Hall said. ''People out here don't want to pay for services they may never need.'' **********Mr. Ivler has resumed hotel operations in the building and says he is gaining a stronger following within the business community.

President Reagan is hoping to exchange formal documents of ratification with the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, at the Moscow summit meeting. **********The dispute erupted over an attempt by Senator Pete Wilson, Republican of California, to require the Soviet Union to be bound by the same interpretation of the treaty that will bind the United States. **********When Mr. Wilson's attempt failed by only a slim margin, the majority leader, Senator Robert Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, complained that senators were attempting to undo a treaty interpretation measure approved earlier in the day. **********''If we're going to have Mickey Mouse amendments like this, the President is not going to have this treaty,'' he said just before he then dismissed the Senate for the night. **********Although the Senate's ultimate approval of the treaty has never really been in doubt, parliamentary and political roadblocks have kept the Administration in a state of agitated suspense about whether the final vote would come before the summit. **********What had appeared earlier today as the final breakthrough developed when Democratic and Republican leaders, without the specific approval of the White House, agreed on compromise language as a condition on how the treaty may be interpreted. That language will be attached to the resolution of ratification. **********The resolution is the formal measure expressing the Senate's advice and consent to the treaty, and it requires approval of two-third of the Senators to pass. Approves Compromise **********After the Senate approved the treaty interpretation compromise, by a 72-to-27 vote, it began working on other conditions, including one expressing the Senate's view that any declarations or understandings between the United States and the Soviet Union on negotiations for an agreement to limit strategic weapons should not interfere with current American military programs. **********The condition, proposed by Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, would also require the President to consult with the Senate on the negotiations. It has the qualified support of both the Senate Democratic and Republican leaders, who permitted Mr. Helms to offer it as part of a bargain to keep him from delaying final passage of the treaty. **********The compromise language on interpreting the treaty arises from a long-running dispute over the scope of the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. The compromise allows senators on both sides of that disagreement to claim a measure of victory, while leaving the dispute itself unresolved. The issue has its roots in a contention by the Reagan Administration that the 1972 ABM Treaty can be interpreted to permit testing of some components of the President's proposed ''Star Wars'' antimissile defense system. **********Democratic senators have strenuously opposed that reading of the 1972 treaty. In an effort to refute those views, Democratic senators have been adamant about attaching a condition establishing that treaties cannot be reinterpreted by the President without the advice and consent of the Senate. **********But precisely what the compromise language approved by the Senate actually established was itself open to interpretation.

Lugar, Republican of Indiana, who supported the measure to speed approval of the treaty, called the language ''redundant and irrelevant,'' and said senators who did not like it had no need to worry about it. An 'Unconditional Surrender' **********Senator Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican who opposed the condition, called it ''an unconditional surrender by the Administration.'' The measure, Mr. Specter said, was ''a switchblade knife aimed at the security of the United States'' because it would bind the United States to obligations not imposed on the Soviet Union. **********Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who heads the Armed Services Committee and who has been a key figure in the dispute over interpreting the 1972 ABM pact, said the condition reaffirmed the constitutional principles that have always governed treaty making and that were ''interrupted'' by what became known as the Sofaer Doctrine. **********Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, helped forge the compromise, but said that if he had had his way there would be no such condition. **********''But I know who's in the majority and I know where the votes are,'' the Senate minority leader said, acknowledging that Democrats have had the votes all along to insist on the condition.

Michael S. Dukakis. **********In the Canadian debate, which was held in a television studio in Ottawa, the party leaders repeatedly clashed with each other, provoking the most revealing moments of the exchange. Trade Pact Is Issue **********The confrontation centered on the free-trade agreement that the ruling Progressive Conservatives have signed with the United States. The opposition Liberals forced a general election, to be held Nov. 21, by refusing to approve the pact in the Canadian Senate. **********In three weeks of campaigning before the debate, the Liberals' assertion that the agreement will turn Canada into an ''economic colony'' of the United States appeared to have had only a minor effect on the Progressive Conservatives' lead in the opinion polls. **********On Tuesday night, John Turner, the Liberal leader, and Edward Broadbent, the leader of a second opposition party, the New Democrats, repeatedly pointed to what they described as the threats to Canada's economic independence in the agreement, which would remove most trade barriers between the two countries. For the Defense **********Brian Mulroney, the Progressive Conservative leader and Prime Minister, countered with a point-by-point defense of the accord. But he ultimately retreated into what some of his aides conceded may have been a tactical error: a reminder that the agreement can be scrapped by Canada at six months' notice if it proves damaging. **********Mr. Mulroney's debate advisers had reportedly urged him not to show the instinct for political street-fighting that has marked his public career. But Mr. Turner's prodding appeared to push him to the limits of his tolerance. The high point came when Mr. Turner, shaking his finger at the Prime Minister, said, ''I happen to believe you've sold us out.'' **********Mr. Mulroney, his face flushed, interrupted. ''Just one second, Mr. Turner,'' he said, pointing back at the Liberal leader. ''You do not have a monopoly on patriotism, and I resent the fact that you imply that only you are a Canadian. I want to tell you that I come from a Canadian family, and I love Canada, and that is why I did it, to promote prosperity.'' **********Mr. Turner pressed on. ''We have built a country, east and west and north, on an infrastructure that resisted the continental pressure of the United States,'' he said. ''For 120 years we've done it, and with one stroke of the pen you've reversed that, thrown us into the north-south pull of the United States. And that will reduce us, I'm sure, to an economic colony of the United States, because when the economic levers go, the political independence is sure to follow.'' **********Mr. Mulroney, looking as though he could barely contain himself, interrupted again. ''With a document that's cancelable on six months' notice?'' he said, in a mocking tone. ''Be serious. Be serious.'' **********As in the United States, televised election debates are regarded as crucial here. In a debate before the last Canadian election, in 1984, Mr. Mulroney, then the opposition leader, succeeded in turning around a deficit of 11 percentage points in the polls with a harsh attack on Mr. Turner, then Prime Minister, for approving a list of last-minute patronage appointments requested by Mr. Turner's predecessor as Liberal leader and head of Government, Pierre Elliott Trudeau. Points Given Turner **********This time, many of Canada's leading political commentators concluded that Mr. Turner had gained the upper hand. But it was far from sure that the Liberal leader's impression on the country's 17 million voters would be sufficient to make up the Liberals' deficit in the polls. **********The latest Gallup Poll, made public on Monday, gave the Progressive Conservatives 40 percent of the decided vote to 29 percent for the Liberals and 28 percent for the New Democrats. The poll showed 19 percent of the voters undecided. **********The Liberals have been badly damaged by policy disputes among the party's top figures over the free-trade pact and other issues, and by repeated attempts in the last two years to oust Mr. Turner as leader. In the early stages of the campaign, matters worsened to the point that leading Liberals expressed concern that the party, which has governed Canada for most of this century, might ''disappear'' in the election. But Mr. Turner, who is 59 years old, has been widely credited with a tough performance on the hustings, despite a painful back condition. Opposition Parties Clash **********Although Mr. Mulroney's aides conceded today that the Liberal leader had been effective in the debate Tuesday on the English-language service of Canada's three major networks, and in the three-hour debate in French that preceded it on Monday night, they were encouraged by the continuing bitterness between the Liberals and New Democrats. **********Despite their avowal that defeating the free-trade agreement is crucial to the country's survival, the two opposition groups have diverted an increasing amount of fire from the Progressive Conservatives onto each other. This is apparently because both groups sense that the real battle in the election may be for second place and the status of official opposition in Parliament that it confers. **********In the debate Tuesday, Mr. Turner focused on what is widely regarded as the New Democrats' main electoral liability, a commitment to withdraw Canada from participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, accused Mr. Broadbent, of seeking to ''skate around'' the party's military policies.Mr. Broadbent countered by assailing Mr. Turner for failing to show up for key votes on free trade."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/29/business/icahn-hints-at-strategy.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Labaton", "pub_date": "1988-01-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 404, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Icahn Hints at Strategy", "print_headline": "Icahn Hints at Strategy", "body_text": " **********Carl C.

Altman & Company, amid a motley assortment of aging commercial structures, is no longer a sleeper. Four major projects that will create more than 1.5 million square feet of commercial space are in construction or planning there. **********Nearing completion on the northeast corner of Fifth Avenue and 40th Street is the 25-story, 205,000-square-foot office building developed by a Japanese and British partnership that includes Mitsui Fudosan and the Colonial Property Group. **********Two blocks to the south, on the west side of the avenue, the Hammerson Property Corporation will start demolition in July for a 30-story, 600,000-square-foot office building it will erect on the full block between 38th and 37th Streets. The 38th Street end of the site now holds the former W & J Sloane furniture store. **********One block south, Murray Hill Properties will replace its six-story midblock building at No. 400 with a 225,000-square-foot commercial building. The company is using the air rights over the eight-story structure on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 37th Street, which it also owns, to take its new building to 31 stories. **********The new owners of the B. Altman building, K.M.O.-361 Realty Associates, plan to create 550,000 square feet of office space by converting some sales floors and adding as many as six new floors at the Madison Avenue end of the structure. Approval by the Landmarks Preservation Commission is awaited. **********The Republic National Bank can take credit for leading redevelopment in the area: in 1985 it completed its 29-story, 500,000-square-foot office tower on the westerly blockfront between 39th and 40th Streets. **********Then, in 1986, the Goodstein Construction Corporation and Arthur G. Cohen, a developer, completed the 32-story Fifth Avenue Tower, with residential condominiums above a seven-story commercial base, directly opposite at 39th Street. **********Since then the pace of development on this stretch of Fifth Avenue has quickened considerably. The four projects now in the works add up to more development than the area has seen in many years. The last sizable project there before the current spurt was 489 Fifth Avenue, the narrow 34-story office building just south of 42d Street that was completed in 1970. **********''I have thought that the part of Fifth Avenue between 34th and 42d Streets was a comer for some time,'' said Tim Fitzpatrick, president of Hammerson Property. **********''Hammerson Property has been looking for the opportunity to build in Manhattan for several years,'' he said. ''We could not have found a better opportunity in terms of potential value and location.'' **********Hammerson Property is a subsidiary of the Hammerson Property Investment and Development Corporation of Britain, and it has built major projects in Europe and Canada. Its United States arm has done commercial projects in Buffalo, Houston and Los Angeles. The Fifth Avenue building is its first in New York City. **********Mr. Fitzpatrick said the company acquired the former furniture store building early in 1987 and spent 18 months assembling the two other parcels as well as easement rights to permit a full-block building. Despite the softness of the Manhattan office market, he said, the company went ahead with contruction as soon as it had control of the property. **********''We have been buoyed by the activity and interest in the area in the last few years,'' Mr. Fitzpatrick said. ''Also, by getting the full block, we will have a unique commodity to offer - large floors, which are increasingly rare in midtown.'' **********Floors in the building will range from 14,300 to 24,000 square feet. There will be 27 office floors and 30,000 square feet of retail space on three levels in the base. **********When the three empty buildings on the site come down this summer, a granite and reflective-glass tower designed by the architectural firm of Brennan Beer Gorman, will go up. **********The development timetable calls for construction to begin in September and for the building to be ready for its first office tenants by the first quarter of 1990. Mr. Fitzpatrick said the asking price for space in the building, with 420 Fifth Avenue as its address, would be in the low to mid-$40's a square foot. **********In the next block the principals of Murray Hill Properties, Norman Sturner and Neil H. Siderow, hope to begin construction of their new building by next spring. By then they will have to decide what sort of project it is to be. Although the original development plan called for an office building, Mr. Sturner and Mr. Siderow are now contemplating a hotel. **********''There are no major hotels in this area,'' said Mr. Sturner, whose company has focused on office rehabilitation projects. ''But between the garment, toy, tableware and other industries based in the area, there are more than two dozen market weeks. And with the proven success of the convention center, we are thinking that what is needed here is a hotel.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/19/business/britain-to-use-nasdaq-system.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-04-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 183, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Britain to Use Nasdaq System", "print_headline": "Britain to Use Nasdaq System", "body_text": " **********The Nasdaq automated quotation system is expected to be authorized today to operate as the first foreign stock exchange in Britain.

Of the American Arabs, there are 300,000 Palestinian-Americans, of whom 50,000 live in Michigan. **********For years, the Palestinian-Americans have quietly supported the cause, sending money home to help relatives they left behind. Expatriates from Ramallah collected donations until there was enough to build a hospital and a public library there. Now they are openly pressing politicians by writing letters and other lobbying efforts here. They Sit by Their Radios **********In Detroit suburbs like Livonia, where large numbers of Arab-Americans live, Palestinian expatriates now sit by their shortwave radios or flip between network broadcasts, quietly cheering as Palestinian youths hurl rocks at their Israeli occupiers. **********''Everyday, we live it, we eat it,'' said a Palestinian parishioner here. ''That's why you see us coming to church.'' **********In record numbers they have gathered at St. Mary's Antiochian Orthodox Church here, 500 families praying that this may be the turning point they have been waiting for. ''We pray to the Almighty God that this blood not go to waste,'' said the Rev. George H. Shalhoub last Sunday, ''that this blood be an olive branch for peace.'' **********Here, the spirits rise and fall with the news. One day Palestinian-Americans are emboldened by the sight of distant cousins waving the banned Palestinian flag, the next day they are disheartened by Palestinian extremists who, this week, for example, hijacked a bus in an attack that left six people dead. Guilty About Life in America **********They are at both exuberant over distant triumphs and ill-at-ease because of their own good fortune in this country. **********''I want to cry every time I see the kids, I'm so proud of them,'' said Fred Ghannam, a Palestinian engineer and member of St. Mary's. ''I can imagine myself there among those people. I feel guilty when I get up and go to work and have a nice life while they're carrying the burden for all of us.'' **********Like many of the Palestinians in this country, Mr. Ghannam came to the United States as a teen-ager shortly after Israel was created in 1948. His family came from Ramallah, 10 miles north of Jerusalem, and settled in Detroit where factory jobs abounded. Mr. Ghannam changed his name from Fuad to Fred and went on to college and a job at the Ford Motor Company. **********''I'm ashamed for my generation,'' he said. ''We didn't fight back. We didn't do anything. We were trying to put our lives together in this country.'' Now Taking an Interest **********If Palestinians-Americans felt detached before, they are now fervently taking interest in the cause. **********''I have never watched the news as much as I have the past few months,'' said Mr. Ghannam's wife, Suham. **********At the same time, prominent Palestinian-Americans are trying to gain support in Washington. The heads of several Arab-American groups met with Secretary of State George P. Shultz last month before his trip to the Middle East to press their concerns: an immediate end to attacks by Israeli soldiers, free elections allowing Palestinians control over their municipalities and equal representation at an international conference on the future of the territories. **********Ultimately, they say, they want an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital. ''We want to be treated as people, not as a refugee problem,'' said Ibrahim Ghanayem, president of the American Federation of Ramallah, which represents 25,000 Palestinian-Americans with roots in that West Bank town. See P.L.O. as Representative **********They look to the Palestinian Liberation Organization as their representative. ''We support the P.L.O., but we don't all agree with it any more than every American agrees with President Reagan or the current makeup of the Congress,'' Mr. Ghanayem said. **********They say they have been inspired by unexpected demonstrations of support, most recently a letter signed by 30 United States senators criticizing Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel for rejecting an exchange of ''territory for peace.'' **********After years of going unnoticed, they say they are encouraged that the months of street fighting have moved even staunch supporters of Israel, such as Senators Rudy Boschwitz, Republican of Minnesota, and Carl M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who took the lead in drafting the letter. **********''Finally, people can see what we've been complaining about,'' Mr. Ghanayem said. New Sense of Identity **********The zeal of the Palestinian rock-throwers has given the children and grandchildren of Arab immigrants a new sense of identity and belonging. **********Growing up in the suburbs, ''you didn't say you were Palestinian,'' said Fred Ghannam's daughter, Cyndi. ''You wanted to assimilate. You didn't want to make waves. Now we've become stronger and more confident.'' **********Still, the difficult task of bringing Americans closer to their point of view remains. The Arab-American lobby is greatly overshadowed by the wealth and influence of the Jewish lobby. And, despite a strong presence in higher education and the professions in this country, Arabs here are still fighting the stereotypes that peg them as terrorists and oil barons. **********''We are not that many, and we are hated,'' said Mr. Ghannam's nephew James. ''It's hard growing up with all your neighbors pointing at you as 'them.' I wish we could enjoy the image of - I'll just say it - the Jews.'' Tensions in High School **********Since the violence in the occupied territories erupted, similar tensions have been played out here on a much smaller scale. There have been reports of fights between Arab and Jewish high school students here and hotter-than-usual debates between Palestinians and their Jewish friends. **********''Anytime the subject comes up I become very obnoxious, and then the discussion doesn't last very long,'' Fred Ghannam said. ''At times, we just can't discuss it with Jews,'' said James Ghannam. ''We agree that oppression does take place. What we disagree on is that it should be condoned all in the name of the sanctity of Israel.'' **********Others say the Palestinian revolt has not affected their relations with Jews. ''What is there not to get along with?'' asked Emeel Ajluni, a financial analyst in Detroit. ''We're intelligent. We're reasonable. We have similar backgrounds that emphasize education and strong family ties.'' Complaints of Palestinians **********Still, there is bitterness over what they describe as injustices in the territories. Palestinians must carry identification cards, cannot vote, are restricted by curfews and travel limits. **********And they say that they themselves are denied the privileges of other Americans when they return. ''Any Jew in the world can go to Israel, proclaim his identity and build a life as a full citizen,'' said James Ghannam. ''Yet we cannot go to the houses of our parents and move there. We don't have the luxury of going to a kibbutz for the summer.'' **********There is a thirst for any news about the territories and expatriates when close relatives still living there visit, or they can or rely on reports from friends who travel back and forth. For those who have few immediate ties and are reluctant to return to hometowns under Israeli occupation, news reports are their only link home. **********''You have an image of what your town is like,'' said Mrs. Ghannam who has not returned to Ramallah since she left as a child 40 years ago. ''Then you see the beatings and the soldiers patrolling your streets, the streets you grew up on.'' Day Revolves Around the News **********Now much of their day revolves around newscasts. Their family gathers in the den, which looks like many other American dens except for a French map of Palestine from the 1830's on one of the walls. They sit intent and motionless, as images of defiant youths cloaked in Arab headdresses flicker across the screen. Then they switch channels to see more. **********One evening earlier this week, they were disturbed by reports that three Palestinian guerillas and three Israeli civilians were killed after Israeli soldiers stormed a bus that the guerillas had seized. **********They worry that such things will tip the scales of American sentiment against them once again, and they get impatient when their Palestinian relatives resort to violence. ''That sets us back,'' Fred Ghannam said. **********But Mr. Ghannam is filled with a quiet optimism these days. For years he has refused to return to Ramallah while it is under Israeli occupation and has resisted the pleadings of his four grown children to take them there. Now he thinks there may be a chance for him to see his homeland again. **********''I didn't think it would be in my lifetime,'' Mr. Ghannam said. ''I didn't have much hope until this erupted.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/23/world/six-in-florida-indicted-on-charges-of-training-anti-nicaragua-force.html": {"writer_name": "George Volsky", "pub_date": "1988-08-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 527, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Six in Florida Indicted on Charges Of Training Anti-Nicaragua Force", "print_headline": "Six in Florida Indicted on Charges Of Training Anti-Nicaragua Force", "body_text": " **********In a second such case in six weeks, a Federal prosecutor announced today that six men had been indicted on charges of recruiting, training and arming mercenaries to fight the Government of Nicaragua. **********A six-count indictment, handed up by a grand jury in Fort Lauderdale on June 28 and unsealed today, accused the six, all Cuban-Americans, of violating the Neutrality Act, which prohibits armed intervention by American citizens abroad. One of the defendant was charged with violating firearm laws. **********On July 13, seven men, including Mario Calero, the brother of the the contra leader Adolfo Calero, were indicted on similar charges. Camps in Everglades **********Today's indictment, announced by Mark P. Schnapp, chief of the Criminal Division of the United States Attorney's Office here, said that in July 1983, four of the Cubans, Rene Corvo, Sergio Becerra, Francisco Hernandez and Rafael Torres Jimenez, set up a military training camps in Collier County. The F.B.I. said the camp was in the Everglades, 70 miles west of Miami. **********The indictment says that 60 mercenaries were recruited and that the two other defendents, Eulalio Francisco Castro and Joseph Marcos, provided money for food, weapons and military training. Federal officials said they did not know the source of the money, which they estimated could amount to ''several hundred thousand dollars.'' **********Mr. Schnapp said the principal organizer of the operation was Mr. Corvo, a 48-year-old former United States Army paratrooper and a member of Brigade 2506, which launched the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961. **********In February 1984, the indictment says, Mr. Corvo traveled to Costa Rica to arrange for his men to join a contra group led by Eden Pastora Gomez, known as Comandante Zero. A month later, the indictement says, they ''participated with Mr. Pastora's insurgency force in combat raids against the Government of Nicaragua.'' 'Combat Raids' **********Later that year, the indictment charges, Mr. Corvo recruited more men and organized his own force, the Saturnino Beltran Commandos, which carried out ''combat raids'' in Nicaragua from bases inside Costa Rica. **********The indictment says Mr. Corvo falsified an export declaration and shipped weapons to his commandos from Fort Lauderdale. Included in the shipments, which took place between March 1985 and January 1986, were a 20-millimeter cannon and a 9-millimeter mortar launcher, the indictment says. **********In 1984 and 1985, newspaper articles reported that large quantities of weapons were being shipped illegally from the Miami area to the contras. In May 1986, the Justice Department said there was no evidence that contra supporters in Florida were involved in the illegal shipments of weapons. **********Mr. Corvo, Mr. Becerra, Mr. Castro and Mr. Marcos surrendered today and were later freed on $25,000 bond.

''To most Americans, this scene is Moscow.'' **********To most Russians, however, and to those foreign journalists who reside here, the scene is anything but Moscow. Television monitors project back the morning and evening news, as they are being broadcast in the United States. Speaker boxes squawk with live radio reports from New York that include traffic conditions on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. And by pressing two numbers on their telephones, reporters here are connected directly to their newsroom switchboards. Enormous Satellite Dishes **********All these electronic miracles are made possible by several enormous satellite dishes, parked in the lot of the Rossiya in conspicuous contrast to the medieval domes across the way. Similar satellite stations are set up across town at the Mezhdunarodnaya Hotel, where the White House has its press center and where most print and radio reporters are based. **********As thousands of foreign reporters start arriving over the weekend, they will find they can pick up the receiver, dial a number in Pittsburgh, speak to an American operator and place a credit card or collect call anywhere in the United States, bypassing the ordinarily time-consuming and undependable Soviet phone network. **********''All this is so much different from when I came here with Nixon in 1972,'' said Joe Angotti, vice president and executive producer for special events for NBC News. ''Then we were completely dependent on the Soviets' sending our stuff out for us. **********''I remember we had tape of this interview with a dissident, we put a spot together, the reporter got on the air and just as we got to the tape, the Soviets pulled the plug.'' The Limits of the 70's **********At the summit conferences of the 1970's, network executives said their broadcasts were incredibly similar because of the limits Soviet officials placed on their coverage. This year, the reports risk similarity not only because all the networks have the Red Square backdrop, but also because the increasingly accommodating Soviet public relations operation seems to have opened the same doors - to psychiatric wards, drug abuse clinics and tank battalions - to all the reporters. **********This week, the Rossiya, its lobbies, guest rooms and balconies converted into newsrooms, editing rooms and sets, was crackling with television news people, each trying to be a little different from the network next door. **********In one room, a producer was frantic. ''I need an Afghan vet,'' she said. ''It's preferably someone who is disgruntled, maybe with a drinking problem and preferably an amputee. Oh, and let's see if we can get one who speaks English.'' **********Down the hall, a rival from another network was also agitated. ''They promised me an exclusive on the AIDS victim,'' he said. ''I cannot believe that everyone's going to be interviewing our AIDS victim.'' Cables, Wires and Tools **********And amid the planning of stories was the connecting of wires. A technician with an electrical problem nearly crashed into Lane Venardos, executive producer of special events for CBS News, as he came racing down the hall, tools in one hand, a cable in the other. **********''Calm down,'' Mr. Venardos said. ''It's not brain surgery. It's only TV.'' **********At first it seemed logical for the Russians to offer the American networks use of the studios at Gosteleradio, the state-run Soviet network in Ostankino, a neighborhood several miles from central Moscow. But after pleading by a joint committee of American network representatives, the Rossiya Hotel became the summit television headquarters. Coffee, Naps and Notebooks **********''Basically, I've tried to make life here as easy as possible for everybody,'' said Wendy Walker, White House producer for Cable News Network, who set up her network's Rossiya operations. ''I know it's silly, but everyone has a personal thing that makes him or her happy. One person needs a nap, another likes fresh brewed coffee, another likes to use one kind of notebook. I made sure all of it was here for all of them.'' **********The visiting news people have had to adjust themselves down a few beats to the pace and bureaucracy of working in the Soviet Union. ''They do things differently here,'' said George Ball, director of the NBC ''Today'' program. ''It's a lot slower. Everything has to go through all these channels.'' **********But the summit news operation is slick, well oiled and positively Western compared with the ordinary Moscow machinery. And this worries some resident correspondents. **********''At the moment, the Soviet Union is running as close to a Swiss watch as it ever will,'' said Barry Peterson, the local CBS News reporter. ''And all these people are going to think it's always like this. But it's really like one of the Swiss watches you buy on the New York subway. It keeps great time for a few days and then, boing, it falls apart.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/13/business/global-briefs.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-06-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 349, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GLOBAL BRIEFS", "print_headline": "GLOBAL BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Colombia's national airline, Avianca, has suspended freight flights to the United States after paying $3.4 million in fines for cocaine smuggled among fresh flowers, newspapers reported on Sunday.

They are famous for prestigious labels like Hennessy Cognac, Moet & Chandon champagne and Vuitton luggage. **********At issue is control of the world's largest luxury-goods conglomerate, a company now called LVMH Moet Hennessy-Louis Vuitton, usually shortened to LVMH. **********The LVMH saga also features a hot new star, Bernard Arnault, the 39-year-old French industrialist who announced on Thursday that he had become LVMH's largest shareholder. Last week alone, Mr. Arnault's forces spent about $600 million to increase their holdings in LVMH to 37 percent, hastening the day when he will probably be able to take charge of the conglomerate. Arnault to Choose Sides **********He may not be ready to take over yet, but he has become the pivotal figure in the feud over how the venerable family interests should control the company. **********An extraordinary LVMH shareholder meeting scheduled for this Thursday could resolve the matter. The Paris financial community has been busy speculating whether Mr. Arnault will come down on the side of the Vuitton family or the Moet, Chandon and Hennessy clans. The Vuitton faction originally invited Mr. Arnault to buy into LVMH as an ally. But Mr. Arnault has recently appeared to ally himself with the rival Moet-Chandon-Hennessy faction. **********Whichever side he chooses, financial analysts say Mr. Arnault, who controls the Christian Dior and Christian Lacroix fashion houses, seems well on his way to becoming chairman of the LVMH empire one day, thanks to his huge corporate holdings and a war chest that will allow him to make even more acquisitions. **********''The goal I have fixed for myself was to make our group the leading luxury group in the world,'' said Mr. Arnault, a formal, soft-spoken executive, in his pastel gray office at Christian Dior's headquarters. ''I'd say we're well on our way.'' **********Just four years ago, Mr. Arnault was a little-known businessman, liv-ing in New Rochelle, N.Y., and working for the American subsidiary of his family's modest real estate business. **********He returned to France in 1984, eager for new challenges. So he bought a nearly bankrupt company, Agache-Willot-Boussac, which was a hodgepodge of retailing, fashion and manufacturing. **********Mr. Arnault quickly turned it into a treasure trove. The company he acquired owned the famous Left Bank department store, Bon Marche, and the Conforama retailing chain. But its jewel was the Dior fashion house. It also owned a plastic manufacturing operation and Peaudouce, a leading manufacturer of disposable diapers. Corporate Turnaround **********Mr. Arnault renamed the company Financiere Agache, and nursed it back to health. He sold some ailing operations and cut costs in others. As a result, Agache earned $112 million on revenue of $1.9 billion last year. **********''We had a great deal of faith in his talents and that is why we backed him,'' said one of the many bankers who finance the Arnault empire. **********Mr. Arnault also found time to do some luxury shopping. Last year, he bought Celine, a clothing and leather goods company. He also bankrolled the young designer Christian Lacroix, who was the sensation of Paris fashion last year. **********While Mr. Arnault was building his base, Moet Hennessy was merging with Vuitton, a deal that was consummated last year and created LVMH Moet Hennessy-Louis Vuitton. Tensions at LVMH **********Henry Racamier, the 77-year-old chairman of Louis Vuitton and No. 2. at the newly formed LVMH, was impressed by Mr. Arnault. In June, Mr. Racamier asked Mr. Arnault to buy some LVMH shares and join forces with him. That was after Mr. Racamier had a run-in with Alain Chevalier, the LVMH chairman and head of Moet Hennessy before the merger. **********The two men - both highly respected for their success in building well-oiled luxury goods empires -had a falling out in June when Mr. Chevalier surprised Mr. Racamier by suggesting that LVMH allow Guinness P.L.C. to buy 20 percent of LVMH stock to help prevent any hostile takeover. This suggestion shocked Mr. Racamier, who grew alarmed that such a move would tip LVMH too heavily in favor of the drinks business. In addition, there were some tensions between the two men about marketing strategies. **********Mr. Chevalier and Anthony Tennant, Guinness's chairman, were close friends, and on the day that Moet Hennessy announced its merger with Vuitton, it also announced a joint distribution agreement with Guinness, which sells Johnny Walker Scotch whisky and Gordon gin. **********''Guinness is one place where we had a difference of opinion,'' Mr. Racamier said in an interview. ''It is not a drama, however. The whole thing has been exaggerated.'' Shifting Allegiances **********After Mr. Racamier sought to enlist Mr. Arnault to help counter LVMH's beverage bias, Mr. Arnault turned to his investment banker, Lazard Freres et Compagnie, for advice. It just so happened that Lazard Freres was also Mr. Chevalier's investment adviser. **********Lazard Freres brought Mr. Arnault and Mr. Chevalier together, and after a late-night meeting Mr. Arnault seemed to switch allegiances. On July 8, he announced a joint venture with Guinness - 60 percent of which would be controlled by Agache - that would buy 27 percent of LVMH. **********''I always thought that Arnault was very ambitious,'' said Francois Badelon, an analyst with Patrick du Bouzet, a Paris stockbroker. ''He has done great things with Agache. But to move to a higher level, I always thought he had to move to a great group.'' **********That, many Arnault watchers say, is why he swooped in on LVMH, which owns the world's No. 1 champagne, No. 1 cognac and the rights to Christian Dior and Givenchy perfume. LVMH earned $213 million on revenues of $2.1 billion last year. Increased Stock Holdings **********Mr. Arnault and his Guinness partners last week increased their stock and warrant holdings to 37 percent of LVMH's capital, from 27 percent. Some analysts said that the Vuitton forces were rumored to be moving to increase their holdings and that in reaction Mr. Arnault was seeking to obtain 33 percent of the voting rights, which would give him a blocking minority, to help Mr. Chevalier. **********''Racamier wanted to pick up more stock and he forced Chevalier, Agache and Guinness to act,'' said Susanna Hardy, an analyst with DLP James Capel in Paris. **********Mr. Racamier said he still considered Mr. Arnault an ally, but he declined to comment on whether Vuitton - with 23 percent of the shares and 30 percent of the voting rights -had bought more shares this week. **********Some critics say Mr. Arnault just might seek to oust the 57-year-old Mr. Chevalier so that he could take LVMH's reins and become the undisputed champion in the world's luxury goods arena. 'That Would Make Him Look Bad' **********''Mr. Arnault is ambitious, but not so ambitious that he would do that,'' one LVMH official said. ''That would make him look bad because Mr. Chevalier is so respected in French business circles. He can always wait a few years until Mr. Chevalier retires.'' **********Mr. Badelon, the analyst, added, ''If Mr. Arnault seeks to force out the management, the families can always band together to stop him.'' **********At Thursday's meeting, LVMH shareholders are expected to vote to change the corporate structure so that the board would be replaced with a less powerful supervisory board. Many analysts say that in an effort to establish a truce, the new board would have 12 members - four representing the Moet, Chandon and Hennessy families; four representing Vuitton interests, and four representing the Arnault-Guinness alliance. **********Mr. Chevalier is expected to be named president of the managing group. In an interview, Mr. Racamier said he would be the No. 2, but added that Mr. Arnault would also probably be a member. 'I'm the Principal Shareholder' **********Mr. Arnault called Mr. Chevalier an excellent manager. ''I agree with his strategies,'' he said. ''His problem is that he is not a major shareholder. In the businesses I manage, I'm the principal shareholder, and that helps me control the situation.'' **********In building his empire, Mr. Arnault seems to make sure he is in control of every block. He and his family have a 40 percent stake in Financiere Agache, and two investment banks that are close to him - Lazard Freres and Worms et Compagnie -each have 10 percent. To gather a war chest, he sold 42 percent of Christian Dior to the public this year for $520 million, but Agache remains majority holder. **********All of which leads the Paris financial community to suspect that Thursday's shareholder meeting will not be the last time they hear about Mr. Arnault and the control of LVMH.

The near certain election of Carlos Salinas de Gotari will accelerate an intellectual revolution that is driving Mexico beyond its defensive, inward-looking past and toward a more receptive, internationalist future. This shift toward globalism offers a tremendous opportunity for improving Mexican-American relations. **********Mexicans are re-examining their place in the world. Mexico turned inward after its 1910 revolution, formulating a foreign policy designed to keep it safe from the designs of an encroaching northern neighbor. A powerful state apparatus directed the nation's energies toward developing local industry and the middle-class consumer market. The state also protected the economy from external competition and its upper and middle classes from a restless peasantry and growing urban proletariat. **********This safe society enjoyed solid growth with low inflation during the 1950's and 60's. In the last 15 years, however, the luster of the ancien regime has been badly tarnished by spiraling stagflation, capital flight, and widening gaps between rich and poor. A growing number of Mexicans believe that the paternalistic state can no longer guarantee economic development or social peace. **********Now, Mexico is turning toward an alternative, globalist perspective based on these tenets: *********** The old policies of protecting do mestic producers from imports have run their course. Mexican industry must now confront global competition. *********** Economic national security can no longer be guaranteed by a rigid state that itself tries to provide jobs, investment and new technology. Closing the doors to internal investment and foreign technologies, and frustrating the drive for integration into the global trading and financial markets would not preserve Mexican sovereignty but only increase its vulnerability. *********** The ''national self'' cannot be the central geopolitical or economic option. Technology, markets and power do not lie primarily in debt-depressed, politically unstable Latin America but in the Pacific basin and North America. **********The Mexican Government has begun to act on these realizations. To force industry to become more efficient and competitive, Mexico has slashed tariffs and joined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. A competitively valued peso is also focusing the attention of Mexico's entrepreneurs on foreign markets. **********The globalists count among their numbers the Harvard-trained social scientist Carlos Salinas and his team of like-minded, often Americantrained technocrats. Nevertheless, the predominance of the globalist approach is far from assured. It still faces formidible opposition from some traditional politicians, government bureaucrats, smaller businessmen and many intellectuals. **********Moreover, several roadblocks stand in the way. To begin with there is stagflation. Unless the three-digit inflation that plagued Mexico in 1987 can be tamed, globalism will become identified with price instability and falling real incomes. **********Next is the problem of foreign debt. Mexicans unanimously want to reduce interest payments that are draining the country of investment capital and fueling inflation. However, the globalists eschew unilateral actions that might frighten the very foreign capitalists they wish to attract. **********Then there is the problem of low investment. Without a return of business confidence, private investors will not create new, world-class industries. Business managers need steadier macroeconomic policies, price stability and expanding markets at home and abroad. **********Social inequity is also a perennial problem for Mexico. Globalists have cleverly attributed Mexico's glaring inequalities to ancien regime policies that guaranteed companies monopoly profits and that subsidized the upper-middle class. However, the strength of political opposition on the left and right indicate that the globalists are vulnerable to the charge that their modernization campaign has lowered real wages and threatens many smaller, less competitive firms. **********Finally, there is continued political disruption. Globalist economics could provide a structural foundation for a flowering of democracy in Mexico. By reducing the power of the fused ruling party-Federal bureaucracy, globalism offers an opening for competing interests. The strategic tasks facing the Salinas administration will be to smoothly manage the transition from a one-party state to a more pluralistic system. **********THESE are serious challenges. The responsibility for overcoming them is Mexico's, but American policy makes a difference: **********First, the net resource transfer from Mexico to international financial markets should be reduced by half. The United States can create a regulatory and political environment that encourages commercial banks to extend new loans or grant relief on old debts. Increased flows from multilateral agencies and capital-surplus countries like Japan can also spur investment and support globalist economic reforms. **********Second, in both bilateral and multi- lateral forums, the United States and Mexico can reciprocally reduce trade barriers and avoid building new ones. **********Third, on the contentious issues of drugs and migration, the United States could abandon unilateral measures in return for a greater Mexican willingness to recognize that their ''domestic'' policies affect American interests and are legitimate topics for negotiations. One possible deal: For the next several years, the United States could agree to accept a larger number of Mexican migrants if Mexico would place greater emphasis on job creation. **********Fourth, the United States can adopt a diplomatic posture that neither undermines the Mexican Government through public scorn nor smothers it in an ostentacious embrace. Matter-of-fact recognition of progress when deserved, and careful and precise criticism when warranted, will most likely stimulate positive responses. **********Such initiatives would not be charity: They are bargains based on reciprocity. Most important, they are rooted in the conviction that it is in America's interest for Mexico's globalists to prosper. A successful Mexican perestroika could provide the United States with a more affluent, democratic, less distant neighbor."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/04/business/company-nes-remy-starts-bid-for-piper.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-10-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 169, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Remy Starts Bid for Piper", "print_headline": "COMPANY NES; Remy Starts Bid for Piper", "body_text": " **********The cognac maker Remy Martin began a bid for a controlling stake in Piper-Heidsieck, one of the last family-owned French champagne concerns. **********The French stockbrokers' association said Remy Martin had made a friendly bid of 2,600 francs, or $410, a share for 45 percent of Piper - 60 percent of which is owned by the Marquis Francois d'Aulan and his family.

The drop reflected traders' worries about a price war among members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. **********For American motorists, the recent declines in oil prices have been enough to prevent the usual summer increase in retail gasoline prices. In fact, gasoline prices are at roughly the same level that motorists paid last July 4th. **********The slide in oil prices led Salvatore Gilbertie, an analyst at Elders Futures Inc., to comment, ''It's 1986 all over again.'' That year, prices fell to $10 a barrel after Saudi Arabia increased its production of crude oil in an attempt to regain the market share it had lost during years of limiting output. The limits had been part of an OPEC strategy to prop up prices. **********The slide in oil prices, which followed OPEC's semiannual meeting in Vienna last month, accelerated this week with reports that the United Arab Emirates would make good its threat to increase production and ignore production quotas set by OPEC. **********''That is a major negative in terms of people's expectations for OPEC discipline,'' said Robert Boslego, an energy analyst at the Boslego Corporation of Winchester, Mass. He said that his monitoring of the loading of crude oil onto tankers indicated that OPEC production was already well above its quota. Non-OPEC oil producers have also been increasing production. **********Mr. Boslego noted that American crude oil stocks were relatively high, at about 360 million barrels. ''That's a real damper on the market,'' he said. **********Andrew Lebow, an oil broker at ED&F Man International, estimated that worldwide inventories are 80 million to 100 million barrels ahead of last year's level. Building Market Share **********Many analysts believe that OPEC's members, unable to hold down production or to push up prices, are now seeking to build their market shares. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are discounting their oil aggressively and will raise production to meet the increased demand that lower prices bring, Mr. Gilbertie said. **********Mr. Lebow observed, ''As long as market share seems to be the guiding philosophy within OPEC, prices are vulnerable.'' **********West Texas Intermediate oil for delivery in the following month, which sold for $17.50 a barrel at the beginning of June, closed yesterday at $14.94. **********That sharp drop has not fully worked its way through to consumers, but it has helped stabilize gasoline prices. No Increases Seen **********Because of the overproduction and inventories, there is little likelihood of a tightening of supply later in the summer that might push up prices. ''From what we see at this end, it looks very, very good,'' said David L. Morehead, the spokesman for the Petroleum Marketers Association of America. **********The American Automobile Association said the national average retail price of gasoline at the end of June was 108.9 cents a gallon, up a tenth of a cent since Memorial Day. In previous years, gasoline has often risen several cents a gallon in June. **********Unleaded gasoline from a self-service pump, the most frequently purchased type of gasoline, averages 95.7 cents a gallon, compared with 96.0 cents at this time last year, the association said. **********According to its survey, self-service leaded regular gasoline is selling for 92.3 cents a gallon on average, and self-service premium unleaded gasoline for 108.6 cents a gallon. At full-service pumps, average prices were 113.5 cents for regular, 118.4 cents for unleaded and 130 cents for premium unleaded gasoline. **********Another expert, Trilby Lundberg, of the Lundberg Survey, which tracks wholesale and retail oil product prices around the country, found that between June 10 and June 24 average gasoline prices had fallen a quarter-cent, to just under $1 a gallon. **********The survey found that prices for a gallon of unleaded gasoline at a self-service pump ranged from 124.56 cents in Honolulu to 79.9 cents in Newark. In Los Angeles, the average was 95.02 cents; in Omaha, 90.47; in Washington, 97.13, and in Manchester, N.H., 95.45. **********Although gasoline prices have fluctuated wildly in recent years, the current price of 108.9 cents is almost the same as the price in 1970, when inflation is taken into account. The average price then was 36 cents, according to the automobile association. The change represents an increase of 202 percent.

It is delivering to 121 affiliated television stations 10 1/2 hours of programming a week - two hours on Saturday, three and a half on Sunday and the rest on weekdays late at night. **********Moreover, the network - the brainchild of Rupert Murdoch, the Australian entrepreneur whose News Corporation owns Fox, and Barry Diller, Fox's chairman - is still convincing advertisers that it can one day become a viable alternative to the three networks, an alternative they would like to have. ''The promise is there and over all they are sticking with it,'' said Jack Otter, a senior vice president at McCann-Erickson, the advertising agency. **********Still, it might be several years before the network, which will almost certainly require tens of millions of dollars in additional investment, pays off. And it is still early to know whether it will become a staple of American television. Mr. Diller and his team must come up with enough hit shows to make the service viable. But part of Fox's fate is out of their hands. If advertiser spending sags, the repercussions could be particularly tough on Fox because advertisers might view it as expendable, agency executives say. **********''There was so much money trying to buy time on the networks last season that the overflow dollars went to Fox,'' said Alec Gerster, executive vice president at Grey Advertising. ''The question is how well Fox will do next season and the one after.'' **********Mr. Diller is bullish. ''Does the world need another network?'' he said in an interview from Fox's headquarters in Los Angeles. ''Not like those that exist. But our entire Fox Broadcasting Company in New York and Los Angeles can fit in half of one floor of their 40-floor buildings. Does the world need a programming service? Yes, if the programming is good.'' Successes and Failures **********So far Fox's program record is mixed. The network is doing best on Sunday night. In that time slot it has successfully pitted series aimed at younger adults and teen-agers against network shows aimed at older audiences, such as ''60 Minutes'' and ''Murder, She Wrote.'' **********Its strongest show is ''21 Jump Street,'' a Fox series about undercover agents in high school. That is followed by a new show, ''America's Most Wanted,'' which broadcasts profiles of the nation's most-wanted criminals and urges viewers to call in any information they might have about them. Afterward come ''Married . . . With Children,'' the saga of a dissatisfied couple, and ''It's Garry Shandling's Show'' and ''The Tracey Ullman Show,'' both comedies. **********Last week Fox's Sunday night shows over all were receiving a 4.3 rating, meaning that 4.3 percent of all households in the United States with televisions were tuned to Fox. Fox had told advertisers it could deliver a 6 rating, several agency executives said. But the programming has improved and advertisers are generally pleased. A Saturday Night Massacre **********Saturday night, however, is a ''disaster,'' according to Michael Drexler, an executive vice president at Bozell, Jacobs, Kenyon & Eckhardt, the advertising agency. The network has attained a 2.9 average rating. **********After several flops, Fox has already introduced one new show, ''Family Double Dare,'' an entertainment/game show that is faring significantly better than its predecessor. A second, ''The Dirty Dozen,'' an adventure series, will debut soon. **********''They have good audience skew because they are going after younger adults 18 to 39, who are believed to be heavy consumers,'' said Mr. Drexler of Fox's Saturday night programs. ''But the ratings are still far from high enough to attract the revenue they really need.'' Troubles on Other Nights **********Fox's weekday late-night programs have also had problems. After the Joan Rivers show's highly publicized debacle, Fox replaced it with ''The Wilton North Report,'' a show that attempted to combine talk and entertainment, and then replaced that with ''The Late Show.'' Ultimately, Fox will pick one. So far this season the rating of ''The Late Show'' has been less than 2. **********''We have to question the wisdom of the late-night show given that the casualties have been endless,'' Mr. Diller said. But there is no indication Fox will give up on late nights. Many Loyal Affiliates **********While a handful of stations have dropped the Saturday night lineup, Fox's affiliates have generally stayed loyal, if somewhat skittish. **********Mr. Diller said the network has done better in attracting independent stations, those unaffiliated with the major networks, than it had anticipated. ''We thought we would have 65 percent coverage of the country and we have 80 percent,'' he said. But most Fox affiliates do not transmit on very high frequency, instead most of them are independent stations that operate on the less-powerful ultrahigh frequency. **********An independent's most profitable hours are 4 P.M. to 8 P.M. Prime time - 8 P.M. to 11 P.M., when the major networks put on their strongest shows - is their weakest period. So the independents are not giving up much in allocating prime time to Fox. Murdoch's Objective **********Mr. Murdoch has an ulterior motive for sticking with a network - a business that is not especially profitable even for ABC, CBS and NBC. He sees a network as a way to enhance the value of the seven independent television stations, including WYNY-TV in New York (formerly WNEW-TV), that he now owns. **********Like all independents, those stations have to buy their programs and greatly rely on old network series and movies. But such programming cannot command the audiences, and hence the advertising dollars, that major network programs can. **********Media executives and analysts invariably point out that Mr. Murdoch has deep pockets and a strong commitment. Morever, they are not counting out the Fox network. They note that it took years for Home Box Office, owned by Time Inc., and Cable News Network, owned by Ted Turner, to make money. A Large Investment **********Still, the investment in the network is a major one even for Mr. Murdoch. His News Corporation had 1987 revenues of $5.3 billion. **********Not only have the network's start-up costs been high, but the profits of Fox's television stations have been flat, according to Jeffrey Russell, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the investment firm. He predicted that their profits would remain flat for the year, in part because of a sluggish economy. **********Mr. Diller countered that the stations have been investing profits in better programming. Like the investment in the network, he said, the investment in the stations will pay off over the long haul."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/11/business/what-s-new-marketing-empty-nesters-coaxing-older-customers-deposit-their-cash.html": {"writer_name": "Hilary Stout", "pub_date": "1988-09-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 593, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Coaxing Older Customers to Deposit Their Cash", "print_headline": "WHAT'S NEW IN MARKETING TO EMPTY NESTERS; Coaxing Older Customers to Deposit Their Cash", "body_text": " **********TEN years ago, executives at Central Fidelity Bank of Richmond, Va. began looking for ways to attract customers.

They got in touch with Claire S. Longden, a financial planner with Butcher & Singer Inc., in New York, because ''we just didn't know, with the amount of money we had, and the number of years until retirement, what was the best course to take,'' the husband said. **********Many people in their 40's and 50's are beginning to plan for retirement and, like this couple, they have a wide range of concerns. Will we have enough money to maintain our standard of living? How should we invest our retirement money? Should we buy a vacation home that we can also use as a retirement home? **********The first step in retirement planning is to determine how much cash you need to cover retirement living expenses. Those with large balances in their company pension plans or individual retirement accounts should not be lulled into a false sense of security. ''Money generally loses half its buying power over 10 years, so what sounds like a lot of money today may not be,'' Ms. Longden said. **********To do the calculations, take your last three bank statements, sort the checks by type of expense, and compute an average for each category. Adjust the figure for retirement by reducing expenses paid on behalf of children and payments for life insurance premiums or mortgages and adding money to be spent on travel and recreation. **********Make an adjustment for inflation using a calculator or financial charts. People who plan to retire in 15 years and expect an annual inflation rate of 7 percent, for example, would use a multiplier of 2.8. So someone who needs $40,000 in today's dollars will need $112,000 annually for retirement. **********Reduce that figure by projected pension benefits. Most companies provide annual statements of amounts accumulated in the pension accounts; some will calculate estimated monthly retirement benefits as well. To complete the financial profile, add in the value of other assets, excluding equity built up in a home. **********''About 95 percent of the people we do this exercise with discover that they won't have enough money,'' said Sharon Goldsten, a financial planner with Pennington/Bass Companies in Lubbock, Tex. Careful investing over ten 10 or 20 years may be able to make up the shortfall. **********Financial planners urge people in their 40's and 50's - many of whom have paid off their mortgages and no longer pay their children's schooling costs - to contribute as much as possible to retirement plans. Tax-deferred savings become more valuable if tax rates rise. **********People who are considering a change in jobs may want to negotiate bonuses from their new employers to compensate for the amount they lose because their pension benefits from the employers they are leaving have not yet become vested, said Edward Mendlowitz, a partner in the New York accounting firm of Siegal, Mendlowitz & Rich. **********Others may want to review their pension arrangements in light of the excise tax included in the 1986 Tax Act. The tax equals 15 percent of annual pension payouts that exceed about $112,500. One option is to shift a portion of earnings into a non-tax-deferred pension plan, which is subject to current tax but not to the excise tax, said James E. Hughes, a partner with the law firm of Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue in New York. **********Furthermore, review the allocation of funds in company pension accounts. Employees often may choose among investments that provide income or growth for their retirement money. Ms. Longden recommends that people in their 40's divide the funds equally between income and growth investments; at age 50, shift 75 percent into income-producing investments; and move entirely into those investments at age 55 because ''you can't afford to lose money at that age,'' she said. **********Similarly, while people in their 40's may still want to invest a portion of their funds in the stock market, those in their 50's might consider a portfolio of municipal bonds, with staggered maturities of 10 to 15 years. That provides a steady stream of money available for reinvestment at the then-prevailing rate, as well as a chance to reorganize the retirement plan in the event that circumstances change. **********One safe way to double money in 10 years is to purchase zero-coupon Treasury bonds. They pay no interest but are sold at a deep discount, and the holder receives the face value of the bond when it matures. A $10,000 Treasury bond maturing in 1997 costs about $4,300 today. Because tax is due annually on the ''imputed interest'' earned, zero-coupon bonds are best suited for Keoghs, I.R.A.'s, and other tax-sheltered accounts. **********Another option is a tax-deferred annuity sold by insurance companies. Earnings build up tax free, so someone who invests $75,000 in an annuity that earns 9 percent interest will have $188,375 after 15 years, assuming an effective Federal, state and local tax bracket of 38 percent.Invested in a certificate of deposit, the money would have earned only $169,350, assuming the same 38 percent tax bracket. There is a 10 percent penalty for withdrawals from annuities before you reach age 59 1/2. **********PEOPLE who expect to stay with the same company until retirement may want to find out whether they must take retirement benefits in monthly payments rather than a lump sum. Those who cannot take lump sums can choose to receive either certain monthly amounts over their lifetime or a smaller monthly amount plus a stipend to be paid to their spouses after their death. **********Ms. Goldsten recommends choosing the larger monthly benefit and using the difference to purchase a life insurance policy that provides payment to the spouse. Such programs are best put in place during your 50's, before insurance premiums become prohibitive. **********Others in their mid-50's may find extra cash by stopping premium payments on their whole life insurance policies, if the company permits (this means that the policy will still be in effect, but the benefit level will not continue to increase). They can also decrease the amount of their coverage. Premiums rise with age, and life insurance usually is not as critical for older couples who are no longer supporting their children. **********It is also worthwhile to consider where you want to live during retirement. ''One mistake lots of people make is to sell everything when they hit 65, move to Florida, and then find out they don't like it,'' said Steven B. Enright of Seidman Financial Services in New York. He suggests vacationing in areas that look attractive for retirement to learn more about them. **********Finally, do a rough calculation of your retirement finances each year, to account for any changes. ''It isn't enough to look at this once when you're 45,'' Mr. Enright said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/03/business/business-technology-advances-in-drugs-courtesy-of-computers.html": {"writer_name": "Barnaby Feder", "pub_date": "1988-08-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1368, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advances in Drugs, Courtesy of Computers", "print_headline": "BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY; Advances in Drugs, Courtesy of Computers", "body_text": " **********Drug companies are not ready to abandon the ''spray and pray'' random sampling of compounds to find potential new drugs, but excitement is growing about using computers to design tomorrow's pharmaceuticals in a more rational way. **********While the field of computer-designed drugs is still in its infancy, several companies have products in clinical trials that computers helped formulate, and last year start-up ventures that sell software and modeling equipment for such work had an estimated $25 million in sales. **********Computer-aided design swept through the automotive and aerospace industries, among others, during the 1970's and quickly spread as far afield as architecture and civil engineering. About $6.7 billion was spent on such systems last year, according to the International Data Corporation, a market research firm based in Natick, Mass. **********But drug companies and those trying to supply the equipment for computer-aided drug design say that the challenge of creating a drug for something as incomprehensibly complex and constantly changing as a human body simply cannot be compared to building a Buick or a bridge. ''This whole field is still in the research stage,'' said Myra Williams, executive director of information resources and strategic planning for Merck & Company, which has been working on computer-aided drug design since 1973. **********The conventional method for creating a drug starts with endless and largely random sampling of compounds to find ones that show signs of having a biological impact, such as slowing tumor cell reproduction. Companies typically screen 5,000 or more substances before finding a compound that can be formulated so it is both safe and effective. 'Spray and Pray' **********Most companies continue to invest in automating this ''spray and pray'' process. Nevertheless, computer researchers say enough progress has been made that it has finally become easy to persuade upper management to bet some research money on their approach. **********''It's more or less taken for granted now that resources will be available for this,'' said Dr. Yvonne Martin, co-leader of the computer-assisted molecular design team in the pharmaceuticals division of Abbott Laboratories. ''It's impossible to oversell the potential.'' **********The idea that computers can replace blind luck is based on the declining cost of computing power and advances in laboratory equipment that are giving researchers their first good glimpse of how interactions between individual molecules cause or combat diseases. Many bodily functions and reactions begin when molecules on the surface of cells bind to hormones, enzymes or other molecules. **********X-ray machines and newer devices, like nuclear magnetic resonance machines, are used to capture images of how cells are acting. The machines are allowing researchers to create atom-by-atom maps of some of these receptors and the molecules that bind to them. That opens the door to using computers to generate images of molecules that might fit the site and for simulations of how the binding would occur. A Lock-and-Key Metaphor **********The process is often described as studying a biological lock and then creating the specifications for a key. The key is the active ingredient in a new drug. It may activate a receptor or simply block a hormone or other natural key from getting in and starting a reaction that doctors would like to inhibit. **********The lock-and-key metaphor is, however, a bit misleading. Unlike a typical lock, receptors are constantly vibrating and moving. They often react differently at different times to chemical keys, depending on what is going on around them in the body, or respond to various combinations of keys in different ways. Drug designers have to worry not just about the geometric fit but also about electrical balances and a variety of other atomic forces. **********In some cases, researchers are trying to determine the characteristics of the receptors on the basis of what is already known about the chemical keys, which are usually smaller compounds like peptides. **********''It's an extraordinarily floppy kind of thing,'' said William Ripka, head of the molecular-modeling and drug-design group at E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company's medical products division in Wilmington, Del. ''You don't know what shape a peptide is taking when it is binding to the receptor, and one made up of a chain of just five amino acids might have a million different conformations if you add up all the different ways its parts could be rotated.'' Computers Seek Patterns **********Computer programs can help by running through various possible arrangements looking for energy patterns or other characteristics the molecules are likely to favor. But ultimately what is provided is a three-dimensional guess. **********''We are a long way from being able to fully simulate such systems, even with supercomputers,'' said Keith Davis, chairman of Chemical Design Ltd., a leading supplier of computer modeling software and hardware based in Oxford, England. **********Nonetheless, the modeling has become much more successful. One reason is rapid strides in computer graphics. **********Chemists can rotate the three-dimensional images they make, zoom in on the images of key clusters of atoms, and strip the peripheral clusters from the backbone of the molecule to get a better view of its skeleton. They can also pull models of compounds from data bases and simulate what they would look like if added to the molecules. They can also run programs that calculate the chemical and energy characteristics of various shapes the molecule might take. Making Movies of Systems **********At companies like Du Pont, software from such suppliers as the Polygen Corporation of Waltham, Mass., is being used to make movies of how these biological systems may actually move and flex over time. Such sophistication is costly. Basic software packages may typically cost as little as $10,000 but complete systems run as high as $350,000, according to Michael Wagner, head of the computational chemistry products group at Molecular Design Ltd., a software company in San Leandro, Calif. **********Most researchers think that artificial intelligence programs will play a growing role in helping chemists choose which compounds to try in their simulations. **********Skeptics complain that computer wizards often have too little practical knowledge of synthetic chemistry, which leads such researchers to suggest building compounds that experience shows will be extremely expensive and time-consuming but unlikely to work in animals or humans. **********A number of computer researchers say there is truth to such charges. But they point out that synthetic chemists may be overly reluctant to follow suggestions for complicated compounds because many are paid, at least in part, according to the number they synthesize in a year. **********Drug companies are finding that the best way to overcome such problems is to create interdisciplinary teams with a variety of computer and chemistry skills to exploit the new technology. But such efforts may go slowly until a number of teams come up with major products.  A Prescription for Creating Drugs: Computers That Model Molecule Interactions  1 An X-ray of a crystallized form of phospholipase A2, an enzyme involved in inflammation, gives Du Pont researchers an image of electron distribution. Computers then calculate where atoms are, on average, and where they bond to each other. Here is a fragment of a recent 3-D image of the enzyme's structure (dark lines) within its electron envelope.  2 Researchers zero in on the region of the enzyme shaped to bind with other molecules in the inflammation process, pick out the atomic groups (darkened lines) at the active site, and have the computer depict (small dots) their surfaces.  3 Researchers make computer images of compounds likely to fit the shape of the binding site. Other binding problems, like the location of positive and negative charges, are factored in.  4 A compound designed to block the enzyme's activity is modeled to interact with the entire enzyme. Promising structures like this one are passed to synthetic chemists who make the compound for testing on live tissues.

Gorbachev for the change of political climate that made his visit possible. But the President's advisers said today that he was eager to preach his ideas to the Soviet people, and would still make human rights ''agenda item No. 1'' at the summit meeting, which begins in Moscow on Sunday. **********In a 34-minute interview with Soviet television, which was taped in Washington last week and shown in Moscow tonight, the President was asked if he could have ''imagined the possibility of your upcoming visit to Moscow'' when he was first elected more than seven years ago. The Gorbachev Difference **********''Probably not,'' he replied, ''because very frankly, I have to say I think there is a difference between this General Secretary and other leaders of your country that I had met with in the past. I don't think they had any dreams of perestroika.'' **********He was using the Russian word for restructuring, which Mr. Gorbachev has used to describe his program of economic and social change. **********Earlier this week Soviet officials said that by stressing human rights, Mr. Reagan might be harming relations between the two countries. And White House aides confirmed today that at least two dissidents invited to meet with Mr. Reagan in Moscow had been harassed by Soviet officials. **********When President Reagan was asked for his feelings about the trip by the Soviet interviewers, he answered: ''I'm obviously looking forward to the trip for one reason, because I have never been there. And I'm looking forward to seeing your country and, well, as much as possible with the meetings that will be going on.'' **********Mr. Reagan was interviewed by the Soviet journalists Valentin Zorin and Boris Kalyagin. At one point, he was asked what works of Lenin he had read, since he has quoted the founder of the Soviet state in his speeches. Mr. Reagan did not respond directly, but said that he had read Karl Marx in college. **********Mr. Reagan's interview with the Soviet journalists was aired at 9:40 P.M. Moscow time after the popular evening news program Vremya, which draws an estimated 150 million viewers, according to Soviet statistics. The text of the interview was released earlier in Helsinki to reporters traveling with the Presidential party. 'Curious About It All' **********As the President met with his advisers and went over his briefing books today, Marlin Fitzwater, his spokesman, described Mr. Reagan's mood this way: ''I know he's curious about it all, curious to see what the city looks like, and curious to see how people react to his ideas.'' **********''He's also anxious to see Gorbachev,'' the spokesman added. ''He thinks they can do business together. The President considers him an important development in U.S.-Soviet relations.'' **********In a briefing for reporters here, Rozanne L. Ridgway, the Assistant Secretary of State for European and Canadian Affairs, said that Mr. Reagan would make human rights ''agenda item No. 1'' during the summit meeting. But she and other Administration officials declined to criticize Soviet officials for expressing irritation at the emphasis on human rights, or for harassing dissidents invited to meet with Mr. Reagan on Monday. **********''We don't want to get into a public argument before the summit,'' Mr. Fitzwater said. Another Administratiom official said the White House was following a careful policy of playing down incidents that could impair the climate of good will at the meeting. **********The White House has invested much in the summit meeting because it is the highlight of the President's final year in office, and a chance to turn public attention away from some of his problems at home. **********But it is also an important moment in the evolution of Mr. Reagan, from hard-line anti-Communist to a man who refers to the Soviet leader as a close friend. **********One reason for this evolution is the warm relationship Mr. Reagan feels he has developed with the Soviet leader. As Mr. Reagan told five European journalists in an interview last week, ''We can debate and discuss, and I think he is very sincere about the progressive ideas that he is introducing there and the changes that he thinks should be made.'' **********Mr. Reagan added, in the Soviet interview, that his more open policy toward the Soviet Union also reflects a broad political consensus in the United States. **********He predicted that his successor would continue his policies and said, ''I think that our people want this.'' **********But while Mr. Reagan regards Mr. Gorbacehv as a friend, he regards the Soviet system itself as an enemy. Example of Religion **********One example he offered in the Soviet television interview was religion. ''I've just wondered,'' he said, ''if there isn't a field there in your own country for more openness and the allowing of people to practice religion in the ways they chose - and here we call it separation of church and state.'' **********The interviewers noted that Mr. Reagan frequently quotes Lenin about the ''expansionist aims of Soviet Communists.'' Then Mr. Zorin asked the President to list the works of Lenin he had read. **********''Oh, my,'' replied the President, who is known for repeating facts and stories that are sometimes hard to verify. **********He went on to describe how he had read Marx in college, and that Marx had argued that ''communism could only succeed when the whole world had become communist.'' **********''So I wasn't making anything up,'' the President said. ''These were the things we were told.'' **********The questioners asked Mr. Reagan why, if America was a democracy, he continued to pursue a policy in Nicaragua that was opposed by the Congress. **********The President replied that Congressmen only represented individual states and districts, while the President had responsibility for ''national security.'' **********''And that is a duty he cannot shirk,'' the President said. **********In a refelction of Soviet sensitivity to the human rights issue, the President was asked if he also discussed human rights with right-wing dictators, such as Gen. Alfredo Stroessner of Paraguay. **********The President said that he did, and then gave a little lesson in pressure politics and interest groups. **********Mr. Reagan pointed out that one reason for the emphasis on human rights in the Soviet Union was the large number of Americans who trace their ancestry to that country, and watch events there carefully. **********''Government is influenced by public opinion,'' he said, adding that one of eight Americans has roots ''in your area.'' **********''And so we can get along and make treaties much better with each other as governments,'' Mr. Reagan said. ''If our people are not rebellious about something that your Government is doing to what they consider their ancestry.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/03/business/fannie-mae-set-to-price-500-million-issue.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-10-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 418, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fannie Mae Set to Price $500 Million Issue", "print_headline": "Fannie Mae Set to Price $500 Million Issue", "body_text": " **********Treasury financings this week are confined to the bill market, starting with today's regular weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills. **********By late in the day Friday, the rate for three-month Treasury bills was 7.26 percent, while the rate for six-month bills was 7.46 percent. **********Among Government agencies, the Federal National Mortgage Association plans to announce tomorrow the interest rate for a $500 million issue of indexed sinking-fund debentures due in 1993, which will replace the regular October sale.

Bilzerian, the Florida financier, moved into the roomy offices on the 11th floor of the Singer Company's Stamford, Conn., headquarters in February, shortly after winning his first takeover fight. **********But Singer's chairman says he has been too busy selling off the company piecemeal to enjoy the view. ''There's a bay out there somewhere,'' Mr. Bilzerian told a visitor recently, pointing over his shoulder at Long Island Sound. Four months after Mr. Bilzerian completed the acquisition and began peddling Singer's 12 operating units, he is on the verge of cashing in on what will probably be one of the last highly lucrative corporate breakups. **********He has closed or signed deals to sell seven businesses for a total of $1.7 billion. Mr. Bilzerian's acquisition costs, including interest payments on new and assumed debt, have totaled $1.9 billion. Valued at $632 Million **********Those sales will leave him with five businesses and some miscellaneous corporate assets that analysts and investment bankers conservatively estimate could fetch $632 million. **********Thus, after paying taxes, liabilities and other investors, it appears that Bilzerian Partners L.P. 1, a group controlled by Mr. Bilzerian, will reap a minimum of $90 million, with about half going to Mr. Bilzerian. **********Analysts are astonished by Mr. Bilzerian's success. ''I was a big skeptic,'' said Thomas O. Lloyd-Butler of Montgomery Securities. ''I was wrong.'' **********Chances are neither Mr. Bilzerian nor anyone else will be able to repeat the feat. Singer fell in the waning days of 1987, before changes in the tax law greatly increased the cost of dismantling such companies. **********How Mr. Bilzerian, a 38-year-old who lost at least four takeover fights before winning Singer, got to do the honors depended greatly on developments that he could not have anticipated. ''In the final analysis, luck and timing had a lot to do with it,'' said Gordon Bitter, until recently Singer's chief financial officer. **********A key event was the death of Joseph B. Flavin, Singer's longtime chairman, on the eve of the takeover fight. His death on Oct. 7 left the company with little resolve to resist the $50-a-share tender offer that Mr. Bilzerian made on Nov. 2, and it capitulated rather quickly. **********Equally important, the October stock market collapse frightened away potential rival bidders. **********In addition, the insistence of Singer or its investment banker, Goldman, Sachs & Company - it is not clear which - that the company be sold in one piece alienated potential friendly buyers, who did not want to dismantle the company just to get a few choice morsels. **********''I guess some of us missed the boat,'' said Warren Sinsheimer, deputy chief executive of the Plessey Company, a British concern that later purchased Singer's electronic systems division for $310 million from Mr. Bilzerian. **********Mr. Bilzerian's biggest break came on Dec. 16, the day the bids were due. On that day, Congress abruptly eliminated a loophole in the tax code that had enabled acquirers to pay lower capital-gains taxes when they sold off parts of the acquired business. But Congress exempted from the law any outstanding tender offers, including Mr. Bilzerian's. Given that edge, the few companies still contemplating taking on Mr. Bilzerian decided to bow out. **********Without the tax break, Singer would probably have to declare an additional $500 million in capital gains on its divestiture program and pay an additional $175 million in taxes, said David Redmond, a Singer consultant at Peat Marwick Main & Company. 'Last Guys Out the Door' **********Mr. Bilzerian declined to discuss the tax breaks. ''I don't want to rub it into some Congressman that we were the last guys out the door with a bundle of cash,'' said Mr. Bilzerian, who already has his hands full with the Securities and Exchange Commission's continuing investigation into his business affairs. (In lawsuits against third parties, the commission has made accusations that Mr. Bilzerian may have violated securities laws by concealing the extent of various stock holdings. So far it has brought no charges against Mr. Bilzerian, who has steadfastly denied any wrongdoing. While the S.E.C. is investigating Mr. Bilzerian's role in several takeover attempts, the Singer deal has not been mentioned in any court documents.) Terry W. Heil, a 22-year Singer veteran who stayed to help Mr. Bilzerian with the divestitures, estimated that Mr. Bilzerian and senior management distributed more than 300 selling brochures in five countries, conducted slide-show briefings for some 70-odd finalists and opened a ''data room'' with important documents to buyers when the talks turned serious. Acted Like Game-Show Hosts **********Mr. Bilzerian's bankers at Shearson Lehman Hutton acted like game-show hosts urging contestants to ''come on down,'' said David H. Race, president of Toronto-based CAE Industries, which bought Singer's Link Flight Simulation Division for $550 million. **********Still, there were snags. Many of the best-heeled military contractors have become wary of acquisitions because of the Government's efforts to limit military spending. Others balked at paying $300 million and up for some of Singer's pieces when they could have bought the whole company six months earlier for a billion and change. Best Profit Margins **********That coolness may have been responsible for an about-face by Mr. Bilzerian. Initially, he wanted to keep Singer's power-tool and floor-care-products unit and its gas-meter operation, known within Singer as ''motors and meters,'' as a beachhead for future acquisitions. These easy-to-understand businesses had the best operating profit margins of the lot: 11 percent compared with 4 percent for most of the military businesses. **********As it turned out, everything went on the block in late April, when the merger became final, and ''motors'' was the first to go in July when Ryobi Ltd., a Japanese company, agreed to pay $325 million for it. Three weeks later, Mr. Bilzerian accepted a $132 million offer from Ruhrgas A.G. of West Germany for ''meters.'' **********Foreign corporations also scooped up three of the five military-related units sold. The weak dollar, which has lowered the price of all American corporations in other major currencies, has raised foreign interest in military contractors as well. **********Still, Mr. Bilzerian has not always been able to obtain top dollar. Dalmo Victor, which makes radar warning devices, fetched only $175 million, a mere $1 million more than what Singer had paid Textron for it in 1986, when Dalmo Victor had lower sales. **********Now, with Singer on the verge of prepaying its debt, Mr. Bilzerian and his investment bankers at Shearson Lehman Hutton are turning their attention to the remaining business units, which represent their profit on the deal: Kearfott Guidance and Navigation Systems; Librascope, which makes submarine electronics; Link Industrial, which produces power-plant simulators, and the commercial end of SimuFlite, which trains business and commercial pilots. (Industry sources say Singer has a handshake deal to sell the fifth business, Link Miles, the international arm of the simulation business, for $175 million to an as-yet-unnamed buyer.) Other odds and ends include a 40 percent stake in a joint venture with Mitsubishi Precision that is worth at least $40 million, and a 27 percent stake in SSMC Inc., the sewing machine business that Singer spun off as an independent company in 1986. **********SSMC has offered to pay the prevailing market price for the stake -$42 million. But Mr. Bilzerian has demanded an undisclosed premium, according to William F. Andrews, SSMC's chairman. Lest the company treat his demands lightly, Mr. Bilzerian has taken a seat on SSMC's board and has alerted the Securities and Exchange Commission that he might force a change in control at the company. $90 Million in Its Kitty When Singer's parts are sold, Singer will end up with $361 million. Taxes should skim $101 million from that, and other liabilities $70 million. As part of the financing agreements, Shearson is entitled to 10 percent of the after-tax profits and Mesa Holdings L.P., a partnership controlled by T. Boone Pickens, is entitled to 20 percent. **********A buyout of the preferred shareholders would cost Mr. Bilzerian at least $43 million. That would leave Bilzerian Partners owning 100 percent of the common equity of a company with $90 million in its kitty. **********Mr. Bilzerian would have to pay more in personal taxes if he liquidated the company to withdraw the cash. But he says he plans to leave the money inside Singer, where he can tap it for future acquisitions. ''I don't need to take it home and touch it,'' he said. Little From His Pockets **********The feat is even more remarkable considering how little of the $1.7 billion in financing came from Mr. Bilzerian's own pockets. Bilzerian Partners paid $87 million for the initial 2.1-million-share stake in Singer, but the bulk of the financing came from banks, which lent $1.15 billion that has already been repaid. Shearson and Mesa, which provided the rest, will be well rewarded. **********Shearson should collect about $50 million from various fees and $20 million in profits from the divestitures. Mesa should reap at least $16 million in fees and interest and $40 million in profits. **********Severance packages approaching $20 million and a robust labor market in Stamford have certainly eased the pain for the 200 Stamford employees who are losing jobs. And division managers say Mr. Bilzerian respected their wishes as much as possible during the divestiture process. Management's Preference Honored **********For instance, the three bids for Dalmo Victor were virtually the same. So Mr. Bilzerian sold the company to General Instrument, the suitor preferred by Dalmo Victor's management. **********If this does not sound like the typical breakup transaction, that is because Mr. Bilzerian has always been an iconoclast. He dropped out of high school because he refused to conform to the school's no-jeans dress code. After earning a high school diploma in the Army, he graduated with honors from Stanford University and earned a master's degree in business at Harvard."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/13/world/gorbachev-listens-to-the-people-and-gets-an-earful.html": {"writer_name": "Bill Keller", "pub_date": "1988-09-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 810, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Gorbachev Listens to the People and Gets an Earful", "print_headline": "Gorbachev Listens to the People and Gets an Earful", "body_text": " **********Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, reappeared in public today after a six-week absence and ran into the angry distress of the Soviet consumer in an unusual televised encounter with central Siberians. **********At his first stop on a barnstorming visit to the vast region of Krasnoyarsk, Mr. Gorbachev was confronted by a contentious crowd shouting complaints about shortages of food and housing. **********''Go to our stores, Mikhail Sergeyevich, there is nothing there!'' a woman called out, as the Soviet leader stopped by the roadside on his way into the city of Krasnoyarsk from the airport. **********A man yelled: ''Lines everywhere! For meat, for sausage, for everything!'' Frustration and Discontent **********The heckling did not appear to be intended as personal criticism of Mr. Gorbachev, but instead seemed to be an attempt to draw his attention to the frustration and discontent that threatens to swamp his program of economic change before it is fully in place. **********The broadcast of the encounter tonight on the main television news program, Vremya, was apparently designed to show the Soviet leader grappling with the real concerns of the public. **********Appearing refreshed by his annual vacation on the Crimean Peninsula, Mr. Gorbachev calmly and cheerfully engaged the crowd. **********''I get your meaning and I know what you're talking about,'' he said. **********He acknowledged that Siberia had suffered more than other regions from Moscow's inclination to spend billions of rubles on giant industrial complexes while neglecting housing, food, kindergartens and other needs. 'We've Got to Correct That' **********''It's not right,'' the Soviet leader declared. ''We've got to correct that.'' **********A skeptic shot back from the crowd: ''That won't happen!'' **********Soviet television normally broadcasts excerpts from Mr. Gorbachev's meetings with the public when he travels about the country, but he has never been shown encountering such frank unhappiness. **********It is a standard joke in the Soviet Union that when top officials travel they are shown only freshly painted apartments and stores with shelves generously stocked for the occasion. Tonight's broadcast was evidently intended to show that Mr. Gorbachev will not fall for such tricks. **********After his most heated exchange with residents in Krasnoyarsk, one doubter shouted: ''Will this all be shown on television, or will they cut out half of it? Tell us the truth!'' ''I don't command that,'' Mr. Gorbachev said with a broad smile. Anger Over High Prices **********At a later stop, Mr. Gorbachev listened as residents complained about the high prices at the new private shops and restaurants that have grown up under his program of tolerating limited free enterprise. **********Mr. Gorbachev defended his policy, saying that only by opening more private businesses could the country generate the competition that will ultimately bring down prices. **********The Soviet leader was last seen in public July 30, when he met the West German Foreign Minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, at the Kremlin. Although his whereabouts were not announced, Western diplomats said they were told in early August that Mr. Gorbachev had left on vacation. **********Mr. Gorbachev has made a custom of returning from vacation with a highly visible trip to some region of the country, to show that he is in touch with the people. The trips often include a major speech, and Soviet journalists said today that they expect one this week. **********His appearances in Krasnoyarsk may provide some clues as to where the Soviet leader plans to focus his attention in the coming months. Key Votes and Restive Minorities **********He returns to face not only growing impatience about food supplies, but increasingly assertive minorities in several republics and a crucial series of elections for party and government positions that are supposed to demonstrate a new commitment to democracy. **********During his absence, the second-ranking Soviet leader, Yegor K. Ligachev, made oblique attacks on the general directions of Mr. Gorbachev's foreign and domestic policies, criticizing the emphasis on peaceful coexistence with the West and the fascination with market-style economics. **********Krasnoyarsk, an industrial city of 1 million people, is probably best known in the United States because of the huge radar station located in nearby Abalakovo. **********The United States has cited the radar as a violation of the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty, and warned that there can be no further Soviet-American arms agreements until the installation is dismantled. **********Mr. Gorbachev made no reference to the radar in his comments tonight, and a senior Western diplomat said he would be surprised if the Soviet leader focused on the issue during his visit."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/13/business/graham-family-power-upheld.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-05-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 137, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Graham Family Power Upheld", "print_headline": "Graham Family Power Upheld", "body_text": " **********The Washington Post Company said yesterday that its shareholders had approved an amendment to the company's charter that affirms the power of Katharine Graham, the chairman and chief executive, and her family to accept or reject any acquisition proposal. **********Specifically, the amendment gives the holders of the 2.1 million shares of class A stock the sole right to answer any takeover offers. **********The class A shares, all of which are owned by the Graham family, are not traded publicly.

Suddenly, though, other kinds of financial innovators are in the limelight. **********The product that caught Wall Street's imagination last week was christened with an unprepossessing name - unbundled stock units - but it has the potential to have a big impact on the financial world. It is too early to say how this new technique, designed by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., will fare, but four blue-chip corporations - American Express, Dow Chemical, Pfizer and Sara Lee - have already signed on to convert up to 20 percent of their common stock, and other Wall Street houses are racing to analyze the plan and possibly create their own. **********In effect, the approach transforms each share of ordinary common stock into three different securities - a bond, an unusual type of preferred stock and a long-term option on the company's stock at a set price. **********The logic behind this technique has caught the attention of corporate officials. Although a company will be paying out the same amount of cash to investors as it is now, by turning dividend payments on stock into interest payments on debt, the company will be able to save millions of dollars in taxes each year because interest payments to bondholders are tax deductible, while dividend payments are not. **********''As we were evaluating how much each of the securities might be worth, we found we were looking at companies in much the same way that leveraged buyout firms do,'' said Ronald Gallatin, a managing director of Shearson who led the team that developed the securities. Indeed, the same tax advantages are a big incentive for such buyouts. **********Investors, on the other hand, will be able to fine tune their portfolios more closely. Investors who are interested in growth and appreciation, for example, could opt for the equity certificates or combine them with the preferred, while those interested in steady income who wanted to avoid the risk of the stock market, could buy the bonds. **********But while there is a logic - and elegance - to the scheme, slicing common stocks into these component parts raises many questions for investors, for corporations and for the economy. **********One of the most obvious posed last week was the loss of tax revenue for the United States Treasury. If only a few companies follow this route, the tax loss will be sizable, but limited. It is estimated, for example, that Sara Lee will save more than $15 million on taxes the first year, an amount that would rise to more than $83 million in the final year the bonds are outstanding, for a total of more than $1 billion over the 30-year period. If corporate America embraces this technique, the sums could mount quickly, putting pressure on Congress to deal with the differing tax treatments of debt and equity. **********There are less obvious issues too. One is the ownership of the corporation. The companies now proposing to make the swaps plan to exchange the new units for up to 20 percent of their shares, but there are no obvious reasons why that could not go higher. At some point, the excess debt would overwhelm the remaining equity, but somewhat higher ratios appear possible. Depending on the level chosen, the number of common shares could shrink considerably, making ownership more concentrated. **********There are questions for corporations, too. If all goes as planned, 30 years from now the units would, in effect, be recombined into shares. If that happens, a company will have benefited from some very large tax savings. It also will have posted increases in reported earnings per share during those 30 years, since it will have fewer shares outstanding. But if its share price has not risen high enough to make it worthwhile for investors to redeem the warrants, the company would face a huge bill. **********A corporation's responsibilities to its investors seem to grow more complicated, too, under this plan. Its traditional fiduciary responsibility is to maximize shareholder interest. It also has contractual obligations to pay interest to bondholders. **********Its obligations under the new plan are less clear, particularly with respect to the holders of the new preferred and the equity certificates. If a company raises its dividends rather than investing more money in the corporation, the preferred holders benefit, but share prices may not rise as fast, and neither will the equity-appreciation certificates. The reverse would hold if it keeps dividend growth small. **********One thing the securities probably won't do, at least directly, is affect takeover bids. Under the provisions of the securities, someone who wanted to take over a company would have to buy the new package of securities at the same price as the stock. **********But, as one rival investment banker put it, ''This is a first-generation product.'' If these succeed, he said, the next round of similar recapitalizations could include strong anti-takeover language in the provisions of some of the securities. **********Nonetheless, these securities could make raids on companies more difficult in another way. Those shareholders who exchange their shares for the new units will give up their votes in corporate elections. It is institutions, the very shareholders who are most likely to vote against management in proxy fights, who are expected to make the switch. Since individual investors generally vote with management, some incumbent managements might survive when they would have been ousted. **********As for investors, small shareholders are not likely to exchange their shares for the units, largely because they would have to pay taxes on the switch. And owners of the bonds would face heavy tax bills, which is one reason the bonds are expected to be held by tax-exempt institutions like pension funds. **********But even institutional money managers may not rush to convert shares into these new units. Despite their attractions, they have no track record, and no one knows how they will trade in the marketplace. If there is not active trading, such investors might find it difficult to buy or sell when they want to, or to do so without pushing the market price up or down sharply. ''Liquidity is critically important,'' said Mary Ellen Johnson, the treasurer of Sara Lee, who believes efficient markets will develop. **********Whatever the questions, Shearson has stolen a march on the rest of Wall Street. Even if others introduce similar instruments, Shearson's innovativeness will remain in people's minds for some time to come. If the product catches on - still a big if - it would be the first big financial innovation since the birth of organized trading in options and financial futures contracts in the 1970's. **********Perhaps significantly, the unbundled stock units are to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The last waves of innovation were pioneered by exchanges in Chicago, which were able to act in part because New York was haughty and confident that only stocks and bonds were real investments. That confidence is now shaken. **********For Shearson, last week was the culmination of a year-long development effort by investment bankers. They persuaded four blue-chip companies to adopt it, and other corporations are said to be considering similar steps. **********Shearson was just one of the firms looking for ways to carve up the attributes of a share of stock into different securities. Mr. Gallatin, who headed Shearson's team, was already known as an innovator for his invention of money-market preferred stock. **********At first, the team, which also included Richard P. Roelofs and Anthony T. Garcia, tried to divide shares into two components, one representing dividends and the other capital appreciation. But in January, E. Philip Jones, a former associate professor of finance at Harvard University's business school, who had recently joined Shearson, suggested that shares really had three attributes that attracted investors: the current dividend, possible dividend increases and possible capital gains. That perception led to the new proposal. Once the proposal was shaped, the next job was to assure that it would pass regulatory muster. That task fell to Raymond W. Wagner, a partner in the law firm of Simpson, Thatcher & Bartlett. **********In a world where gossip is endemic, Shearson did remarkably well in keeping the plans from the rest of Wall Street. The idea was presented to 40 companies several months ago, but word of how the deals would be structured leaked out only a few days before the formal announcement. **********Now that the product is public, its future is by no means assured. The first big test is whether it can clear Securities and Exchange Commission scrutiny. Two Columbia University law professors, Jeffrey Gordon and Bernard Black, say it violates an S.E.C. rule aimed at limiting recapitalizations designed to reduce shareholders' voting rights. The N.Y.S.E., which is supposed to enforce the rule, is asking the S.E.C. to modify it, but will not say if the securities could be listed without changing the rule. **********Those who are issuing the securities would love to see the parts of the puzzle trade at a total price higher than the shares they replaced, and would like it even more if the market valuations of the pieces helped to push up the prices of the remaining shares. If that does happen, it would no doubt stimulate more companies to take similar steps.  PUTTING A VALUE ON SARA LEE'S SECURITIES  To see how the new securities would work, consider the Sara Lee plan. Sara Lee proposes to take back up to 22.2 million shares of stock, or 20 percent of the shares now outstanding. Its shares closed last week at $45.25, up 75 cents in part on positive reaction to the plan. **********The first security, the bond, will pay annual interest of $1.44, the current dividend of Sara Lee stock, and be redeemed for $120 at maturity in 30 years. The second security, known as the incremental dividend preferred, will pay the same amount as any dividends Sara Lee pays on its common stock, less the current $1.44 payout. So if the company raised its annual payout to $1.54, the incremental dividend preferred would collect 10 cents a year. After 30 years, the company can buy back the preferred for $3 a share. **********The last security, known as an Equity Appreciation Certificate, gives the holder the right, in 30 years, to buy a share of stock for $123, the value of the two other securities at that point. If all goes well, shares retired in 1989 will be reissued in 2019. **********For the company, the advantages of the securities compared with common stock are clear. The $32 million in dividends that Sara Lee has been paying each year on the shares it proposes to reacquire is not tax deductible. When it pays the same amount as interest on the bonds, that will count as a corporate tax deduction. At the corporate rate of 34 percent, it saves $10.9 million a year. **********In fact, the savings are much greater than that, and they will grow each year. That is because the biggest value in the bonds stems not from the annual interest payment but from the growth in the value of the bond, as it approaches being worth $120 in 2019. Each year, Sara Lee is allowed to deduct the estimated increase in the bond's value as if it had paid that amount in interest. In the first year, that increase would amount to about $13.5 million, saving Sara Lee another $4.6 million in taxes. The amount will gradually grow, and for the entire 30 years, Sara Lee will save about $1.1 billion in taxes. (Conversely, each year the I.R.S. would expect an investor to pay taxes on the same amount. But the bonds are expected to be held by pension funds, which are exempt from taxation, so the Government will lose revenue.) Moreover, the accounting rules are such that Sara Lee will be able to compute earnings per share - a key figure watched by investors and securities analysts - as if those shares had vanished. The result will be higher reported earnings per share. Some accountants have protested that that treatment is misleading, but they concede that it conforms to accounting rules. **********The risk for the company is also clear. What if, in 2019, its shares sell for less than $123? Then Sara Lee must come up with $2.7 billion to redeem the bonds. But it would not get a similar cash inflow since the holders of the equity appreciation certificates would not opt to redeem their warrants. **********Will Sara Lee shareholders line up to swap their shares for this new package of securities? For tax reasons, most individuals are not expected to do so. But those tax problems don't apply to institutions, like pension plans, and it is to them that the marketing effort is being directed. **********A big question for such institutions will be how the new securities will trade. While it is clear that by the year 2019, the package of securities will be worth at least as much as a share of stock, there is no guarantee that they will trade for as much in the meantime. They could trade for more or less, depending on how investors view them. Moreover, if trading is inactive, then the markets could be illiquid, subject to big fluctuations if any investor wanted to buy or sell a large quantity of securities. **********The bonds would appeal primarily to tax-free institutions because taxable investors would have to pay tax on the bonds' price appreciation, even though they would have minimal cash income. Some Individual Retirement Accounts might find them attractive, however. **********The other securities could find a retail market, however. The incremental dividend preferred would provide a way to bet on a company raising its dividend. Speculative buyers who believed that Sara Lee stock was sure to rise could get more bang for their bucks by buying the equity-appreciation certificate rather than common stock. **********How much will the securities be worth? The computers were calculating all through Wall Street last week. The bond is the easiest to value, at about $20. As for the preferred, estimates vary widely, depending both on how fast one assumes Sara Lee will raise its dividends, and on what interest rate one uses to discount future payments. Over the last decade, it raised its dividend at an annual rate just over 13 percent, but during the preceding five years, the figure was less than 4 percent. One guess is that the preferred will trade for about $17. If the equity-appreciation certificate traded for $8 or $9, the package would be priced similarly to the shares it replaces."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/27/business/mexico-plan-on-bond-bids.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-02-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 158, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mexico Plan On Bond Bids", "print_headline": "Mexico Plan On Bond Bids", "body_text": " **********The Government will announce by next Friday its response to foreign banks' secret bids for bonds offered by Mexico in an innovative plan to reduce its $105 billion in foreign debt, the Treasury Department said. **********Mexico's approximately 560 creditor banks had until today at 4 P.M.,Eastern standard time, to subP.M.,Eastern standard time, to submit their sealed bids under the plan, devised by the Mexican and United States Governments.

And it is a strategy that analysts, who often have trouble following conglomerates, can easily understand. In fact, several say they have been recommending IC stock specifically because the 54-year-old Mr. Bays is beginning to make sense of the company. **********But as pleased as veteran IC-watchers are with Mr. Bays's strategy, they are even more pleased with how he is using it. For to Karl Bays, a strategy is a guideline, not a straitjacket. **********Indeed, Mr. Bays is defining consumer products in the widest possible way. Just last month, he spent $30 million to buy 18 percent of Northfield Laboratories, a company that is trying to develop a commercial blood substitute. Does Northfield fit into a consumer company? ''Blood is the ultimate consumer product,'' he said. **********Then there is the $13 million he recently spent on a new research and development complex for the Hussmann Corporation, the $756 million IC subsidiary that sells display cases and other equipment to supermarkets. Does that fit with the strategy? ''They sell to the same supermarkets that the food companies sell to,'' he said. Mr. Bays's fans - and there are many - say his combination of rigid adherence to cash-flow goals and flexibility about investments is exactly what IC needs right now. ''There are abundant opportunities for employing the company's resources, and he is always looking for interesting opportunities to create value,'' said Richard G. Cline, chairman of Nicorp Inc. and an IC director. **********MR. BAYS is making a powerful effort to get presidents of IC subsidiaries to do that kind of searching as well. In October - ironically, just three days before Black Monday - he gave 1.2 million shares of IC stock to 26 of his top people, to get them to think like owners rather than managers. IC subsidiaries still have their own boards. And, even though Mr. Bays monitors all spending for training, new plants and such, his executives say their autonomy has remained inviolate. ''I don't feel like there's someone looking over my shoulder at all,'' said Ray Morris, chief executive of Pet Inc., IC's huge food products subsidiary. **********Over the last year Mr. Bays and his unit presidents have done a good deal of auspicious pruning, selling off businesses that do not fit with IC's blueprint for its future, and cutting product lines that, while they fit strategically, do not yield high returns. **********In September, IC's board approved Mr. Bays's plan to spin off the Illinois Central Railroad, IC's original business, as an independent company. In April Mr. Bays arranged to sell IC's $967 million Pneumo Abex subsidiary, which makes aircraft landing gear and flight controls, to a joint venture of the Henley Group Inc. and Wasserstein, Perella & Company, for $1.3 billion. On a much smaller scale, Pet and other IC subsidiaries have been unloading product lines - Musselman's Fruit Products is one example - that, while marginally profitable, did not seem the best use of corporate resources. **********Already, IC is a smaller but healthier company. IC's income from continuing operations was up about 62 percent last year, to $198 million, from $122 million in 1986. The divestitures will trim IC's sales from more than $4 billion last year to about $3.5 billion in 1988. But that number, if Mr. Bays has his way, will not remain static for long. He has loosened IC's purse strings, encouraging his unit presidents to pump capital into their businesses. And he is ''scanning the horizon'' for a consumer products company to buy. **********The result, predicted J. Robert Copper, senior vice president of planning, will be that ''in five years, IC will have grown by compound double digits in earnings.'' And what will be the source of that growth? ''IC will have a heavy presence in Europe, Asia and the Pacific rim, it will be in consumer products, but it will also be in about 10 emerging technologies,'' he said. **********Mr. Bays's moves are playing well on Wall Street, too. ''Karl Bays has not only streamlined IC, he has revitalized it,'' said William Tiritilli, who covers IC for Rodman & Renshaw and has been recommending IC stock for his ''longer-term conservative'' accounts. Alan S. Greditor, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert, has a blanket ''buy'' recommendation on IC. The reason: ''Karl Bays is a proven chief executive, and he has IC headed on exactly the right course.'' **********To be sure, Mr. Bays's background gave him a running start. **********For close to 15 years, Mr. Bays had been chief executive of American Hospital Supply Corporation. Through acquisitions and capital investments - and through a decentralized management style that gave divisional subsidiaries wide latitude on how to run their shows - he grew American Hospital into a $3.5 billion health-care concern. **********But his very success turned out to be his nemesis. Baxter Travenol, another health-care concern that was itching to expand, decided that American Hospital was the kind of company it wanted and made a successful hostile run at it. In 1985, the two companies merged. Mr. Bays got the title of chairman of the newly merged company, but few hands-on management duties to go with it. **********For IC, Mr. Bays's mounting frustration could not have come at a better time. He was already an IC director, so he knew the company. And he certainly knew how to manage. So, when William B. Johnson, IC's chief executive since 1968, was sidelined by a stroke in June 1987, the board passed over such veteran IC officers as executive vice president Bruce S. Chelberg and vice chairman Boyd F. Schenk, and asked Mr. Bays to sign on. **********''Karl was an experienced C.E.O., he was on the board and it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,'' said Mr. Cline, the director. Mr. Bays described the situation more succinctly: ''I was a rare find.'' **********THERE is no question that Mr. Bays has changed the style and tempo at IC. Where Mr. Johnson, a lawyer by education and a numbers man by preference, was mainly interested in bottom-line results, Mr. Bays is fascinated by operations. **********Mr. Bays plays down the differences between himself and Mr. Johnson (''I'm fatter than he is,'' is all that he will allow). But IC executives say there has been a sea change. **********''Our board meetings used to be taken up with talk of receivable days outstanding, payable days outstanding and other numbers,'' recalled Mr. Morris, the Pet chief. ''Karl's attitude is, let's go through a quick overview of the quarter and then discuss a segment of business.'' **********Even John F. Fagan, IC's executive vice president for finance and its chief numbers man, has changed his emphasis. ''Bill wanted details on final numbers, but Karl is more interested in developing a plan to serve customers,'' he said. ''The result is that now I spend less time presenting routine numbers, more time on exceptional things, particularly those that affect operations.'' **********There were, of course, many points of intersection between Mr. Bays's thinking and Mr. Johnson's. In fact, some of the acquisitions made in the Johnson days seem to have followed reasoning of the sort that would delight Mr. Bays. **********For example, IC withstood a lot of flak from Wall Street when it paid $320 million - 30 times earnings - to buy Progresso and a handful of lesser-known brand names from the Ogden Corporation in 1986, a year before Mr. Bays took over. Mr. Copper says he worked out a five-year plan for Pet incorporating Progresso, compared it to an existing plan without the acquisition, then calculated the difference between what Progresso cost and what value it added. ''We recognized the synergies in advertising, distribution and production, and we would have paid more,'' he said. Indeed, Progresso added more than $30 million to Pet's earnings the first year after it was bought. **********Still, if Mr. Bays inherited a basic game plan, he also inherited a company that was in an operational vacuum. It owned a mishmash of businesses and, because it had not gone through any obvious financial debacles, IC executives felt little pressure to modernize their factories, to cut their costs or to weed poor performers from product lines that showed satisfactory returns as a whole. Pet, for example, thought its main profit source at one plant was cultured milk products; the line was actually losing money. **********Even before Mr. Bays joined, IC's planning staff had begun segregating businesses into winners, losers and what-ifs. But with Mr. Bays's urging, they have stepped up the pace. Today, IC is busily selling the losers, nourishing the winners and creating strategic plans for the what-ifs. For example, the Midas International Corporation, best known for its muffler repair operations, is a what-if. The franchise operation, which provided IC with nearly $351 million in revenues last year, has moved into brakes and other car services, and has just started a $4 million training program for its mechanics. **********Mr. Bays is being particularly tenacious about expanding IC's clear winners. In doing so, he is taking IC from a ''deal'' company - one that buys what others build - to one that explores any avenue for growth. **********IC executives say Mr. Bays's open-mindedness already saved one deal from going sour. Before he joined, IC had targeted its Pepsi bottling operations as a good growth area and decided to expand them by buying RKO Bottling Inc. from Gencorp. Pepsico Inc., which did not want any franchisee to grow that powerful, tried to block the sale. **********Just a few days before the two companies were scheduled to go head to head in court, Mr. Bays and Roger Enrico, chief of Pepsi-Cola Worldwide Beverages, negotiated a settlement in which IC's entire bottling operation would be turned into a joint venture with Pepsico. Today Pepsi-Cola General Bottlers Inc., which includes RKO and several bottlers formerly owned by Pepsico, is the largest Pepsi bottler in the world. IC owns 80 percent, Pepsico 20. **********''Karl divorced himself from a confrontation mode,'' Mr. Copper said. ''Bill would have been content to try his luck in court.'' **********Mr. Bays has equally delicate internal negotiating tasks ahead. He must keep IC's momentum going, even among divisions that have been selected for drastic cuts. And he must persuade unit chiefs that he really wants them to stress internal growth, even as they carve away at operating costs. **********SO far, he seems to have gotten his point across. He proudly notes that capital spending, which had averaged about $70 million a year for several years, will come close to $200 million this year. And IC has lopped $80 million from its costs. **********The cuts have been painful. Mr. Copper has reduced his staff from 10 to two. Mr. Fagan cut his staff in half, to 40. Throughout the company, about 1,300 jobs are gone. **********The stock grants were the prime motivation, executives say. ''What we've really been doing is acting like aggressive shareholders,'' Mr. Fagan said. **********''We asked them to cut $50 million and they cut $80 million,'' said Mr. Cline, the director. ''Without ownership we'd have been lucky to get $40 million.'' **********Of course, not all cost cuts mean job losses. Some headquarters savings came from cutting the number of suppliers and putting off plans to computerize certain functions. And subsidiaries have been busily looking for synergies. Pet, for example, has been working on keeping company trucks from logging too much down time. A few years ago a truck delivering flour to a plant on the West Coast might have come back to St. Louis headquarters empty; now, it is likely to pick up taco shells for its El Paso Mexican foods line along the way. **********BUT there has been bloodletting at Pet too. It once had 33 profit centers, each with its own general manager. Now it has five groups, each with a president. There used to be 39 division managers; now there are 22. Total employment is down by 91 people, half of whom were managers. **********''This was a substantial savings but it also opened market opportunities,'' Mr. Morris said. For example, frozen foods and grocery shelf foods, once separate fiefdoms, now report to the same manager. That gives them an incentive to publish recipes, say, that use several Pet products, or to combine advertising budgets to get better rates. **********Mr. Bays is trying to elicit that sort of cooperative effort from people at all levels of IC. ''It sounds trite, but I really do believe management is getting things done through other people,'' Mr. Bays said. **********As part of that belief, Mr. Bays has been trying to promote cross-fertilization of ideas between different levels of employees and between similar-level people at different IC subsidiaries. Meetings among subsidiary heads to exchange tips have become more frequent. Hussmann right now has a $2.5 million project at one of its largest plants to find better ways to get workers and management to act together to fine-tune work flow and other production details. If it is successful, Mr. Bays says, he may suggest that other subsidiaries adopt the approach. **********Mr. Bays already is holding periodic ''Coffee and Breakfast with Karl'' meetings for headquarters employees and encouraging subsidiary presidents to do the same. And he is including lower-level people in some of IC's awards programs. **********For five years IC has been giving annual Chairman's Awards to top-level employees. This year, at Mr. Bays's urging, award winners included a woman who trained the office staff on a new computer system and a regional sales manager. Each winner got 100 shares of IC stock. **********Mr. Bays also is attending to customers. He joined the board of the Grocery Manufacturers Association, primarily to become better acquainted with the supermarket executives who stock Pet goods and use Hussmann equipment. And he has persuaded Hussmann people to help the executives with floor planning, and to invite them to the new research center. **********Mr. Bays is certain that he has gotten his message of cost cutting and customer emphasis across to the subsidiaries. But dramatic examples, he conceded, are hard to come by. ''There are no showstoppers, no whiz-bang things,'' he said. ''It's day-to-day hard work.''

They add that since Iran has never depended upon its weak navy and air force, the loss of ships today is a minor setback. **********While successful Iraqi military operations over the last year have lent heart to the Iraqi Army, they have not changed the military equation in the war, which still favors Iran. Iran's greatest military strength still resides in the Revolutionary Guards, who have come virtually to replace the army, which is viewed with continuing suspicion as an undependable holdover from the days of the deposed shah. Willingness to Die **********The Revolutionary Guards are fanatically loyal to the principles of the Iranian Revolution and have been effective in battle because of their devotion and willingness to die. **********The two setbacks today, resulting from the American naval action and a surprise Iraqi attack on Iranian positions on the Fao peninsula, came on the heels of a failed Iranian offensive against Iraq in the Zagros mountains of Kurdistan northeast of Baghdad, at a time when Iraq appears to have the upper hand in the so-called war of the cities. **********But the political leadership of Iran, according to specialists on the Iranian military and political system, still maintains its goal of driving the United States, which it calls the ''Great Satan'' from the Persian Gulf. **********Administration officials believe it was the Iranian Revolutionary Guards who resumed mining the Persian Gulf during recent weeks as a deliberate provocation to test United States resolve to stay in the Gulf. According to one official, the Iranian leaders view the United States as militarily strong, but cowardly and bankrupt both morally and ethically. A Ripe Time?  Gulf specialists in and out of the Government say that with the victories of the more radical Khomeini loyalists who won most of the seats in the April 8 parliamentary elections in Iran, the Teheran Government may have believed the time was ripe to once again challenge the United States presence in the Gulf. **********When the United States bombarded Iranian oil platforms near Sirri Island, after freshly laid Iranian mines seriously damaged the frigate Samuel B. Roberts, the small Iranian Navy, which had avoided confrontation with the United States up to now, challenged the American Persian Gulf naval task force and lost most of its ships in the process. Prior to today's events the Revolutionary Guards were the only Iranian forces to exchange fire with United States forces. **********The Iraqi attack at Fao, which was under way while the United States was retaliating for the mining, was also a surprise to most Western military specialists. The Iraqi army is outnumbered three to one by the Iranians and in recent years has preferred to fight on the defensive to reduce casualties. This weekend it went over to the offense to recapture the port city of Fao, which Iraq lost to Iran in February 1986. **********It was Iran that had been expected to take the initiative in the land war. Iran was expected to launch a major offensive early this year in an attempt to capture the Iraqi port city of Basra. Apparently Teheran had only limited success in mobilizing volunteers for the offensive and, faced with strong Iraqi defenses around Basra, decided not to attack. Instead of a southern offensive, Iraq made a series of attacks in moutainous Kurdistan along its northeastern border with Iraq. Initially Successful **********The Iranian attacks were initially successful, but achieved little of strategic importance. Iraq used chemical weapons to help stop the the offensive and then started a successful counteroffensive, which eliminated the Iranian threat to the Darbandikhan dam and hydroelectric complex, which was believed to be the immediate objective of the Iranian offensive. **********While the fighting in the north was taking place last month, Iran and Iraq continued to exchange air and missile attacks against each other's population centers, in what has become known as ''the war of the cities.'' Specialists on the war say Iraq now clearly has the upper hand in this war. Iran is said to be suffering from the constant Iraqi missile attacks on Teheran and the holy city of Qom far more than Iraq is from the sporadic Iranian Scud missile attacks on Baghdad. Growing Iraqi Confidence **********The success of Iraq's missile attacks against Iranian cities, and their ability to strike at Iranian shipping in the lower Gulf with air attacks has helped Iraqi morale, according to experts on the war. But most importantly, the successful Iraqi defense of Basra last year and its ability to counterattack against the Iranians in Kurdistan this year are seen as indications of growing Iraqi confidence in their own military ability. **********This newfound confidence apparently prompted this weekend's successful attack against Fao.

Equipment like optical fibers and electronic switches allows so much telephone traffic to be concentrated in a single place that a breakdown affects far more customers than before. Affected Areas Growing **********''The network is getting thinner and thinner and switches are getting bigger and bigger,'' said John C. McDonald, executive vice president for technology at the Contel Corporation, a non-Bell telephone company. ''When a major outage occurs, it's going to cover bigger and bigger areas.'' **********The phone system's vulnerability has become more important now that the circuits carry not only conversations but computer data and are crucial to the nation's commerce. Companies routinely place orders, transfer money and consult computer data banks over phone lines. A halt in phone service could ricochet through the economy, causing millions of dollars in business losses. **********The Chicago-area disruption was caused by a fire on May 8 in an Illinois Bell switching center in Hinsdale. Illinois Bell does not expect service to be fully restored until early June. **********The Hinsdale fire highlights the growing concerns. The switching center was not manned; it was monitored from Springfield, 200 miles away. It had no fire suppression system, a common feature of computer rooms in the data-processing industry. And local fire authoritites were not contacted for more than an hour after the blaze began. **********A review of the Hinsdale system's vulnerability could have wide ramifications, because most other local telephone companies have networks and procedures similar to Illinois Bell's. **********James Eibel, vice president of operations at Illinois Bell, said the company was thoroughly reviewing its procedures and network design. The company has called the failure a rare event that was not easy to foresee. **********The Hinsdale switching center provided local service to 35,000 customers. But it also served as a hub into which traffic from about 50 other switching centers flowed on high-capacity optical fibers to be connected to long-distance services. Hinsdale, which handled 3.5 million calls a day, was one of five such ''gateways'' in the Chicago area. Hence, the fire disrupted service to a vast swath of suburbs south and west of Chicago, affecting hundreds of thousands of customers. **********''Ten years ago there were hubs, but there were dozens of them because you couldn't put everything you needed to handle all of Chicago in one or two buildings,'' said Jerry Hoppe, chief engineer of the Illinois Commerce Commission, a state regulatory agency. ''There are certain advantages to scale. But there obviously is a disadvantage when you put all your eggs in one basket.'' **********The failure has prompted many questions from customers and from the Illinois Attorney General's office, which has asked the commerce commission to investigate Illinois Bell's practices. 'A Lot of Questions' **********''There are going to be a lot of questions asked after this is all over as to why so much traffic has been concentrated in one switch and as to why they didn't have proper fire protection equipment,'' said David R. Yadlosky, group director of operations of the computer network used by the Florists' Transworld Delivery Association. The network's computer, in a town near Hinsdale, was cut off, making it impossible for 12,500 florists around the nation to send flowers by wire or to process their credit-card transactions. **********The Hinsdale fire also cut a communications link between the Federal Aviation Administration air traffic control computers at O'Hare Airport in Chicago and other F.A.A. control centers, causing delays at O'Hare. Flight delays then rippled across the country. **********The failure also disabled the reservations center that processes 35,000 calls a day for the Holiday Corporation, owner of Holiday Inns. The company was able to transfer many calls to its main reservations center in North Carolina. ''I've been in this business 18 years and I've never seen a failure this disastrous,'' said Roger J. Hickey, director of the Midwest reservations center. **********The growing concentration of telephone equipment in vulnerable centers has also worried the Defense Department, which wants to insure that the system cannot be easily disabled by a saboteur or a nuclear attack. A panel set up by the National Academy of Sciences has been studying this issue and released its first report last August. Concern About Terrorism **********''The results are scary,'' said Mr. McDonald of Contel, who is chairman of the panel. ''The report concludes that the network is getting thin enough in certain areas that if a guy like Qaddafi knew where they were, he could wreak havoc with the phone system.'' **********One vulnerable area, the report said, is in a system called common channel signaling. This is a separate network that sets up paths for telephone calls over the A.T.& T. long-distance circuits, by far the nation's largest telephone network. The signaling network has only 14 switching centers. A.T.& T. said the 14 centers were heavily protected and backed each other up in case one was disabled. **********The technology that allows for more concentration of phone traffic clearly has its benefits, just as a highway has advantages over a grid of small streets. Economies of scale allow for lower telephone rates and electronic features allow for new services like call-forwarding. With competition growing in the telephone industry since the Bell System breakup in 1984, some authorities say, both local and long-distance phone companies are rushing to employ these cost-saving technologies. Benefits of Electronic Switches **********One major advance is the electronic switch, which has replaced the electromechanical switch in routing calls. The newest such switch made by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company can handle four times as many calls as its electromechanical predecessor, and new switches are starting to appear that will do twice again as much, said Amos E. Joel Jr., a consultant on switching and a former Bell Laboratories switch designer. Mr. Joel estimated that since divestiture, local telephone companies have reduced their number of switches by about 10 percent. **********Optical fibers, which are hair-thin strands of glass, carry phone conversations as pulses of light. A single fiber can carry at least 8,000 phone conversations, compared with 24 on a pair of copper wires. Now, phone companies are moving toward the ability to cram 24,000 conversations through a fiber. **********The General Electric Information Services Company, which runs one of the nation's largest computer networks and leases lines from A.T.& T., has had to buy a satellite communications system as a backup for the failures that occur because of optical fiber breaks. **********''What began to happen as fiber optics came in is that A.T.& T. began to concentrate more and more traffic on a single fiber route,'' said Richard J. Lewis, manager of network operations for the General Electric Company subsidiary. ''The outages aren't that frequent but when they do occur they are massive,'' he said. Other Causes of Failures **********The company has recorded eight A.T.& T. fiber failures in two years, caused by problems like cables cut by backhoes and mudslides. **********Phone company officials generally dispute suggestions that the phone system is becoming less reliable. **********''I think that perception is wrong,'' said Joseph P. Nacchio, director of network engineering and operations for A.T.& T. ''We have more route miles, more circuit miles and more alternate path capabilities than we had before.'' **********For big companies that lease lines, the level of reliability depends on how many circuits they order, Mr. Nacchio said. But for consumers, who use the public network, any break in a line or fiber is usually not noticeable, as traffic is immediately switched to another line. New Equipment More Reliable **********The newer equipment is also more reliable than the older technology, said Patrick E. White, assistant vice president of new architecture and service concepts for Bell Communications Research, which does network planning for the seven regional Bell operating companies. He said electronic switches had no moving parts and broke down less frequently than electromechanical devices. **********Still, some of these assertions could be called into question by what happened at Illinois Bell. While the phone company had backup fibers in case a fiber broke, both sets went through the same switching center and were destroyed by the same fire, Mr. Eibel said. **********The fact that the Hinsdale center was unmanned at the time of the fire is also a result of new technology. Because switches are essentially computers, they can be monitored from a remote location over the telephone lines. Hence, Illinois Bell, like other phone companies, monitors many switching centers from a central control room. But remote technicians cannot put out a fire. What Might Be Done **********Experts said it might not be economically feasible to add more redundancy to the system without increasing telephone rates. Therefore, they said, all possible care should be taken to protect such major phone switches and high-capacity lines from accidents. **********A sprinkler system, all concede, would do as much harm to the equipment as a fire. But questions have been raised on why the center did not use a halon gas fire suppression system like those employed in many large computer rooms. A spokesman for Illinois Bell said the company had considered such a system but had doubts about its effectiveness. **********The Illinois Attorney General's office is also looking at why it took more than an hour after the fire began for the fire department to be contacted. The Illinois Bell spokesman said that when the technician in Springfield who was responsible for monitoring the Hinsdale station received the alarm, he tried to call the fire department in Hinsdale. But the call could not get through. The fire had already knocked out the phone lines."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/01/world/israel-considers-barring-the-press-from-arab-areas-hit-by-turmoil.html": {"writer_name": "John Kifner", "pub_date": "1988-03-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 422, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Israel Considers Barring the Press From Arab Areas Hit by Turmoil", "print_headline": "Israel Considers Barring the Press From Arab Areas Hit by Turmoil", "body_text": " **********Israeli officials, stung by foreign television footage showing four soldiers beating two captive Palestinians, are considering banning journalists from areas of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. **********''Look, these are things that are done in different parts of the world, in places where confrontations of this kind are taking place,'' Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said today of calls to limit news coverage of the 11-week-old Palestinian protests.

Gorbachev's anti-alcohol campaign, the Soviet authorities have begun to impose sugar rationing in parts of the country. **********The coupon system, accompanied by severe sugar shortages in other areas where there is no formal rationing, has caused mounting discontent among consumers, who count sugar as one of the few dependable pleasures of the Soviet table. **********It is also a tacit admission that the war against drunkenness, which was Mr. Gorbachev's first major domestic program, has been losing ground after some initial signs of success. **********One Soviet economist, Nikolai Shmelev, proposed this month in the magazine Novy Mir that the Government abandon its draconian methods of fighting drunkenness, which include cuts in liquor supplies, higher prices and conversion of Government distilleries and breweries to producing nonalcoholic beverages. An Unwinnable War **********''It becomes more and more obvious that the state is being drawn into a moonshine war with the population,'' Mr. Shmelev said. ''It can hardly win this war.'' **********He said the Government should focus instead on raising the standard of living and teaching social drinking habits so people will not sit at home and drink for entertainment. **********The sugar rationing began this month after Moscow authorized local authorities to use ration coupons or other methods to control distribution, according to the Government newspaper Izvestia. **********Deputy Trade Minister Sergei D. Aleshin told Izvestia that the demand for sugar early this year jumped as much as 29 percent in some regions, and that it was ''not for tea drinking.'' **********Without rationing, Mr. Aleshin said, the Government believed it would have had to spend an extra $1 billion of scarce foreign currency to import enough sugar to compensate for the depletion of stocks by distillers of illegal alcohol, called samogon. **********With the new controls, he said, ''the moonshiners will have to chose between samogon and their sweet tooth.'' **********Samogon can be made from many raw materials, ranging from grain to fruit to potatoes. Distillers use sugar or add it to the raw materials because it is widely available, relatively cheap and increases alcohol content. Ukraine Seems Hardest Hit **********The area hardest hit by the rationing appears to be the Ukraine, the second most populous Soviet republic and a leading producer of sugar beets. **********In Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, residents said the Government on April 1 began issuing rationing coupons entitling each consumer to 1.5 kilograms, or 3.3 pounds, of sugar a month. **********According to Government estimates, that is about 60 percent of the normal consumption of pure sugar in this sugar-loving society, where heavily sweetened tea, homemade jams and sugary cakes are staples of hospitality. **********Sugar shortages have caused widespread grumbling about unfairness and spawned a variety of rumors. **********One theory popular in the Ukraine is that sugar shortages there were engineered by the republic's Communist Party leader, Vladimir V. Shcherbitsky, who is regarded as a political foe of Mr. Gorbachev, in hopes of undermining the Soviet leader's popularity. Shortages in Riga Reported **********Aleksandr Podrabinek, the editor of an unofficial news bulletin called Ekspress Khronika, said he had been told of severe sugar shortages in Riga, the capital of the Latvian Republic, and in the eastern Ukrainian city of Dnepropetrovsk. **********In his home of Kirzhach, a town of 26,000 about 50 miles northeast of Moscow, ''there is no sugar at all, not even coupons,'' Mr. Podrabinek said. ''Some of the factories are giving sugar to their workers, one kilogram per person per month, but in others there is not even that.'' **********Sugar supplies in Moscow have been erratic, with many stores without any and others carrying sugar cubes but not the granulated variety preferred for home baking. **********According to residents in Odessa, a Ukrainian city on the Black Sea, distillers of the potent samogon have already begun to elude the Government rationing program by insisting that customers include a rationing coupon as part of the price for a bottle of rough, homemade vodka. **********Mr. Gorbachev's crusade against drunkenness began in the spring of 1985, and the Government credits the effort for improved health statistics, including a marked improvement in life expectancy for men and reductions in workplace injuries and alcohol-related crime. Making Up Lost Output **********But the Government has lost a significant amount of income from the drop in liquor sales. And the moonshining industry, mostly private stills operating in rural homes or city apartments, has grown so much that some specialists believe the illegal market has almost completely replaced the cutbacks in official liquor sales. **********Mr. Shmelev, the economist, said ending the controls was the best way to drive the illegal moonshiners out of business, bring needed revenues to the state and avoid the danger that moonshining would produce a web of organized crime. **********Although there have been rumors that the Government plans to relax liquor controls somewhat, the sugar rationing program suggests that it still prefers Prohibition-style methods. **********Responding to consumer complaints about the sugar shortages, Soviet officials have begun to stress that the high Soviet level of individual sugar consumption - about 60 percent higher than in the United States - is a health hazard."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/21/business/ibm-sets-compatible-software.html": {"writer_name": "Calvin Sims", "pub_date": "1988-09-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 601, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "I.B.M.

For many, fire is the only tool for transforming forest into farm or pasture. **********From the flames, tons of fumes and particles are hurled into the sky, and at night, roaring and red, the forest looks to be at war. **********Now, Brazilian and American scientists in a new satellite monitoring program are for the first time pinpointing and measuring the effects of the fires. The destruction and burning of forest here is so vast, the scientists say, that it may account for at least one-tenth of the global man-made output of carbon dioxide, which is believed to be causing a warming of the earth through the greenhouse effect. Burning of fossil fuels accounts for most of the carbon dioxide released worldwide. **********Environmentalists have long warned of the destruction that is increasing with each new dry season, and witnesses every year report more cemeteries of trees. The scientists' findings show that in 1987 the burnings ruined more forest cover than previously thought and proved to be major polluters of the earth's atmosphere. **********In 1987, Brazilian scientists estimate, fires just in Brazil's part of the Amazon basin covered 77,000 square miles, an area one and a half times the size of New York State. Of these, at least 30,000 square miles were newly felled virgin forest, the researchers said. The remainder, they added, involved regrown forest on previously cleared land, savannas and fields. **********The pioneering studies, which include the most comprehensive estimates yet of the emissions from the Amazon fires, also found that pollution from the burnings traveled thousands of miles. This has raised questions about a possible link between the gigantic emissions from the fires in the South American tropics and the damage to the earth's protective ozone shield over Antarctica. Smoke Rises to 12,000 Feet **********Alberto Setzer, coordinator of the satellite data at the Space Research Center in this south Brazilian city, said smoke clouds from the Amazon fires often rose to 12,000 feet. Their gases and particles were then lifted up higher into jet streams and blown south across the South Atlantic, close to Antarctica. Many scientists now believe that several of these gases, including methane and nitrogen oxides, are among the reactive gases that can directly or indirectly deplete ozone, Dr. Setzer said. **********''There is no proof yet that the material is interacting with the ozone shield, which is much higher in the stratosphere,'' said Dr. Setzer. ''But we know the material gets to the Antarctic region, and we know that storms can pump it upward. We do not know yet how high it reaches. Several people are working on this.'' **********American scientists who took part in the mission over Antarctica by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in October said they had not searched for or found evidence of compounds from the Amazon. But NASA researchers are now searching for such traces by satellite. **********But even without the ozone question, Dr. Setzer said, the ''tremendous'' emissions coming off the Amazon pose serious problems. ''They are large enough to cause significant changes in the chemical balance of the atmosphere and influence the global weather,'' he said. A Doubly Harmful Effect **********In the case of carbon dioxide, for example, the forest destruction is doubly harmful, Dr. Setzer and other researchers noted. The dwindling forest cover becomes not only less efficient in absorbing and removing this ''greenhouse gas,'' but the fires also add new, huge volumes of it. **********A report prepared by the study group at the Space Research Center estimated that the fires in Brazil last year produced carbon dioxide containing more than 500 million tons of carbon. The fires also produced 44 million tons of carbon monoxide, more than six million tons of particles, almost five million tons of methane, two and a half million tons of ozone and more than one million tons of nitrogen oxides and other substances that can circulate globally and influence radiation and climate. **********''There is enough to compare it to the outburst of a very large volcano,'' Dr. Setzer said. **********The study results on deforestation and emissions from the fires so far cover only the Brazilian two-thirds of the Amazon rain forest. Still more of the pollutants are produced by fires in parts of the Amazon basin outside Brazil. Other Countries Studied **********''Our findings in general agree with those of Brazil,'' said Compton Tucker, a physicist who is part of a group studying deforestation and emissions at the Goddard Space Flight Center at Greenbelt, Md. The NASA group, he said, is now also analyzing satellite data of other countries of the Amazon basin, including Bolivia and Peru, where burnings have increased. **********''This phenomenon has been greatly underestimated, and until 1987 no one has ever tried to study this systematically,'' Dr. Tucker said. ''The satellite data are also there for other areas. There are no technical constraints. They just have not been processed yet.'' **********The effects of the fires are felt clearly on the ground in areas where the pace of destruction is greatest, including the state of Para, in the eastern Amazon, and farther west in northern Mato Grosso and Rondonia. Here new roads have opened, and cattle and soybean farmers are felling huge areas. **********Newly analyzed data for the state of Rondonia, for example, show that in 1984, when paving was completed on a highway financed by the Inter-American Development Bank, deforestation jumped from 6,500 square miles and reached 10,500 square miles in 1985. By late last year it had affected 14,600 square miles, or 17 percent of the state surface. Respiratory Disease Rises **********In August and September in past years, when the thick haze over the region worsened, it has forced airports to close down, caused boat accidents on the rivers and brought a rise in respiratory diseases. **********Early this month, the annual drama of fire came to the fore as burning spread from a farm in Mato Grosso and set ablaze a national park, the Parques das Emas. The 335,000-acre park, which consists of easily flammable savanna rich in animal life, has only four wardens, who have been unable to maintain the fire corridor. The blaze lasted five days and, according to the forestry service, destroyed 65 percent of the park. **********As forestry experts explain it, spontaneous fires are rare in the moist rain forest. Rather, workers first cut the trees, leave them to dry and finally set fire to them during the dry season. Usually only the felled part is dry enough to burn, and fires remain confined to the intended areas. In the absence of transport or roads, the timber cannot be sold, and burning is the easiest way to clear the land. **********In the computer room at the Space Research Center here, researchers capture and analyze the satellite images every day. Marcos Pereira, one of the analysts, explained that the satellite registers the fires as points of intense heat. These appear as dots on the screen and permit researchers to pinpoint their location. Often, the ominous dots form a belt showing the boundary between the virgin forest and the settled areas. ''It is very striking how the fires follow the roads,'' an American researcher said. #170,000 Fires in 1987 On the worst day of 1987, Sept. 9, the satellite detected 7,603 fires. Dr. Setzer said that between June and October 1987, covering the whole dry season, the satellite registered more than 350,000 fires. Because burnings may last between 24 and 48 hours, many fires may have been registered more than once, Dr. Setzer said. Therefore, he added, his group is using a conservative estimate of 170,000 fires for 1987. **********As part of the new program, researchers send their findings every day to the National Forestry Service in Brasilia. Shocked by last year's data, the service has said that this year it will open a nationwide campaign and levy large fines for the burnings. Virtually all the fires are conducted illegally, without the required permits. **********But the service, which guards the largest forest on earth, has fewer than 900 wardens for a region larger than Europe. ''We would need 15,000 to 20,000 guards to be effective,'' said Carlos Marx Carneiro, a director of the service."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/10/business/icc-clears-rio-grande-rail-purchase.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-08-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 508, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "I.C.C.

Mr. Burnley was interviewed on NBC-TV's ''Meet the Press'' program. **********Frank Lorenzo, the chairman of the Texas Air Corporation, the parent of both airlines, said during the program that there was nothing wrong with the operations of both airlines and that he welcomed the new investigation. The Accident Record **********The only serious accident in recent years involving a Continental plane occurred last November in Denver, when a McDonnell-Douglas DC-9 overturned at Stapleton Airport, killing 28 of the 72 passengers and crew members. In the last decade, the only fatal accident involving an Eastern plane occurred in January 1985, when a Boeing 727 struck a mountain in Bolivia, killing 29 people. **********Continental and Eastern account for nearly 20 percent of the nation's air traffic, making Texas Air the biggest airline holding company. **********The broadened investigation could cause further confusion among Texas Air's passengers, some of whom have expressed concern about the Eastern inspections. **********Last Wednesday, Mr. Burnley announced that his agency had begun a major investigation of recent financial maneuvers by Texas Air to see whether these transactions had affected the safety of its airlines by weakening them financially. $823,000 in Eastern Penalties At the same news conference, T. Allan McArtor, the Federal Aviation Administrator, said his agency had begun to inspect each of Eastern's 267 planes because the carrier had amassed about $823,000 in outstanding proposed penalties for a variety of violations. **********Mr. Burnley said yesterday that the F.A.A. had already inspected 200 of Eastern's planes and that 19 of them had been grounded because of safety problems. Virtually all of the problems ''were easily correctable,'' he added, and the 19 planes were returned to service ''in a couple of hours.'' **********Despite the speed of the repairs, Mr. Burnley added, many of the violations ''were significant problems.'' He did not give specific details. **********Mr. Burnley said that the inspection of Continental's 352-plane fleet would be ''just like the Eastern investigation.'' **********''We'll have people who will be walking around the planes and through them,'' he added, ''and talking to the maintenance personnel and folks in the cockpit, and making sure that anything that can be readily identified is corrected.'' Variety of Violations **********The fines proposed for Eastern before the latest inspections were for a variety of violations, such as improper repairs, deficient maintenance records and the use of flight dispatchers who had not passed competence tests. **********Since the current inspection has not resulted in the grounding of planes for long periods, it has not greatly disrupted Eastern's operations in the short term. Nonetheless, at the end of its 30-day inquiry, the F.A.A. could end up imposing stiff penalties or other restrictions on the airline if it found that it had been flying the planes for long periods with serious safety problems. **********Mr. Burnley said he doubted that, as a result of the various investigations, his agency would revoke Texas Air's rights to operate its airlines. ''I really would be quite surprised if it came to that,'' he added. ''I think that we will find, somewhere along the way, that Texas Air is willing to correct whatever problem we identify.'' **********He added, ''I have got to say that we have found very good cooperation from Eastern.'' **********Mr. Lorenzo said that the Transportation Department and the F.A.A. were ''not being unreasonable'' in starting the investigations. ''And we also think that these investigations will have a positive side in that, when they're concluded, they'll show and point out what's really going on, which is positive,'' he added. **********David Sylvester, an airline analyst for Kidder, Peabody & Company, said that the inquiries could be a turning point for Texas Air. For instance, he added, if the company was given a relatively clean bill of health it could use the results to reassure its customers. But if major safety problems are found it could accelerate the defection of passengers from the two carriers, which have experienced continuing problems with flight cancellations, lost baggage and labor confrontations. **********A spot check of Continental's and Eastern's major hubs found some passengers who had made bookings on other airlines after the disclosure at midweek of the various investigations, with some canceling Eastern bookings. **********Although there was no evidence of a mass exodus, some passengers and travel agents said they had become increasingly disillusioned with the Eastern and Continental service even though they believed the airlines' planes were safe. Gain for Pan Am Shuttle **********One major competitor that appears to be gaining from Eastern's current problems is the shuttle operated from New York's La Guardia Airport by Pan American World Airways, according to figures provided by the airline. **********Jeff Kriendler, a spokesman for Pan Am, said traffic on its shuttle had dramatically increased since Thursday. That day, several flights between Boston and New York ran full in the afternoon, which, he added, was very unusual, and the flights between New York and Washington's National Airport carried about 400 more passengers than the previous Thursday. Pan Am's shuttle had its best day ever last Friday, he said, and it also had its best Saturday ever. **********But a spokesman for Eastern said it was also experiencing very heavy loads on its shuttle and that there was no evidence that passengers were switching to Pan Am. **********The shuttle would be one of the first services to reflect a shift since no reservations are required. Switches by Passengers **********At La Guardia's Marine Air Terminal, from where Pan Am operates its shuttle, some passengers said that they had switched either earlier due to the better service at Pan Am or because of concerns over the current turmoil at Eastern. **********Jay Ciro, a broker with Prudential-Bache Securities who lives in Washington, said that he flew the Eastern shuttle to New York, but had switched to Pan Am after learning of the Federal investigation from his wife. **********But many Eastern shuttle travelers shrugged off the news while others said that they took whatever shuttle would leave closest to the time they got to the airport. Eastern flies every hour while Pan Am flies on the half-hour. **********Travel agents also reported some defections, while some station managers and personnel for other airlines said some passengers were willing to take the loss of a nonrefundable Eastern ticket to book on other airlines. **********Paula Musto, a spokeswoman for Eastern, said, ''We have not had a lot of reaction'' from passengers on the safety issue. She said that fewer than 1 percent of the callers to the airline's reservations number had mentioned safety as a consideration.  SMOKE FORCES LANDING **********CLEVELAND, April 17 (Reuters) - A Continental Airlines jet with 104 passengers and 5 crew members made an emergency landing today after smoke filled the cabin, officials said. **********Three people were hospitalized for smoke inhalation, the officials said. A woman who suffered an asthma attack during the flight was also treated, they said. **********According to the police and officials at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport, a Boeing 737 traveling from Newark to Cleveland developed smoke in the cabin shortly before landing.

The closing was the first in the 70-year history of the land bank system and could cost the system as much as $300 million, one official said. **********Meanwhile, an official of the Farm Credit Assistance Board, a sister agency of the Farm Credit Administration, said the condition of a second bank, the Federal Land Bank of Omaha, had deterioriated so dramatically in recent months that Federal assistance would probably be needed. **********Eric P. Thor, president of the assistance board, the agency that made the decision to close the Jackson bank, said the Omaha bank ''has submitted a number of documents for a request of assistance'' but had not made a final decision on how to resolve its problems.

Watkins, an Oklahoma banker and financial consultant, planned to wind down the bank's business as quickly as possible and close its doors permanently within a year. **********Agency officials said Mr. Watkins would seek to sell off the good loans and begin liquidation proceedings on the delinquent loans. But that will not necessarily be quick because, under a law passed last year, if the agency finds it less costly to restructure a farmer's mortgage, foreclosure cannot be instituted. Management Criticized **********According to Mr. Thor, one of the primary reasons for shutting the Jackson bank was poor management. He said that since the bank began to experience difficulties, his agency had received no ''comprehensive, coherent financial and business plan from the Jackson management.'' **********He said that poor management practices had gone on for at least three years, and that the final cost of the liquidation of the Jackson bank to the Farm Credit System could be $300 million. **********The land bank became insolvent, according to farm credit officials, because of plunging land values in Mississippi, Louisiana and Alabama. They said 40 percent of the bank's loans were in trouble with little prospect for recovery. The bank faced losses totaling $4.7 million a month, the officials said. **********They said the bank was insolvent by $3.6 million on Friday when all of its offices were simultaneously closed by an army of 350 bank examiners. 'Unsafe and Unsound' **********Despite an infusion of $30 million earlier in the year, the agency ''determined that the bank is in an unsafe and unsound condition,'' according to a statement. **********In the hearing today before the Senate agricultural subcommittee, officials of the Farm Credit Administration came under strong criticism from senators who asked why the agency had not closed the bank last year, when it was almost insolvent. **********''There is a serious question why the F.C.A. did not take action at an earlier date,'' said Senator Howell T. Heflin, Democrat of Alabama. Earlier action could have saved the Government money and resolved an uncertain situation for farmers, while bringing in a new lender. Decided to Wait **********The chairman of the Farm Credit Administration, Frank W. Naylor Jr., said the agency had considered appointing a receiver in October but was told by its legal staff to wait until the new law was in place. **********Farm Credit officials said today that the agency was negotiating with the Federal Land Bank of Texas, based in Austin, and the Federal Land Bank of Columbia, S.C., for one of these two to assume the Jackson bank's good loans and to take over the extension of credit in the three-state area. Both are healthier institutions. **********''We are trying very hard to work out an agreement to restore service with the cooperation of some of the other system institutions,'' Mr. Naylor said. No Credit Since December **********Closing the bank and reaching an arrangement could in fact help farmers in the three-state area to get new credit for the purchase of farmland. The Mississippi bank had not extended credit since December, and its reopened offices will be servicing only outstanding loans, not extending credit. **********At the hearing today, senators also inquired about the financial health of the Omaha bank. Mr. Naylor promised to report to Congress on this bank within 60 days. **********In recent years, buffeted by falling land values, the system's 287 lending institutions have lost almost $5 billion, which has severely depleted their capital base. The situation became so grim last year that Congress passed the Agriculture Credit Act of 1987 to inject $4 billion into the system."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/15/business/capital-plan-feared-as-a-burden-on-banks.html": {"writer_name": "Nathaniel Nash", "pub_date": "1988-07-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 969, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Capital Plan Feared as a Burden on Banks", "print_headline": "Capital Plan Feared as a Burden on Banks", "body_text": " **********Bank holding companies in the United States must raise billions more in new capital than their overseas counterparts under a Federal Reserve plan to increase capital requirements, according to calculations by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. **********As a result, there is growing concern at the F.D.I.C. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency that the Fed's proposal will raise the cost of doing business and therefore place the nation's banking organizations at a disadvantage against their international competitors. **********The plan to increase capital levels to 8 percent of assets is part of an international accord designed to give banks a cushion in times of stress. Though the accord applied only to banks, the Fed has indicated it intends to subject bank holding companies in this country to the requirement as well. Final adoption of these standards is expected within 30 days. Estimate of the Burden **********In a preliminary estimate compiled by the staff of the F.D.I.C., holding companies as a whole will have to raise more than $15 billion in new money by the end of 1992 for their subsidiary banks to meet the 8 percent risk-based standard. But 150 bank holding companies will have to raise an additional $14.1 billion of capital so that they themselves can meet the higher requirements. **********Federal regulators say that it is highly unlikely that the banks will in the end raise the entire amounts through new stock or debt offerings. Rather, they will choose to sell off some unprofitable businesses, cut costs to retain more earnings and even restructure their asset portfolio, which includes loans, to move toward less risky holdings. **********Indeed, while the international accord is meant to increase the level of bank capital, it is also aimed at rewarding prudent banking, permitting banks to hold less capital against low-risk assets like Government securities. While a bank has to reserve a full 8 percent against a business loan, it does not have to reserve anything against a short-term United States Government security, effectively reducing its capital requirement. **********Fed officials have estimated that banking companies as a whole will have to raise as much as $15 billion for one class of required capital, which will include shareholder equity, retained earnings and noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Capital in that class would have to equal half the 8 percent of assets required. The central bank has not given estimates for the second class of capital, which must also equal 4 percent of assets. That class includes subordinated debt, other preferred stock and some reserves for possible loan losses. An International Standard **********The international agreement - signed by the central banks of 12 industrial nations in Basel, Switzerland, earlier this week - sets for the first time an international standard for bank capital based on the riskiness of a bank's loans and other assets. **********None of the other 11 nations are expected to apply the higher standards to the parent companies of their domestic banks. **********''The Fed is about to place United States banks at a competitive disadvantage, since they will have to raise a lot more money,'' said the F.D.I.C. chairman, L. William Seidman, when asked to comment on the F.D.I.C. staff findings. ''If you properly keep the bank separate so that its capital cannot be drained by the holding company, the bank should stay sound no matter what happens to its parent.'' A Growing Policy Dispute **********The calculations by the F.D.I.C. and the comments by Mr. Seidman underscore a brewing policy dispute between the Fed and the other two Federal banking agencies, the F.D.I.C. and the Comptroller of the Currency, over how to carry out the international capital agreement. **********But more broadly, the dispute highlights a growing debate between the two camps over the future role of bank holding companies within the banking structure. **********Mr. Seidman and Comptroller Robert L. Clarke argue that as long as a bank is strong and well capitalized, and as long as Federal regulators prevent holding companies from draining profits from the banking subsidiaries, the holding companies do not necessarily need to be as highly capitalized as the banks. **********They argue that Federal deposit insurance, which insures deposits up to $100,000, applies only to banks and not to their holding companies. ''So if the holding company goes bust, as long as the bank is insulated from that, there should be no threat to the system,'' Mr. Seidman said.  Mr. Clarke said it would be important to regulate bank holding companies' capital requirements ''differently from the banks because they will become different animals.'' The Fed's View **********On the other hand, Fed officials are grappling with both their institutional role as the primary regulator of bank holding companies and a longtime Fed doctrine that in times of stress the resources and strength of a bank holding company are to be used to help a troubled bank. **********They are also concerned that if the banking parent and its nonbanking subsidiaries were not subject to the same kinds of rigorous capital requirements, risks taken by the nonbanking subsidiaries of the parent company could have a spill-over effect and weaken the bank. **********In recent years major banking companies, in an effort to increase their profitability, have expanded into many new areas of business, such as securities brokerages and insurance sales. **********Moreover, for years the Fed has required that holding companies maintain the same levels of capital as their subsidiary banks, and it is reluctant to change that standard."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/13/world/moderate-quake-in-tokyo.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-08-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 98, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Moderate Quake in Tokyo", "print_headline": "Moderate Quake in Tokyo", "body_text": " **********A strong but brief earthquake rocked central Tokyo today, sending skyscrapers swaying and snarling rail transportation at the beginning of O-Bon, an annual holiday.

The group is reportedly led by Abdel Hadi Hamadi, older brother of Mohammed Ali and Abbas Hamadi who are held in West Germany on terrorist charges. **********Abdel Hadi Hamadi, a senior member of the Iran-backed fundamentalist Party of God, is widely believed to be holding another West German, Rudolf Cordes. A third West German, Alfred Schmidt, who was kidnapped here a year ago at the same time as Mr. Cordes, was freed last September. **********Taking the West Germans hostage is designed to press the Bonn Government to release the Hamadi brothers. **********Abbas Hamadi is on trial in Dusseldorf, charged with complicity in the kidnapping of West Germans in Beirut. Mohammed Ali Hamadi has been charged in connection with the hijacking in June 1985 of a Trans World Airways jetliner to Beirut airport and in the murder of an American passenger on board. **********The West German Embassy in Damascus said the Syrian Foreign Minister, Farouk al-Sharaa, telephoned his German counterpart, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, and informed him of the release. **********The first indication that Mr. Schray might be released came Wednesday, when the kidnappers issued a statement in West Beirut saying that mediation by President Hafez al-Assad of Syria had led to what the statement called ''commitment and guarantees'' that could resolve the Schray case within hours.  [ In Bonn, the West German Government gave no indication how Mr. Schray's release had been secured. **********The government spokesman, Friedhelm Ost, said in a statement that Mr. Schray had been released and added: ''West Germany thanks the Syrian Government. It also hopes that the Syrian Government will be able to succeed in freeing Rudolf Cordes, who has been held as a hostage in Lebanon since Jan. 17, 1987.''  [ Mr. Ost did not explain why Syria was being thanked. The government has maintained a taut silence about its handling of the kidnappings. Although there have been persistent reports in the West German press that a sizeable ransom was paid for Mr. Schmidt, possibly by private industry, the Government has denied that any money was paid. There has also been insistent speculation that Mr. Schmidt's release was linked to a Bonn decision not to extradite Mohammed Ali Hamadi to the United States. ]  The police said Mr. Schray was brought at daybreak in an ambulance to the office of the mainstream Shiite Amal movement in the southern suburbs of Beirut, where he was turned over to Syrian officers, who then drove him to Damascus. **********Two Scandinavian relief workers for the United Nations, Jan Stening, a Swede, and William Joergensen, a Norwegian, were released Tuesday after 26 days in captivity. **********Lieut Col. William R. Higgins, an American Marine officer who served as head of United Nations observer force, was seized by gunmen last month near the southern port of Tyre. **********Eight other Americans are among more than 20 foreign nationals missing in Lebanon. **********Private radio stations said today that Syrian pressure had secured the release of Roula Freij, the 16-year-old daughter of a wealthy Lebanese businessman.

Beginning salaries, which have risen to more than $25,000 in some cases, also show how great the need is. **********In fact, the Department of Labor calls physical therapy the third-fastest-growing profession. (The department says paralegal jobs are growing at the fastest rate; medical assistant jobs next.) By the year 2,000, the need for physical therapists will increase 87 percent from the 45,000 people in the field in 1986. **********It is easy to pinpoint some reasons. People who live longer suffer more strokes, broken hips, arthritis and muscular weakness that require long-term therapy. **********More young and middle-aged people exercise regularly - and such sports as jogging, skiing, and tennis can result in knee and back problems, sprained ankles, broken bones. Cancer patients and others need therapy after operations to get muscles working. **********Physical therapy is a relatively young field that grew largely out of World War I, when wounded soldiers needed rehabilitation. Therapists of those days were called ''reconstruction aides,'' according to Kenneth D. Davis, director of the department of practice of the American Physical Therapy Association. The group has 47,600 members, including about 2,000 physical therapy assistants with associate degrees in the speciality. **********Today's physical therapists are college graduates, holding at least a bachelor of science degree from one of 116 college programs. About 16 percent have master's degrees. **********A student typically starts with science courses like physics, chemistry, psychology and anatomy, along with humanities. The prospective therapist specializes in the final two years. Others with a science background could take the therapy courses at the master's degree level. Each state licenses physical therapists after examinations. **********''The fastest-growing area these days is private practice, and the hospital-based practice is diminishing.'' Mr. Davis said. In private practice, physical therapists can earn $50,000 and more. **********Physical therapists with administrative responsibilities earn $38,000 to more than $45,000, Mr. Davis said. In the Northeast the average salaried physical therapist earns $33,000 and the nonsalaried in private practice earns $70,000. **********The field continues to be dominated by women. Only about 25 percent are men. **********Mr. Davis became acquainted with physical therapy when he took a job in a Chicago rehabilitation hospital, and then began studying in the field. ''After graduation from the University of Illinois I worked at Children's Hospital in Washington and then became director of rehabilitation services at Washington Hospital Center,'' Mr. Davis said. Long active in the association, he later took an administrative job at its Alexandria, Va., headquarters. **********For Margaret McAteer, physical therapy was a way to work in a health field besides becoming a doctor or a nurse. A basketball player, she won an athletic scholarship to Temple University in Philadelphia and graduated with a bachelor of science in physical therapy in 1983. ''It took four years and two summers,'' she said. Now she is director of physical therapy at Beth Israel Hospital in Passaic, N.J. **********Miss McAteer likes the flexibility of the job. Employment is available almost anywhere, she said. Married therapists can take time off to raise children knowing that jobs will be there when they can return to work. They can also work part time. ''The work is most always a challenge and rewarding, too,'' she said. ''First, we must have a good working relationship with doctors.'' She added that understanding the patient was also important. ''Hurt people are not themselves,'' she said. ''There has to be a lot of psychology involved in therapy.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/27/business/fletcher-consolidation.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-06-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 187, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fletcher Consolidation", "print_headline": "Fletcher Consolidation", "body_text": " **********Fletcher Challenge, the New Zealand-based conglomerate, is consolidating the management of two leading British Columbia forest-products companies, creating an entity with about $2 billion in annual sales.

The Government in September announced a sharp currency devaluation and huge price increases, which raised the inflation rate to 114 percent for that month alone. 'Balance Sheets Are Meaningless' **********''I have no idea what's going to happen,'' Mr. Traver said, noting that the volume of sales from his five companies had fallen by 60 percent in just six weeks. ''At the moment, balance sheets in Peru are meaningless. I'm having to change totally the way I run my business.'' **********The Government measures were aimed at slashing a fiscal deficit that was running at 16 percent of gross domestic product, but in the process the economy tumbled into a sudden recession. **********The purchasing power of Peruvians was decimated overnight as many prices rose by 100 to 500 percent. The ''shock'' left the private sector in disarray as customers vanished, orders were canceled, bills went unpaid and credit evaporated. **********''I think we're going to see many bankruptcies, which is a scenario that Peru has never witnessed before,'' Mr. Traver said. ''And I think it's going to happen very quickly, probably before Christmas.'' Storm of Criticism **********Struggling to put together a medium-term recovery plan amid a storm of criticism, the Economy Minister, Abel Salinas, has predicted an economic contraction of at least 6 percent in 1988, but many economists believe the situation is already worse than in 1983, when the gross domestic product shrank by 13 percent. **********The left-of-center Government of President Alan Garcia is at the center of the crisis because it primed a boom in consumer spending in 1986 and 1987 by printing new money and using up reserves of hard currency. But it has alienated both local business officials and foreign creditors with its policies, and now has few friends in time of need. **********Some economists now argue that the state must retrench from its involvement in the economy and leave the initiative of development to business. **********But for the moment, caught in the tailspin of falling sales, bankers and industrialists are unable to look that far ahead. ''You're completely out of date,'' one businessman told a colleague who contended that bank credits were still available. ''That was last week.'' Worse Time Ahead, Many Say **********Further, many executives expect still worse times because the surge of inflation last month has made an early new devaluation of Peru's currency, the inti, unavoidable and has blunted much of the positive impact on the fiscal deficit of the first round of price hikes. **********Probably nowhere is uncertainty more visible than on the streets of Lima, where an estimated 20,000 freelance money dealers buy and sell dollars. They feed the speculation that has driven the open market for the dollar from 210 to 530 intis in less than two months. **********For companies like Mr. Traver's Peruplast, the devaluation has proved doubly harmful. Mr. Traver had been importing polyethylene at 33 intis to the dollar, which was one of several official exchange rates in existence until all were unified last month at 250 intis to the dollar. But now, because the Government is out of dollars, he must buy them on the open market. 'Lack of Raw Materials' **********''At one of my plants, production is down from 150 tons to 25 tons per month because of the lack of raw materials,'' he said, referring to his flexible-plastic manufacturing operation. ''I may have to weld the factory gates shut and pay off my workers there.'' **********He said he expected his main plant to continue supplying Government monopolies with the plastic bags needed to pack salt, rice, sugar, powdered milk and fertilizer. But he added that a subsidiary that makes paint for packaging has seen sales drop sharply. **********With the economy in turmoil, even the local heads of multinational corporations seem uncertain how to react, yet the impact of recent developments has inevitably been greater among medium-sized independent businessmen like Mr. Traver who serve as the backbone of Peru's private sector. **********At times, the heavily built, jovial Columbia Business School graduate says, he wonders how business has managed to survive at all here. In the early 1970's, he recalled, a leftist military regime regarded all business officials as ''exploiters of the people,'' while a civilian Government in the early 1980's destroyed many local companies by opening up the economy to cheap imports. Disincentive to Investment **********On top of that, he went on, executives here must deal with the high cost of labor, brought on partly by strong trade unions; an intractable bureaucracy, and a tax system that he considers a disincentive to investment. ''It recently took me nine months to get an import license,'' he noted, ''and in the meantime I lost $500,000 in sales.'' **********Three years ago, Mr. Traver was even the target of an attempted assassination, presumably by leftist terrorists, when he was shot point-blank in the face as he left his office by car. Now he drives a bullet-proof Mercedes-Benz and carries a revolver with him at all times. **********Still, even as his business reels from the latest economic crisis, he has no intention of leaving Peru. ''The main change in my life is that I have stopped taking customers out to dinner,'' he said. ''The dinner bill now is equivalent to one month's wages for one of my workers, and I can't justify that in times like these.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/18/world/no-pay-no-fun-but-fight-is-on-for-un-job.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Lewis", "pub_date": "1988-09-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 723, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "No Pay, No Fun, but Fight Is On for U.N.

It is so hot, in fact, that the Assembly will pick its president by secret ballot this year for the first time since 1983. **********The two contestants are Dame Ruth Nita Barrow, the representative of the Caribbean island of Barbados, and Dante Caputo of Argentina, the Foreign Minister. **********It is a fight that has almost everything: a little nation against a big one, a black woman against a white man, a speaker of English against a speaker of Spanish. **********Some are even likening the contest to a replay of the Falklands War, in which Barbados and most of the other English-speaking Caribbean nations supported Britain, while Latin America sided with Argentina. **********But United Nations officials say the contest is also important because it threatens the tradition under which each region of the world gets its chance at the top United Nations jobs on a rotating basis and apportions them among its members. **********''If Argentina muscles out Barbados then nothing will be sacred,'' said one senior official. ''Small countries will know that they are at the mercy of their big neighbors.'' **********There are signs this is already happening.

Argentinia's representative, Marcelo E. R. Delpech, says that about 90 of the United Nation's 159 member countries support the Argentine Foreign Minister. These, he said, include East Europe, the Soviet Union, Japan and much of Asia, and all of Western Europe except Britain and Portugal. **********Diplomats say these countries are backing Argentina in the hope this will give them more influence with one of Latin America's biggest nations and a better chance of landing business deals. **********''With only 300,000 inhabitants we can't compete on trade or influence grounds,'' Dame Nita said. **********But as a black, she said, she has the support of black Africa, though diplomats say France is trying to persuade its French-speaking former colonies to support the Argentinian. Dame Nita is also backed by most English-speaking Commonwealth lands, including India, Pakistan and Canada. **********The United States faces a painful choice, with major interests to safeguard in both Latin America and the Caribbean. **********Many diplomats think the American vote will go to Barbados, with the United States delegate, Vernon A.

''The biggest problem is the lack of purchasing power.'' Wider Unrest Is Feared **********Government officials acknowledge that Mr. Rocard, a Socialist, will probably lose some popularity as a result of the confrontations. Some economists say the rash of strikes could snowball into wider unrest. Already the Communist-led General Confederation of Labor has called for a job action by all Government employees next Tuesday. **********But leaders of other unions seem reluctant to destabilize Mr. Rocard's Government. ''The union leaders don't want things to get out of hand, but it seems they're having a hard time keeping the rank and file in line,'' said Genevieve Vibert, an economist with Credit Lyonnais, a major French bank. Many unionists on Mr. Rocard's left flank accuse him of being too conservative and too concerned with austerity. **********Most of the strikes have been in the public sector rather than private sector, where many companies, making strong profits, have granted wage increases that have exceeded inflation in the last two years. After France suffered large trade and budget deficits, double-digit inflation and a currency crisis in the two years after the Socialists came to power in 1980, the Socialists changed gears and adopted a policy of ''rigor.'' **********That policy sought to restrain wages and spending to hold down inflation and the trade and budget deficits. When Jacques Chirac became Prime Minister in 1986, his conservative Government continued those austerity policies. **********''The policies of rigor have been prolonged for several years,'' said Francoise Milewski, an economist with the French Institute for Economic Analysis. ''Many people have suffered a real loss in earnings.'' Indeed, according to her institute, public workers have lost about 2.5 percent of their purchasing power since 1983. Focus on Nurses' Strike **********In the strike causing the most public concern, 170,000 nurses are demanding a raise of about $4,000 a year and a 33 percent increase in the starting salary. The Government has offered them $160 million more a year, but the nurses have ridiculed that offer. **********Meanwhile, a strike by 250 workers who make axles at Renault's plant in Le Mans is crippling the company.

Such a declaration could suspend civil liberties and empower the Government to restrict news reporting from Punjab. #500 Killed in 3 Months Last month, the Indian Parliament approved a constitutional amendment that would allow the Government to declare an emergency in Punjab to battle the growing terrorism by Sikh separatists. More than 500 people have died in terrorist-related violence there in the last three months. **********Indian officials have expressed concern about the increased firepower of the Sikh militants, who in the last week have used shoulder-fired anti-tank missiles, similar to those used by guerrillas in the war in Afghanistan. **********Intelligence officials say that the rocket assaults on paramilitary troops and the home of a prominent Sikh moderate politician have stunned the Government and that they are being forced to consider tighter security for threatened leaders, who have suddenly become more vulnerable to ambushes. **********Eighteen of the killings today occurred at Rajhra village, near Patti. Police officials told reporters that Sikh radicals had surrounded the homes of a Hindu family, rounded up the members, including a 5-month-old infant, and sprayed them with gunfire from automatic weapons. **********A statement by the Khalistan Commando Force, a terrorist faction, took responsibility for the killings and said such assaults would continue until police forces stopped what the group said were killings of young Sikh terrorist suspects. The police said that the same group had apparently killed nine people in two other villages in the area and that other extremist factions had shot eight people dead in separate attacks. Curfews have been imposed in these areas. **********The extremists are seeking a separate Sikh nation in Punjab. Sikhism is a monotheistic religion founded in the 15th century in an attempt to reconcile Islam and Hinduism. **********Officials here said the use of Soviet-made rocket launchers by the extremists has taken the conflict with Indian forces to a new level of sophisticated weaponry. **********Security officials said in interviews that the Government had underestimated the firepower of the Sikh rebels and that recent captures of the shoulder-fired rockets, plastic explosives, grenades and other arms have pointed to a more extensive, advanced and organized arsenal than was earlier believed to exist. **********The rockets, called RPG-7, for rocket-propelled grenades, can hit targets more than 1,500 feet away. **********''The recent seizures have taken us by surprise,'' a security official said. ''They have exceeded our earlier estimates.'' Source of Rocketers Unclear **********The source of the rockets is unclear, but some of them are reported to have been stolen from Indian Army ammunition dumps. Officials here say they have been unable to confirm reports that these weapons have been smuggled across the Afghan and Pakistani borders into Punjab. **********But they say they are very worried about the prospect of peace in Afghanistan because that could result in a sudden influx of sophisticated arms into northern India and spur the extremist campaign in Punjab. **********Earlier this week, the police raided two extremist centers in the Punjab districts of Amritsar and Ferozepore and captured 14 rockets, 32 Chinese-made Kalashnikov automatic rifles, grenades, bombs and a quarter ton of ammunition, much of it from a concrete underground bunker. **********Many terrorists - a current police estimate is 100 - are based in the Golden Temple at Amritsar, the leading Sikh shrine, officials say.

On the contrary, Nicaragua is in many ways more polarized than ever. **********The Sandinista crackdown on the internal opposition last month, which included the violent repression of a protest march, jailing of party leaders, closing of press outlets and the seizure of the country's largest private business, has driven many who hope for democracy in Nicaragua to the brink of despair. They say the crackdown disrupted slow progress that was being made toward a more open society here. **********Government leaders, however, say they were forced to act in order to thwart a United States-backed plan to undermine the Government.

Efforts to Revive Talks **********The author of the faltering Central American peace accord signed by regional leaders a year ago, President Oscar Arias Sanchez of Costa Rica, sought this week to encourage the contras and the Sandinistas to resume peace talks that broke down in June. **********At a gathering in Ecuador on Wednesday for the inauguration of that country's new President, Rodrigo Borja, Mr. Arias asked President Fidel Castro of Cuba to use his influence to encourage the Sandinistas to return to negotiations. **********Mr. Castro, who is perhaps the Sandinistas' closest ally, said after the meeting that he was willing to work for a ''just peace'' in Central America, and on Thursday, President Daniel Ortega Saavedra of Nicaragua invited the contras to Managua for four days of talks beginning Aug. 26. Mr. Ortega said the Sandinistas would also accept Washington as a site. **********On Friday, a contra leader, Adolfo Calero, reaffirmed the rebels' insistence that any future talks be held outside Nicaragua. ''The climate for a new meeting does not exist,'' he said, though he did not respond directly to the prospect of a meeting in Washington. Sweeping Changes Are Demanded **********Contra leaders say that if there are more peace talks, their first demand will be that profound political changes be decreed immediately. Mr. Calero said in Miami that new talks must be ''not to discuss democratic reforms, but to put them into practice.'' **********The contras are demanding that the Sandinista Front surrender control of Nicaragua's army and police, that all anti-Sandinista prisoners be released from jail in a matter of days and that the opposition be permitted to open its own television station. **********Within Nicaragua, social tension continues to grow, fueled largely by a rapidly deteriorating economy. **********Fighting recently broke out at a principal Managua market following efforts to dislodge vendors selling food without permits. And at a brewery, a labor conflict has turned ugly since a group of workers voted to quit the Sandinista labor federation and join one affiliated with the opposition. **********Canadian authorities were forced this week to issue public denials of a rumor that has been raging through parts of the countryside suggesting that Canada was ready to accept large numbers of Nicaraguan refugees. As the rumor spread, hundreds of impoverished peasants, many carrying their meager possessions, converged on the port of Corinto waiting for a Canadian boat that was supposedly waiting to take them away.

The Minneapolis company is one of a small number of American employers that have decided to become pushy in dealing with the medical community that cares for their employees. If these companies are successful, a lot of employers might decide they have been passive too long and use them as models. **********As of next Jan. 1, Honeywell will require that all its insurance carriers provide data that would enable the company to evaluate the performance of the doctors and hospitals with which it deals. By looking at this data, Honeywell says, it will be able to determine which doctors are performing too many unnecessary diagnostic tests or operations or are charging too much. It then would compel them to change their habits or leave the health-care systems that Honeywell encourages its employees to use. **********Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota, one of Honeywell's carriers, is resisting the company's request. The health insurer fears that the sophistication needed to analyze the raw data and apply the results properly does not yet exist and that a little information could do a lot of damage to the practices of some physicians, often unfairly. Blue Cross and Blue Shield says it would be happy to hand over such information, but only if it were ''scrambled'' so that doctors could not be identified. Honeywell argues that data in this form would be far less valuable. **********Honeywell's strategy stems from a realization that a simple guarantee by doctors that they will provide discounts in return for a company's business does not assure that costs will be held down and that adequate health care will be provided. Many employers and health-care experts note that doctors can easily make up for the discounts by ordering unnecessary procedures as dramatic as coronary bypasses and as commonplace as X-rays. That problem is considered a reason why health-care costs have been rising faster than the general inflation rate, forcing companies to increase insurance premiums sharply and transfer more costs to employees. Honeywell also acknowledges, however, that some doctors might not order enough procedures, and patients could suffer. **********Honeywell's ultimate goal ''is to identify the reimbursement for any health care, to record it, and to subject it to analysis as to whether or not it was appropriate and necessary,'' said Dr. John M. Burns, vice president for health and environmental resources at Honeywell. **********To put it more dramatically, the nation's leading supplier of automation and control systems for homes and buildings wants ''to take the quality management system that has distinguished the change in the manufacturing industry and apply it to the medical industry - to make the medical community comply with standards,'' he said. **********But many representatives of the medical community argue that the current data on physicians are not sufficient to make constructive judgments. Dr. D. K. Ohrt, vice president and medical director at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota, acknowledged that many sophisticated companies would someday expect this kind of information routinely. The Blues, he said, were working with physicians to develop a consensus on appropriateness standards for treatment. The idea is to prevent discrepancies like that for the hysterectomy, or removal of the uterus, which is performed seven times as frequently in some Minnesota communities as in others. **********But until those standards are developed and a system for applying them is perfected, ''all we have are data,'' Dr. Ohrt said. ''And I don't want John Burns or anyone else to be approaching our physicians or hospitals with data we gave them that haven't been validated at all.'' **********Honeywell's push for more complete information on where its health-care expenditures are going is only part of the company's aggressive approach, which emphasizes sharing responsibility among the employer, the employee, the medical provider and the claims administrator. Fourteen months ago Honeywell threw out its health maintenance organizations and traditional fee-for-service indemnity insurance plans for 12,000 of its 78,000 employees worldwide and forced them to use preferred provider organizations, networks of physicians who agree to provide care at a discount in return for a company's business. The idea was to hold down medical costs through better management, yet not limit necessary access to physicians. **********Honeywell has already begun to make judgments on the medical community in one area: the very expensive operation. The company has designated six ''centers of excellence'' around the country to which it sends its employees for these procedures - the University of Minnesota for heart transplants, for example. Honeywell bases its selection on the success rate of the institution, and Dr. Burns said the efficiency with which the leading centers can perform operations can also mean cost savings."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/18/business/india-shifting-carbide-judge.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-10-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 283, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "India Shifting Carbide Judge", "print_headline": "India Shifting Carbide Judge", "body_text": " **********An Indian court has ordered the replacement of the judge trying the compensation case against the Union Carbide Corporation, saying there were grounds for the company's concern that it might not get a fair trial at Bhopal. **********The verdict is likely to further delay the complex litigation concerning the Bhopal gas disaster, which has not even entered the trial stage four years after the December 1984 leak and two years after the case began in India. **********It also set the stage for a crucial confrontation between lawyers for Carbide and the Indian Government that is scheduled to begin Nov. 1 before the Supreme Court here.

It finally cleared them out by trading the autos for advertising space and time. More recently, Cunard Lines Ltd. swapped cabins and meals for advertising as well as airline seats, tableware for its dining rooms and air-conditioning units. **********In both cases, one of the agencies involved in the process was Reciprocal Merchandising Services of New York, a specialist advertising agency in the barter field. It is an alternative way of buying media time, sales promotions and products by exchanging what one company has for something that another company has. ''In bartering, everyone wins,'' said Perry Silver, Reciprocal's president. **********The process operates like this: In a current $100,000 radio advertising campaign that Reciprocal has for Frenchmen's Reef, the resort on St. Thomas, in the Virgin Islands, Reciprocal works with J. D. Greif, the Philadelphia ad agency and provides that amount of radio time for the resort. In exchange, Frenchmen's Reef offers $100,000 of rooms and food. Reciprocal uses the rooms and food for its clients and contacts, particularly from the radio and television field, either directly for them or for winners of contests offered by the clients. **********All through the process no money changes hands except at the end, when Reciprocal sells the final product or service - in that case, the rooms and food - at a discount. In the end, Mr. Silver said, barter winds up with a cash payoff. ''The problem is that while everyone along the chain can benefit from bartering, when it comes to my landlord, he wants only cash,'' Mr. Silver said. **********Barter advertising may be considered old-fashioned or nonprofessional or whatever critics choose to call it, Mr. Silver asserted, but it produces a better return than the regular practice of advertising. The normal return for an advertising agency is from 15 to 17.65 percent of billings, although many agencies do get additional revenue from fees for time spent on an account. Reciprocal is drawing a return of 17.5 percent to 20 percent, he said. ''One reason that we get a better return is that we build into our cost factor an extra percentage to lay out the funds for a campaign for a payoff that may not come for a year,'' he said. **********That alludes to an occasional paradox in the whole procedure. If Reciprocal does a particularly good job in the campaign and the advertiser becomes very busy, a cruise line or hotel chain, for example, he and his clients will be unable to share in the exchange process because either the cabins or the rooms will not be available for months. But then, Mr. Silver adds, ''It's like cash in the bank, anyway.'' **********The agency, which has been in operation for more than 30 years but under Mr. Silver's ownership since 1982, provides the normal media services of large agencies but obtains creative services from other agencies. Reciprocal offers clients the option of working with them on a trade or on a receivables basis. In the receivables option, Reciprocal will buy a company's excess inventory in exchange for the sale to the company of other needed products or services at a discount. **********Mr. Silver's agency buys time and space on radio, television and magazines across the country and owns space in various markets on outdoor billboard, buses, subway stations and railroad platforms. The agency doesn't function as a barter club but it does issue gift certificates to a client for the dollar amount of media purchased. It also has its own RMS credit card for that purpose. **********''We doubled our business between 1982, when I took over, and 1984,'' he said, ''and since then have been growing at a rate of between 20 percent and 30 percent.'' The agency currently does about $5.5 million in billings."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/22/business/careers-improving-quality-of-products.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-11-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 765, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Careers; Improving Quality Of Products", "print_headline": "Careers; Improving Quality Of Products", "body_text": " **********THE first Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Awards were won last week by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, Motorola Inc. and Globe Metallurgical Inc. Presented by President Reagan, the Government awards, named for the late Secretary of Commerce, were given for high product quality. **********About the same time, the Society of Management Engineers, which is based in Dearborn, Mich., issued a study that warned that much remained to be done about production quality - largely a responsibility of manufacturing engineers. They work at the edge of fast-changing technology and need much broader training, according to the study by A. T. Kearney Inc., a consulting firm. **********Detlef K. Koska, a principal at Kearney's Chicago office who supervised the study, stressed what he called important points: ''In the past managements would say, 'Let's throw in more technology.' Yet it is really people who have to make the manufacturing environment more successful. Also, change can come only from the top down.'' **********LaRoux K. Gillespie, senior project engineer at the Kansas City, Mo., plant of Allied-Signal Inc., agreed. He emphasized the lack today in many companies of top-level ''appreciation of strategic and leadership issues'' that engineers in factories need to know. **********For example, they need to understand floor problems. ''Manufacturing engineers have to go out on the floor,'' he explained. ''Problems are relatively undefined. If a machine doesn't work the engineer has to determine the real underlying trouble.'' **********That means dealing directly with people almost daily - workers who use machinery, maintenance technicians, equipment engineers who might have purchased the machinery, vendors who sell equipment and scientists who develop products. **********He thinks programs like those given by the National Technological University at the master's degree level via satellite to company plants are ''the wave of the future.'' His plant, for example, has a link with the University of Missouri through which engineering lectures are received and videotaped. **********What was another significant finding of the study, Mr. Gillespie said, was that manufacturing engineers needed not only the broader background required to integrate but also the chance to help a company's top management plan strategy. **********''Take a look at manufacturing that employs 21 million people in this country,'' he said. ''Look at the future around the world, emerging countries like India and China now becoming competitive. We cannot depend on top management alone.'' **********Therefore planning strategy must be vertical, not just horizontal, he added, to assure a quick response to competition. Perhaps production costs have to be cut sharply; perhaps licensing a particular product is the quicker answer. **********Tomorrow's manufacturing engineers probably will have that broader training. Today's manufacturing engineer is what he calls ''a converted engineer'' who might have a background in mechanical, chemical, electrical or industrial engineering. In earlier years many so-called manufacturing engineers advanced through the ranks from shopwork, often with a technologist's background. **********After an undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering, Mr. Gillespie, who is 46 years old, got a master's degree in manufacturing engineering at Utah State University, one of the few such programs. **********Mark J. Stratton, manager of manufacturing engineering education, at the Society of Manufacturing Engineers, stressed the recent growth of manufacturing engineering programs. The three earliest accredited programs back in the 1970's were at Boston University, Utah State University and the University of Massachusetts. Now the list includes Oregon State, California State Polytechnic and Kansas State. Many others have programs that are not accredited by the inspection organization related to the Society of Manufacturing Engineers. **********Mr. Stratton explained that the impetus for more programs in manufacturing engineering came in 1983 when the International Business Machines Corporation asked universities for proposals about setting up master's degree programs.

A third answered simply, ''I shall be Emperor.'' **********The student was Crown Prince Akihito, the heir to the Chrysanthemum Throne, whom Mrs. Vining had been hired to tutor in English after Emperor Hirohito asked American officials to find an instructor. **********Now, four decades later, with the Emperor seriously ill, the 54-year-old Crown Prince may finally be about to see his statement come true, becoming the 125th monarch in a line that, tradition has it, extends from 660 B.C. Not Altogether Like Anna **********Hirohito's illness has also suddenly revived interest in Mrs. Vining, a tall, gracious 85-year-old Quaker who instructed Akihito from 1946 to 1950 and became closer to him perhaps than anyone else outside the cloistered confines of the imperial household. Her story invites comparison to Anna Leonowens, the English tutor to Crown Prince Chulalongkorn of Siam in the 1860's made famous by the novel ''Anna and the King of Siam'' and ''The King and I,'' the book's stage and screen adaptations. **********Mrs. Vining modestly disavowed the parallel. ''The whole situation was so different,'' insisted Mrs. Vining, who lives quietly in a retirement community on rolling farmland here, 36 miles southwest of Philadelphia. **********But she has been inundated this week with requests for interviews by Japanese newspapers and magazines as one of the few authentic sources of information on Akihito. And she acknowledges that her role was unique. **********At the time she took up her duties in 1946, the Emperor had only recently renounced his divinity, and until the end of the war no common Japanese had been allowed to look at either the Emperor or the Crown Prince. Parent-Teacher Conferences **********Until then an author of children's books, Mrs. Vining suddenly found herself the first foreigner permitted inside the living quarters in the Imperial Palace. She not only tutored the Crown Prince, but also eventually his brother and three sisters, and even Empress Nagako. **********As she recounted it in a best-selling book in 1952, ''Windows for the Crown Prince,'' she had parent-teacher conferences with the Emperor and Empress, played cards with them, taught their children Monopoly and was privileged to attend traditional functions like the New Year's poetry reading in the palace. When the imperial family visited one of its country retreats in the mountains or by the sea, Mrs. Vining accompanied them. **********In addition, with tact, she sought to fulfill a request from the grand steward of the Imperial Household Agency that she ''open windows onto a wider world'' for the Crown Prince, gently nudging him in the direction of democracy. In this, she felt herself part of the American Occupation, headed by Gen. Douglas MacArthur. In two private lessons a week and one or two hours in class at the Peers School, originally started for princes of the royal blood and later open to commoners, she sought ''to set him free, to let him be himself.'' **********''I certainly wasn't trying to mold him ideologically, but he was still a prisoner, in a way, of the imperial chamberlains,'' she said. **********From their first lessons, when the Prince was only 12 years old, Mrs. Vining sought to encourage more independence in him. On Fridays, after the last class in the afternoon, she often asked Akihito what he was going to do. **********''It is not decided,'' he would respond. **********''Who decides?'' Mrs. Vining inquired. **********''The chamberlains,'' the Crown Prince explained. **********''Why don't you decide?'' she suggested. ''This is your afternoon.'' **********This conversation occurred many times, Mrs. Vining remembers, until finally one day the Crown Prince announced, ''I decide.'' ''I thought that was great,'' she said. **********In her parent-teacher meetings with the Emperor and Empress, Mrs. Vining also worked to establish what she felt was a more normal family life. **********''When they asked if I had any suggestions for them, I said I thought it was a pity they saw so little of the Crown Prince, that he missed them,'' she recounted. **********To try to insure that the Crown Prince was treated like her other students in the Peers School, Mrs. Vining gave all the pupils English names, in alphabetical order. Since he sat in the middle of the room, he drew Jimmy. Not a Carbon Copy **********As for Akihito himself, Mrs. Vining found him honest, friendly and intelligent, ''near the top of his class, though not the very top.'' He was never arrogant and was a good athlete who enjoyed tennis, swimming and fishing, she said. **********''He won't be a carbon copy of his father,'' Mrs. Vining said. ''He wasn't hidden away like his father was. He will be much more visible, more like Queen Elizabeth.'' **********Since she left Japan in 1950 she has been back to visit several times. Akihito still keeps in touch with her, sending her photographs of his own family at Christmas. **********But one of her most cherished memories is of a comment by Hirohito. ''If ever anything I did has been a success,'' he said at a luncheon, ''it was asking Mrs. Vining to come here.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/15/business/company-news-chiron-to-get-20-million.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-11-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 212, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Chiron to Get $20 Million", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Chiron to Get $20 Million", "body_text": " **********The Chiron Corporation, a biotechnology company, said today that Ciba-Geigy Ltd. would make a $20 million investment. **********Ciba-Geigy will purchase one million shares, or 7.9 percent, of new Chiron common stock at $20 each.

Munis, after all, have an appeal that few other investments can match - tax-free income - and, many individuals believe, they are safe and hassle-free. Unfortunately, that is not so. ''Munis are for the astute investor,'' said Jay Goldinger, co-founder and principal of Capital Insight Inc., a Beverly Hills, Calif., retail and institutional brokerage. He noted that municipal bonds are traded in a bid-and-ask market that has no price-quotation tape and less liquidity than the markets in United States Government securities and common stocks. Therefore, the majority of investors who are attracted to municipal bonds should invest through no-load municipal bond funds, not directly, he said. **********''One client came in and said, 'I just want to put everything into municipal bonds,' '' recalled Madeline I. Noveck, president of Novos Planning Associates Inc. and chairman of the Metropolitan New York Society of the Institute of Certified Financial Planners. ''But it's not that simple. You have to structure your bond portfolio so you have many bases covered.'' She suggested staggering maturities to limit interest-rate risk and including corporate bonds, as well as municipals, in the portfolio. And bonds should be only one part of a diversified portfolio that includes equities, such cash equivalents as Treasury bills for liquidity and other assets, she said. **********The easiest way to establish a carefully structured bond portfolio is to invest through a mutual fund or a unit investment trust. Both invest in professionally selected diversified portfolios of a certain description - such as insured triple-A securities or high-yield (alias junk) bonds. A mutual fund is actively managed; a unit investment trust is a fixed portfolio of securities that are normally held until maturity, unless called. Both offer special local portfolios with double and triple tax exemptions for high-tax states like New York and California. But even selecting a mutual fund or unit investment trust can be complex, although a new requirement by the Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to help investors by making comparable data available. Funds must calculate yields based on total return (income plus or minus the change in the value of the securities in the fund) for specified time periods. In the past, some funds advertised distribution rates that were bolstered by capital gains distributions; others chose whatever time period was most favorable, given their performance. **********A look at one fund shows some of the complexities of the municipal-bond funds. **********''I know what sells funds - high yield - but high yield isn't always the way to invest,'' said Walter Kingston Jr., chief portfolio manager of the Freedom Managed Tax-Exempt Fund, a $13 million open-end fund from the Tucker Anthony Management Company. In its first full year of operation the fund, which holds only investment-grade bonds (rated A or better) moved into the top ranks of funds tracked by Lipper Analytical Services. For the 12 months ended May 31, it provided a total return of 9.95 percent, for a No. 5 ranking. **********''You can't have high current yield along with high distribution and high total return unless interest rates do not change,'' Mr. Kingston explained, because when interest rates rise, bond prices fall. **********''Once you get away from the highest yield, though, there are many strategies,'' he said. ''I'm going to try to structure my portfolio in a way that I can trade the volatility - protect the assets when yields rise or enhance the assets when yields fall.'' **********One way Mr. Kingston does this is by hedging the portfolio in the futures and options market. Another is by trading actively; he has had a turnover equal to 100 percent of the fund's size since the first of the year. **********''You don't get high yield in short-term paper,'' he said. ''Relatively high yield means long-term bonds.'' But there he offers a warning to investors: ''Don't buy long-term funds for short-term purposes. If you need liquidity, don't buy a long-term bond fund.'' **********Whether an investor should buy a mutual fund or a unit investment trust depends on his or her objectives. ''Buy a trust if you want to lock in a rate of return and you need a predictable income stream,'' for retirement, for example, said Thomas Littauer, senior vice president for marketing of Van Kampen Merritt, a Xerox Financial Services company that is the nation's largest sponsor of insured municipal trusts. A fund, being actively managed, will strive for a higher return, but that entails risk. **********Also, a trust does not have a fund's annual management fee, Mr. Littauer noted, but it does have a one-time, up-front sales charge of 4 to 5 percent and a nominal trustee surveillance fee of no more than one-tenth of 1 percent a year. Both funds and trusts offer liquidity, because trust sponsors make a secondary market in trust units. **********Van Kampen Merritt offers trusts of 5-, 10-, 15-, 20- and 30-year maturities of triple-A rated securities with both interest and principal at maturity guaranteed by a major financial guarantor. Mr. Littauer said sales have risen more than 30 percent over last year. **********''A lot of that is due to turbulence in the markets and because interest rates are higher,'' he said. ''There's been a real flight to quality.'' A typical minimum investment in a fund or trust is about $5,000, although some allow investments as small as $1,000. People who have $25,000 or more to invest may want to consider buying bonds directly, although Mr. Goldinger said investors should have at least at $100,000. **********Next week: Direct investments in municipal bonds.8.4 = 2.0 LINES John Hancock Mutual Life Insuranced (Tucker Anthony)"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/09/world/koreans-open-assembly-campaign.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Haberman", "pub_date": "1988-04-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 810, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Koreans Open Assembly Campaign", "print_headline": "Koreans Open Assembly Campaign", "body_text": " **********South Korea's capacity for the promise and the potential disorder of democracy was put to a new test today with the official start of a campaign for National Assembly elections this month. **********The April 26 balloting shapes up as a rerun of the bruising presidential election held in December. **********Once again, the Government party faces a fractured opposition, whose divisions and bitterness run deeper than ever. Once again, politicians and neutral commentators expect the ruling camp to retain its grip on power and perhaps even to tighten it. **********And once again, campaign atmospherics are highlighted by charges of vote-buying and intimidation. Most of the accusations are aimed at the governing Democratic Justice Party, which has by far the most money to spend. But none of the parties are stinting themselves as they enter the first legislative elections since 1985. Quieter Campaign Expected **********For all the familiarity of the situation, many South Koreans expect - or at least hope - that the next few weeks will be quieter than the presidential campaign last fall, which was filled with nasty polemics and bursts of violence. Politicians say the electorate seems to be weary of political struggle and views the campaign as an inevitability to endure rather than as an opportunity to seize joyfully. **********''I can see it when I shake hands with people,'' said Lee Chul, an anti-Government member of the National Assembly who is running as an independent. ''I can tell that the enthusiasm is down.'' **********The battle is for a legislature that has been expanded from 276 seats to 299 and that, in theory, should be stronger than its predecessors. Under a new Constitution that went into effect on Feb. 25, it is to have broadened investigatory powers, and it may not be dissolved by the president. **********But even a bolder National Assembly is not likely to present a significant threat to the new President, Roh Tae Woo. For the most part, it will remain what it has long been - a forum for grievances rather than an effective legislative body along American or Western European lines. Changes in Election Law **********With the opposition in disarray, the ruling party last month rammed through a law calling for the direct election of 224 legislators from local districts and for the proportional distribution of the remaining 75 seats. As usual, the Assembly is skewed in favor of rural areas, traditional Government bastions. **********But big cities, especially Seoul, are better represented than before, and anti-Government candidates normally run well there. In addition, there will be only one assembly member per district, a departure from the recent procedure of electing two people from each constituency. Those two points, taken together, were widely regarded as a formula for opposition success -had the rivalrous parties been able to stick together. **********For a while, it appeared that the two main opposition figures, Kim Young Sam and Kim Dae Jung, would do just that. Instead, personal antagonisms and political differences got in the way, as they did last fall. As a result, Kim Young Sam's Reunification Democratic Party and Kim Dae Jung's Party for Peace and Democracy are fighting head to head in dozens of districts. **********The chief beneficiary will be Mr. Roh, who is looking to consolidate his authority by showing that his Government has gained popularity. Big Majority Is Possible **********He was elected with only 36.6 percent of the popular vote, and his party says it would like to increase that share to 40 percent this time. Because of the method of seat distribution, a plurality of that size should give the ruling camp at least 55 percent of the 299 seats. Some pessimists in the opposition say a two-thirds Government majority is not out of the question. **********Mr. Roh has gone to lengths to distance himself from his political patron, former President Chun Doo Hwan, by dumping many Chun loyalists from the party's roster of candidates. But while he tries to run from the previous, unpopular regime, the opposition is making sure that he cannot hide. **********Its leaders have wasted no time linking Mr. Roh to the corruption scandal surrounding Chun Kyung Hwan, the former President's younger brother. The younger Mr. Chun is accused of having embezzled millions of dollars when he headed a rural development program called the Saemaul Undong. **********Kim Young Sam charged today that Mr. Roh must have been aware of the alleged wrongdoing because he was Home Minister five years ago and in that post had ultimate jurisdiction over Chun Kyung Hwan."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/25/world/ex-panama-president-challenges-un-s-invitation-to-his-successor.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Lewis", "pub_date": "1988-09-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 421, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ex-Panama President Challenges U.N.'s Invitation to His Successor", "print_headline": "Ex-Panama President Challenges U.N.'s Invitation to His Successor", "body_text": " **********Panama's ousted President has challenged plans for his successor to address the General Assembly next week. **********Eric Arturo Delvalle, who says he is still President even though he was removed from office by the Panamanian Parliament in February, asserted in a letter to Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar that inviting Manuel Solis Palma to address the General Assembly on Tuesday as Panamanian head of state violates its rules because Mr. Solis ''is not the representative of my Government nor is he the authorized spokesman of Panama.'' **********Mr. Delvalle, who is reported to be in hiding in Panama, said in the letter, dated Sept. 19, that he is unable to attend the opening of the General Assembly himself. **********Mr. Delvalle, whom the Reagan Administration still recognizes as Panama's constitutional head of state, was removed after he tried to oust Gen.

The chips, known as dynamic random access memories, or D-RAM's, are made mainly by Japanese manufacturers. Is the shortage merely a cyclical fluctuation or a more fundamental change? How long will it last?  Rajiv Chaudhri  Semiconductor analyst, Goldman, Sachs & Company. **********The shortage will last well into 1989 and I think it's going to get worse. New capacity is coming in, yields are improving and production is increasing, but that will not be enough. D-RAM demand grows 100 percent a year on average. **********I think this cycle could be different from the last cycle for several reasons. In 1984, the Japanese were going overboard with capital spending. This time they will err on the side of not having enough capacity. The Japanese companies this time have a bigger share of the market than they had last time. They will be more profit conscious this time and less market-share conscious.The Japanese will try to prolong this as long as they can.  Doug Andrey  Manager of industry statistical programs, Semiconductor Industry Association. **********It will ease toward the end of the third quarter and will end in the fourth quarter.

Roach  Chairman and chief executive officer, the Tandy Corporation. **********The D-RAM shortage may cause some fundamental changes in the ways in which U.S. chip manufacturers address the marketplace and make decisions. U.S. end users of D-RAM's find themselves in a difficult position. There is a natural tendency to want to be supportive of U.S. chip makers on the one side and a necessity of remaining viable manufacturers on the other. **********Traditionally, the semiconductor industry did not want to be in too close a relationship with its customers. Today it is beginning to say something totally different. It is saying maybe it wants to do long-term contracts. What it is finding out is that it is making other parts that are not salable without a supply of D-RAM's. The domestic semiconductor manufacturers are going to have to prove that they justify the support of the end-users. I'm not sure when the difficulty will be over, but few say later than mid-1989.  Joseph L. Parkinson  Chairman and chief executive officer, Micron Technology Inc. **********There is a widely held theory among some industry observers that clouds will gather sometime soon, and D-RAM's will rain down on the parched American computer industry. We at Micron, as among the last in the field of American D-RAM producers, question this weather forecast. **********The Japanese destroyed the American D-RAM industry by a hailstorm of illegal selling of products here in the U.S. at below their foreign-made cost to produce, thus eliminating five of seven major American D-RAM producers. As a result of the Japanese/American Semiconductor Agreement such illegal dumping is prohibited in the U.S. and most other countries. **********The D-RAM technology is too complicated for easy entry of any new supplier, and the lead time on sophisticated manufacturing facilities too long for excess capacity to be built shortly. Accordingly, supplies will remain constrained for a prolonged period.

In comparable deals, banks typically earn fees of 1 to 1.5 percent. But in the RJR Nabisco deal, even a lender of $100 million, the minimum loan size, can expect 1.5 percent in fees. **********Representatives of about 40 of the largest international banks assembled at the Pierre Hotel in New York yesterday to review the RJR Nabisco transaction. The banks had been selected for their ability to commit at least $500 million each. A second tier of banks will meet in New York on Jan. 5 to discuss commitments of $100 million and up. Japanese Support Is Needed **********Tomorrow, a similar meeting will be held in Japan. Because the Japanese banks are being asked to provide about $5.5 billion, more than a third of the total $13.75 billion in bank financing, Kohlberg, Kravis's Henry R. Kravis is expected to ask 11 Japanese banks to provide roughly $500 million each. The Japanese participation is viewed as crucial in closing the deal. **********''I think they'll have difficulty if Japan doesn't step up for a third,'' said Mark J. Lerner, vice president and head of the Japan banking group at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. ''My perspective is the Japanese banks will play a significant role.'' **********The steep upfront fees reflect some of the concessions that the deal's architects expect they will have to make to allay the lingering apprehension among potential lenders and policy makers. The Ministry of Finance in Japan has said it is monitoring leveraged buyout lending by Japanese banks. And several American legislators have promised to review the issue in Congress next year. Additional Loan Risks **********The RJR Nabisco deal, however, poses additional risks because of its unprecedented size. Banks fear that the deal will tax the banking system's ability to absorb the debt and thus make it difficult for them to resell parcels of the loans in the secondary market, as they often do to reduce their exposure to specific deals. **********For that reason, participating banks are being asked to hold the loans longer than usual and to coordinate any resales in the secondary market, so that any benefits one bank gains by reselling its loans are shared on a prorated basis with the other banks in the syndicate. **********''This is pretty well acknowledged as an exceptionally strong credit,'' one participant at yesterday's meeting said. ''But because of the size, this is not going to be a deal where everyone can sell down to some relatively modest number within 30 days.'' **********The banks have until Jan. 17 to respond, and few had made commitments as of yesterday, despite the sweeteners in the deal. Details of the Financing **********Of the $13.75 billion being raised by the banks, $6 billion will be in the form of a bridge loan to be repaid from the sale of assets: $5 billion in the first 12 months and $1 billion in the following six months. **********Another $1.5 billion will be repaid over two years, while another $5.25 billion portion is expected to be a six-year term loan. A final $1 billion loan for working capital will be made available for three years. **********Along with higher fees, there is another difference in the RJR Nabisco financing. Ordinarily, agent manager status is reserved for a handful of the largest lenders. But here, all of the 75 to 100 banks that are expected to make up the primary lending syndicate are being asked to commit at least $100 million, and thus they will be entitled to the agent manager fees. **********Banks that commit $1 billion or more will receive a facility fee of 2.25 percent plus an agent manager fee of 1 percent. Those that commit between $750 million and $999 million will receive 2 percent and seven-eighths of 1 percent; $600 million to $749 million, 1.75 percent plus seven-eighths of 1 percent; $500 million to $599 million, 1.75 percent plus three-quarters of 1 percent; $350 million to $499 million, 1.625 percent plus three-eighths of 1 percent; $200 million to $349 million, 1.5 percent plus one-quarter of 1 percent; and $100 million to $199 million, 1.375 percent plus one-eighth of 1 percent. Questions on Fees **********It was not clear whether the four lead banks, Manufacturers Hanover, Bankers Trust, Chase Manhattan and Citicorp, who together have committed to lend $2.7 billion, were entitled to any fees beyond those given other lenders of their size. Nor could bankers explain what would happen if the bank fees exceed or fall short of the $325 million that had been disclosed in earlier public filings. **********At this point, delays in lining up the bank financing will only add to the volatility of RJR Nabisco's stock, which closed yesterday at $89.875, up 87.5 cents. That price was well below the ostensible $109 value that the buyers have placed on the deal."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/06/business/the-media-business-advertising-ads-for-diet-soft-drinks-look-new.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Stevenson", "pub_date": "1988-09-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 570, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ads for Diet Soft Drinks Look New", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Ads for Diet Soft Drinks Look New", "body_text": " **********REMEMBER when diet soft drinks were promoted on television only by curvaceous women in bikinis? **********Times have changed.

And last night, on ABC's Monday Night Football, Diet Coke broke a new campaign featuring brawny football players showing off their muscle. **********Why the shift? Both the Coca-Cola Company and Pepsico Inc. are determined to capture their share of the growing number of men turning to diet soft drinks. Calorie-counting women used to dominate this market. **********In the late 1970's about 75 percent of diet soft drinks were consumed by women. By 1982, when Diet Coke was introduced, the number was 72 percent, and it is now 65 percent, according to Michael A. Beindorff, Coca-Cola U.S.A.'s advertising manager. **********Advertising is both following the trend and encouraging it. ''We've moved from that unbelievable woman walking out of the ocean drinking from a Tab bottle to the New York Giants football team,'' said Jesse Meyers, publisher of Beverage Digest, an industry newsletter. **********The popularity of diet drinks among men is one reason for the near-explosive growth of the category in the past five years. But industry analysts say the main reason is that many find the taste of the products using Nutrasweet as a sweetener more appealing. **********Diet Coke is the nation's third best-selling soft-drink brand, behind Coke Classic (which held 19.8 percent of the overall market at the beginning of the year, says Beverage Digest) and Pepsi (18.8 percent). Diet Coke now holds about 11.5 percent of the total soft-drink market, up from 9.4 percent at the beginning of the year, according to Beverage Digest. Diet Pepsi has about 7.5 percent of the total market, up from 6.1 percent at the beginning of the year. **********Commercials for Diet Coke, which along with Diet Pepsi and most other diet soft drinks are now sweetened only with Nutrasweet, have always emphasized taste, but the new campaign adds a twist. Mr. Beindorff said the commercials single out Diet Coke from all other one-calorie soft drinks and describe it as the brand ''you can drink more of.'' **********The commercial that was broadcast during last night's game between the Giants and the Washington Redskins starred Charles Mann and Dave Butz, defensive linemen for the Redskins. During the 30-second spot, the teammates flip for the right to the last bottle of Diet Coke during a practice. Only they don't flip a coin - they flip a quarterback. **********The campaign, continuing throughout the season, will feature players from all 28 National Football League teams. The commercials were created by Lintas: New York, Diet Coke's agency. **********Going after more male drinkers is a strategy that carries the risk of drawing business away from the sugared Coke brands. But Mr. Beindorff said that since more men are choosing diet soft drinks anyway, Coke wants to be sure it holds its No. 1 position in that market. **********''That's certainly a consideration anytime you manage a portfolio of brands, as we do,'' Mr. Beindorff said. ''But if anybody is going to leave sugared colas for a diet drink, we want to make sure they come to Diet Coke.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/08/business/company-news-group-discloses-sun-electric-stake.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-06-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 180, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Group Discloses Sun Electric Stake", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Group Discloses Sun Electric Stake", "body_text": " **********S.O.Q.

The indictment said $500,000 was hidden in a suitcase in Chicago last August. That suitcase was secured with Yugoslav diplomatic seals and flown to Yugoslavia, where the money was deposited in a local bank, the charges said. The movement of more than $10,000 in cash out of the country must be reported to Federal officials, but no such report was made, the indictment said. $100 Billion a Year The amount of drug money laundered annually in the United States is estimated to exceed $100 billion, said Mr. Von Raab, who said today in Philadelphia that ''money laundering is not a local problem, it's an international problem.'' **********The Yugoslav official indicted is Bahrudin Bijedic, Consul General in Chicago. A Customs official said that Mr. Bijedic did not have diplomatic immunity and that the Justice Department had consulted with the State Department before charging him with conspiracy. Not all officials working at foreign embassies have immunity. **********Tomislav Cadikovski, an official at the consulate in Chicago, said he knew nothing of the charges. Mr. Bijedic had gone out, he said. **********Four other defendants were charged with conspiracy, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. They include Hubert Francis Cole, described as a money-laundering expert and former adviser to a nationwide tax protesters' group. Mr. Cole also faces a variety of charges involving various money-laundering and currency-reporting statutes, as well as the Arms Export Control Act. 'Must Be a Mistake' **********Another person charged with conspiracy was Vinko Mir, the chairman of LBS Bank of New York. LBS, a $100 million subsidiary of the large Yugoslav commercial bank Ljubljanska Banka, was also charged with helping launder the money and faces a $250,000 fine if convicted. **********Mr. Mir, reached by telephone at his office in New York, said he had ''no idea'' about the indictment. It ''must be a mistake,'' he said, because the bank does only ''normal banking business.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/10/world/state-dept-given-a-budget-reprieve.html": {"writer_name": "Elaine Sciolino", "pub_date": "1988-01-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 831, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "STATE DEPT. GIVEN A BUDGET REPRIEVE", "print_headline": "STATE DEPT. GIVEN A BUDGET REPRIEVE", "body_text": " **********Congress has forestalled the State Department budget crisis for at least a year by quietly appropriating additional funding in the final days of its last session. **********The little-noticed move gives $60 million more to the State Department for salaries and operational expenses for this year, just enough to prevent a package of what had been described as the most dramatic budget cuts in the department's history. **********The widely publicized budget-cutting plan has been shelved, at least temporarily. **********It would have eliminated 1,270 jobs, about 8 percent of the department's work force in Washington and around the world, and closed at least 13 embassies and consulates, among other cost-cutting measures. Other steps that are no longer under consideration are the elimination of 27 deputy assistant secretary jobs and of differential pay in hardship posts. **********Senior State Department officials emphasized that the crisis was not over, merely delayed for a year, and that the department would have to face the same hard decisions next fall. 'From Catastrophic to Difficult' **********''The situation has gone from the catastrophic to the difficult,'' Ronald I. Spiers, the Under Secretary for Management, said in an interview. ''We got a lot of relief this year, but next year still looks bad.'' Just three months ago, Mr. Spiers had described the budget situation as the worst personnel problem he had faced in his 32 years in Government. **********But the additional money has helped alleviate morale problems in the department and has staunched rumors of impending layoffs, unpaid furloughs and arbitrary transfers. **********The budget reprieve, contained in the State Department authorization bill signed into law by President Reagan on Dec. 22, was the result of fierce lobbying on Capitol Hill by Secretary of State George P. Shultz, the White House chief of staff, Howard H. Baker Jr., and ranking officials from the State Department and the Office for Management and Budget. **********During the four-week ''budget summit'' meeting, the tortuous talks between the White House and Congressional negotiators to reduce the Federal deficit, a consensus emerged in the budget committees that the State Department needed more money to operate efficiently. Department budget analysts axcknowledge that their cause was helped by the dramatic slide of the dollar that occurred just as the summiteers began their work. Relief on Internal Pressure **********Because the committees were slashing much larger amounts from the foreign aid budget against the State Department's wishes, they decided to relieve some of the internal pressure on the department. **********''They were cutting so much from foreign aid that an extra $60 million for State seemed like small potatoes,'' said one Congressional staff member familiar with the negotiations. **********In the end, the State Department was appropriated $1,694,000,000 for salaries and expenses, about $60 million more than the Department expected. **********Although there were dire predictions inside the State Department of drastic cuts during the crisis, including many complaints by Secretary of State George P. Shultz, there were no public expressions of relief when the extra money came through, in large part because the department does not want to give the impression that its problems are over. Greater Increase Urged **********The budget summit agreement restricts the increase for the State Department to 2 percent, which budget experts in the department say is severely inadequate. According to Mr. Spiers, the higher rate of inflation abroad and the dramatic decline of the dollar require that the State Department receive a budget increase of 10.5 percent next year just to maintain the current level of programs. **********''Unless someone bails us out, which we don't expect, we're still going to have problems,'' said Mr. Spiers. **********A task force under Deputy Secretary of State John C. Whitehead has not been disbanded, but will continue to analyze the long-term budget problems facing the department, including which posts abroad can easily be closed. **********The department will still seek Congressional approval for an early retirement plan for Foreign Service officers similar to one in effect in the civil service. **********The added revenue for this year still does not allow for any construction of new facilities, such as plans for a new Foreign Service school. And State Department officials predict that the current near-total hiring freeze will remain in place. **********Budget analysts in the department were delighted that the authorization bill in the end dropped House provisions to create an Under Secretary for Terrorism and ambassador-at-large for Afghanistan, and a Senate provision to create an ambassador-at-large for global climate issues. **********But because of the reprieve this year, it will be difficult to convince many lawmakers that the crisis is not over. ''Everyone thinks that the reform movement is dead,'' said one State Department official. q"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/07/world/sandinista-strategy-real-or-bogus.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Kinzer", "pub_date": "1988-04-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 740, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sandinista 'Strategy': Real or Bogus?", "print_headline": "Sandinista 'Strategy': Real or Bogus?", "body_text": " **********A document circulating in Managua that purports to be a list of the Sandinista Government's objectives for 1988 - including the use of ''revolutionary terror'' - was disavowed today by a Government spokeswoman. **********The document is presented as a report of a February meeting of the Sandinista National Directorate. It outlines a strategy under which the Government will take limited steps toward political liberalization, while intimidating the opposition through the use of ''revolutionary terror.'' **********''This is not a document of the National Directorate,'' said the Government spokeswoman, Eva Maria Teller. ''We think the Administration has circulated this document,'' she said, referring to Washington. ''The most sensible thing would be not to publish it.'' Warning on Concessions **********The document says the combination of freeing anti-Government prisoners and lifting restrictions on the press has created ''an explosive potential that is highly dangerous for revolutionary power.'' It recommends political concessions, but asserts that the army must remain under Sandinista control. **********''What we cannot permit is that the true structures of power pass into the hands of the bourgeoisie,'' it says. **********The 10-page document, which is on stationery of the National Directorate, was circulating in opposition circles today.

Mr. Ortega's name and what appeared to be his signature were on the document. The spokesman, Manuel Espinoza, said members of the National Directorate do not sign reports of their meetings. U.S. Embassy Denies Role **********''This is clearly an effort to undermine the peace process that is now under way,'' Mr. Espinoza said. Two weeks ago, the Government signed a cease-fire agreement with guerrilla leaders, and negotiations regarding aspects of the truce were continuing today in the southern village of Sapoa. **********The text of the document begins below headings that say, ''Secret. Draft. Protocol 1470. Extraordinary Session Number 47.

''We don't know anything about it and we have no comment,'' he said. **********Opposition leaders who have read the document said it showed the Sandinistas were determined to stay in power by any means necessary. 'A Bombshell' **********''This is a bombshell,'' said Mauricio Diaz Davila, who represents opposition parties on the National Reconciliation Commission established under provisions of a Central American peace accord signed last August in Guatemala City. ''It shows the Sandinistas without their costumes. It's sad, because this is going to do a lot of damage.'' **********The document is not dated, but it discusses the importance of removing Miguel Cardinal Obando y Bravo, the Roman Catholic Primate, from his position as mediator in cease-fire talks, a step the Government took on March 2. ''Obando will always be our enemy, and it is not convenient to maintain him in this position,'' the document says. **********Although the document says defeating the contras is the ''key task,'' it devotes considerable space to the internal opposition. ''We will take all available measures to divide and splinter'' the opposition, it says. ''At these moments, we cannot renounce the use of revolutionary terror.'' La Prensa Doesn't Publish **********The editors of the opposition newspaper La Prensa said they could not publish today because the Government, which controls the supply of newsprint, had refused to sell them enough. They said they were victims of ''clear discrimination'' that violated Sandinista pledges to respect freedom of expression. **********The Government has said it does not have enough paper to distribute, but both pro-Government newspapers appeared as usual today. **********In a statement, La Prensa's editors said the Government was violating its commitment under the cease-fire agreement. The editors called the Government's actions ''a deliberate blow against freedom of expression in Nicaragua.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/26/world/china-s-economy-takes-small-leap-backward.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Gargan", "pub_date": "1988-09-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1316, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "China's Economy Takes Small Leap Backward", "print_headline": "China's Economy Takes Small Leap Backward", "body_text": " **********China's Communist Party Central Committee meets Monday to deal with economic problems that have grown increasingly serious since the country embarked on an ambitious program of restructuring its economy nearly a decade ago. **********In the last year, as China has moved farther away from the Soviet model of socialism, the country has been racked by soaring inflation, bank runs by panicky depositors, corruption within the bureaucracy and a rising tide of worker unrest. **********China's financial system is in disarray with an uncontrolled growth of the money supply, its currency is sinking rapidly in value against the dollar and a patchwork of free and controlled prices has created gluts in some areas and shortages in others for everything from industrial raw materials to daily consumer goods. **********Salt, the most basic seasoning in Chinese food, is now being rationed in Beijing. Pork, sugar, eggs and cooking oil have been rationed for six months now and people in the capital are beginning to voice doubts about the benefits of the country's economic direction. 'There Are Problems' **********''Of course there are problems,'' a Chinese economist said recently. ''But to change from the old way to the new way has never been done. We are exploring a direction that nobody else has.'' **********These problems, however, have severely shaken China's leaders, according to Chinese academics who are familiar with policyy discussions, and the Communist Party chief, Zhao Ziyang, has lost some of his authority. Already, hints that the leadership will dramatically scale back various forms of economic experimentation and restructuring have appeared in China's press. The 175 members of the Central Committee who will meet Monday are to ratify this slowdown in reordering the country's economy. **********Deng Xiaoping, the country's senior leader, told a group of Japanese economists this weekend that China's policies would be modified to cope with these concerns. ''The difficulties we are facing now concern development and are different from those we had before,'' Mr. Deng was quoted by the official New China News Agency as saying. ''The readjustment we are going through now is not a change of policy. Neither is it a change of development strategy. We are working out methods and measures for future progress after summing up our experiences and we are capable of overcoming the present difficulties, including combating inflation. The rate of development is now too fast.'' 'The New Economic Order' **********''The transition from the old economic order to a new economic order is now generally blamed to be responsible for most of the irregularities of Chinese society,'' China Economic News, a weekly review of economic and financial issues, said recently. **********This new economic order, what China's newspapers are calling ''the new order of socialist commodity economy,'' has achieved much, particularly in recent years. The country's farmers, almost all of whom till their own land, are thriving. For the first time in Chinese history, farmers are benefiting from substantial economic growth. They are building new homes, buying consumer goods common in urban areas and are educating their children. **********In urban areas, department stores are jammed with consumer goods, from televisions to refrigerators to cosmetics. Vegetables are available in the winter in the north and fish are sold at many inland markets. **********What has invigorated agriculture is now being tried in other segments of the economy. But transforming the industrial, power, housing and service sectors of the economy into a system propelled not by planners but the efficiencies of the market has proved far more difficult than most Chinese economists had envisioned. **********For the first time since China began this process, the difficulties of erecting a new structure while slowly dismantling the old are becoming manifest. Industrial Growth Put at 17% **********Industrial growth is continuing to roar along, with the rate of increase for the first six months of this year at about 17 percent, according to the State Statistical Bureau. But this growth, a level many Chinese economists believe is excessive, has fueled inflation and unhinged efforts by the central bank, the People's Bank of China, to impose discipline on the financial system. **********Thirty-six percent more money was put in circulation in the first six months of this year than during the same period last year, a trend the bank hopes to end. **********''With more currency in circulation, bank loans increased rapidly,'' the press agency reported. And, as inflation picked up, it said, ''people panicked.'' **********Much of the panic stemmed from the widespread belief that prices would, and indeed did, begin a steep climb for most consumer goods. Accustomed to relatively stable prices, China's urban consumers for the first time faced official inflation rates of 24 percent and widely acknowledged, but unofficial, rates closer to 50 percent. **********Retail sales in many cities jumped 50 percent over those of a year ago. ''As a result, the supply chain of goods began to falter and the amount of goods in stock became 'weak,' according to the statistics bureau,'' China Daily reported over the weekend. **********Many economists, both Chinese and foreign, argue that a major element in any structural reform of the country's economy is the freeing of prices from centralized control so that goods and services are distributed by market forces. Mr. Zhao, the party leader, has pushed aggressively for what he calls ''price reform,'' regardless of the short-term pain it would bring. **********But other members of the leadership have decided that uncontrolled inflation and the potential for urban discontent are problems too severe to continue with price reform at the moment. Putting Off Price Reform **********In a meeting this weekend with Valentin L. Pavlov, the chairman of the Soviet Union's State Committee for Prices, Yao Yilin, one of the five members of the Standing Committee of the Politburo said that any further freeing of prices would be put off for two years. **********The prices of half of the raw materials, industrial and consumer goods and food - including grains, cotton and edible oils - are still subject to control, Mr. Yao said, according to the New China News Agency. **********''China is not prepared to free the prices of these commodities, nor is it ready to restore the prices of those commodities that have already been freed from Government controls, because this is conducive to production and consumption,'' the agency quoted Mr. Yao as saying. **********At the same time, China's currency, the yuan, has begun sinking in value on the black market. Last year, one dollar fetched about five yuan. Today, the same dollar is worth between eight and nine yuan. **********Although the official rate of exchange, 3.7 yuan to the dollar, is fixed, the growing disparity between the official and black market rates has raised the concern of foreign investors, who are burdened with the artifical rate in computing their transactions with the Government. Effectively, foreign investors and traders who are bound to the official rates are paying double for Chinese goods. **********Of growing concern to China's leaders as well is the mounting level of industrial unrest. Chen Ji, a senior official of the All China Federation of Trade Unions, said that there have been 49 strikes reported throughout the country in the first six months of this year with many more strikes probably going unreported. **********''Since we have begun reforms,'' he said in an interview, ''we have new contradictions between prices and wages. Now factory directors earn more than workers, and some workers earn more than other workers. There are new problems we never met in the past.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/13/world/africans-at-the-un-express-skepticism-on-pretoria-moves.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-10-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 380, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Africans at the U.N.

The abundant supplies and low commodity prices have caused candy makers to increase the size of their bars in the last two years. And while retail prices so far have not dropped, analysts predict that candy makers may soon take some action on that front. **********The surpluses are the result of improvements in technology and nearly perfect growing weather, which has increased production, particularly in countries new to the market. A Shortage in 70's **********Growing conditions were not so ideal in the mid-1970's, when cocoa reached an all-time high of $5,379 a metric ton as bad weather and unstable political conditions led to shortages. The high prices encouraged several countries, including Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil and the Ivory Coast, to plant more cocoa trees, which take seven to nine years to mature. The harvest from those trees is a major reason for the current surplus and low prices. The cocoa contract for May delivery rose yesterday by $16, to $1,562 a metric ton (2,204.6 pounds), on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York. **********Last season nearly two million tons of cocoa were produced worldwide. The International Cocoa Organization, a group of producing and consuming nations, had projected last year that the crop this season would be about 30,000 tons higher, but it is now revising that upward. **********The Gill & Duffus Group P.L.C., a London-based commodities firm, predicts that world output this season, which ends in September, will be a record of more than 2.1 million tons, up 6 percent from last season. **********Production will exceed consumption by about 122,000 tons, according to the firm, which expects worldwide consumption to grow 3.6 percent this year. The International Cocoa Organization anticipates a surplus of 150,000 metric tons. **********In the United States, people consume an average of 10 pounds of chocolate a year, a figure that has held steady for the last five years, according to the Chocolate Manufacturers Association. #20% of a Candy Bar Some candy makers said the cheaper cocoa had kept candy prices from going up. About 20 percent of a typical milk chocolate bar is made up of cocoa. The other 80 percent is largely sugar and milk. **********While sugar and milk prices have been stable in recent years, such other costs as production, transportation and labor have been rising, said Tom Morris, executive vice president of World's Finest Chocolate, a Chicago company that makes candy bars and supplies cocoa for bakers. **********Lower production costs and stiff competition have caused World's Finest to reduce its price on bulk cocoa sold to bakers by about 12 percent since July, Mr. Morris said. **********Retail prices for individual bars may not fall soon, but consumers may see still bigger bars, slightly lower prices on bagged and boxed chocolates, coupon programs and other promotional efforts, according to analysts and Richard T. O'Connell, president of the Chocolate Manufacturers Association. **********The strategy of offering consumers a bigger bar for the same price is nothing new. **********Two years ago, the Hershey Foods Corporation, based in Hershey, Pa., was the first to increase the size of its candy bars, making them 10 to 15 percent larger. Hershey's Costs Down **********Even with the bigger bars, Hershey's costs - because of reduced cocoa prices - were nearly $25 million lower last year, which enabled the company to spend more on marketing, said John M. McMillin, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities. **********M&M/Mars, a subsidiary of Mars Inc., increased the size of Snickers, its biggest seller, about 8 percent in 1986 and made its Milky Way bar bigger by about the same amount last fall. **********Hershey and M&M/Mars together hold about 70 percent of the candy market in the United States. **********Lower prices for a commodity are not good news for everyone. The International Cocoa Organization has been trying, with little success, to support prices. The group has tried to control the market by buying beans for a buffer stock. But the absence of several leading nations in the organization, including the United States, the largest consumer, and Malaysia, the fourth-largest producer, has made the effort largely futile. 'Relatively Powerless' **********''As it stands now, the cocoa organization is relatively powerless to boost prices,'' said Kim Badenhop, an analyst at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. **********The organization, which is based in London, was in a deadlock last June, when members could not agree on prices. The Ivory Coast and Ghana withheld beans to try to prop up prices. But both nations, faced with mounting stocks and the need for foreign exchange, have increased their sales this year. The sales helped bring about the slide in commodity prices during the last three months, analysts said. **********In January, the organization reached an agreement and purchased 75,000 tons in six weeks. That brought the stockpile to 250,000 tons, the maximum set by the group. **********The group held an emergency meeting in mid-March to consider a supplemental measure for withholding up to 125,000 tons, but the talks ended in a stalemate. **********Mr. Badenhop said the next full meeting of the organization, scheduled for mid-September, was the soonest that an official withholding program could be put into effect. **********Analysts said such a program would cost $35 million to $40 million. The organization, however, is short of funds since several countries, including Brazil and the Ivory Coast, owe substantial amounts for their share of the buffer stock purchases. 'A Catch-22' **********''These countries say they will pay when cocoa prices recover, but it's a Catch-22,'' Mr. Badenhop said. ''Prices aren't going to recover unless the supply declines, and without withholding cocoa from the market, that won't happen.'' **********Arthur Stevenson, an analyst at Prudential-Bache, believes that if prices do rise during the next few months, the increase will be small. However, a trader at Gill & Duffus said that many traders believe there will be continued selling pressure in the commodities markets, which could drive prices down further. **********''There is very little incentive for producing countries to cut back while it is still profitable,'' Mr. Badenhop said. ''These third world nations are in dire need of foreign exchange and they have to keep their work forces employed.'' **********However, such countries as the Ivory Coast and Brazil are beginning to lose money on exports. If prices fall much lower, cocoa-producing nations might be forced to cut the price supports they pay to farmers, which would lower production. **********Nor is there much hope that consumption will soon rise significantly. Half of the world's population does not eat chocolate - people in China and Southeast Asia have never developed a taste for it and many others are too poor to afford it."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/09/business/another-loss-at-maxicare.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-12-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 168, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Another Loss at Maxicare", "print_headline": "Another Loss at Maxicare", "body_text": " **********Maxicare Health Plans Inc., which has been disposing of assets that it acquired earlier in the decade, said this week that it had lost $169.7 million in the third quarter. **********Maxicare, the nation's biggest health maintenance organization, said most of the loss - $113 million -was caused by a special provision for losses on health plans the company has sold or is planning to sell to pare itself back to a profitable core. **********Maxicare, struggling with rising costs and $460 million in debt, has sold health plans this year in 13 of the 26 states in which it did business, cutting membership to 1.4 million from 2.3 million. **********The third-quarter loss of $169.7 million compares with a loss of $6.4 million in the third quarter of 1987."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/22/world/1800-s-turkish-treasure-ship-found-by-greeks-in-aegean.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-05-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 559, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "1800's Turkish Treasure Ship Found by Greeks in Aegean", "print_headline": "1800's Turkish Treasure Ship Found by Greeks in Aegean", "body_text": " **********Greek divers have found a treasure-laden Turkish warship sunk by Greek revolutionaries in the Aegean Sea in 1822. **********The remains of the wood sailing ship were found in 162 feet of water near the island of Chios in the eastern Aegean near where historical accounts place the sinking of the Ottoman ship, according to Peter Nicolaides, a salvage expert. **********The Bourloti Seimaz - or Explosives Invincible - was set afire and sunk by a Greek admiral, Constantine Kanaris, in revenge for Turkish killing and looting on Chios. **********Thousands of islanders died in the Turkish raids, which shocked other nations and swung other European countries behind the Greek struggle for independence from the Ottoman Empire.

Watched by clumps of muttering uniformed and plainsclothes police but ignored by droves of Chinese tourists wandering the expanse of concrete that stretches out from the Gates of Heavenly Peace, the protesters stood up and wandered off after a short while. **********Ding Shisun, the president of the university, issued a stinging defense of his teachers and students today and indirectly criticized China's leadership for ignoring the problems of higher education. A Big Issue at Current Congress **********''We shouldn't be afraid of trouble caused by the students,'' he said in an article in the China Youth News. ''We shouldn't overcriticize young people. When they say that young people are bent solely on profit and fame, can't the leaders examine their own conscience?'' **********The issue of China's treatment of its intellectuals, the country's students, faculty and researchers, has emerged as a central and troubling issue during the current session of parliament, the National People's Congress. Day after day, newspapers are filled with comments by delegates to the congress describing the rudimentary living and working conditions in universities and calling for a dramatic increase in Government support for schools and universities. **********At Beijing University, Xu Xi, a thin, intense 25-year-old lecturer in the international politics department, said the issue was simple. ''Education in China is in crisis,'' he said. **********Sitting hunched on a low stool in his room, a 15-by-9 foot cement box he shares with two other men, both of whom are married, Mr. Xu talked about why he had covered five poster-sized sheets of paper with grievances, persuaded 29 of his colleagues to sign the protest and hung the posters in the middle of campus. Although putting up such posters is illegal, Mr. Xu said it had to be done. 'Shocking Proportions' **********''The crisis in education has reached shocking proportions,'' his poster read. ''We feel that the crisis in education and nationhood has as its key the treatment of intellectuals.'' **********''There are two major points,'' he said, fingering the sleeve of his worn, olive-green jacket. ''One is the material condition of teachers, the problems of housing and salaries. The second is now many people don't care to become teachers. Many students are coming to me and saying they have no interest in becoming teachers.'' **********Mr. Xu looked about his spartan quarters. Two bunkbeds piled with clothes hugged the raw cement walls, making room for two small desks and two metal-legged stools. Narrow bookshelves, each partially filled with thin, paper-backed volumes, hung over each mattress. Clothing dangled from hooks and lines of twine in a corner. **********Down the dim hall, there is one communal toilet for the 14 rooms. There are no washing facilities in the four-story building. The teachers must use a central bathhouse in the center of campus. 'Enough to Live, Nothing Fancy' **********He talked quietly about the life of a young teacher at Beijing University. **********''My salary is 82 yuan a month, with bonuses, maybe 100 yuan,'' said Mr. Xu, referring to the larger sum of about $27. Of this, he said, he spends 50 yuan on food each month. ''Fifty yuan will give you enough to live, nothing fancy, very simple,'' he said. ''But if you want other things like fruit, it will cost more.'' **********Mr. Xu said that it was a mistake however to focus exclusively on living conditions as a grievance, that the larger issue of the country's educational policy needed to be examined. **********''Material conditions can be tolerated but morale is bad,'' he said. He ticked off a list of problems, including a cutback in the number of students who will be permitted to study abroad, the system of sending young lecturers to remote regions for a year, the abolition of job assignments and the need for academics to play a greater role in the formulation of educational policy. **********''For example,'' he said, ''it would really be better if they sent teachers from the countryside here, to learn for a year, and then have them go back. Now they send people from the university, most people who have just graduated to the countryside to teach. They know very little about education and return after a year. In actual fact this is a waste of time for them.'' 'More Democratic Atmosphere' **********Much of the debate over educational policy and the appearance of wall posters has been encouraged, teachers and students said, by the extent of free discussion at the current National People's Congress session. **********''Putting up that poster is directly related to the more democractic atmosphere of the National People's Congress,'' said Mr. Xu. ''There's been progress made in democracy so the problems of intellectuals have resurfaced. Delegates at the congress from the academic world should have a basic say in educational policy. This is a very simple principle.'' **********Hanging wall posters, once a constitutionally protected right, is now illegal, a fact Mr. Xu said he was aware of. It was a flurry of wall posters in November and December 1986 calling for greater democracy in China that prompted a nationwide wave of student demonstrations, which in turn provoked a fierce crackdown by the authorities in a campaign against ''bourgeois liberalization.'' **********During the campaign, several distinguished intellectuals were expelled from the Communist Party and many writers, playwrights and artists ceased working for more than six months out of fear of political retribution. **********''I was a little bit nervous about signing the poster,'' Mr. Xu acknowledged. ''I don't think last year's anti-bourgeois liberalization drive will be repeated. But you never know how this will affect your future.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/11/business/company-news-maxxam-opposes-kaisertech-pact.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-03-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 152, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Maxxam Opposes Kaisertech Pact", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Maxxam Opposes Kaisertech Pact", "body_text": " **********Maxxam Group Inc., which controls the equivalent of 32 percent of Kaisertech Ltd., has filed a suit in state court in Delaware seeking to end a standstill agreement between the two companies.

''We have people calling up, saying, 'You've got to buy, you've got to buy,' '' he said. ''We ask, 'Why?' ''Crosscurrents Cited **********Another trader, who asked not to be named, said, ''There are a lot of crosscurrents on the Street now. While some analysts expect pretty good fourth-quarter earnings, other people are afraid the market is being set up for a fall. I mean, some guys are predicting 3,500 on the Dow again.

A weaker dollar makes American exports more competitive abroad, and theoretically should help ease the nation's trade deficit. **********But analysts note that there is an inflationary danger in a plunging dollar because foreign producers may drive up their prices, thus giving American manufacturers more leeway to raise their own prices.

Biotechnology companies complain that the delays, which affect the rights to thousands of developments in genetic engineering, are a significant barrier to commercial progress. Concern About 'The Fox' **********But critics say the plan is unlikely to solve the problem, and some are concerned that it might give private companies undue influence over the agency. **********''It's a needed Band-Aid, but we have to be careful not to let the fox into the chicken coop,'' said Robert Merges, an associate professor at the Boston University School of Law, who follows biotechnology patents. **********The Government plan, disclosed last week, calls for creating a Biotechnology Institute in league with the Industrial Biotechnology Association, the principal lobbying group for biotechnology companies. In a letter to the group, Donald J. Quigg, the Patent and Trademark Commissioner, proposed that the association offer a weeklong training program for examiners entering the field, organize seminars on new research and help plan visits by examiners to laboratories around the country. The idea for helping to train the examiners was raised by the biotechnology association in the spring. **********The examiners ''will be exposed to people and facilities on the leading edge of biotechnology, and sometimes there is no other way to get that than from the companies,'' said Richard D. Godown, the president of the association. The group said it planned to provide its help without charging the Government. **********''I think this is a sign of how desperate the industry is to do something about this situation,'' said Representative Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, who held hearings on the biotechnology backlog last spring. The subcommittee said it had found that it took the Patent Office more than four years to process the average biotechnology patent, although the agency says the wait is slightly more than two years. 6,500 Applications The agency said that 6,500 biotechnology patent applications await a decision - about 70 applications for each Government examiner. The Government predicts that the number of applications will grow by 12 percent a year through the early 1990's. **********But among those expressing reservations about the plan for additional examiners are lawyers who say that prominent biotechnology companies could shape examiners' thinking on arcane but commercially important issues. **********This is one example cited: Several biotechnology companies are battling in court over the rights inherent in being the first to identify therapeutic uses for a human protein versus the rights inherent in being the first to reproduce that protein in large quantities through genetic engineering. Both steps are crucial, but are often performed by different companies. The resolution of such disputes frequently turns on the language used in patent claims, which are approved by the examiners. **********''This amounts to an industry examining its own cases,'' said Harold Wegner, a Washington lawyer who has previously criticized the pace of biotechnology patents. **********Mr. Godown emphasized that industry representatives would not offer advice on particular cases.

Gorbachev, has urged more open study of Communist history, there is little evidence that the commemorations here will contribute to an official re-examination of the period's history. **********This is striking, since those who experienced the programs of 1968, to mark the 20th anniversary of the same events, like to recall that it prompted deep reflection on the past. That was the moment that became known as the Prague spring, a period of cultural and intellectual flowering under Alexander Dubcek. A Mysterious Death **********In those months, experts reopened a study of the more troubling aspects of Communist history. A public prosecutor re-examined the investigation into the mysterious death of Jan Masaryk, Mr. Gottwald's Foreign Minister and son of Thomas Masaryk, the founder of modern Czechoslovakia. The younger Mr. Masaryk threw himself to his death from a Foreign Ministry window 14 days after the 1948 Communist takeover under circumstances that have never been thoroughly clarified. **********Also in 1968, a party-appointed commission explored the history of the show trials of senior Communist leaders in the early 1950's. Several leaders who had been tried and executed on trumped-up charges were then rehabilitated, including Vladimir Clementis, who accompanied Mr. Gottwald when he proclaimed the Communist takeover and who later became Foreign Minister. **********Now the historic photographs of Mr. Gottwald in store windows throughout the capital are neatly cropped, eliminating the visage of Mr. Clementis. **********The state-controlled television is broadcasting a special 22-part serialized version of the novel ''Natives,'' by Jaroslav Matejka, which follows the members of a rural Moravian family through the sufferings of World War II to the Communist takeover. With soap opera intensity, heroic young people engage in valiant struggle, sweetened by romance, to wrest Czechoslovakia from the clutches of Nazism and then capitalism. Other Events Celebrated **********This is significant, because Czechoslovakia marks a series of important national events this year, including the 20th anniversary of the Prague spring and the Soviet-led invasion of 1968; the 50th anniversary of the 1938 Munich agreement that surrendered Czechoslovakia to Hitler, and the 70th anniversary of the founding in 1918 of the independent Czechoslovak republic. **********Czechoslovak officials seemed at pains to stress that critical historical study was necessary, though not within the context of a triumphant celebration. **********Milan Matous, a principal ideologist who is the deputy director of the party's Marxism-Leninism Institute, said: ''This does not mean we will not address the negative side, but of course not at the same time, but in the historical literature, in political documents. The first thing is to see our history truthfully, not only the positive and the triumphs, but the faults and the mistakes.'' **********Asked to cite specific projects, Mr. Matous said that historians of the Marxism-Leninism Institute were producing a major study of the party's role in wartime resistance to the Nazis. Asked whether that would include treatment of the 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, when Stalin made a short-lived peace with Hitler, just as Germany was swallowing Czechoslovakia, he replied, ''The thing is to appreciate the resistance as a whole, and the persons who died in it.'' Nazi Terror Is Cited **********Gesturing toward a window, he said: ''People here were experiencing the terror of the Nazis in the streets. This was the reality, and not the more abstract question of whether Molotov should have signed or not.'' **********''I was only 10 or 11, but I recall a movie newsreel where Molotov was smiling, and maybe desire was father of the idea, but people did not believe this was a friendship pact, and it wasn't difficult to understand that for a time you had to accept certain conditions.'' **********The unofficial opposition in Czechoslovakia is not unified in judging 1948. Members of the Charter 77 human rights organization produced a document on the events, then rejected it because of differing evaluations. **********For older opposition leaders, many of whom were loyal Communists until they were toppled with Mr. Dubcek, the events of 1948 were the beginning of a noble experiment that failed. But for a younger generation, whose first experience of politics was the anti-Stalinist cause of Mr. Dubcek, and its bitter and sudden end, 1948 presents a kind of original sin. **********''You need archives, facts,'' said a young woman of the movement who spent time in prison in 1970 for her anti-Government activities. ''We must study the events of 1948 as the root of our present problems.'' Munich Pact a Factor **********Jiri Hajak, a diplomat and Mr. Dubcek's Foreign Minister, who was a young Social Democrat in 1948, said Czechoslovak enthusiasm for the Communist takeover led by Mr. Gottwald could be attributed to the Soviet liberation of Czechoslovakia from Nazi Germany. He contrasted that enthusiasm with Czechoslovakia's perception that it had been deserted by Britain and France in 1938. **********Like many contributors to the Prague spring, Mr. Hajak says he believes answers to the open questions of the innovations and invasion of 1968 are more pressing than the issues of 1948. **********''As long as there remain blank spots, and no full colors, great obstacles will remain to general economic and political reform,'' he said. ''The present leadership may think about it, but in attempting it they will be haunted by the specter of the Prague spring, and of their own attitudes.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/02/business/marketing-gives-corning-a-boost.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-04-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1402, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Marketing Gives Corning a Boost", "print_headline": "Marketing Gives Corning a Boost", "body_text": " **********A catchy television commercial showing a transparent cooking pot being used to melt an aluminum saucepan has helped spawn a resurgence of cookware at the Corning Glass Works, which had been in decline because of strong foreign competition. **********Such familiar kitchen items as Pyrex and Corning Ware had been eclipsed, and the company's $26 million cookware loss in 1985 was symbolic of a decade-long downward trend. **********The striking TV commercial has become a symbol of an old-line American manufacturing company bouncing back and meeting foreign competition head-on to regain profitability. The commercial shows an aluminum saucepan melting inside one of Corning's new Visions dishes on top of a kitchen range. A voice gives the advertising slogan: ''Turning ordinary saucepans into sauce.'' **********The commercial drove home the idea that a ceramic dish can be used in place of a metal saucepan on the stove and thereby expanded the market for Corning's products. **********''Corning finally realized the need to market its products,'' said Ed Schollmeyer, an analyst at Paine Webber. ''There's been a great transformation at the company over the past few years, largely due to the introduction of products like Visions and the revitalization of the entire line of dinnerware and cookware.'' **********Now, after spending more than $40 million on a restructuring, Corning's efforts to return cookware and dinnerware products to profitability are paying off. **********After deficits in the consumer products division in 1984 and 1985, that segment of the company returned to profitability in 1986, when it earned $25.9 million.

Restructuring in '85 **********Signs of trouble for Corning's consumer products began to appear early in this decade. The division made a slight profit in 1983 but lost about $1 million the following year. It allocated $30.6 million for a restructuring in 1985, when the consumer products division earned $4.6 million. The restructuring costs, however, pushed it deeply into the red. **********''For the first time in the company's history, we were showing a loss,'' said Stephen Albertalli, Corning's director of investor relations.

''He has aggressively and attractively promoted Corning.'' **********Analysts said that many of Corning's problems stemmed from a stodgy and complacent atmosphere. **********Since the introduction of Pyrex, the first glass bakeware, in 1915, Corning had concentrated on producing basic, quality items and had little interest in updating them. Corning Ware, the traditional white cookware with the little blue flowers, has been around since 1958. Corelle Living Ware, a rugged dinnerware brought out in 1970, was the last product Corning introduced in the dinnerware and cookware market until 1984, when Mr. Fogarty began his turnaround.  A Changing Market **********Although Corning's products had been considered to be basics in American kitchens for decades, the company failed to pay attention to the demands of a changing market, a mistake, industry analysts said, that also hurt many of Corning's domestic competitors. In addition, the strong dollar of the late 70's and early 80's made imported products cheaper for Americans. The foreign companies were quick to produce merchandise that was not only more stylish but also less expensive than Corning's. **********Moreover, throughout its history, Corning had tried to sell its products on the merits of durability, offering a two-year warranty against chipping and breaking on Corelle dinnerware. The warranty, however, proved costly because large stocks had to be maintained. In addition, the company appeared to miss a consumer signal. **********''The dinnerware and cookware market changed,'' said Alan Donnelly, a Corning spokesman. ''Durability was no longer enough of a factor in the purchasing decision.'' **********The lower prices and greater styles of the foreign competition further complicated the company's marketing plans by forcing Corning out of many of the specialty and department stores, such as Bloomingdale's, during the early 80's. Today, the company does most of its business through discount stores such as K Mart, Bradlees and Wal-Mart.  A Striking New Product Perhaps the most striking - and symbolic - change for Corning since Mr. Fogarty began the turnaround has been the introduction of Visions. It was developed by a Corning laboratory in France and sold in that country beginning in 1983. It was introduced in the United States two years later. **********According to Chuck Ryan, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, Visions has become the best-selling top-of-the-range cookware in this country. Made of a tinted glass-ceramic material, Visions is the first transparent cookware available for the microwave as well as for the top of the stove. **********Corning officials estimate that Visions now holds 34 percent of the top-of-the-range cookware market, far more than that of competitors such as Revere Ware, Westbend and Farberware with their metal or ceramic-covered metal top-of-the-range products. **********Looking back on its success, Corning, as well as industry analysts, gives much of the credit to the television commercial, which was developed by an Australian subsidiary when the product was marketed there.  The Driving Force **********''The Visions television commercial, for example - the melting pot ad - has been remarkably effective,'' Mr. Fogarty said, calling it the ''driving force behind the growth of this major new brand.'' **********Corning also gave its Corelle Living Ware a face lift, with decorations that were changed frequently. The product was streamlined, and offered with only a few variations in price. All of the Corelle products are manufactured in the United States, but Corning's overseas subsidiaries use their own decorations to suit their markets. **********Pyrex Bakeware and Corning Ware were also overhauled. While Corning still sells Pyrex Original, it has added Pyrex Clear Advantage, with a twist. Introduced in 1986, the new Pyrex is coated with silicon, making it non-stick. **********Corning Ware was updated with new decorations and styles. Microwave Plus, another line, consists of Corning Ware and Pyrex products specifically designed for use in microwave ovens. **********With the establishment of a separate unit called Crown Corning, the company has sought to regain some of its sales in the upscale market. Crown Corning sells products with special decorations, and also imports glasses, vases and other items not manufactured by Corning for sale in the department and specialty stores. Crown Corning generates only 10 percent of the division's total sales, but company officials believe that its presence in more fashionable stores is important to the company's image. **********Just as the earlier strength of the dollar hurt Corning, the weakened dollar is now viewed as helping it as foreign competitors find their products at a price disadvantage in American stores. **********Analysts are pleased with the company's performance. ''Corning is very well established, and despite a probable slowdown in the consumer durable market, Corning has positioned itself well,'' said Mr. Ryan of Merrill Lynch. ''Profits will grow despite the sluggish economy.'' **********At its peak during the early 70's, the consumer products division's profit margin was between 18 and 20 percent. It is now running at just over 10 percent. Mr. Albertalli said efforts were being made to regain the earlier profit margin. **********''But over the next five years, reaching 15 percent would be quite an achievement,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/25/world/voznesensky-denies-signing-pravda-letter.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-04-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 235, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Voznesensky Denies Signing Pravda Letter", "print_headline": "Voznesensky Denies Signing Pravda Letter", "body_text": " **********Andrei Voznesensky, the Russian poet, has denied that he was among 38 prominent Soviet writers and editors who signed a letter to the Communist Party newspaper Pravda.

Hueltje sat at a small truck stop here just after 6 A.M., dividing his attention between his hearty breakfast of toast, eggs and home fries and the log book that he is required to keep by the United States Department of Transportation. **********A solidly built man with blond hair and a no-nonsense manner, Mr. Hueltje had good reasons for starting his day doing two things at once. His schedule called for deliveries in Portland, Me., Manchester, N.H., and Boston. That included not only 250 miles or so of driving, but also loading and unloading operations that would be time-consuming because, as usual, he was carrying computer equipment that must be handled delicately. **********''You have trade-show people who are waiting for their machines,'' he said. ''You have to get it there.'' A Husband-and-Wife Team **********Mr. Hueltje was soon joined by his wife and fellow driver, Rozanne, who arrived dressed in running shoes, slacks and a blazer. For a change, she had managed to get a good night's sleep - about six hours - in the bunk bed at the back of their truck's cab. **********She decided to work with her husband, who owns his truck and leases his services to Atlas Van Lines Inc., after he made several trips during which she did not see him for months at a time. ''He would be gone three months and I would see him for five days,'' she recalled. **********Husband-and-wife teams like the Hueltjes, who are in their 30's, are becoming more common as drivers and their wives seek ways to cope with the loneliness and isolation. The Hueltjes had been away from their ranch-style home in Phoenix for more than a week and planned to be on the road for two more weeks. **********The cross-country run from California, Mr. Hueltje said, took three days. One driver slept while the other drove and they made no stops except for refueling. ''The truck was just rolling,'' he said. ''You live in the truck.'' **********They have a small refrigerator in the truck, allowing them to make sandwiches and snacks as they drive. They also carry a motorcycle and some snorkeling equipment, which they use for occasional moments of recreation between jobs. **********Comprising the rest of the essentials are a color television and a stereo for entertianment and a citizen band radio that the Hueltjes now only use for directions. Much of the chit-chat on C.B. radios in the late 1970's has now been replaced by more matter-of-fact, practical conversations, Mr. Hueltje said. Fuel Thefts and Heavy Expenses **********Their good spirits did not last long on this morning. On the drive up to Portland, Mr. Hueltje discovered that he had much less fuel than he thought in his Kenworth tractor, which can hold 240 gallons in its tank. After measuring the fuel level at a rest stop, he said that about 150 gallons had apparently been siphoned off, probably by a driver that parked near his truck the night before. **********While such incidents are common, he said, this was the first time it had happened to him since he began driving six years ago. **********Mr. Hueltje is better paid than most drivers. He earns $1.17 a mile because he handles valuable cargo like computers and keeps to the tight schedule necessary to serve events like trade shows. Many drivers squeeze out their livelihood from rates as low as 70 cents a mile, he said. **********Nevertheless, even Mr. Hueltje feels intense pressure to keep moving. Having invested $53,000 in buying and renovating his used truck -about half what a new rig would have cost - he now has monthly payments of $1,380 and running expenses of about 50 cents a mile to meet. **********Last year, the Hueltjes worked about nine months, grossed $90,000, and netted about $45,000. Difficult Maneuvers **********Nothing is simple driving a 66-foot-long tractor-trailer that weighs about 60,000 pounds. Mr. Hueltje's attempt to turn the rig around in a parking lot became back-and-forth maneuvers that required five attempts while Mrs. Hueltje watched the back of the truck. **********Later, as the Hueltjes prepared to deliver a load of facsimile machines in Manchester, they found that the machines were destined for a warehouse near the center of the city and not at the address on the outskirts that they had been given. The best route to the new location included passing under an overpass that has a sign warning of a 13.2-foot clearance. Eager to avoid wandering around a city he did not know, Mr. Hueltje successfully gambled that, with his wife guiding him, there would actually be enough room for him to get his 13.6-foot truck under the overpass. **********Minutes later, calling on reserves of skill and patience, he brought the hulking trailer to a stop on a sidestreet by the warehouse with inches to spare between parked cars. 'We Didn't Make a Dime' **********By about 2 P.M. the machines were unloaded, five hours after they had left Portland. That was two hours more than had been budgeted so the couple had just enough time to gulp down hamburgers and soda before heading to Boston. **********''All that runnning around,'' said Mr. Hueltje with a groan as they ate. ''We didn't make a dime on that.'' Stretching before them was the prospect of a rushed delivery in Boston and a quick trip to a truck stop outside the city for about four hours sleep. They had to be in New York by the next morning to deliver equipment at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. **********''You just can't say, 'I think I'll take a couple of days off,' '' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/06/business/the-media-business-advertising-an-audit-to-determine-location-of-magazines.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1988-05-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 186, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; An Audit to Determine Location of Magazines", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; An Audit to Determine Location of Magazines", "body_text": " **********The new interest in Whittle Communications' plans for publishing magazines specifically for doctors' offices makes it timely for someone to introduce syndicated research on which magazines can be found where. **********That is exactly what the Public Place Magazine Audit will try to do.

Now his father, a revered former President, and a founder of that same party, appears to be getting the same treatment. **********Gen. Lazaro Cardenas, who was President of Mexico from 1934 to 1940, was to have been one of the key figures in the rebroadcast of an acclaimed historical drama on the country's main television network this month. But the last 30 of the 170 episodes originally filmed were suddenly dropped from the series, in what political and media experts here believe is an effort to dampen the growing political strength of the younger Mr. Cardenas. **********Running as the candidate of the left-populist National Democratic Front, Mr. Cardenas was officially credited with 31.1 percent of the vote in the election July 6. But he maintains that widespread vote fraud deprived him of millions of votes and has been urging Mexicans not to recognize the victory of the official winner, Carlos Salinas de Gortari. **********All 30 of the affected episodes from ''Path of Glory,'' a dramatized version of the Mexican Revolution and its immediate aftermath, deal with the period in which General Cardenas was in power. They show General Cardenas taking steps to improve the lot of workers and peasants and to limit the influence of foreign economic interests, positions that his son advocates today and that he argues the ruling party has abandoned. 'Yet to Receive Explanation' **********''I have yet to receive any explanation of why or how this trampling and truncation of my work came about,'' said Fausto Zeron-Medina, a respected Mexican historian who served as historical adviser to the series. ''But whoever did this clearly recognized and understood the relevance of history to current events.'' **********Mr. Zeron-Medina said ''an obvious but not complete explanation'' for the sudden censorship of ''Path of Glory'' is ''the weight which Cardenismo has in the present political contest.'' Because the younger Mr. Cardenas, with his impeccable revolutionary credentials, has emerged as leader of the political opposition, ''Cardenas the hero has become an inconvenience, and the system which contributed to the sculpting of his monument must now hide him.'' **********The unexpected termination of the series, whose filming was partly financed by the Mexican Government, has made both the Government and the Televisa network objects of ridicule. In a satirical article entitled ''Chronicle of a Desaparecido,'' a columnist for the newspaper Uno Mas Uno this week imagined a future in which General Cardenas's image has been taken off Mexican currency, his name removed from one of the main thoroughfares in downtown Mexico City, and any mention of his presidency stricken from textbooks. **********But to Mr. Zeron-Medina and many others here, the controversy also indicates the extraordinary delicacy and seriousness with which Mexicans approach all aspects of their history, a sensitivity probably unsurpassed anywhere in Latin America. The Argentine novelist Jorge Luis Borges once remarked after a visit here that ''I came to Mexico and found the Mexicans contemplating the refuse of their past.'' Revolution Began in 1910 **********Though the Mexican Revolution began in 1910, its key battles, leaders and ideological arguments are constantly invoked to justify positions taken in current political disputes. The Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which has ruled uninterruptedly here since first coming to power in 1929, regards itself as the embodiment of the revolutionary tradition and as the final arbiter of how the revolution should be interpreted. **********''When I circulated the first draft of the script, I received lots of comments from people asking me if they were reading about history or the present,'' Mr. Zeron-Medina said. ''The issues of presidential succession, democratization and the foreign debt, just to name a few, were in the forefront of a national debate then, as now.'' **********''Path of Glory'' was first shown, uncensored, on Mexican television last year, while Mr. Cardenas was still a member of the PRI. But when a rebroadcast began earlier this year, according to members of the program's production staff, leading members of ''the revolutionary family,'' as the PRI elite is commonly called here, made known their complaints about various aspects of the drama. **********Mr. Zeron-Medina, who studied Mexican and Latin-American history here and at Cambridge University, said that earlier this year he met with a Televisa official who told him that President Miguel de la Madrid had personally requested that the network exercise care in the way the drama presented its subject matter. Among the topics mentioned, Mr. Zeron-Medina said, were the role of the military, tense relations between the Roman Catholic Church and the state, and the portrayal of former Mexican presidents. Former Presidents Complained **********People involved in the production, who asked not to be identified, said relatives of former Presidents Plutarco Elias Calles and Alvaro Obregon who are themselves prominent political figures were among those who complained about specific episodes. Miguel Aleman Velasco, the head of the network that broadcast ''Path of Glory,'' is also the son of a former Mexican president and a leading supporter of the PRI. **********The Televisa network did not respond to telephone calls asking for comment about the controversy. The Mexican Institute of Social Security, the Government agency that supplied money and facilities for the filming, also did not return calls requesting comments. **********But a letter sent by the Ministry of the Interior to Televisa and made public this week by Mr. Zeron-Medina recommended ''the partial or total elimination'' of scenes a Government historian considered ''inappropriate'' because of excessive violence or deviation from official portrayals of historical figures. The letter argued that ''from the point of view of a state project,'' the objective of the rebroadcasts should be to ''favor our historical knowledge and our pride in the institutions and men who constructed modern Mexico.'' **********Mr. Zeron-Medina has written to the network urging that the censored episodes be rebroadcast but argues that it is more important in the long run that Mexico come to terms with its own history.

It also created a cultural, spiritual and national force that has been both a slavish supporter and the bane of Russian and Soviet leaders, one they have sought alternately to co-opt and to suppress. Gorbachev Follows Suit **********Mikhail S. Gorbachev's proclamation of a new degree of tolerance for the church is very much in that tradition. His immediate reasons include opening another front in his campaign to liberalize Soviet society, and gaining the support of an institution that despite 70 years of active repression can still claim the allegiance of 50 million people in the Soviet Union. **********In the broader context of the struggle Mr. Gorbachev is waging for the hearts and minds of the Soviet people, the enlistment to his camp of the church seems intended to challenge his adversaries' claim to Russian nationalism and to seize for his leadership the mantle of Russian history - to affirm, as the hymn would have it, his claim to ''Sacred Rus.'' **********Yet in allowing the church at last a sanctioned place in Soviet life, Mr. Gorbachev has in effect conceded the inability of the atheist state, despite seven decades of ardent and often brutal efforts, to crush or replace the spiritual and mystical grip of religion on the ''narod'' - literally, the people, but in Russian usage the working and farming folk. **********''I guess it's something people need and don't find anywhere else,'' said a Kiev taxi driver, stranded in the huge crowd outside St. Vladimir's, aglow in candles, frescoes, gold and the magnificent chants of the Russian church. The Church's Backbone **********Though the patriarch and other senior hierarchs of the church have come under sharp criticism from intellectuals and dissidents for their accommodation and timidity before the state, they remain to the majority of their flock a symbol of a higher reality, of a beauty that transcends the politics and travails of the daily grind. **********Questionable as their behavior has been, the hierarchs in many ways represent the age-old talent of the Russians to bend and dissemble, but to tenaciously safeguard what intellectuals have dubbed their ''soul.'' It is a tenacity expressed in the verse of the millennial hymn. It was the other-worldly magnificence of the church that first drew Prince Vladimir to the Byzantine religion, when his awed emissaries returned and reported, ''We knew not whether we were in heaven or on earth, for on earth there is no such splendor or such beauty.'' **********In seeking to tap this force today, Mr. Gorbachev seems to face no immediate risk. Firmly subjugated by Peter the Great almost 300 years ago and badly battered by the Soviet state, the surviving Russian church is timid and loyal. **********Bearing ample witness to this subservience during the millennial celebrations are the peals of praise that Patriarch Pimen of Moscow and All Russia and other prelates have lavished on Mr. Gorbachev and the restructuring plan he calls ''perestroika,'' the deference to officials of the watchdog council for religious affairs at all official ceremonies and the constant pledges of fealty to the state. The Risks of Recognition **********Yet the recognition of an institution that by definition challenges the state's monopoly on ideology and authority has inherent risks. **********Youths have long been tentatively tasting religion as an alternative to the barren official ideology, and the new dispensation is certain to increase the flood. Dozens of unofficial religious publications have already surfaced, and young believers increasingly call for a church entirely independent of the state. **********Mr. Gorbachev will probably be compelled to give similar treatment to other churches and religions - the Moslems of Central Asia; the Baptists and Pentecostals; the Roman Catholics, both underground and sanctioned, of the Baltic republics and the Western Ukraine; the Armenian church and the Georgian Orthodox. **********The underground Ukrainian Catholics pose a particular problem. Forcibly merged into the Russian Orthodox Church by Stalin in 1946, the church continued to operate secretly and has become a repository of Ukrainian nationalism, which has long been feared by the Kremlin for its links to Ukrainian exiles in the West and its hostility to the Russian domination in Moscow. The Ukrainian Perspective **********On the eve of the celebrations in Kiev, a Ukrainian cultural study group held a conference on the millennium as a Ukrainian event, because it occurred in what is now the Ukraine and laid the foundations also of the Ukrainian nation. **********Ukrainian Catholic sources also reported special masses celebrated in secret chapels in the Western Ukraine to mark the millennium. **********The Russian Orthodox Church itself, despite its willingness for many years to be a mouthpiece for Soviet propaganda abroad, has developed extensive independent ties to the Vatican, the World Council of Churches and other international organizations. **********The presence in Moscow and Kiev of the Vatican Secretary of State, Agostino Cardinal Casaroli, at the head of a large and influential delegation testified to Pope John Paul II's interest in forming links to the Russian Orthodox Church despite the unresolved problems with Soviet Catholics. **********Forging strong independent links abroad and affirming its special place in ''Sacred Rus,'' the church could yet prove a force for Mr. Gorbachev to reckon with."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/28/business/the-media-business-advertising-monthly-paper-to-advise-nonprofit-groups.html": {"writer_name": "Randall Rothenberg", "pub_date": "1988-12-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 148, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Monthly Paper to Advise Nonprofit Groups", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Monthly Paper to Advise Nonprofit Groups", "body_text": " **********Charities and other nonprofit organizations have traditionally looked to corporations and foundations to offer guidance on how to solicit funds.

But proponents do warn that dealings between the two neighbors might be reduced to an unending series of squabbles over minor trade issues. **********''Canada wanted this agreement in the first place, and they wanted it more than we did,'' said Senator Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat who supports the agreement with some reservations. ''If Canada now turns around and rejects it, and if they come forward with a proposal in another area like acid rain, it would be a bit more difficult. Americans may think: 'Here they come again. We listened to their entreaties on trade; they backed down and said no. How can we be sure they'll follow through?' '' Energy Department Concerns **********United States Government agencies strongly supported the trade agreement, but a few had reservations. Some Energy Department officials, for example, and some members of Congress said the pact could hurt American producers of uranium and natural gas by making it easier for Canada to export those products to the United States. **********American officials and academic experts spoke more in sorrow than in anger about the possibility that Canada might reject the trade agreement. **********''When the bilateral relationship does not go well, the Canadians tend to take separate, independent and sometimes even arbitrary directions in their foreign policy,'' said Lansing Lamont, director of Canadian affairs at the Americas Society in New York, a forum for discussion of Western Hemisphere affairs. **********If Canada rejects the pact, he said, ''there are a lot of areas where both countries might decide to flex their nationalist or independent feelings.'' Turn to Europe and East Asia **********Alan K. Henrikson, a professor at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, said that if Canada rejected the pact, it would probably seek better access to markets outside North America, in Europe and East Asia. **********Members of Congress and academic experts predicted also that there would be increased pressure for protection of domestic industries in the United States and Canada if the pact dies. **********Prof. Charles F. Doran, director of the Center of Canadian Studies at Johns Hopkins University, said, ''Any aggrieved party, any interest group that feels it's been treated badly in this arrangement will come to Congress and ask for protectionist measures, to make sure that a free-trade agreement like this never happens to them again.'' Such industries might include producers of uranium, wheat, oil, natural gas, steel and car parts, he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/05/business/aca-joe-s-stock.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-04-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 123, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Aca Joe's Stock", "print_headline": "Aca Joe's Stock", "body_text": " **********Aca Joe Inc., a men's clothing retailer, said its common stock had been deleted from the Nasdaq over-the-counter trading system effective April 1 because of the company's failure to meet Nasdaq's capital and surplus requirements.

Alan Smith, G.M.'s executive vice president for finance, said in an interview that the objective was to be ''cost competitive at roughly current levels'' of sales, which represent about 37 percent of the American car market. **********Robert C. Stempel, G.M.'s president, also said the company planned to be operating its plants at 100 percent of capacity by 1992, which means it could increase output only slightly through the use of overtime if sales were to improve. **********The new strategies amount to a stunning turnaround for General Motors, whose officials just a few years ago were confidently predicting that it would regain 45 percent or more of the domestic car market. The change in attitude is drastic for a company whose philosophy was to have the factories available to meet any consumer demand. **********By acknowledging that the company will have to be pared down to roughly fit its current sales level, General Motors is following the lead of the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation. Both those companies had decided to avoid the dangers at the bottom of the automotive sales cycle rather than try to reach for the peaks. **********G.M.'s shift also effectively concedes a big sector of the market to imports and the Japanese companies that have built or are building assembly plants in this country. **********General Motors' share of the combined car and truck market in the United States has been eroding steadily in this decade, falling from 44.1 percent in 1980 to 34.7 percent last year. Throughout that period, company officials routinely issued optimistic forecasts of improved sales and scheduled production to meet the forecasts. **********The result has been recurring gluts of cars on dealers' lots and the use of financial incentives to stimulate sales. But incentives are expensive and cut into profits. According to an analyst who attended today's meeting, G.M. is projecting that it will spend $3.3 billion on incentives this year, up $600 million from 1987. **********By more closely matching production capacity with what officials termed ''a volume outlook that is realistic,'' G.M. is evidently hoping to save on incentives as well as run its plants at an efficient level. Ford's record profitability recently has been attributed to its strategy of keeping plants producing close to capacity. **********Mr. Stempel also said that General Motors was planning to trim its components-making operations and buy from outside sources those parts it cannot competitively produce. **********The contract the company signed with the United Automobile Workers union last year reportedly included a ban on plant closings and on layoffs for any reason but a drop in sales. However, Mr. Stempel noted that the manufacture of certain components could be ended without closing plants, according to an analyst. General Motors has shown that it can effectively close plants by terming them ''indefinitely idled,'' and leaving open the possibility they might reopen. **********''We're working very hard with our unions on the question of outsourcing non-competitive products,'' Mr. Stempel said in a statement released by the company. ''It's a joint process, but the unions understand the problem.'' **********General Motors officials also said that the company that once sought to make a car for ''every purse and purpose'' was planning to cut back on the number of models and options. For example, instead of having V-6 and four-cylinder engine options for a car, the company may just offer versions of the four-cylinder engine. **********''A lot of our cost savings and efficiency improvements are due to a more creative use of our existing products,'' said Lloyd Reuss, executive vice president for North American automotive operations, in the company's statement General Motors officials told the analysts that it expects to cut annual costs by $12.5 billion to $13 billion by 1990, rather than the $10 billion estimated next year. But an analyst noted that the cost cuts refer only to operating efficiencies and not to marketing costs, such as incentives. **********G.M. said it has repurchased 9.1 million shares of its common stock since March 1987. Some 4.4 million shares of class E stock, which reflects the earnings of the company's Electronic Data System Corporation, have also been repurchased along with 2.2 million shares of class H, which is based on the GM Hughes Electronics Corporation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/27/business/japan-is-seeking-larger-role-in-world-s-financial-system-and-debt-crisis.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Greenhouse", "pub_date": "1988-09-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1081, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Japan Is Seeking Larger Role in World's Financial System and Debt Crisis", "print_headline": "Japan Is Seeking Larger Role in World's Financial System and Debt Crisis", "body_text": " **********Japan is demonstrating an increased willingness to accept more financial responsibilities as officials of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank gather here for their annual meetings. **********Japanese officials have indicated that the nation wants to contribute a far larger amount to the I.M.F. And they are expected to provide details Tuesday of their broad plan to help reduce the $1.2 trillion debt of the world's developing nations. The plan, announced in June by Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, calls for debtor nations to buy back their debts at a discount and then issue new bonds to their creditors. **********In addition, Satoshi Sumita, the governor of Japan's central bank, announced a plan on Sunday night to lend urgently needed cash to some Latin American debtors, including Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. 'Want to Play Bigger Role' **********''The Japanese, as the second-largest economy in the free-market world, are increasingly showing that they want to play a bigger role,'' one European finance official said. **********Japan's partners have urged it to play a larger role in the debt crisis since its economy has grown much more important and because it has huge trade surpluses. **********Mr. Sumita has voiced frustration that Japan makes the fifth-largest contribution and thus has the fifth-largest voice in the monetary fund, even though it has the second-largest economy among I.M.F. members. He wants Japan to become the second-largest contributor and have the second-largest voice, ranking only behind the United States. **********Japan contributes about 4.7 percent of the monetary fund's capital even though it has 11 percent of the capitalist world's foreign reserves. The United States pays 19.9 percent and Britain, France and West Germany also pay a larger share than Japan. **********Japan has pushed these initiatives as the Americans have been relatively unobtrusive in a week of financial meetings here. Nicholas F. Brady, the United States Treasury Secretary, has been on the job for less than two weeks, and the Reagan Administraton has decided not to take any major initiatives during the Presidential campaign. In addition Washington's largesse has been hampered by the huge budget deficit. **********Mr. Sumita of the Bank of Japan said today that the new loan program for middle-income nations would go beyond the $30 billion program that Japan has in place to recycle funds to developing nations. Japanese officials declined to say how much new money would be lent. But Michel Camdessus, the monetary fund's managing director, praised the program and said it would provide important aid to debtor nations. Payment Would Be Guaranteed **********The Japanese debt plan to be announced on Tuesday, named after Finance Minister Miyazawa, is intended to make it easier for commercial banks to reduce their third-world exposure. The plan would enable banks to sell their debts at a discount and would guarantee payment of the reformulated debt through an I.M.F.-managed fund. Neither Japan nor the monetary fund has put a dollar figure on the plan. **********The guarantee fund would be financed by debtor nations, which will give some foreign exchange reserves to the monetary fund as collateral. The plan is similar to a Mexican debt relief plan arranged by the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company in December 1987. The Mexican effort produced disappointing results, with few creditors interesting in buying back debt they had sold at a discount, because interest payments were not guaranteed. **********The Miyazawa plan is widely considered to be the most important official debt plan proposed since the 1985 Baker plan in which former Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d sought to ease the debt crisis by calling on commercial banks to lend new money to developing nations, while debtor nations were prodded to do more to alter their economies to foster growth. **********The Baker plan has not stopped the debt crisis from snowballing. Commercial banks have lent little new money and debtor nations have not revamped their economies as much as their creditors would like. **********Discussing the Miyazawa plan, John Williamson, senior fellow with the Institute for International Economics in Washington, said: ''It's certainly saying one has to move beyond the Baker plan. But one can say the the Baker plan was sufficiently imprecise that this could be viewed as an evolution of the Baker plan.'' Outlined at Toronto Meeting **********The Miyazawa plan was outlined broadly at the meeting in Toronto in June of the Group of Seven - the United States and its major economic partners, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada. At the time, the American delegation criticized it because the I.M.F. might have to use its funds to guarantee the debt, if the debtor nation's foreign reserves were inadequate collateral. **********''It's hard for us to comment on the plan because we haven't seen the details, but we're concerned that it be consistent with the Group of Seven communique, which opposes transferring private risks to the public,'' said one finance official of a member nation. **********According to French officials, their Government is also drafting a wide-ranging debt relief plan that President Francois Mitterrand may introduce in a speech on Thursday at the United Nations. **********Mr. Miyazawa is not in West Berlin; he remained in Tokyo because of Emperor Hirohito's illness. Mr. Sumita is expected to present details of the plan on Tuesday. **********In a speech today to the monetary fund's policy-making Interim Committee, Mr. Sumita endorsed Mr. Camdessus's call for fund members to increase its $115 billion in capital.

American 'Selling Advantage' **********''The American cars have roughly a $2,000 selling advantage over comparably equipped Japanese cars,'' said Jack V.

''Add $1,000 in cash rebates, and, in the case of Chrysler, up to $2,500, and that's a huge differential.'' **********The Chrysler Corporation began the current round of buyer incentives in November and has led the discounting war since then, though the Ford Motor Company and the General Motors Corporation have offered substantial rebates of their own.

This may mean that Ford has reached the limits it imposed on itself earlier in the decade, when it sharply cut its overhead by reducing its production capacity, Mr. Kirnan said. **********''Ford may have some difficulty holding up because it is already producing at full capacity,'' he said.

Pessimism Fades **********The sales increases are causing analysts to pull back a bit from their pessimistic predictions of late last year, when they were expecting the 1988 car and truck market to shrink at least 5 percent from the 1987 sales of 15.2 million. **********Two factors seem different now: consumer confidence has rebounded since the stock market crash, and Detroit has decided that, rather than cut production, it will try to move cars through heavy discounting. **********Paul Kleinaitis, an analyst with Duff & Phelps, attributed most of the upturn to the sales incentives, which he said seemed to be set in concrete now that the manufacturers have committed themselves to higher second-quarter production. ''It's a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy,'' he said. ''Incentives increase sales, production increases to fill the demand - which means you have to keep the incentives.'' **********Mr. Kleinaitis said the incentives were more aggressively packaged than he had thought likely, taking the form of rebates rather than cut-rate financing or discounts on options. **********''It's pretty strong, you have to say that, but it smacks of a short-term fix of the kind Detroit is known for,'' he said. ''It might be better to just cut prices - I don't think the U.S. car companies have made enough of their price differential with the Japanese.'' **********Mr. Kirnan of Kidder, Peabody estimated that Chrysler had enough car inventory to last 68 days on Feb. 29, down from 101 days a month before; General Motors had 59 days, down from 84, and Ford had 59, down from 70.

''You can't expect to have a big result every time. It's good for the relationship to be regularized.'' **********As President Reagan left Moscow this morning and flew here to brief British officials on the meeting, his aides depicted a summit conference that was stronger on symbols than on substance, a spirited encounter between two strong-willed leaders who disagreed sharply at times and gave significantly different evaluations of the meeting. The Conflicting Views **********Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, said Wednesday that the summit talks had been marked by ''missed opportunities.'' But senior White House aides said Mr. Reagan had seized his most important opportunity, to speak directly to the Soviet people and encourage the changes taking place in the Soviet Union. **********In assessing the results of the summit talks, the White House aides acknowledged that from the beginning, the President was more interested in making statements than in reaching agreements, more concerned with the image he projected on television than in the content of his direct conversations with Mr. Gorbachev. **********One of the major disappointments for the White House was the failure of the Russians to broadcast Mr. Reagan's speech at Moscow State University and his exchange with students there, an event that several aides described as ''the emotional high point'' of the visit. **********''He may have missed a few opportunities,'' a senior official said of Mr. Gorbachev, ''but we didn't miss any.'' Questions on Reagan's Stamina **********Questions about the 77-year-old President's health and stamina continued to bother the White House. Howard H. Baker Jr., the chief of staff, told reporters aboard Air Force One that although Mr. Reagan's fatigue had played no role in the summit meeting: ''He is tired. I guess he looks tired.'' **********Other officials who saw Mr. Reagan up close this week said his energy and attention span varied widely. At times the President seemed sharp, replying quickly to Mr. Gorbachev's points, they said, but at other times his mind clearly seemed to wander, and during one meeting he was observed dozing. **********White House aides tried to put the best face on a meeting that they once hoped would result in a completed treaty reducing long-range arms. **********The aides described tough bargaining on the arms issue that left many key issues unresolved, and as they left Moscow, the White House expressed growing pessimism that a treaty could be completed during the Reagan Administration. **********''As time passes, it gets increasingly unlikely,'' said an official familiar with the arms talks. **********Another official added that the Russians now seemed to be waiting for the new Administration that takes office in January, and are holding back on some potential concessions in the arms talks to set a positive tone with the new President. **********White House aides also acknowledged that the seven agreements that were signed in Moscow, covering issues like student exchanges and fishing rights, amounted to very little. But, they noted, they brought to 47 the number of two-way pacts signed in the last three years. **********A White House aide said: ''Are they big agreements? No, they're peanuts. But that's coral-building. You're slowly building up a relationship of trust and agreements.'' Talks on Mideast Policy **********In addition to the formal agreements signed in Moscow, American officials expressed satisfaction at conversations over Middle East policy. **********For the first time, a Reagan aide said, the Russians seemed willing to show more flexibility on the nature of an international conference on the Middle East, and on how the Palestinians would be represented. **********The officials also reported progress on southern Africa. The two sides agreed to try to work out a plan by September providing for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Angola, and for the independence of South-West Africa, the South African-ruled territory also known as Namibia. **********As he left Moscow, Mr. Reagan said it was fitting for him to meet a final time with Mr. Gorbachev in St. George's Hall, where he first entered the Kremlin last Sunday. **********Referring to the legend of St. George, the famous dragon-slayer, the President said, ''I would like to think that our efforts during these past few days have slayed a few dragons and advanced the struggle against the evils that threaten mankind - threats to peace and to liberty.'' A Few Prejudices Slain **********The President also indicated that he had slain a few prejudices from his own past, when he called the Soviet Union an ''evil empire.'' Addressing Mr. Gorbachev, he said, ''Tell the people of the Soviet Union of the deep feelings of friendship felt by us and by the people of our country toward them.'' **********But Presidential aides said Mr. Reagan still expressed some of his old feelings in private. On Sunday, when the President and his wife, Nancy, took a stroll along the Arbat, a quaint corner of old Moscow, Soviet security agents rather brutally pushed aside reporters and curious Muscovites who tried to get a closer look. **********Leaving the scene, Mr. Reagan muttered to one assistant that the Soviet Union remained a ''police state.'' **********Here in London, the Reagans had tea with Queen Elizabeth and dinner with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who accepted an invitation to visit Washington next November. **********It was a quiet evening among old friends tonight, and British officials quoted Mrs. Thatcher as saying, ''After meeting Reagan, the Russians will find it very difficult to see America as a threat.'' 'Doesn't Show Any Deference' **********With the summit meeting behind them, American officials were willing to describe some of the chemistry between Mr. Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev. **********Most foreign leaders, even old friends like Mrs. Thatcher, tend to defer to Mr. Reagan because of his age and stature, an official said. ''But Gorbachev doesn't show any deference or respect, for his age or his position,'' the official explained. ''He treats Reagan like a regular guy, and I don't think anybody else treats him that way.'' **********Mr. Baker expanded on that description, saying the two men ''speak very freely and they speak very frankly.'' **********At one point, the chief of staff said, ''They were face to face and going at it pretty heavy until the end.'' **********Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said the encounter took place during the last meeting on Wednesday, and concerned an effort by Mr. Gorbachev to alter a paragraph in the final statement that was issued that night by the two sides. 'Peaceful Coexistence' **********On Sunday, the Soviet leader had handed Mr. Reagan a piece of paper containing a proposed paragraph on the political relations between the two countries. It referred to the concept of ''peaceful coexistence'' and committed both countries to staying out of the internal affairs of other countries. **********Reagan aides were afraid that such language would effectively bar the United States from pressing human rights issues, or from supporting rebel forces in countries like Nicaragua. **********As American officials tell the story, alternative language was worked out between the two sides that omitted Mr. Gorbachev's draft. At the final meeting on Wednesday, however, the Soviet leader revived his initial proposal. **********After a brief discussion with his aides, Mr. Reagan again rejected the Gorbachev proposal. It was at that point that the two men ''stood toe to toe,'' according to Mr. Baker."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/30/world/soviets-say-un-group-ignores-pakistani-acts.html": {"writer_name": "Elaine Sciolino", "pub_date": "1988-09-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 678, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Soviets Say U.N.

Gerasimov, the Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, accused the peacekeeping group monitoring the Soviet withdrawal in Afghanistan of ''not doing its job properly.'' He warned that there would be ''difficulties'' in creating future peacekeeping operations if Pakistan's violations were not properly reported and investigated. **********The Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, asked Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar on Wednesday for a detailed report on the activities of the peacekeeping group to be delivered to the permanent members of the Security Council, Mr. Gerasimov said. **********In recent weeks, the Soviet Union has stepped up its charges that Pakistan is violating its promise of noninterference under the April accords by allowing arms to continue to flow to the Afghan guerrillas.

'Expression of Frustration' **********''If we do not succeed in creating an efficient control mechanism here in Afghanistan, which is a kind of testing ground, then we will have difficulties in creating this kind of mechanism in other conflicts,'' Mr. Gerasimov said. He urged the monitoring force to ''report things as they are.'' **********Asked about Mr. Gerasimov's charges, Foreign Minister Sahabzada Yaqub Khan of Pakistan said in an interview, ''These threats are an expression of frustration on their part because the conflict is going against them in Afghanistan.'' **********''The Soviets are also trying to cover up a whole series of violations of the Geneva accords and of international law by violating our air and ground space,'' he added. **********Since the mission, known as the United Nations Good Offices Mission to Afghanistan and Pakistan, was created last summer, several countries that contribute troops to it have complained to the United Nations that it is running poorly. They have charged that the mission is badly organized and has been denied access to areas where violations by Pakistan and Afghanistan may have occurred. A Countercharge by Shultz **********Phyllis E. Oakley, deputy to the State Department spokesman, said the United States would comment on the charges on Friday. But at a meeting of the five permanent members of the Security Council on Wednesday evening, Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Mr. Shevardnadze clashed, accusing each other of violating the accords. **********When Mr. Shevardnadze accused Pakistan of continuing to supply arms to the guerrillas with American help, Mr. Shultz countered by charging that Pakistani airspace had been continually violated. **********The strong and relentless Soviet verbal attacks on Pakistan are somewhat puzzling since both the United States and the Soviet Union agreed in principle at Geneva that Moscow would be allowed to continue to arm the Afghan Army and the United States to funnel aid to the guerrillas. **********In a sign that there is some cooperation between Pakistan and the Soviet Union, Mr. Shevardnadze and Mr. Yaqub Khan agreed at a meeting Wednesday night on the text of a General Assembly draft resolution on the situation in Afghanistan, according to Mr. Yaqub Khan. The resolution calls for ''scrupulous respect for and faithful imlementation'' of the Geneva accords and ''expresses its expectation'' that the Soviet withdrawal will be completed on schedule. **********But Mr. Gerasimov's charges were the most detailed to date. Among the accusations are the existence of military training centers for Afghan rebels in Pakistan, inaction by Pakistan in stopping the creation of a ''so-called transitional government'' on Pakistani territory, and the creation of an Afghan press agency on Pakistan's territory."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/25/world/us-says-it-may-seek-a-cut-in-its-un-dues.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Lewis", "pub_date": "1988-02-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 592, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Says It May Seek a Cut in Its U.N.

The United States is now expected to provide 25 percent of the funds for the United Nations and its specialized agencies, including the World Health Organization in Geneva and the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna. **********A major concern of those pressing for such a reduction is that the United States could soon lose its vote in the General Assembly under United Nations rules if Congress continues to appropriate less than America owes. **********Those who favor lowering the United States share say they hope that Congress can be persuaded to restore full financing for the United Nations and its specialized agencies if America's assessed contribution is cut. **********Contributions to the United Nations are assessed according to each country's wealth. The formula in use puts the United States share of United Nations expenses at about 29 percent, but a longstanding United Nations rule limits any country's budget share to 25 percent of the total. The United States is the largest single contributor. **********Last year, the United States was supposed to pay $212 million toward the roughly $800 million annual budget for United Nations headquarters in New York. Overall, it owed $571 million toward the cost of the 44 international organizations it belongs to, most of which are affiliated to the United Nations. **********A reduction in the American share of the United Nations budget would require majority approval of a General Assembly resolution. Administration officials say no firm decision has been made, though many say they feel they have little alternative to seeking a reduction because of the difficulty of gaining a full appropriation from Congress. **********These officials also say they do not yet know what share of the United Nation's budget the United States should offer to pay if it decides to press for a reduction. But some friendly foreign diplomats have suggested the United States could seek 15 or 20 percent. **********Any cut in the contribution would force other countries to pay more, with most of the extra payment falling on the next largest contributors. **********Japan is the second largest contributor, with a 10.84 percent share of the budget, followed by the Soviet Union (10.2 percent), West Germany (8.26 percent), France (6.37 percent) and Britain (4.86 percent). **********A decision to seek a lower share of the budget would represent a sharp change of policy for Mr. Reagan. **********Last year, when it became clear the Congress would not provide America's full budget share for the second year running, the Scandinavian countries informally suggested that the Administration seek a lower assessment and offered to help persuade other countries. **********Secretary of State George P Shultz rejected the proposal, saying it would reduce America's influence at the United Nations and damage its prestige on the world stage. **********Since then, however, officials say the Administration feels the prospects of Congress restoring full financing to the United Nations in the forseeable future have worsened, reflecting concern about the American budget deficit."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/06/business/finance-new-issues-united-illuminating-issue-is-offered.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-10-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 108, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "United Illuminating Issue Is Offered", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; United Illuminating Issue Is Offered", "body_text": " **********The United Illuminating Company yesterday began offering $150 million of 10 1/2 percent debentures due 1995 at a price of 99.875, to yield 10.524 percent, through underwriters led by Morgan Stanley & company. **********At the time of pricing the yield spread over Treasury securities with a similar maturity was 178 basis points. **********Nonrefundable for five years, the issue is rated Baa-3 by Moody's and BBB- by Standard & Poor's, underwriters said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/04/world/nicaragua-refuses-visas-to-replace-us-envoys.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Kinzer", "pub_date": "1988-09-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 651, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Nicaragua Refuses Visas to Replace U.S. Envoys", "print_headline": "Nicaragua Refuses Visas to Replace U.S. Envoys", "body_text": " **********The Sandinista Government is refusing to grant visas for American Embassy officers to replace those expelled nine weeks ago, according to Nicaraguan and foreign diplomats. **********Some officials familiar with the dispute say it could lead to a break in diplomatic relations between Washington and Managua. There has been no public indication that such a break is imminent. **********''It's a tense situation,'' said Luis Humberto Guzman, a member of Nicaragua's National Assembly, who has discussed the matter with American diplomats. ''There are at least some people in Washington who would like this to lead to a diplomatic break.'' **********It has been more than three weeks since the State Department spokesman, Charles E. Redman, complained publicly about the matter. ''Stalling on the issuance of visas for U.S. diplomats indicates that the Sandinista regime wishes to prevent the U.S. Embassy from functioning normally,'' Mr. Redman said at a briefing in Washington. **********On July 11, the Sandinistas expelled Ambassador Richard H. Melton and seven other American diplomats, asserting that they were involved in a plot to destabilize Nicaragua. In response, the United States expelled the Nicaraguan Ambassador in Washington, Carlos Tunnermann Bernheim, and seven Nicaraguan diplomats. **********The United States has presented visa applications for seven Foreign Service officers to replace those expelled from Managua, but the applications have not been acted upon. Each week, the American charge d'affaires here visits the Foreign Ministry seeking information on the applications, and each week he is told that the applications would be viewed favorably if the United States allowed Mr. Tunnermann to return to his post. In addition to being Nicaragua's Ambassador to the United States, Mr. Tunnermann was Nicaragua's Ambassador to the Organization of American States, which is based in Washington. The Sandinista position is that because of the O.A.S. post, the State Department had no authority to expel him. **********The United States has made clear it will not allow Mr. Tunnermann to return. The State Department says it would accept another ambassador if Nicaragua permits a new American ambassador to come to Managua. **********A Nicaraguan official confirmed today that his Government was holding up visas for new embassy officers as a way of pressing Washington to allow Mr. Tunnermann's return. **********But he said other diplomatic visas, as well as visas sought on humanitarian grounds, were still being approved by both sides. **********The United States Embassy in Managua remains open, but diplomats say it is not functioning normally. The two economic officers assigned here were among the diplomats expelled in July; as a result there is no economic section. The personnel shortage has also led the embassy to stop processing visa applications from private Nicaraguans. **********The diplomatic dispute comes against a background of continued tension between the United States and Nicaragua. The Sandinistas and the contra guerrillas, who are backed by the United States, have been observing a cease-fire since March. But there have been sporadic violations. **********The peace talks between Government and contra leaders broke down June 9, and officials on both sides say there is no prospect for an early resumption of the talks.

In speeches, published papers and annual reports, they note how they have cut the fat out of management layers and divested businesses that did not fit in with overall corporate strategy. **********They say they have attacked quality problems, both through re-educating workers and through technological developments like statistical process controls that alert workers if any machine is starting to produce faulty parts. And they usually end with a plea to Washington to do the rest of the job, through better monetary, trade and tax policies. But are the executives resting on laurels they have not yet earned? Many economists and academicians, along with a handful of prominent business leaders, say they are. These experts worry that quality problems are alleviated but not solved; that it still takes too long to get products from lab to market; that workers and management remain at odds in too many plants, and that American companies retain a provincial attitude toward world markets. **********''We've come a third of the way to regaining competitiveness by slashing costs and improving productivity, but clearly, we have not done enough,'' said Jerry J. Jasinowski, senior vice president of the National Association of Manufacturers. **********Andrew C. Sigler, chairman of Champion International Inc., is more blunt. ''Cutting isn't the answer - that can be done by stupid arbitrary judgments,'' he said. ''Competitive companies must understand how to motivate people to be productive, and that is hard as hell.'' **********No one doubts that progress has been made. Indeed, sales per employee, a key productivity measure, have skyrocketed at most companies. Factory productivity is rising in almost every industry. Exports are surging to the point where the trade deficit plunged 25 percent in November, and dropped again in December. **********Manufacturing costs are down from 15 to 25 percent, and administrative costs have been cut even more. Numerous companies have installed just-in-time inventory control, a system in which suppliers deliver quality-guaranteed parts that are used immediately rather than placed in stock. The Hewlett-Packard Company, for one, has chopped $600 million a year from its inventory carrying costs through such a system. **********EVEN the USX Corporation, a company frequently cited as an example of all that is wrong with American competitiveness, can point to impressive gains. David M. Roderick, its chief executive, said USX now makes a ton of steel in less than 4 man-hours, down from 10 a few years ago. In fact, USX's per-ton production costs are in line with those of the Japanese. **********But much of the progress in the manufacturing sector may be illusory. Many gains in comparative cost that American companies have made against the Japanese can be traced to the rise of the yen and could be wiped out if the dollar rebounds. And many huge productivity improvements in steel and other basic industries were accomplished primarily by closing plants and winning union concessions. Such gains cannot be improved upon without more bloodletting and closed capacity. **********''Yes, American industry has improved over the past four, five years, but so have our competitors,'' said Robert Anderson, the departing chief executive of the Rockwell International Corporation and a member of the 1983 Presidential Commission on Industrial Competitiveness. ''The United States may have been 1 on a scale of 1 to 10. Well, now we're 5.'' **********Indeed, business experts warn that American industry is not moving fast enough. Foreign companies are getting into new product areas all the time, leading to shakeouts in almost every market, at home and abroad. Increasingly, American companies must fight each other as well as foreign competitors for shares in markets they once had sewn up. Anyone who watched Xerox fall victim to the Japanese in copiers, or saw Pratt & Whitney lose its longstanding lead in aircraft engines to General Electric, would recognize that past rules of competition do not apply in the global business environment of the 1980's. **********The vast improvements that many American companies have eked out on the factory floor have not always been replicated in non-production areas, like sales and administration. And they have certainly not been apparent in the service sector, which employs about 70 percent of American workers. **********Indeed, maintaining - or, in some cases, regaining - supremacy in manufacturing industries remains vital for the American economy. Reliance on the fast-growing service sector could spell disaster. Low service productivity is an open invitation for future competition from overseas. And, in any event, manufacturing companies are the clients for better than 25 percent of services. ''Idiot is not an out-of-line word for people who say a service economy is the way to go,'' said Mr. Roderick of USX. **********All told, on a global basis, American productivity figures are not comforting. The years of stagnating productivity growth earlier this decade did not rob the United States of its leading position in world productivity. But now, although American productivity is again improving at a steady annual clip, other countries are catching up. **********C. Jackson Grayson Jr., head of the American Productivity Center in Houston, predicts that, based on comparative growth rates between 1973 and 1986, Canada, France, Norway, West Germany, Belgium and Japan will eventually pass the United States in employee productivity. **********''The U.S. is still the world leader, but you just can't assume that will last,'' he warned.  The Quality Race **********Quality issues remain the sharpest thorn in American industry's side. For years, the Japanese - not to mention the Germans, the Koreans and a growing legion of others - have produced high-quality goods at market prices, and American companies are still scrambling to figure out how they do it. **********The Xerox Corporation learned the hard way how quickly Japanese competition can turn market supremacy into market oblivion. Until the early 1970's, Xerox was the undisputed copier king. ''We were fairly arrogant, until we realized the Japanese were selling quality products for what it cost us to make them,'' said Paul A. Allaire, Xerox's president. **********Xerox has caught up, and its arrogance is long gone. Instead, the company is one of the biggest advice-askers around. Its executives have talked to Japanese companies about design and manufacturing processes, to business professors about organizational structure, to other American companies about quality programs and distribution methods. And it has installed what Mr. Allaire calls a total quality process, a system that involves formally identifying service or quality problems and forming teams to solve them. **********It is the companies that have made the greatest quality strides that keep looking for better ways to do things. ''We've sent people around the world, looking for best practices,'' said John A. Young, chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, which does ''total quality control'' analyses of every department, including sales and administration. ''There is a quality network out there,'' he said. ''Xerox, Ford, H-P, we all have ideas going back and forth.'' Such companies remain the exception. Far more still try to make do with a quick fix. Some have tried worker-involvement programs, which failed when they refused to give workers the power to implement their ideas. Others have beefed up inspection programs for parts and finished products only to find the cost of fixing defective products - rather than making sure they are made correctly in the first place - can run as high as 25 percent of operating budgets and wreak havoc with delivery schedules. **********Even companies with excellent records of producing high-quality products run into problems when they ignore the quality of their marketing, product design or service operations. **********I.B.M., for example, has occasionally made that mistake. By not paying serious attention to customers' frustration with the incompatibility of many I.B.M. machines, it opened doors for the Digital Equipment Corporation and other companies that had pumped research dollars into developing networks that would solve the incompatibility problems. **********''In the past, you could enter markets at your own pace,'' said E. Kirby Warren, vice dean at the Columbia Business School. ''Today, you have to learn what customers want, make it and sell it, or someone else will.''  Where to Be **********That means operating as close to the market as possible. For that reason, the delight that many economists and business executives are manifesting at the rising export figures may be misplaced. While exports help the skewed trade balance, many business experts believe that for American companies to thoroughly penetrate overseas markets, they must produce in those markets. **********''A manufacturing plant is seen as a commitment by foreign customers and governments that we will be there for a long time,'' said Winston R. Hindle Jr., senior vice president, corporate operations, for Digital Equipment. ''A sales and service office is not the same.'' **********Foreign companies, particularly Japanese ones, often develop relationships with suppliers that they carry through to their own overseas plants as they expand globally, said Glen H. Hiner, senior vice president of G.E. Plastics, which is beefing up its Japanese production. ''We want them to be used to working with us,'' he said. **********Producing offshore also enables companies to take advantage of currency fluctuations. The Dow Chemical Company, for one, has duplicate facilities in several countries and fills orders from whichever location looks as though it will have the lowest costs at shipment time. **********Lastly, producing offshore is still the best way to get to know other cultures and markets. The annals are rife with stories of companies that tried to export full-sized refrigerators to countries notable for tiny kitchens, or dolls with blond hair and blue eyes to countries in Asia and Africa. **********''Too often, we view foreign markets as dumping grounds for our surplus products,'' said Philip Cotler, a marketing professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. ''That runs counter to the notion of finding needs abroad and servicing them.'' **********To really spot such needs - to become market driven, in management jargon - requires a new attitude toward product design. **********G.E. Plastics is working with aircraft companies to develop materials to solve toxic-fume problems. And Rockwell and TRW Inc. are tailoring their automotive parts for different markets. ''Every country's automobile industry has its own idiosyncrasies,'' said Jerry K. Myers, executive vice president and general manager of TRW's automotive sector. **********In fact, some say that it is the lack of such flexibility that has most hurt the American steel industry. ''It didn't develop new uses for steel when plastics, aluminum and cement knocked it off in automotive and construction,'' said Charles Bradford, a steel analyst at Merrill Lynch Research. Mr. Roderick of USX accurately notes that the Japanese and Europeans have also not developed new markets for steel. But as low-cost producers, they never had to. **********Many business experts say that if a company can truly maintain its position as lowest-cost producer, it can get away with a lackluster track record of product introductions. ''A company that is putting all of its resources into products will look good in the short run, but the key is still its manufacturing processes,'' said Robert H. Hayes, management professor at the Harvard Business School. **********Mr. Anderson of Rockwell agrees. Over the last three years, Rockwell's capital expenditures have exceeded $1.5 billion, close to 70 percent for high-tech production processes like computer-integrated manufacturing. The company has developed a reputation for quality even in Japan, where its modems dominate the market and are accepted by Japanese computer companies without inspection. ''If you don't have the latest in equipment it is impossible to get the productivity you need,'' Mr. Anderson said.  Wall Street's Role **********Sometimes, though, chief executives use Wall Street as the whipping boy for their unwillingness to make expensive investments that do not show immediate bottom-line results. They complain that corporate raiders, frightened boards and investors clamoring for immediate paybacks represent home-grown obstacles as formidable as any provided by foreign competitors. **********Too many executives are squandering corporate resources to alleviate the pressure from investors, business experts warn. ''Far too much of our capital is going into stock buybacks or defensive moves against raiders,'' said Patrick Choate, an economist who is TRW's director of policy analysis. ''The pressures for quick results and quarterly earnings make it difficult for executives to put money into long-term strategies.'' **********Indeed, many experts say that Richard J. Ferris, the former chief executive of the Allegis Corporation, had the right idea when he tried to establish a global, computer-linked transportation and lodging network around Allegis's United Airlines unit. Whether his vision was right will remain moot - the company's board ousted him and sold Allegis's rental car and hotel businesses at enormous short-term gain. **********Other boards were forced by outside pressures to back away from long-term plans. The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company's strategy of cutting back its dependence on tires and investing in productivity tools was neatly derailed in 1986 when investors, angered at the lack of short-term profits, sold the stock, providing a golden opportunity for Sir James Goldsmith to begin a takeover attack. The board sold chunks of the company and mortgaged other parts to maintain Goodyear's independence. **********There are success stories, of course - tales of companies that, with full board and shareholder backing, have honed their production and marketing skills, motivated their people and done just fine. **********Rubbermaid Inc. has put about 9 percent of revenues into new plants and modernization every year this decade. In 1980 it had six manufacturing locations; today it has 25. The company, based in Wooster, Ohio, has introduced more than 700 products in the last five years. Its productivity, measured in units produced per employee, has increased by 50 percent since 1980, and its profits have quadrupled on tripled sales. **********But in many ways, Rubbermaid had it easy. Inexpensive household products, Rubbermaid's mainstay lines, do not face much competition from imports. No raider has made a run at the company. It has always had a reputation for quality. And it never went through the kind of haphazard diversification and expansion that characterized many companies in the 60's and 70's. **********Caterpillar Inc., in contrast, has been through a ghastly few years. The company took losses of $1 billion in a three-year price war with Japanese construction equipment manufacturers. Improving productivity was a matter of survival. **********Caterpillar has discovered how counterproductive many traditional ways of operating really are. Its plant layouts were such that a transmission, say, could travel as much as 10 miles as it moved to different assembly operations. And the process of tracking that part through the company's labyrinthine plants could generate as many as 1,000 pieces of paper. **********Now Caterpillar, thanks partly to the dollar's decline, has moved into the black with its market share intact. It is now injecting a great deal of capital into a program called Plant With a Future, which combines extensive computerization with a new production setup in which ''cells'' of workers make a part from start to finish. Gilbert Nolde, a company spokesman, predicted that by the 1990's Caterpillar will be down to an average of 10 pieces of paper and 200 feet of travel for each part. **********While Caterpillar reorganizes its work floor, other companies are redrawing their organizational charts. **********Most companies are still looking for the most workable mix of centralized and decentralized operations. The Eastman Kodak Company has reorganized into 24 business units, each with profit-and-loss responsibility, to speed up commercialization of new products. I.B.M. recently decentralized in a similar manner, distributing its many products among five self-contained businesses and giving the business heads bottom-line responsibility. **********G.E. Plastics, in contrast, has abandoned the profit center concept in its United States operations in favor of a centralized marketing and sales organization. ''Too many of my products seemed to be competing with each other,'' said Mr. Hiner. **********Digital Equipment used to view each product line as a separate business, responsible for its own worldwide marketing. The result was that ''the U.S.-based managers would push the wrong products in the wrong countries,'' Mr. Hindle said. Now the company gives executives in each country responsibility for selling all products in their geographic areas. Its Japanese managers, for example, recognized that while the Japanese had ample access to excellent computers, there was a need for good software, so that is what they are emphasizing in Japan.  A New Breed **********Many companies are looking for a new breed of manager who can help to coordinate product design and manufacturing. ''Few of our clients are willing to settle for old-line manufacturing people who can just talk the language of the production floor,'' said Lynn Tendler Bignell, a principal of the New York recruiters Gilbert-Tweed Associates. ''They want someone who understands the business implications of filling an order, who can communicate with design, with finance, with all the functions.'' **********Already, several companies - including Xerox, Ford, Kodak and Hewlett-Packard - form teams of people from production, engineering, marketing and design at the point that a product is conceived, and keep them together until the product hits the market. In some cases, they have moved engineers and designers to the factory floor. The result, they report, is fewer quality problems, and a speeded-up timetable for getting products to market. **********In part to foster a team approach, many companies are also adopting a small-is-better philosophy of expansion. All new facilities at G.E. Aircraft Engines are small satellite plants. ''We believe that if you limit a plant to 600 to 1,500 people, the management is closer to workers,'' said Brian H. Rowe, senior vice president. **********That is a crucial theme. Business experts insist that more important than new computers, modern plants or anything else that money can buy are systems that get management and labor on the same side. They cite as proof how much better Ford Motor, which has brought its workers into every step of its operations, is doing than General Motors, for all that company's investment in super-modern equipment. **********Companies that have delegated authority down the line report excellent results. Mr. Sigler says that at two of Champion's smoothest-running plants, workers - called members - belong to teams that do their own hiring and firing. TRW's Mr. Meyers has given small groups of employees at a few plants responsibility for maintaining their equipment and interacting with customers, and he says the increase in productivity and quality is ''tremendous.'' Other companies saw quality and productivity shoot up after they scheduled daily plant-wide meetings to discuss anything that went awry the prior day. **********But that sort of approach is not pervasive in American industry. L. Joseph Thomas, a professor at Cornell University's Johnson Graduate School of Management, visited a Japanese electronics company at which an employee who had made 220 unsolicited suggestions in five years was given an award. ''In most U.S. companies,'' he said, ''such a person would be viewed as a pain in the neck.'' **********Clearly, a lot more has to be done - a fact that executives are starting to come to grips with. **********As Mr. Roderick of USX put it: ''I don't hear anybody saying we got it all done, put the shovels away and let's go drink beer.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/26/world/as-truce-chances-developed-contras-built-private-channel-to-democrats.html": {"writer_name": "Susan Rasky", "pub_date": "1988-03-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 782, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "As Truce Chances Developed, Contras Built Private Channel to Democrats", "print_headline": "As Truce Chances Developed, Contras Built Private Channel to Democrats", "body_text": " **********In the weeks leading to the cease-fire agreement between the contras and the Nicaraguan Government, rebel leaders defied the Reagan Administration and opened a private channel of communication with the Speaker of the House, Jim Wright, and a handful of Democrats. **********Administration officials, still insisting that the Democrats abandoned the Nicaraguan rebels by refusing to approve President Reagan's aid request on Feb. 3, said today that Congressional Democrats were claiming credit for the cease-fire to save their political reputations. **********''The contras were bludgeoned into the cease-fire by the Democrats,'' an Administration official said. ''Jim Wright was talking to them more than any of us were.'' **********Recounting his consultations with the rebels, Mr. Wright said information from them was an important factor in shaping strategy for a Democratic plan for assistance to the contras and, more significantly, in persuading him to delay any action on an aid package during the Sandinista offensive last week against the rebels. **********Relying on signals from the contras and from contacts with the Sandinistas, the Speaker said, he became increasingly convinced that the two sides were serious about bargaining on a cease-fire despite the fighting along the Honduran border and that any attempt to renew aid could derail the negotiations. **********''On March 16, both sides started calling me to say they were going to pursue the peace talks at a high level,'' Mr. Wright, of Texas, said in an interview. ''A substantial part of my lay-low strategy was dictated by what I was hearing from Central America. I was led to believe that if we didn't rock the boat, there would be a chance for a cease-fire.'' **********The groundwork for Mr. Wright's discussions with contra and Sandinista representatives was laid last August, when the Speaker took on a prominent role as an proponent of the Central American peace initiative sponsored by President Oscar Arias Sanchez of Costa Rica. At that time, represenatives of the Sandinista Government initiated contacts with his staff and maintained those contacts through the fall and winter as Mr. Wright and the Administration battled over whether American aid to the rebels should include weapons. **********The Speaker was sharply criticized by the Administration for his high-profile involvement in arranging the initial round of truce talks and for meeting here last summer with representatives of the contras and the Nicaraguan Government. The Speaker defended his role and his continued contacts with the Central Americans, saying that without them during the last several weeks, ''I would have been flying blind.'' **********''I have no illusions about being Secretary of State,'' he said. ''I like the job I have. But if these people trust me, and I'm the only one who will see them, I'd like to think that having an open door may have made some difference.'' **********Although contra leaders have had close contacts with House Republicans and some House Democrats, including Mr. Wright, for several years, it was not until the House rejected President Reagan's request for weapons and ammunition for the rebels last month that members of the contra directorate began seriously seeking help from the Speaker and other Democrats in obtaining new aid. **********Referred by Representative Ike Skelton, Democrat of Missouri, Alfredo Cesar and Aristides Sanchez made one of their first lobbying calls on Representative Frank J. Guarini, Democrat of New Jersey, an opponent of military assistance but a consistent supporter of other forms of contra aid, such as food, clothes and medicines. **********''I spent about two and a half hours with them and they said they wanted to build a moderate consensus for humanitarian aid because they realized that lethal aid was now out of the question,'' Mr. Guarini recalled. **********Among other Democrats to whom Mr. Cesar and Mr. Sanchez made their case were Representatives John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, Jim Slattery of Kansas and Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma. **********After the defeat of the Democratic aid package March 3 and the reports last week of a Nicaraguan raid into Honduras in pursuit of the contras, there was a visit from Paul Reichler, an American attorney here who represents the Sandinistas, a House aide recalled.

CHARLES E. HUGEL, 60, who heads the committee, is chairman of RJR Nabisco and chairman and chief executive of Combustion Engineering Inc., based in Stamford, Conn. Mr. Hugel became chairman of Nabisco - a position with no day-to-day management responsibilities - in 1987. **********Mr. Hugel joined Combustion Engineering in 1984 after spending 30 years with the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, where he was executive vice president and an architect of the breakup. At the time of his arrival, Combustion Engineering's earnings and revenues were faltering as the oil industry stopped ordering new equipment because of lower oil prices. Mr. Hugel initiated a major restructuring to reduce the work force and to acquire service-related technology companies.  JOHN D. MACOMBER, 60, is chairman of Lasertechnics Inc., a manufacturer of industrial and medical laser systems based in Alburquerque, N.M. He is the former chairman and chief executive of the Hoechst Celanese Corporation, of Sommerville, N.J.

Adler Books, specializes in finding out-of-print children's books, a small but thriving niche in the bookselling business. A one-woman business run from a rural lane in Stockbridge Mass., Adler Books is one of the oldest and best-known companies in the field, attracting a clientele that ranges from collectors seeking rare first editions of ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' to yuppies who want their favorite Dr. Seuss for old time's sake. A diverse group, to be sure, but they have one thing in common: All are willing to pay from $10 to more than $1,000 for a book that might originally have sold for a quarter. **********''My customers essentially have sold themselves on my product before they contact me,'' said Mrs. Adler, who started her business on the dining room table of her Manhattan apartment nearly 20 years ago. **********The out-of-print children's book business, once the domain of women who were interested in a hobby rather than a source of income, is no longer one of the backwaters of bookselling. It is experiencing a surge in sales, fueled mainly by readers of middle age and beyond who are willing to pay big dollars for the little treasures of their childhoods, and by changes in the tax law and the devaluation of the dollar, which has lifted sales to foreign buyers. **********Rebecca Myers, associate publisher of AB Bookman's Weekly, the bible of the out-of-print book business, said demand and profitability in the so-called O.P. book field are on the rise. Changes in the ways publishers can compute depreciation of unsold stock, which stemmed from a 1980 Supreme Court ruling and which were codified in recent tax legislation, make it financially unattractive for publishers to warehouse slow-selling volumes. Publishers now push books out of print sooner than ever before. More than 200 million books are now out of print, according to industry estimates, and that supply is increasing at a fast pace. **********For booksellers specializing in the O.P. market, each of these books represents a potential sale. And Mrs. Adler and others in the children's O.P. market are benefiting from another factor as well: Children's books - and illustrators - have arrived in the grownup world of collecting. **********According to AB Bookman, business is thriving: At auctions in the last several years, collectors have forked over sums that have surprised even long-established dealers: A.A. Milne's manuscript for ''When We Were Young'' fetched $212,520 at Sotheby's in July 1986; Edward Lear's 1846 ''Book of Nonsense,'' brought $225,940 in August 1986; turn-of-the-century illustrators like Arthur Rackhman, Kate Greenaway and Beatrix Potter are commanding four-to-six-figure prices. **********A collectors' market has also developed for original drawings of prints by living illustrators. Until the last several years, these drawings almost always slipped unnoticed into the hands of art directors at magazines and publishing houses, Ms. Myers said. No more: Not since collectors became willing to pay handsomely - up to $10,000 at Sotheby's last fall - for illustrations by the likes of Maurice Sendak. The windfall has, in turn, inflated prices for the artist's published work. **********In Mrs. Adler's business, a book's price reflect its scarcity as well as its edition, but rare does not necessarily mean Gutenberg Bible-rare. Some of the most expensive books for the average collector are so-called 20th Century ''ephemeral'' books. Printed on cheap paper with flimsy covers, many did not survive their owners' childhoods and the few intact copies available - such as first editions of Margaret Wise Brown's ''Goodnight Moon,'' and a number of books in the Little Golden Books series - are prized. One of Mrs. Adler's most prized books was a rare first edition, first printing of L. Frank Baum's ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,'' the first work in the Oz series. Published in 1899 for about $1.50, the book commanded ''well over'' $1,000 when Mrs. Adler sold it several years ago. **********MRS. ADLER, who speaks with rapid precision and uses parentheses and tangents like Theodor Giesel on a caffeine jag, said about 15 percent of her business is in rare books. But about 70 percent, she said, comes from buyers looking to recapture something of their lost youth, to impart some wisdom to a younger generation, or just to put a child to sleep. **********Last year, she said, more than 400 people who read her classified advertisement in The New York Times Book Review availed themselves of her services. And her sales, she said, have been rising about 5 percent a year for the last five years. **********In Mrs. Adler's small office in her home, she keeps nearly 2,000 books. Because space is tight, she limits inventory to titles she expects will sell within a year. But she rarely receives requests for books she has on hand. More often, she hunts for them, a process that often takes from four to six weeks. **********She checks AB Bookman advertisements from other dealers and runs her own ads. When that fails, she puts titles on her perpetual shopping list, and looks for them in her travels or at estate sales. She pores through catalogues issued by other dealers, such as Helen Younger of Aleph-Bet Books in Valley Cottage, N.Y., or calls a favorite supplier, like Carol Docheff in Berkeley, Calif. **********Mrs. Adler says she locates only about half the books requested, and sells only half the books located, satisfying about 100 customers a year. She never gives up searching for a title, she said, but some - like first-edition James Thurbers, early Dr. Seuss classics and Mr. Sendak's ''Where the Wild Things Are'' - are impossible to find. ''Everybody,'' she said, ''wants them.''  TOMORROW'S TREASURES **********WHICH children's books are likely to appreciate with age? **********James Carey, co-owner of Books of Wonder, a Manhattan shop specializing in collectible children's books, said there were some sure bets. First-editions of anything by Maurice Sendak, Theodor Geisel (Dr. Seuss), Tasha Tudor and Shel Silverstein have skyrocketed in price, he said. Collectors are paying up to $35 for first-editions of Dr. Seuss's ''The Butter Battle Book,'' which cost $6.95 at first issue four years ago, Mr. Carey said. And he recently sold a first edition of ''The Cat in the Hat'' for $750. **********Among author-illustrators whom Mr. Carey believes collectors will value are Chris Van Allsburg (''The Z Was Zapped'') Chris Conover (''Simple Simon'') John Steptoe (''Musaro's Beautiful Daughters) Barry Moser (''Jump'') and Trina Schart Hyman (''St. George and the Dragon''). He also bets on authors William Sleator (''The Boy Who Reversed Himself'') and Lloyd Alexander (''The Illyrian Adventure''). **********''Anyone renowned who sells a lot when they first come out is a good indicator of future collectibility,'' he said. A Caldecott or Kate Greenaway award helps; so does preserving a book's original condition. He also suggests getting the book signed by the author and buying first editions. But that could be tricky: Many publishers did not indicate the edition on books printed before 1980."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/18/business/building-a-global-supermarket.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Greenhouse", "pub_date": "1988-11-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1631, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Building a Global Supermarket", "print_headline": "Building a Global Supermarket", "body_text": " **********When Hamish Maxwell, the chairman of Philip Morris, was orchestrating his company's takeover of Kraft Inc., he said one of the rationales for the huge merger was to create a colossus that could sell Cheez Whiz and Jell-O around the globe. **********The $13 billion takeover is the latest and most ambitious move in the food industry's drive to build the global supermarket - to sell the same products in grocery stores, bodegas, marches and supermercados. **********Coca-Cola - widely considered the most popular product in the world - Kellogg's Corn Flakes and Nescafe are already sold from Alabama to Zambia, and companies like Quaker Oats and Pillsbury and Philip Morris's Kraft and General Foods units hope to do the same with their own products. A Matter of Taste **********But food is a matter of taste and tradition, which makes the marketing of brands across national borders an unpredictable business. **********Many marketing executives say the trend toward the global supermarket has been fostered by - and is in turn fostering - a growing similarity in consumer tastes around the world. Such a convergence, business theorists say, is an inevitable result of the cross-fertilization of cultures, with people traveling more than ever and seeing many of the same movies and television serials. **********Yet food marketers are discovering that even with some convergence in consumer tastes, the differences, at least in food, continue to outweigh the similarities. Moussaka lovers in Greece might not run to buy Kraft's Philadelphia Cream Cheese while American grits lovers might shun microwaveable chicken tikka dinners from India. **********''The globalization of consumer goods markets has become quite trendy,'' said Ian Davis, a marketing expert in the London office of McKinsey & Company, the management consulting firm. ''Still, it is difficult to take a product that is successful in one country and transpose it into another.'' Economies Sought **********Industry analysts say food companies are starting to copy car, computer and consumer electronics manufacturers in developing a global strategy because they recognize that larger sales mean economies of scale in output and distribution. In addition, food companies see that operating globally can enable them to spend more on research and development to stay ahead of the competition. **********And like others before them, food companies find that the lessons they learn in marketing products in one country can help them in others. ''There are marketing advantages and manufacturing advantages in taking proven concepts, adapting them here and there and then repeating that success in several countries,'' said Kamran Kashani, a marketing professor at the Imede business school in Lausanne, Switzerland. **********Even so, it is remarkably difficult to discern any general rules for success in foreign markets. Industry executives are often puzzled why some products, like Coke, delight foreign consumers while others fail. Why, they ask, did Perrier, the French mineral water, become a sensation in the United States, while McVitie's Digestive Biscuits, Britain's most popular cookie, has not won the taste buds of Americans? New Product Ideas **********''On the whole, the reason that companies have been successful in going global - these would include Coca-Cola, Marlboro cigarettes, McDonald's hamburgers, Sony Walkmans -is that they have tended to take a new product idea rather than an old idea,'' said Mr. Davis of McKinsey. **********''Launching a soup or a biscuit or a cheese globally is not a new product idea and runs into established competition,'' Mr. Davis continued. ''McDonald's was a new way of retailing food. Coke had a new concept in soft drinks.'' **********But sometimes foreign markets do not embrace ''new'' ideas either. Campbell's Soup stumbled in Brazil because canned soup - new to Brazil - was found distasteful. When some American companies introduced soft cookies in Britain, they failed to catch on because the British much prefer hard cookies. **********Even highly successful global marketers often fall before local competition. Nestle S.A., the Swiss giant, failed to grab a large chunk of Japan's chocolate market because of entrenched domestic competitors. Similarly, France's Chambourcy yogurt, popular in several foreign markets, encountered so much competition in test-marketing in the United States that it withdrew. Catering to Local Tastes **********The companies that are most sensitive to local tastes seem to do best around the globe. Nestle, for instance, produces more than 200 blends of Nescafe to cater to the preferences of different markets. The blends result from extensive taste testing. To please the French, the special sauce on McDonald's Big Macs served in Paris is less sugary and has more of a mustard taste than the special sauce served in the United States. **********Sometimes, success is more a matter of image than taste. Heineken has decided that the best way to sell its beer in the United States is as a premium brand, cashing in on the cachet of imported beer. To crack the British market, however, it decided that the most effective approach was to sell itself as a proletarian beer, and it has been successful. **********''The great global marketers are really more talented at local marketing than global marketing,'' said James Schroer, a consumer goods expert with Booz Allen & Hamilton, the management consulting firm. Europeans Found Ahead **********Notwithstanding the success of Coca-Cola and McDonald's, industry analysts say that European consumer goods companies, like Unilever and Nestle, are generally ahead of American companies in going global. French and German food concerns have long sold their products in Spain and Italy - and European companies are pushing harder than ever to expand across borders to take advantage of the economies that a barrier-free Europe will bring at the end of 1992. **********The Europeans' experience in global marketing could give Philip Morris problems as it seeks to expand its Kraft and General Food lines abroad. Nevertheless, industry analysts say that the combined might of the two units might give them not only more economies of scale, but also more power to gain entrance into supermarkets from Spain to Singapore. **********''Many non-American firms were forced to break out of their small home markets, and many thought it was essential to get into the large American market,'' said Kenneth Simmonds, a marketing professor at the London Business School. ''American companies have often just stayed in the large American market and have not learned how to go into other markets.'' **********Industry analysts say it is not surprising that many American marketers, accustomed to selling a uniform product to the nation's 240 million people, might not see the importance of tailoring their marketing strategies and products to the tastes of other lands. **********''The attitude of U.S. companies would be to act in Senegal or Chile as if those countries were an extension of their home market, whereas Nestle, with its small home base in Switzerland, recognizes it has to adapt the product to the tastes of other countries,'' said James Biggar, president of Nestle Enterprises, one of the Swiss company's two main American operating units. The Addition of an Egg **********Betty Crocker cake mixes offer an example of adapting to local tastes. They flopped in Britain because the English balked at baking a cake without having to even add eggs - they were dismayed that their contribution was so minimal. But when the cake mixes were reformulated to require the addition of an egg, Britain embraced Betty Crocker. **********Food executives and business school professors say there is a conflict between the impulse to adapt products to local markets as a way of expanding sales and the desire to standardize products as much as possiblbe to achieve longer production runs and greater economies of scale. **********Ted Levitt, editor of the Harvard Business Review and a leading spokesman for the importance of global marketing, sees what he calls a ''pluralization of consumption,'' in which people's tastes are moving closer together in some areas at the same time that regional preferences remain strong. **********David Weinstein, a marketing professor at the Insead Business School in Fontainebleau, outside Paris, predicts that tastes around the world will ultimately converge even more, which will allow manufacturers to further standardize their products. This development, he said, would result in part from consumer goods companies marketing their products more and more on an international basis and from increased travel and improved telecommunications. **********''If the world continues to converge, eventually you might even get tastes that are similar,'' Professor Weinstein said. ''People used to say that the French would never eat McDonald's hamburgers. Now they appreciate them in the same way as Americans do. So tastes do change across cultures.''

Retailers, fearful that consumers might have been made cautious by the October stock market plunge, had started heavy price-cutting even before the 29-day season began and the discounts helped stimulate business. Sears Reports Gains **********The nation's largest retailer, Sears, Roebuck & Company, said its sales rose 4.9 percent above those of December 1986, while sales during the 48-week period were up 3.3 percent. **********The K Mart Corporation, the second-largest retailer, reported 8 percent higher sales in December against a 7.7 percent increase in the longer period. The J. C. Penney Company, the third-biggest, said its sales increased 8.6 percent in December and 5.7 percent in the retailing year that begins on Feb. 1. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the fourth-largest, had a 34 percent rise for both the month and the year. **********Federated Department Stores Inc., the largest of the full-line department store chains, had a 5.2 percent gain in December while its annual sales so far were up 6.1 percent. Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc., reported a 3.1 percent monthly increase and a 3.8 percent gain for the 48 weeks. The Limited Inc. had 7 percent higher sales in December but its 11-month sales were up 13 percent. 'Retailers Got Off Easily' **********''Retailers got off easily considering what happened in October when the stock market collapsed,'' said Fabian Linden, director of the Conference Board Consumer Research Center. If the Oct. 19 market collapse had happened on Dec. 19, he said, it would have resulted in a disastrous season. **********''As it was, consumers had enough time to recover from the shock.'' But, even if there had been no market plunge, Mr. Linden said, ''We would have had a lackluster Christmas season because gains in consumer spending had exceeded the increase in personal income for 18 months.'' **********Comments by leading retail executives demonstrated the sharp effect of price-cutting. At Sears, Roebuck, Michael Bozic, chairman of the Merchandising Group, said, ''December sales nearly matched our expectations despite the most competitive Christmas season in history.'' 'Competitive' Environment **********At J. C. Penney, William R. Howell, the chairman, observed, ''While sales were strong, the retail environment became increasingly competitive, adversely affecting gross margin. While the quality of Christmas business was not up to our expectations, net income for the nine-week November-December period this year did equal that recorded in 1986.'' **********Analysts said that a weak apparel business was a prime reason for the mixed results. ''There was significant variance in results, with specialty apparel retailers continuing to report sluggish sales while many of the major mass merchandisers and department stores did somewhat better,'' Jeffrey M. Feiner of Merrill Lynch & Company said. **********Generally, sales at comparable stores, those at least a year old, held up well, although there were some exceptions. The Dayton Hudson Corporation, for example, had a 19.1 percent total sales rise in December, but said its comparable-store sales were up only 1.4 percent. And Charming Shoppes Inc., one of the country's largest chains of women's apparel shops, had 11 percent higher sales over all but a 6 percent decline in comparable stores. **********Following is a list of retailer sales for the five weeks ended Jan. 2 and the year-to-date period:  Sears, Roebuck, $4.11 billion in December, up from $3.92 billion.

Manuel Antonio Noriega and his censors. **********Broadcasting from Fort Clayton in the former Panama Canal Zone, the Southern Command Network offers a steady stream of news here for the 10,000 American soldiers stationed in Panama. Its presence is protected by the Panama Canal Treaties of 1977, and General Noriega's Panama Defense Forces have been unable to control its programming and power supply or intimidate its employees. **********Officially, the main mission of SCN, as the network is widely known, is to ''distribute command information of professional interest to American soldiers,'' said Col. Ronald Sconyers, Director of Public Affairs for the Southern Command. **********But for many Panamanians, SCN provides a welcome alternative to the increasingly strident propaganda being transmitted in the Government-controlled press as the country's 10-month political and economic crisis deepens. Though the network broadcasts no programs in Spanish, 85 years of an American presence here guarantee it a substantial audience of English-speaking Panamanians. Carries Major U.S. Networks **********''Government radio distorts everything and turns it backward,'' said Juan Sanchez, a cab driver whose radio is constantly tuned to SCN's AM station. ''Not everybody understands English, of course, but I translate for them so they can know what is really happening.'' **********The network broadcasts the nightly reports of both NBC News and ABC News and carries Cable News Network reports on its own twice-daily local news programs. Hourly news reports from the network, wire services and National Public Radio are also broadcast by the network's radio arm here and in Colon, a major port on the Atlantic coast. **********So when dockworkers throughout Panama stopped work March 14, after the Government was unable to pay them, and the official news organizations largely ignored the strike or attacked the workers as unpatriotic, they and other Panamanians were able to turn to SCN to learn the results of the work stoppage. **********When civil disturbances after a coup attempt cut off electricity throughout the capital March 16, knocking Panamanian radio and television stations off the air, SCN continued to broadcast news and advisories of which parts of the city should be avoided because of the unrest. United States Government agencies in the former Canal Zone have their own electrical, telephone and water systems. **********On Sunday morning, viewers hoping to avoid the military's weekly ''Todo por La Patria'' program, 90 minutes of adulation of General Noriega and his associates,had the option of switching to the NBC News program ''Meet the Press.'' There they heard Secretary of State George P. Shultz reiterate American demands that General Noriega end the crisis here by relinquishing power. Diplomatic Channel of Sorts **********Among diplomats, the Panamanian political opposition and foreign reporters here, there is a widespread conviction that SCN can also indirectly channel messages from Washington to Panamanians. As the crisis has intensified in recent weeks, the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, Elliott Abrams, has become a regular on CNN, commenting on and analyzing events here. **********''Elliott Abrams goes on the air and says what he has to say for whoever happens to be listening, wherever they happen to be,'' a diplomat said. **********When an American general stationed here, Marc Cisneros, appeared on NBC News a few days ago, it was widely assumed that he was transmitting a message to the Panama Defense Forces. In a brief statement, General Cisneros suggested that the Panamanian military would have a role to play in Panamanian national life even after General Noriega left power. **********Colonel Sconyers said that SCN ''never intentionally programs anything for a Panamanian shadow audience.'' But he said he recognized that the NBC News report could be interpreted as an invitation ''to reach out and touch someone in Panama.'' Window to Outside World **********The network has traditionally been a window on the outside world. Rod Carew, the former Minnesota Twins infielder, who was born here, has said he first dreamed of playing in the major leagues while listening to baseball games on SCN radio. **********Other Panamanians simply like the mix of situation comedies and soap operas the television broadcasts. Entertainment programming includes ''General Hospital,'' ''Ask Dr. Ruth,'' ''Wheel of Fortune'' and ''Kate and Allie.'' **********But the network's importance as a source of information has been underlined in recent weeks as the military has tightened its grip on the flow of news.

The Dow Jones industrials fell 101.46 points. **********Instead of declining, as the markets had been led to expect, the United States trade deficit climbed to $13.83 billion, from $12.44 billion in January. As is customary when disturbing trade figures are announced, the Government warned the markets not to pay attention to one month's numbers, especially since they are not adjusted for seasonal factors - a caveat usually omitted when the trade figures are better than expected. **********Even granting the imperfection of the data, however, the new figures are worrisome. While exports rose by 5.5 percent, to $23.56 billion in February, imports surged even more, climbing by 7.5 percent, to $37.39 billion for the month. The implication is that the American economy is growing too fast, the trade position and the dollar are weakening, and the Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates. All that is a reading that Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d resists; he does not want what he apparently would regard as a premature tightening of money. **********But whether the Fed tightens or not, the credit markets, worrying about inflation, are likely to raise rates. ''Signs of a robust economy have led investors to discard their recessionary glasses and begin to view the world through inflationary ones,'' said Robert J. Genetski, senior vice president and chief economist of the Harris Bank in Chicago. ''Markets are about to experience a replay of the pressures of last spring and summer.'' **********Those pressures on rates caused the stock market to peak in August and crash in October; the catalyst for the crash was a disappointing trade report and a statement by Secretary Baker suggesting that the United States would not move to counter a falling dollar. **********Long-term rates are already moving up. If the Fed reacts promptly and raises short-term interest rates sufficiently, Mr. Genetski maintains, the markets will see that it is serious about stopping inflation and long-term rates will decline. ''However,'' he adds, ''if the Fed hesitates in raising short-term rates or fails to raise them enough (as was the case in the spring of 1987), then markets are likely to be pummeled by the same psychological forces that drove interest rates to extremes in 1984 and again in 1987.'' **********The process by which weakening confidence in the dollar lifts interest rates and depresses securities prices is now well recognized and feared in the financial markets. It is an automatic process that does not depend on Fed action to tighten credit. **********The Fed may try to resist the rise in short-term rates by injecting more reserves into the banking system, but if it does so, the results may be perverse: It may aggravate the market's fears of inflation, raise long-term interest rates and drive down bond and stock prices. This could, in turn, further weaken confidence in the dollar and give the entire process another turn of the screw. **********Having seen such a frightening scenario acted out last summer and fall, will the United States Government do it again? It seems unlikely. The desire to hold interest rates down and keep the economy expanding in an election year is a factor in Administration thinking, but the danger of another perverse reaction by the markets is bound to be an inhibition on Administration pressure to get the Fed to open the money tap. **********In addition, the Administration and the Fed, at this week's Group of Seven meeting in Washington, recommitted themselves to the defense of the dollar. The sudden and alarming reaction of the foreign exchange, stock and bond markets to the poor trade figures caused the Fed and other central banks to intervene boldly to support the dollar. **********But central bank intervention, important as it may have been to head off a worse plunge or even a panic, cannot, over the longer haul, stabilize the dollar or shrink the United States trade deficit without the backup of monetary and fiscal policy. **********It would be unrealistic to expect Congress and the Administration to do anything significant on the budgetary or tax fronts in this election year that would slow the economy down. There would certainly be arguments that the economy is not moving too fast and unemployment is still too high. **********Hence, it becomes overwhelmingly the problem of the Fed to reassure the markets on trade and the dollar and to calm inflationary expectations. The Fed is paying increasing attention to sensitive commodity prices, the spread between short- and long-term interest rates and the international value of the dollar in making its decisions on money and credit. **********And Secretary Baker, at the Group of Seven meeting, reinforced his earlier case for using a commodity index, including oil and gold, as a guide for policies to stabilize currencies. When commodity prices are falling, this policy would presumably require the United States to aim at lower interest rates, and when commodity prices are rising, the Fed would presumably raise rates. Right now, to head off inflation and safeguard the dollar, it looks as though the Fed will raise rates. **********If it fails to act, the markets will do its work for it, perhaps brutally.

Only 43 percent voted for the Conservatives. **********The opposition's warnings took on new life within 48 hours of Monday's voting when Gillette Canada Inc. announced that it would be closing its two plants in Canada, eliminating 600 jobs, and supplying the Canadian market primarily from plants in the United States that have an underutilized capacity. **********Although the Boston-based Gillette Company said that its decision was part of a worldwide restructuring and had nothing to do with the free-trade pact, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and several of his top ministers moved immediately to limit the political damage. **********First, the Government reaffirmed its promise to provide ''generous'' readjustment and retraining programs for those who lose their jobs. And on Thursday night, at a $340-a-plate dinner in Toronto that the country's business elite held to thank Mr. Mulroney for winning the free-trade fight, the Prime Minister pressed home his vision of a vibrant Canada that was fully able to hold its own in open competition with the United States. **********''This Canada of ours is not defined by the size or might of our neighbor, the United States,'' Mr. Mulroney said, to strong applause. ''We are our own people, as talented and as skillfull and as successful as any on earth.'' **********In two bitter months of electioneering, the Government's political opponents had asserted that ratification of the trade deal could strip the country of many of its two million manufacturing jobs. John Turner, the opposition leader who led what he described as a ''crusade'' against the pact, asserted that the removal of tariffs and other economic barriers between the two countries would cause large numbers of companies, both Canadian- and American-owned, to transfer their manufacturing operations to lower-cost plants in the United States. **********To Donna Williams, one of the 600 Gillette employees who will lose their jobs, the announcement that the company's plants in Montreal and Toronto are to be closed within 18 months seemed like a confirmation of Mr. Turner's darkest warnings. ''I guess we're the first victims of the free-trade deal,'' she said. Canadian Dollar a Factor **********Many Canadian economists say it is impossible to predict how the country will fare under the free-trade agreement, which is scheduled to be phased in over a 10-year period from Jan. 1. Among other things, they say, the country's success in maintaining a healthy industrial sector depends heavily on what happens to the Canadian dollar, which has been edging up lately from its low of 69 cents (United States) three years ago to a close today of 83.94 cents, its highest level in seven years. This week alone, on the strength of the Conservatives' re-election, the currency jumped nearly 3 cents. **********In a study earlier this year, the Economic Council of Canada, a Government-appointed body, noted that the gains for Canadian exporters from the elimination of all remaining United States tariffs by 1998 have been more than offset by the rapid appreciation of the Canadian dollar. While the free-trade pact will lower Canadian export prices by eliminating American tariffs that average 7 percent on the 20 percent of Canadian exports that are still subject to duties, the Canadian dollar has increased against the United States dollar by 12 1/2 percent since January 1987. **********The dollar's rise has caused serious apprehension in the business community, causing some strong backers of the trade pact to have qualms. **********''Much of my optimism is conditioned on what happens to the dollar,'' said Dennis DesRosiers, Canada's leading auto industry analyst. Mr. DesRosiers, president of DesRosiers Automotive Research Ltd. of Toronto, has predicted a boom under the trade pact that could have Canada producing 25 percent of all the cars made in North America by the mid-1990's, up from 15 percent now. **********He added, ''A lot of the good things we have going for us begin to disappear with a 90-cent dollar.'' Output for Continental Market **********The Economic Council's view, set forth in two major studies earlier this year, was that Canada could gain as many as 251,000 jobs over the 10-year phase-in of the pact if Canadian industries reacted successfully to increased American competition, notably by ''rationalizing'' production to suit a continental market and by taking other steps to increase productivity. **********In one study, ''Managing Adjustment,'' the council predicted that 29 of the 36 Canadian industries it studied, and 13 of 20 in the manufacturing sector, would benefit from free trade. **********The biggest gainer would be the service industries, it predicted, with a net gain of 182,000 jobs; followed by retailing with 60,000; finance, insurance and real estate with 30,000, and business services, with 20,000. In the manufacturing field, the council saw a more balanced outcome, with 95,000 jobs gained and 76,000 lost, for a net gain of 19,000 jobs over the 10 years. This part of the forecast, in particular, attracted mockery during the election from the opposition, which noted that Canadian manufacuters had been creating an average of 20,000 additional jobs a year without free trade. **********While economists differ about free trade's overall impact, there is more agreement about industries that stand to gain, and those that will likely lose. In the Economic Council's reckoning, the big losers are likely to be electrical products, an industry that has more than 1,000 plants in Canada, and a range of other low-technology industries in which Canada's relatively high labor costs are likely to be a handicap. **********These include rubber and plastics, textiles and leather goods. The council predicted that agriculture, printing and publishing, food and beverages, and primary metals would be among the big gainers.  PROJECTED CHANGES IN CANADIAN EMPLOYMENT  Estimated job gains and losses in Canada as a result of the free trade agreement with the United States by 1998, when all provisions will be fully phased in. In all sectors, a total of 439,100 jobs is expected to be created and 187,800 lost for a net gain of 251,300 jobs.

It was Mr. Gandhi's first visit to Punjab in almost four years. **********In this little town on the Beas River founded by a Sikh religious leader in the 15th century, the Prime Minister asked his Punjabi audience not to mix religion and politics. He was talking about militant Sikh separatists whose armed gangs began the spiral of terror and economic depression that debilitated villages in Amritsar district and other areas of the state. **********Almost 2,000 people have died in Punjab since January. On Monday, the head of a Hindu-based opposition party in the state, which is under emergency rule and has no elected legislature, was assassinated in the state capital, Chandigarh. **********But Sikh separatism is no longer Punjab's only problem, residents of Amritsar and the villages around it say. Unchecked violence has permeated all sects and communities, and guns are everywhere. Armed Men on the Roofs **********Punjabi violence has also changed the way an Indian Prime Minister lives and works. **********In a country where politicians traditionally mix with crowds and are daily besieged by favor-seekers, Mr. Gandhi was today the focus of a security operation involving tens of thousands of troops, police officers and explosives experts. **********In Goindwal, where armed men stood on every roof, the Prime Minister never came close to the people he had come to reassure. **********Speaking to a largely impassive and unenthusiastic audience that had been carefully selected and screened, he wore a bullet-proof vest, stood in a bullet-proof enclosure more than 12 feet above the ground and was separated from the crowd by 20 to 30 yards of no man's land guarded by police officers. **********Mr. Gandhi told the crowd, which clapped on cue from a pair of hands that would appear from time to time over the Prime Minister's head, that there might soon be local elections in Punjab that would give people more control over their own affairs. Armed Gangs in Control **********Punjabis, especially in Amritsar district, know how far they are from this goal, elections or not. They tell of orders from armed gangs who dictate what kind of school uniforms children should wear, what kind of pets people can keep - no dogs, because they bark and warn of intruders - and whether people may own television sets. **********''The credibility of the Government in Delhi is on a steady downward slope,'' the state's leading newspaper, The Tribune, wrote in an editorial today, ''and there is not much that the Prime Minister can offer at today's gatherings in Punjab which could dramatically reverse the tide of cynicism, disbelief and desperation.'' **********Mr. Gandhi had come to Goindwal, where both Sikhs and Hindus have had their lives disrupted by terrorism, to lay the foundation stone of a newsprint factory designed to utilize the residue of crops raised on the Punjab's rich farmlands: sugar cane bagasse and rice straw and husks. The factory, in a new industrial park, will create 20,000 jobs, officials say. **********After leaving Goindwal, Mr. Gandhi went to Jalandhar, where he addressed a Congress Party rally. Later in the day he visited Jaito, near Bhatinda, where 65 years ago his grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, was paraded through the streets in handcuffs after his arrest for defying a British colonial order. Meeting the People **********At the end of the day, Mr. Gandhi finally broke away from his security cordon to meet local people. The Bhatinda area has been relatively quiet and free of violence. **********The Prime Minister's visit to Punjab is the highlight of a week of announcements intended to bolster the Government's image in the state. On Monday, New Delhi approved a project that will bring Pepsico to India to build bottling and food-processing plants in Punjab in a partnership with Indian companies. **********On Tuesday night, the Government ordered the release of 138 detainees held since 1984 when Indian troops stormed the Golden Temple in Amritsar to dislodge Sikh extremists. **********The storming of the Golden Temple, the holiest shrine of the Sikh religion, enraged many Sikhs and ultimately led to the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by Sikh bodyguards. Sikh Areas Attacked **********After her death, Sikh neighborhoods in New Delhi and elsewhere in India where the Sikhs are strong in commerce and industry were attacked by mobs. Many Sikhs died and millions of dollars in Sikh-owned property was destroyed. **********Even moderate Sikh leaders say they believe those attacks were politically motivated, and a commission named three officials in the Gandhi Government as instigators of the anti-Sikh crowds. None have been punished. **********One of the three, Jagdish Tytler, was subsequently made Minister of Food Processing and as such made the announcement Monday of the Pepsico agreement. This was not lost on Punjabis, Sikh, Hindu or Moslem."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/03/business/dow-up-829-after-listless-trading.html": {"writer_name": "Lawrence Demaria", "pub_date": "1988-02-03", "snippet": "LEAD: After a day of listless trading, stock prices turned higher yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing at 1,952.92, up 8.29 points.", "word_count": 655, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dow Up 8.29 After Listless Trading", "print_headline": "Dow Up 8.29 After Listless Trading", "body_text": " **********LEAD: After a day of listless trading, stock prices turned higher yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing at 1,952.92, up 8.29 points. **********After a day of listless trading, stock prices turned higher yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing at 1,952.92, up 8.29 points. **********Investors wrestled with the implications of the latest economic news -that the economy was slowing down, which is normally bad for stock prices, and that interest rates were continuing to fall. Lower yields on bonds can make stocks more attractive. **********Even the news that several major banks had lowered their prime lending rates did not invigorate the stock market. Takeover stories continued to provide the only excitement in a market that some traders said had fallen into a lull.Shaken by Economic News **********In the morning, Wall Street was somewhat shaken by news from the Commerce Department that its index of leading economic indicators was down in December for the third month in a row, and that sales of new homes fell for the second consecutive month. **********Analysts noted that since World War II, every recession has been preceeded by at least three straight monthly declines in the index of leading indicators. But they also pointed out that on four occasions only a milder economic slowdown followed such a three-month decline. **********Some traders said the cut in the prime lending rate, which banks charge to their most creditworthy customers, might have hurt stock prices, because investors might see falling rates as a sign of an economic slowdown. ''The market doesn't like the prime rate cut because the market is discounting a recession,'' one trader said. **********An economic slowdown could hurt stocks because corporate profits would presumably suffer. On the other hand, some traders noted, it could also allow the Federal Reserve to ease its credit policy.Late Rally in Stocks and Bonds **********Later in the day, when it became apparent that the Treasury's $9.25 billion sale of new three-year notes went well, and interest rates fell further, bond and stock prices rose. **********Yesterday, the New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.28, to 143.61, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 0.53, to 255.57. On the Big Board, 856 stocks rose and 673 fell. Volume was 164.9 million, down from Monday's 210.7 million. **********Among individual issues, First Boston fell 1 7/8, to 24 3/8, after Joseph R. Perella and Bruce Wasserstein, the co-heads of investment banking there, resigned to start a merchant banking firm. Other investment firms moved higher: Bear, Stearns jumped 1 1/4, to 13 1/8, and Shearson Lehman Hutton 1 3/8, to 38 3/4. **********But the ailing L.F. Rothschild sagged, losing 7/8, to 2 1/2. Federated Department Stores also fell 2 1/2, to 51 1/4. First Boston is adviser to the Campeau Corporation, the Toronto company that is seeking Federated. Traders said the changes at First Boston could affect Campeau's ability to complete its financing. **********The Nasdaq index of over-the-counter trading edged higher, closing at 347.19, up 0.99. The American Stock Exchange's market-value index closed at 270.14, up 0.41.More Trading in Secondary Issues **********In recent days, secondary stocks have traded relatively more strongly than the blue chips, leading some analysts to suggest that investors, wary of index arbitrage and other forms of program trading that often affect the larger stocks, may be switching emphasis. **********In a letter to clients, William M. LeFevre, an analyst at Advest Inc., contended that program trading ''turns stocks into commodities, with price patterns to match.'' As a result, he said, ''Secondary stocks, not encumbered by the potential of being included in a computerized trading program, may outperform those big blue-chip stocks favored by institutions and included in buy-and-sell programs.'' **********In Tokyo, the 225-share Nikkei index fell 60.11 points to close at 23,672.21. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index lost 59.77 points, closing at 2,298.50. **********In London, The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was fell 2.5 points, to 1,774.4."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/15/world/the-un-today.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-07-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 34, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The U.N.

''Tomorrow will be less like today, because we are seeing a transfer of power from politics to science.'' **********''The century of a scientific and technical leap forward was also that of the camps and bestialities, the century of Auschwitz and penicillin, where one saw, where one sees, doctors torture.'' **********''Century of the green revolution and the brown shirts,'' he continued, ''of the conquest of the cosmos and the desertification of the earth, where life expectancy has doubled in the industrialized countries while genocides and fanaticisms of all kinds have redoubled.'' **********Mr. Wiesel, a longtime friend of the French President, had the idea for the conference shortly after he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986. The Rumanian-born author and educator survived Auschwitz and Buchenwald and has written and lectured at length about the Holocaust. **********''It is a question of saving humanity - or at least our humanity,'' Mr. Wiesel told his fellow laureates. ''We are all on a train that is running toward a precipice. We cannot change trains, so we have to slow it down.'' **********''Man defines himself,'' Mr. Wiesel said, speaking in French, ''not only by his thirst for truth but by his sense of responsibility.

Henry A. Kissinger, who shared the peace prize in 1973 with Le Duc Tho of Vietnam, said they would have ''an important symbolic meaning'' while Willy Brandt, the former West German Chancellor and also a peace prize winner, said they might stir ''useful excitement.'' **********But at a reception this afternoon, two American laureates, Julian Schwinger and Sheldon L. Glashow, bantered irreverently about the conference, suggesting they should all wear T-shirts saying ''Nobel'' on them.

'International Effort' **********Speaking for Turkey, Foreign Minister A. Mesut Yilmaz said ''a major international effort'' would be needed to rebuild Afghanistan. Praising efforts by Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, a longtime United nations official who is coordinating international relief and resettlement efforts in Afghanistan, Mr. Yilmaz offered Turkey's aid after ''the establishment of a representative Government'' in Afghanistan. **********Mr. Yilmaz joined a host of foreign leaders and envoys in speaking during the first week of meetings of the 43d United Nations General Assembly. **********Welcoming the new round of talks between Turkish and Greek Cypriots, Mr. Yilmaz said he hoped that those talks would be the start of an accord in Cyprus with ''a bicommunal, bizonal federation, based on the political equality of the two peoples of the island.'' **********The Foreign Minister of Albania, Reis Malile, also spoke of the Afghan accords, questioning how the United States and the Soviet Union could be guarantors of the Geneva agreements when ''they continue to support and incite the opposing parties.'' **********Proclaiming Albania's ''totally independent policy outside blocs,'' Mr. Malile expressed his Government's wish to cooperate with other nations. He said such efforts must be ''equal, mutually beneficial, and should not infringe on the sovereignty of each country and its social system.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/18/world/fiji-halts-a-security-decree.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-11-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 89, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fiji Halts a Security Decree", "print_headline": "Fiji Halts a Security Decree", "body_text": " **********The Government lifted laws today that had given the military and the police wide powers of arrest and limited press and personal freedoms.

Mapes, president of the NBC Television Network, and James Sefert, chairman of the NBC Affiliates Board. **********The three networks have historically paid local stations millions of dollars for carrying network programming. But the networks' audience is shrinking as viewers seek alternatives, including programming from independent stations and cable networks. As a result, advertisers are spending more dollars outside the networks, which in turn have begun to pressure the affiliates to renegotiate the formulas by which they are compensated. Several Proposals **********At a meeting last Wednesday at its headquarters in New York, NBC made several proposals to the affiliates, according to the memo, including changes in compensation. An NBC executive close to the negotiations who asked not to be identified said the network also proposed ''inventory swaps,'' in which the stations would give back advertising time on the ''Today'' and ''Tonight'' shows in return for slots in prime time. Such an exchange would mean higher revenue for the network, which commands greater advertising rates for the late-night slots, without costing the stations anything, the executive said. **********Time for special telecasts like sporting events was not discussed at the meeting. **********Station compensation will be the thorniest issue for the network and the affiliates. NBC currently dispenses $145 million a year to its affiliates. The network has proposed a reduction in that figure - how large could not be determined. ''We wish the marketplace hadn't changed,'' the NBC executive said. ''But a change is going to have to come.'' **********Compensation levels are based on market factors in each affiliate city. For years NBC paid higher sums to stations that threatened to join first-place ABC. That situation turned around during recent seasons, when NBC became the No. 1 network, winning the November ratings sweep for the fourth consecutive time - an unprecedented feat. The Situation at CBS and ABC **********CBS pays slightly more than $160 million annually to its affiliates, according to a CBS executive. CBS executives would not discuss their network's plans on changes in compensation. ABC, which has been rebuilding its network in recent years, pays out $120 million, and it has just been instructed to cut that amount by about 6 percent. **********Neither Mr. Mapes nor Mr. Sefert was available for comment over the weekend. However, the general managers are expected to respond to the NBC proposal before a meeting of the affiliates scheduled for Jan. 8-11. **********The NBC stations have been girding for the NBC move for some time, and there were few surprises, some general managers said. ''The affiliates are obviously concerned at all three networks,'' C. E. Cooney, the vice president and general manager of KPNX-TV in Phoenix, said Friday.

About $500 Million Spent **********Mr. Pebereau, through a small financial company called Marceau Investissements, has acquired 10.5 percent of Societe Generale, spending about $500 million. Because a third of the money came from Caisse des Depots et Consignations, a state-controlled investment and savings bank, there is a belief that he has Government support and that there is an intention to put control of the bank back in the hands of friends of the Socialist Government. **********Founded in 1864, Societe Generale was one of three banks nationalized in 1945. In 1982 Socialist President Francois Mitterrand nationalized most of the remaining commercial banks and further strengthened governmental control of banking in 1984. **********But in 1987 the Conservative Government of Prime Minister Jacques Chirac privatized Societe Generale as part of its plan to sell parts of 65 state-owned companies to the public. At that time about 60 percent of Societe Generale's shares were bought by independent and foreign investors and about 30 percent remained in the hands of a group of investors handpicked by Mr. Chirac. Multifaceted Operations **********The appeal of Societe Generale is its multifaceted operations. It has more than 2,000 branches in France and caters to 3.5 million private customers and 300,000 businesses. It also has offices in 62 countries. Its substantial operations in the United States include a 23.15 percent stake in the European American Bank, the successor of the Franklin National Bank in New York, and a 50 percent holding in the Sogen Securities Corporation stock-brokerage firm. **********The bank's policies have changed little since it was privatized, but Marc Vienot, the bank's chairman, said, ''Our growth prospects are considerably improved, as we will be able to raise new capital when and as market conditions permit.'' For the first half of 1988, profits rose 22.6 percent, to $283 million. **********When the Socialist Government regained power this year, it vowed it would not interfere with companies privatized under Mr. Chirac. But the Socialists have criticized the ''noyaux durs,'' or ''hard core,'' groups of investors chosen by the Chirac Government. **********In behind-the-scenes maneurvers the Socialists have already managed to break up one such core at Havas, an advertising, publishing and travel group, and Societe Generale appears next on the agenda. Denial by Government **********In November the newspaper Le Monde reported that the Government had asked three major state-controlled insurance companies to support Mr. Pebereau's bid. But Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy has gone out of his way to deny that there is any governmental involvement in Mr. Pebereau's dealings. **********In addition to the political aspects of the battle, Mr. Pebereau's moves highlight the fact that even multibillion-dollar banks are not safe from capital restructuring amid the merger and acquisition frenzy that is sweeping Europe as it prepares for 1992, when many trade barriers will be lifted. **********''Everything is going to move; I don't know how, but it will move,'' Mr. Pebereau said, adding that he expected Japanese and United States investors to be major players in the future. **********Mr. Pebereau decided to invest in Societe Generale precisely because of its strong international presence. Besides its stakes in Sogen Securities and the European American Bank in the United States, it operates offices in Houston, Los Angeles and Chicago offering a variety of business services, including investment banking and securities trading through two principal subsidiaries, SG North America and SG International Inc. 'Best-Placed French Bank' **********The bank has had offices in Britain and Germany for more than 100 years and is currently strengthening its presence in Spain and Italy. ''It is the best-placed French bank to take advantage of change because it is privatized, and because it has good people at all levels and good products,'' Mr. Pebereau said. **********Mr. Pebereau first approached Societe Generale to form a joint leveraged buyout venture with his Marceau Investissements more than a year ago. After he was nudged out as president and chief executive officer of Compagnie Generale d'Electricite by the Chirac Government, but kept on as a board member, Mr. Pebereau found a willing core of investors of his own for his new company, including such powerful old-line French business executives as Gustave Leven, president of Source Perrier, and Jean-Louis Descours, president of Chaussures Andre. **********When the discussions with Societe Generale stalled, Mr. Pebereau secretly started buying shares in the bank. ''It is a business investment, a hommage to the bank,'' he explained. ''We don't want to be part of management but as the largest stockholder we want to play a role.'' **********The two sides are holding negotiations though neither appears prepared to change important positions. Societe Generale wants Caisse des Depots out of the picture and Marceau Investissements to lower its stake to 4 percent. But Mr. Pebereau has different ideas. ''If we can't talk to the management, we will talk to the shareholders,'' he said. Talking With Emissaries **********For its part Societe Generale has mentioned plans to restructure its shares as a defensive measure and though it is talking with emissaries from Mr. Pebereau, it denies there is any capitulation. Societe Generale's Mr. Thibout said, ''We hold to our position.'' **********Mr. Pebereau joined Compagnie Generale d'Electricite in 1968 after a career in the civil service where he was associated with four different public utilities ministers. **********From 1984 to 1986 Mr. Pebereau was president of the energy and telecommunications company and he negotiated a deal with the ITT Corporation that formed Alcatel N.V., a joint-venture telecommunications company. Rand V. Araskog, chairman of ITT, who Mr. Pebereau dealt with at that time, is an investor in Marceau Investissements. It was after that July 1986 deal was made that, for political reasons, the Conservative Government nudged out Mr. Pebereau, though he sees it differently. ''I had been running a large steamer and I wanted to be on a windsurfer,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/28/business/ford-reports-record-net-for-quarter.html": {"writer_name": "John Holusha", "pub_date": "1988-07-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 658, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ford Reports Record Net For Quarter", "print_headline": "Ford Reports Record Net For Quarter", "body_text": " **********Bolstered by record overseas earnings that more than offset a slight decline at home, the Ford Motor Company reported today that it earned a record $1.66 billion, or $3.43 a share, in the second quarter. **********The profit was the largest ever earned by an American-based auto company in a quarter and represented an increase of 11 percent over Ford's earnings of $1.5 billion, or $2.90 a share, in the second quarter of 1987. It also continued Ford's dominance over the larger General Motors Corporation, which last week reported earnings of $1.5 billion. **********With the Chrysler Corporation expected to report earnings of about $300 million on Thursday, the Big Three will have posted a collective profit of about $3.4 billion for the period, also a record. Analysts attributed the industry's prosperity to car and truck sales that have remained unexpectedly strong, a shrinking market for imports, profits from overseas operations and increased consumer demand for larger, more profitable cars.

Plants Operating at Capacity **********David N. McCammon, Ford's vice president for finance, said all the company assembly plants in the United States were operating at capacity, with overtime scheduled beyond that. Production in the third quarter of this year, he said, will be about 15 percent greater than the 1987 quarter, which could produce a year-to-year earnings gain. **********Mr. McCammon also said that falling stocks of unsold domestic cars on dealers' lots could mean the reduction or elimination of sales incentives on 1989 model cars. **********Ford's dollar sales in the quarter totaled $22.4 billion, an increase of 14.8 percent, while its unit sales totaled 1,789,634 cars, trucks and tractors, an increase of 5.7 percent. **********The company reported that its earnings in the United States totaled $903 million, down $79 million from a year ago. Increased costs for materials, labor and new product development were blamed for the decline. **********Mr. McCammon said that last quarter was the first in 36 that Ford's salaried staff had increased. The company added to its engineer and technical staffs to work on new engines and car models. **********Outside the United States, Ford earned a record $760 million, which was an increase of 47 percent from the $516 million earned in the 1987 period. In the second quarter of 1986, Ford's overseas earnings were just $286 million. The company attributed the gain to strong sales and improved profit margins, largely in Europe, along with changed currency values.

The ads are in color after years of black and white. And the objects of Steuben crystal now share the photograph with other items - no longer treated as exhibits in a museum. **********As a matter of fact the ads, be they two-page spreads or single pages, are being treated as works of art in their own right - posters complete with titles, rather than ads with headlines. **********The agency, Doyle, Graf, Mabley, which took over from Ogilvy & Mather two years ago, has produced two ads for the new campaign; two more are in the works. Craig Cutler was the photographer, Ann Lemon the art director and Sujeong Shin the copywriter. **********Their first ad, promoting a deep flower bowl ($580) as well as the name Steuben, shows the bowl highlighted in the far right of the spread. There are three red flowers that almost seem to be reaching for the bowl. The title: ''Seekers of Light.'' **********The second ad in the campaign features a $385 Equinox bowl atop a red table on which there is a blue ball about the size of a billiard ball.

For one thing, given the more competitive nature of the marketplace, a more aggressive marketing stance was mandatory. For another, there is another target audience besides the affluent group that customarily bought Steuben crystal. **********The new audience is made up of people in their 30's and 40's, younger than the traditional target but also affluent as well as influential, active and enamored of fine design. **********''They want the best and know the difference,'' Ms. Carr said. **********The challenge for the agency, taking over from Oglivy, which worked for Steuben for about 30 years, was to appeal to the new group without turning off the regulars. **********The new direction was beginning to show in 1987. **********Particularly selected as a magazine to reach the new target is Vanity Fair, which shares the media schedule with The New York Times Magazine; Gourmet; Art and Antiques, and Architectural Digest. **********Each magazine, Ms. Carr said, will get five insertions during the six months, May and June, and September through December. Gift giving constitutes about 65 percent of Steuben sales. **********And while as a practice the crystal makers don't disclose their sales, Ms. Carr said that 1987 set a record and that 1988 will too. **********The main retail outlet is the store on Fifth Avenue. Additionally there are 13 shops inside upscale department stores thoughout the country. **********In this area a special retail advertising effort is a series of small space ads appearing run of press at least twice a week in The New York Times. **********Catalogue sales are another important contributor to Steuben's bottom line. The catalogue is not only offered for $5 in small print at the bottom of the image advertising but also in a small space campaign of its own that Steuben also uses to gauge the response of the audiences of various magazine audiences. **********These one-sixteenth-page ads, promoting only the catalogue, run in such magazines as The New Yorker -which is not getting the overall campaign for the first time in memory - The Atlantic, Smithsonian, American Heritage, Southern Accents and Nautical Quarterly. **********The Steuben ad budget is between $2.5 million and $3 million, according to Ms. Carr. **********Steuben Glass, a subsidiary of Corning Inc., founded 55 years ago, produces both decorative and functional pieces, the least expensive of which are called ''hand coolers,'' little glass animals that fit in the palm of the hand.

Only one major Government statistic has appeared so far, reporting that unemployment fell slightly last month (good news, perhaps), but fewer new jobs were created than in previous months (bad news, maybe). **********Economic statistics are getting a lot of attention because of the growing apprehension that a recession is overdue, after six years of economic recovery. But if a recession does finally arrive -now, next year or in 1990 - no one will be aware of it until months after the fact. The problem is that the Federal Government takes three or four months, at least, to gather enough data to figure out what happened in a given month. **********''We don't have the tools to pinpoint what is happening in real time,'' said Mark Watson, a Northwestern University economist. Such tools might never exist, economists say, because data gathering in the huge American economy simply takes time. **********Export data, for example, have to be gathered from thousands of companies. That's why the merchandise trade report for August will become available only tomorrow. The trade data indicate whether foreigners continued to buy enough American products to keep the economy growing. But the figures will probably be revised in subsequent months as more companies report. So might other August statistics already issued. As a result, it will be November or December before economists begin to know what happened to the economy in August - and it will be January or February before what is happening right now becomes evident. **********The public, however, is treated to a running, off-the-cuff interpretation of the economic data, as if there were no lag time in the statistics. Indeed, some economists, not to mention journalists, use each statistic to spin out a judgment on the economy as a whole. **********For example, many economists on Wall Street are saying that exports sagged in August, and the trade deficit therefore will be higher than the $9.53 billion reported for July. If the actual figures tomorrow support this view, then the interpretation will be that economic growth slowed. Bond and stock prices will react accordingly, as if the August number meant that the economy were still slowing. **********Henry Kaufman, former chief economist at Salomon Brothers and now head of a consulting firm, says that such judgments help to generate business for brokerage firms by encouraging investors to trade, or bet, on the statistics. ''We overstate our capacity to forecast,'' he said. ''Every wiggle is interpreted as a direction of the economy.'' **********The Government's delay in gathering data is particularly evident in a statistic that the Federal Reserve will report on Friday: the Index of Industrial Production for September. **********The Fed readily acknowledges that its first monthly estimate of factory output relies mostly on a rehash of the Labor Department's latest employment data, because most manufacturers have not yet reported actual production levels. **********A formula is therefore used to translate the employment level and the number of hours worked into factory production. Since hours worked rose in September, the Wall Street judgment is that the industrial index probably rose, too. But whatever the actual number, a revision is likely in November, when more information is available. **********Retail sales data, also to be announced on Friday, are a bit more timely, based as they are on a store survey last month. The Wall Street guess is that retail sales rose slightly in September, after having apparently fallen in August. But both figures are subject to revision. **********Retail sales are particularly important because they account for two-thirds of the nation's economic activity, and a drop-off can precipitate a recession. To speed data collection, Roger Brinner of Data Resources Inc. proposes that the Government gather sales data weekly - in real time, almost - by hooking computerized cash registers in thousands of stores to a national data bank. **********But even if the Government could miraculously find a way to quickly gather sales and other economic data, determining the economy's direction would still take time, said Alice Rivlin, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. In part, this is because trends become clear only after an economic statistic goes in the same direction - up or down -for several months. **********''It's like tracking hurricanes,'' Ms. Rivlin said. ''We gather plenty of data very quickly but we still can't tell in which direction the storm will go, until after it goes in that direction.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/21/business/finance-new-issues-san-francisco-bonds-priced.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-09-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 165, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "San Francisco Bonds Priced", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; San Francisco Bonds Priced", "body_text": " **********The City and County of San Francisco yesterday priced $145 million of revenue bonds with a maximum yield of 7.60 percent for a 7 1/4 percent issue due in 2015 through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.

It agreed to pay the Dalfort Corporation $7 a share in cash, plus one-fifth of a share of the new company's stock, for a total value of about $100 million. **********Dalfort is a holding company of the Pritzker family of Chicago, which had announced earlier this month that it would sell its 64 percent stake in Braniff to an investor group formed by Paine Webber. Provision for Series A Stock **********In the original agreement in principle, the group said it would pay $1,000 a share for the aggregate shares of Braniff series A stock, all of which is owned by Dalfort. A spokesman for the group said he did not know if the provision for the series A stock was in the final agreement. **********BIA-COR is headed by Jeffrey R. Chodorow, chairman and chief executive of Coregroup, a Philadelphia-based investor group. Arthur G. Cohen, a New York real estate developer, is also a principal in BIA-COR. **********It appeared that BIA-COR would not gain control of the full stake that had been held by the Pritzkers. In its announcement, BIA-COR said Paine Webber, which provided a bridge loan to finance the acquisition, would keep an equity interest in Braniff. **********Among the four Piedmont officers who have joined Braniff are William G. McGee, Piedmont's chairman and chief executive until Friday. Mr. McGee, who is 62 years old, will be chairman, chief executive and president of Braniff. He succeeds Jay A. Pritzker in the chairman's post. **********The other officers are W. Howard McKinnon, Piedmont's senior vice president of finance, who became executive vice president and chief financial officer at Braniff. Richard L. James, vice president of planning at Piedmont, became senior vice president of planning at Braniff, and Donald F. McGuire, the vice president of public affairs at Piedmont, joined Braniff in a similar capacity. String of Losses **********The new investors and management team are taking on an airline that has had financial troubles for years. Braniff had an estimated $100 million loss in 1983, the Pritzker's first year of ownership. In fiscal 1988, it had a $12.2 million loss on revenues of $297.4 million, compared with a $9 million loss on revenues of $239.5 million in 1987. **********J. Patrick Foley, Braniff's outgoing vice chairman and chief executive, was quoted in the Sunday editions of The Dallas Times Herald as saying that the new management team would be well prepared to run Braniff. **********''I believe those who are coming in know the business,'' Mr. Foley was quoted as saying. ''If you analyze what Braniff is today and what Piedmont was 10 years ago you can see very similar airlines.'' **********Officials with the investment group praised the new management, saying that the selection of the officers was the beginning of a turnaround. **********''BIA-COR Holdings has great faith in the management team McGee is organizing,'' Mr. Chodorow said in a statement. ''We intend for Braniff to become a strong competitive force in our nation's air travel and hospitality industries.'' **********The job changes come as Piedmont is proceeding with a merger of its operations into the USAir Group Inc., which acquired it last year. Piedmont Executive Shift **********Piedmont announced Friday that several new officers had been named, but its announcement did not indicate that the departing officers had moved to Braniff. **********The chairman of USAir, Edwin I. Colodny, will become chairman and chief executive of Piedmont. He will keep his responsibilities at USAir. Thomas E. Schick, senior vice president of operations, was named president and chief operating officer at Piedmont. **********The new chief financial officer for both airlines will be Jack K. Walker, who had been the company comptroller. No replacements were named for Mr. James or Mr. McGuire. **********Officials with Piedmont said yesterday that the resignations would have relatively little impact on the company's operations and should not affect the merger with USAir. **********''I don't think you're going to see us miss a beat at Piedmont,'' said Mike Clark, a spokesman for USAir and Piedmont.

But these splashy moves have overshadowed a quiet and powerful rally in small stocks. **********Since the beginning of the year, the stocks of these smaller companies have outperformed the larger ones by a wide margin. And for the first time since 1983, many professional investors now believe this advantage will continue for a sustained period. **********Secondary issues ''could outperform the stock market by an additional 5 to 10 percentage points before year-end,'' Carmine Grigoli, chief equity portfolio strategist at the First Boston Corporation, wrote last week. **********Secondary issues are those stocks whose total market value is less than $500 million. Although largely identified with the over-the-counter market, secondary stocks include most of the issues traded on the American Stock Exchange and many of those on the New York Stock Exchange. Nasdaq Index Up 14% **********So far this year, the Nasdaq composite index has climbed 14 percent, while the Dow Jones industrial average is up 8 percent. And on 28 of the 47 trading days since the beginning of the year, these smaller companies have beat the larger issues of the Standard & Poors 500-stock index. **********Even without any dramatic news, such as a takeover attempt, scores of small companies have rebounded sharply from their December lows. Ashton-Tate, a computer software company, for instance, has climbed to 30 from 17 in the last three months. Dress Barn, the retailer, is up 6 points, to 13 1/2. And Chemed, a specialty chemical company, has jumped to 37 1/4 from 28. **********Behind the rally are a number of powerful forces. Small stocks took more of a beating in the October market collapse than larger issues. Several investment strategists at prominent Wall Street brokerage firms have issued recommendations stating that the stocks of these companies are too cheap to pass up. And because pension funds have poured hundreds of billions of dollars into funds representing indexes of larger stocks, small stocks were overlooked for several years, thereby creating market inefficiences and opportunities. **********Individual investors have been directing more money into the mutual funds that invest in these securities, albeit slowly. And several large pension funds, including the $43 billion Public Employees Retirement System of California, are shifting some of their assets into these stocks. **********This represents a welcome change in the market for some investors. Since 1983, the stocks of most small companies lagged the larger issues that make up the Dow and the S.&P. 500. During that time, the large stocks were buoyed by buying from leveraged buyout funds and the swelling index funds, pools of assets that are designed to match the performance of an index. **********''If anybody asks, it's more fun when we're beating the market,'' said David G. Booth, president of Dimensional Fund Advisors, a Santa Monica, Calif., firm that invests exclusively in stocks of these companies. His firm's $4 billion in portfolios, which largely represent corporate pension fund accounts, had lagged the market since 1983. So far this year, his average portfolio is up 17 percent. **********Despite the recent rally, however, there is not yet a return of the euphoria that gripped this market in 1983. Investors' memories of last fall's collapse, when dealers in these volatile stocks practically disappeared, are too fresh. Individual and institutional investors charged that Wall Street dealers simply refused to answer their telephones during the hectic weeks of October and November. From the high set in August until the December low, these stocks plunged 35.4 percent. **********But with the better recent performance, there is a definite change in mood. Stocks of companies like Bush Industries, which makes furniture, have doubled in the last few months. That kind of performance attracts more institutional investors who are approaching the end of the quarter and do not want to have too much cash in their clients' portfolios. **********And some pension funds are switching into these stocks because they believe they represent the best bargains in the market. As a result, firms such as Morgan, Grenfell Capital Management Inc. that specialize in these stocks are seeing new interest from corporate pension funds. ''The pipeline looks really good,'' said Robert E. Kern Jr., executive vice president of Morgan, Grenfell, which since the first of the year has added three new clients. **********Another buyer has been the California retirement system. After shunning these stocks for more than a year, the fund's officials have been buying them since January. Jed Maxwell, principal investment officer of the fund, declined to provide details about the purchases. ''That might communicate information to Wall Street we'd be less than anxious to share,'' he said. Net Inflow for New Horizons Fund **********Individuals are even getting back into the act after fleeing this market for several months. In the first week of March, for instance, Baltimore's T. Rowe Price Associates witnessed a net inflow of $5.5 million into the New Horizons Fund, a mutual fund that specializes in these stocks. That represents a turnaround from January and February, when withdrawals exceeded inflows, a spokesman for the firm said. **********Large Wall Street firms have been eager to jump aboard this market rally. Both First Boston and Goldman, Sachs & Company recently recommended that their institutional clients increase the amount of their portfolios in these stocks. And Byron Wien, a strategist at Morgan, Stanley & Company, yesterday said he was researching this area and would soon issue a report. **********Mr. Grigoli of First Boston said last week that the rally marked a significant turning point for these stocks. In fact, his research report was entitled ''The Bear Market in Secondary Issues Appears to be Over.'' Pointing to price levels not seen since the mid-1970's, he wrote, ''These results suggest that smaller-capitalization issues could continue to provide market leadership in the months ahead.'' **********Obviously, these stocks showed their high volatility in the October panic selling. But some professional investors say that they view such periods of illiquidity as opportunities to buy stocks at bargain levels. **********''When they throw them out, buy them,'' said Stephen A. Lieber, chairman of the Evergreen Funds. His fund owns such issues as Bush and Goody Products, a hair care company.  SURGING NASDAQ STOCKS  Based on daily closes since Jan. 1 through March 8.

Drama Builds Up", "print_headline": "Market Place; Is Orion a Target? Drama Builds Up", "body_text": " **********THE situation at the Orion Pictures Corporation is certainly a curious one. Two of the wealthiest men in the media industry have gradually been buying up stock in the relatively small motion picture and television company. Its recent films include ''Platoon,'' ''Robocop,'' ''No Way Out'' and ''Throw Momma From the Train,'' and its television series include ''Cagney and Lacey.'' **********John W. Kluge, the entrepreneur who sold Metromedia Inc. to Rupert Murdoch for $2 billion, told the Securities and Exchange Commission last Tuesday that he had increased his stake in Orion by one percentage point, to 21.9 percent. **********Three days later Sumner M. Redstone, who owns Viacom International, the diversified media company, said in a filing that he had raised his Orion holdings, to 26.1 percent, from 25.1 percent. As if to get in the last word, Mr. Kluge disclosed Friday that he had bought 1.1 percent more of Orion. **********The stock closed Friday at $14.50, up $2.875 for the day, and analysts are betting that sooner or later Orion will change hands. But who might buy it, and why, is unclear. **********At $14.50 the company is generally considered undervalued. Alan Kassan, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers, believes it is worth $20 a share. Mark Manson, a media analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, puts the value at $18 a share. **********Orion's earnings outlook has improved because its films have done well. In the nine months ended Nov. 30, the company earned $8.3 million, up from $1.5 million a year earlier. Revenues rose to $280.2 million, from $201.7 million. **********But few film companies offer so many problems to analysts attempting an evaluation. The biggest question mark, said Harold Vogel, a media analyst at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, is how to forecast earnings. Orion carries a somewhat high inventory - $516 million - for a company of its size. ''You don't know what the components of that inventory are,'' Mr. Vogel said. ''Therefore you don't know how or when it will be written off.'' **********Thus, even if revenues rise, earnings might not go up commensurately. Mr. Manson added that since the present management (headed by Arthur Krim, the chairman) took over in 1982, the company has not had a consistent earnings record. **********Calculating the purchase price of the company is also difficult, Mr. Manson finds. As he estimates it, there are 17 million shares outstanding, but there is also a complex warrant program that includes about seven million warrants. And the company has $329 million in long-term debt. Mr. Manson calculates that, at $20 a share, the purchase price would be between $700 million and $800 million. **********Mr. Redstone's S.E.C. filing said his purchases were for investment only. In a telephone interview from Boston, he said his position was not adversarial, but he did say he might increase his stake. Mr. Krim did not return phone calls Friday.  Viacom already owns cable systems, television stations and cable television services including Showtime, the Movie Channel and MTV: Music Television. Acquiring a company that produces films would give Viacom vertical integration. **********Mr. Redstone made millions by buying stakes in the 20th Century-Fox Film Corporation and Columbia Pictures Industries before they were taken over. Some analysts say he may simply be hoping that Mr. Kluge or a third party will buy him out. **********Whether the banks would let Mr. Redstone buy Orion is not known because of Viacom's already heavily leveraged situation. An industry expert pointed out, however, that the bulk of the money Mr. Redstone needed to buy Viacom was borrowed by the company itself in a leveraged buyout. This expert suggested that Mr. Redstone could use his wholly owned National Amusements Company, a movie theater chain, to make the purchase. **********Mr. Kluge is a longtime friend of Mr. Krim, the Orion chairman. Mr. Kluge sits on Orion's board and both men are involved with Columbia University and are directors of Occidental Petroleum. As Mr. Kasen puts it, ''For now it appears Mr. Kluge is poised as the white knight.'' But others wonder whether Mr. Kluge, who is in his 70's, really wants a long-term involvement with Orion. **********What both Mr. Kluge and Mr. Redstone obviously see is a company with a record that is improving. ''Robocop'' brought in $54 million at the box office. ''No Way Out'' grossed $35 million, and ''Throw Momma From the Train'' accounted for $45 million. Each of these films was made for about $12 million - a reasonable Hollywood budget today. **********More important, Orion is now about to benefit from having its own home video operation. Until now it had distribution agreements with outside companies such as Home Box Office. It generally took a flat fee for allowing those companies to distribute its films. When Orion begins distributing its movies itself, however, it will make substantially more money on each picture. **********Mr. Kassan believes that without any additional capital costs the company's operating income, buoyed by better films and more home video revenue, could increase significantly next year. And he adds somewhat wistfully (echoing the views of at least two other entertainment experts) that he believes Orion has undermarketed its films. **********''If Warner or Paramount were releasing 'Fx' or 'No Way Out,' those films would probably have done about twice as much business,'' he said. **********Orion's television operation has not fared as well. It has not been able to sell rerun rights for the hour-long ''Cagney and Lacey'' to television stations, and that is a highly lucrative area of the entertainment business. Meanwhile, though, it has sold rerun rights to cable television. **********The major question is whether Orion can continue to make successful films and how it will handle its inventory. Whether either Mr. Kluge or Mr. Redstone is willing to take on that risk will undoubtedly become evident in the next few months."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/12/business/key-rates-929288.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-04-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 190, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "KEY RATES", "print_headline": "KEY RATES", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/17/business/personal-finance-zero-coupon-bonds-and-the-kiddie-tax.html": {"writer_name": "Deborah Rankin", "pub_date": "1988-01-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1135, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Question", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Zero-Coupon Bonds and the 'Kiddie' Tax", "print_headline": "PERSONAL FINANCE; Zero-Coupon Bonds and the 'Kiddie' Tax", "body_text": " **********Below are answers to some recent questions from readers of the Personal Finance column. **********Q. My parents want to give zero-coupon Treasury securities to each of my grandchildren - their great-grandchildren - who are ages 6, 5, 2 and 1. I am told that even though my grandchildren won't receive any interest income from these securities until the securities reach maturity years from now, they must nonetheless pay taxes on the phantom interest each year - and at their parents' rates rather than at their own. Can our family escape this ''kiddie'' tax by naming me, rather than my grandchildren's parents, as custodian of the securities? **********A. Sorry, but there's no way around the tough limits that the new tax law has clamped on family income-shifting techniques. **********''Under the new rules, if children under the age of 14 have unearned income in excess of $1,000 a year, it is taxed at the parents' rate no matter what the source,'' said Albert B. Ellentuck, a senior tax partner in the Washington office of Laventhol & Horwath, a large accounting firm. ''Naming a grandparent instead of a parent as custodian doesn't change the result.'' **********But Mr. Ellentuck said that gifts of these securities, which are often known by the trade names CAT's, TIGR's or STRIP's, make a wise investment anyway. **********Zero-coupon Treasuries are ''stripped'' of their semiannual coupons, or interest payments, and are sold by brokerage houses at a deep discount from their face amount. **********Instead of receiving periodic interest payments, your grandchildren will receive the difference between the purchase price and the face amount when the securities mature. In the interim, however, phantom income accrues at ever-increasing amounts each year. **********Proper timing can minimize the tax bite, Mr. Ellentuck said. If the purchases of the securities are arranged so that they do not mature until after your grandchildren reach age 14, most of the accrued income they produce will be taxed at the children's rate. **********Q. I'm confused about how to figure the yield on United States savings bonds. Is it true that if I hold them for five years and a day, my yield will reflect any rate increases on Treasury securities over the 6 percent guaranteed floor? Is it possible that the bonds I bought in December 1986 are worth more than their face value? **********A. First, if you hold Series EE bonds for at least five years, you will earn 6 percent or the average rate during the holding period of Treasury securities with a five-year maturity, whichever is higher. Twice a year, each Nov. 1 and May 1, the Treasury Department announces the rate it will pay on the savings bonds tied to the performance of the five-year securities. For the latest period - Nov. 1, 1987, through April 30, 1988 - the rate is 7.17 percent. **********But when you purchased your bonds, the rate was much lower. From Nov. 1, 1986, through April 30, 1987, the rate was 6.06 percent; then, for the period May 1 through Oct. 31, 1987, it dropped to 5.84 percent. **********To determine the average rate that applies to a particular bond, an investor must add up the different rates for all the periods that the bond has been held, and divide by the number of periods. That figure is then rounded off to the closest quarter of a percentage point. **********But to earn that average rate, or the 6 percent guaranteed rate if that is higher, the investor must hold the bonds for at least 10 semiannual rate periods, in your case until December 1991. If you redeem your bonds before that time, you will earn far less than the guaranteed floor. For example, if you had sold your bonds after six months, you would have earned only 4.16 percent. After one year, the rate is 4.3 percent. It then slowly rises until it reaches 6 percent after the fifth year. **********To answer your second question, the Government sells Series EE bonds for half their face amount. At current rates, it would take about 12 years for them to reach their face value. Of course, if rates soar, your bonds would reach their face value more quickly. **********But the average rate for the three periods you have held your bonds is only about 6.36 percent. And if you were to sell the bonds now, you would get back only a little more than what you originally paid for them. **********Q. I have a $20,000 certificate of deposit that is coming due. I would like to buy another certificate and hold it jointly with my adult daughter so that it will not become subject to probate when I die. Is there any reason not to do this? **********A. There are pluses and minuses to putting property in two names, but it is generally advantageous, according to Charles Plotnick, a lawyer and adjunct professor of estate planning at Temple University in Philadelphia. **********He says there are two ways to hold property jointly: as joint tenants with the right of survivorship or as tenants in common. Holding property in the first manner means that upon the death of the first co-tenant, the surviving tenant inherits the property by law, regardless in most cases of what the deceased's will says. When property is owned by tenants in common, the deceased's share of the property passes to his or her estate. **********Professor Plotnick says the biggest advantage to holding property jointly with rights of survivorship is that after you die, the property is automatically transferred to the surviving co-tenant, passing outside probate (the time-consuming and costly legal process by which a will is proved to be the decedent's last will and under which the estate is administered). ''This provides a psychological sense of family unity and security,'' Professor Plotnick said. **********Moreover, property that passes through probate becomes a matter of public record; so holding the certificate with rights of survivorship means it would not become subject to outside scrutiny. Holding property this way may also reduce state and Federal estate taxes, and put the property beyond reach of the personal creditors of a co-owner. **********The biggest disadvantage of joint ownership, said Professor Plotnick, is loss of control. Because the property is shared with your daughter, she would have the right to cash in the certificate and take all the proceeds. **********Also, this type of ownership could make her liable for income taxes on her half of the earnings, although you could elect to pay all the taxes by entering just your Social Security number on forms that identify the recipient of the interest."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/20/business/the-media-business-advertising-people.html": {"writer_name": "Randall Rothenberg", "pub_date": "1988-12-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 115, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; People", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; People", "body_text": " *********** Rochelle Newman has been named vice chairman of Font & Vaamonde, a Grey Advertising affiliate that markets to the Hispanic community. *********** Jeremy Birkbeck, Adele Finaly, Gary Steele and Marty Susz have been appointed senior vice presidents at J.

''Most states are either on or above target,'' said Gerald Miller, executive director of the National Association of State Budget Officers. **********Why did some states make accurate forecasts while others had embarrassing shortfalls? **********Revenue forecasters who guessed right say they were unusually conservative in their projections -and lucky. Taxpayer behavior was difficult to predict after the sweeping changes mandated by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 as well as major revisions of tax codes in many states. **********''When we did our estimating work, we were as conservative as we could be, and we did everything we could to shave those estimates down,'' said Daniel A. Salomone, director of research at the Department of Revenue in Minnesota. **********In California, Massachusetts and New York, revenue shortfalls were attributed mainly to overly optimistic forecasts of capital gains receipts. Tax experts agree that the capital gains area was one of the most difficult to forecast and subject to a wide range of reasonable estimates. Even so, the forecasts for capital gains in those three states were far more optimistic than what Federal estimators and most private consultants had projected. Officials in those states insist that their methodology was sound and was not undermined by political pressures to accommodate more spending or to avoid tax increases. **********Yet, in California, one budget official acknowledged that, while there was no attempt to make the capital gains forecast overly optimistic, there was no desire to be unduly conservative in projections. A revenue windfall, the budget official added, would have been tantamount to a tax increase. ''We're a Republican administration and we would not have wanted a tax increase,'' said Lonnie Mathis, an assistant director in the California Department of Finance. **********Revenue estimators can come very close to the mark in predicting taxpayer response to most types of tax changes. But the error rate can be large when trying to predict the impact of major tax changes that have little precedent, as was the case with capital gains. If economic forecasts are accurate, revenue estimators can predict overall tax receipts within 2 to 3 percent of collections, which is a good batting average statistically, said Michael Vlaisavljevich, a former revenue estimator in Wisconsin who is now with the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse. But in dollar terms, he added, it is enough to create a fiscal crisis. **********Everyone expected that capital gains revenues would be down from the 1986 tax year, when taxable capital gains transactions were nearly double the 1985 amount because taxpayers rushed to cash in profits before capital gains tax rates went up. For the 1987 tax year, the question was how much of a decline there would be in capital gains. The answer required assumptions about how much of the 1986 transactions would otherwise have been realized in 1987 and taxpayer response to the higher capital gains rates. Further complicating the equation was the October stock market crash. There was no hard historical data to guide forecasters. **********Congressional and Treasury forecasts of capital gains, which are not made public, and those of most private consultants, projected declines ranging from about 40 percent to 60 percent, which analysts think is close to experience in many states. **********In Massachusetts, Stephen Kidder, the state's revenue commissioner, said his department predicted a 20 percent decline. ''It appeared to us to be a prudent projection at the time,'' he added. **********Revenue estimators dismissed 1986 tax year figures as an ''aberration,'' Mr. Kidder said, and instead used 1985 levels for basing 1987 projections. They inflated the number to reflect a somewhat slower rate of growth in capital gains than had been the average for the 1978-85 period. **********In New York, the Cuomo administration predicted a 25 percent drop in capital gains realizations from 1986 levels. Tax officials now think the drop was closer to 38 percent. **********Last March, New York State's Comptroller, Edward V. Regan, raised concerns about the capital gains estimate. A private consultant who worked on the Comptroller's report said concerns were prompted by lower-than-expected tax receipts in December and January. But the analyst added that the administration's estimates were justifiable. Although underlying growth assumptions were higher than historical trends, he said they were reasonable given the rise in stock prices and trading volume in early 1987."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/08/business/coated-sales-faces-inquiry.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-06-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 260, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Coated Sales Faces Inquiry", "print_headline": "Coated Sales Faces Inquiry", "body_text": " **********Coated Sales Inc. disclosed today that its internal investigation had uncovered a $6 million overstatement on its most recent financial statement. **********Coated Sales announced last week that it had found ''material irregularities'' in the booking of accounts receivables on its past financial statements.

Interim Government Rejected **********Mr. Maung Maung, a lawyer who helped draw up the nation's Constitution, said creation of an interim government to oversee elections, a step that has been widely demanded, would be unconstitutional. **********In what diplomats said might have been a useful gesture at an earlier stage, Mr. Maung Maung said he welcomed the formation this week of a student union that revives an organization banned in the early 1960's. **********He said the Government would build a union headquarters to replace the building that was dynamited in July 1962 in retribution for student protests. **********Diplomats said they believed that none of this would have much effect on the masses of people who turned out in a monsoon downpour today. **********The diplomats said they had heard unconfirmed reports of a similar demonstration and strike in Mandalay, the nation's second-largest city.

Botashev gave Soviet officials six photographs, an invitation from an American friend and a three-page questionnaire, filled out with basic biographical information. Two weeks later, he had permission from the authorities to travel to the United States. **********''Everything was done so fast, it was just fantastic,'' said Mr. Botashev, a Moscow photographer, who remembers that a passport for a business trip to Spain last year required extensive paperwork, a medical examination and two rigorous interviews with Communist Party officials. **********But this time Mr. Botashev, like thousands of others, raced through the passport bureaucracy, only to find his trip postponed several months by a harsh economic reality: No foreign airline will take his rubles, and seats on Aeroflot, the Soviet carrier, are sold out for months. **********Permission to travel, once a precious right of the privileged few, this year has been granted almost routinely to tens of thousands of Soviet citizens with invitations to visit relatives or friends abroad. Little Warning to Agencies **********The political decision to ease travel restrictions appears to have been made with little warning to Soviet agencies that deal with would-be travelers. **********The department that issues travel passports, for instance, recently reported it was having trouble keeping up with demand, because printing factories were not turning out enough blank passports. **********Travelers must now get a new passport each time they leave the country. To save paper, the visa department next year will stop issuing a new document for each trip to a country in the Eastern bloc. **********''It's a strange system,'' Mr. Botashev said. ''I don't think even the Government understands what's going on. They're absolutely not ready for this.'' Tickets Hard to Get The most frustrating problem, for Mr. Botashev and many others, is airline tickets. **********In September, when he asked Aeroflot for the earliest possible flight to New York, he was told to wait until March. **********Mr. Botashev eventually used a friend's connections to get an Aeroflot reservation for mid-January for a flight to Washington. He will take a train to New York, probably with financial help from American friends, since Soviet travelers are allowed to change only 7 rubles, about $11, for each day they will be abroad. **********The boom in Soviet travel has caused delays to many destinations. But the most severe problem is for trips to the United States, where competition for airline seats has been increased in recent months by a surge of Soviet Armenians being given permission to emigrate to the United States. Aeroflot Booked Until May **********Since foreign airlines will not take rubles for tickets because the ruble is not convertible into other currencies, most tourists and emigres must wait for a seat on Aeroflot. Aeroflot is now telling would-be travelers that no tickets are available on its flights to the United States until May or June. **********''I get hundreds of calls about this,'' said Valery I. Zakharov, an economist for the airline. He notes that foreign airlines have many empty seats flying out of Moscow and says he tells callers to ask their American relatives to buy a ticket in dollars on a foreign airline and send it to them. **********Such advice offers little consolation to people who have waited years for the right to travel or emigrate, particularly when they know that the obstacle is the ruble's worthlessness outside Soviet borders. **********Private travel to the United States began to open up in the fall of 1987 and peaked last summer, when the American Embassy recorded about 3,000 requests a month for tourist visas. Those who apply have already received their foreign travel passports from the Soviet Government, and most are granted an American visa within a day. Requests Have Now Dropped **********Last month, the number of requests dropped below 2,000, primarily because of what an American Consular official referred to as ''the Aeroflot problem.'' **********''If you've got hard currency, you can fly out this afternoon,'' the official said. ''But Soviets don't have hard currency.'' **********Aeroflot says the flood of Soviet travelers was unexpected and is far beyond its current capacity. **********The travel backlog grew worse this fall, when Aeroflot ended an unannounced policy of selling tickets on Pan American flights for rubles. **********Aeroflot acts as the ticket agent for all foreign airlines here. According to Soviet travelers and a Pan American official, Aeroflot sold thousands of Pan Am tickets for rubles last summer. Hard Currency Is Lost **********But the Soviet airline had to reimburse Pan Am in dollars each time it sold a ticket for rubles. That hard currency loss apparently led to a change in policy in September. Soviet citizens with United States tourist visas say they are now told that only Aeroflot tickets are available for rubles. **********Some exceptions are made, said Vladimir P. Agapov, an official in Aeroflot's commercial department. For instance, a Pan Am ticket might be sold for rubles if a Soviet citizen needs to attend a relative's funeral in the United States. **********''We prefer to carry these passengers on Aeroflot flights, because of the hard-currency drain,'' Mr. Agapov said. ''If you go just for pleasure, you just have to wait for your turn to get a seat on an Aeroflot flight.'' **********Aeroflot says it is trying to ease the backlog with several special charter flights this winter that will carry emigres moving to the United States. The airline says it also plans some expansion of its United States service. **********But at a time when Soviet enterprises are under increasing pressure to operate profitably, Aeroflot does not appear eager to devote many more airplanes to United States travel. Although it could easily fill more planes with ruble-paying passengers, that money would not help Aeroflot pay hard currency bills for landing rights, fuel and other expenses on international flights."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/28/business/pay-in-japan-rises-4.4.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-12-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 50, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pay in Japan Rises 4.4%", "print_headline": "Pay in Japan Rises 4.4%", "body_text": " **********The average Japanese worker got a 4.4 percent pay increase in 1988, or about $75 more each month, the Labor Ministry said today."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/20/business/blue-chips-rally-pushing-dow-up-2197.html": {"writer_name": "Lawrence Demaria", "pub_date": "1988-12-20", "snippet": "LEAD: The stock market, particularly its blue-chip component, moved strongly higher yesterday on good volume.", "word_count": 583, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Blue Chips Rally, Pushing Dow Up 21.97", "print_headline": "Blue Chips Rally, Pushing Dow Up 21.97", "body_text": " **********LEAD: The stock market, particularly its blue-chip component, moved strongly higher yesterday on good volume. **********The stock market, particularly its blue-chip component, moved strongly higher yesterday on good volume. **********The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 21.97 points to close at 2,172.68.

That $183.6 million investment alone could probably furnish the equity portion in a leveraged acquisition, they said. **********But it appeared that Coniston had suffered a slight dent in its armor from the campaign to force Gillette to put itself on the block. Coniston lost the proxy fight and later settled out of court after Gillette promised to buy back 15 percent of its shares. **********''After Gillette and NL Industries, I'm not that anxious to get involved,'' said Charles A. Leeds Jr., head of risk arbitrage at Balis, Zorn, Gerard, also referring to an earlier episode in Coniston's history. ''In NL, they basically left shareholders high and dry, much the same as Gillette, and if Ron Perelman couldn't make TW happen, I'm not sure what they could do.'' **********While Coniston has generally been able to wring value out of underperforming companies, TW has ample defenses. It is incorporated in Delaware, which has strong anti-takeover laws. Earlier this week, the company also adopted a ''poison pill'' provision that could make a takeover prohibitively expensive. **********A TW spokesman said the company would not have any comment. **********TW, the former Transworld Corporation, has transformed itself many times over the last few years. T.W.A. was spun off in 1983. Three years later, the company sold off its Hilton International hotels to the Allegis Corporation, now UAL Inc., and returned much of the proceeds to shareholders in a one-time distribution. **********From the restructuring TW Services has emerged as a food services company. At the end of last year, it acquired Denny's, a family-style restaurant chain, for $843 million. **********Although analysts at the time thought TW had overpaid, Mr. Murren estimated that the chain is now worth $1.05 billion. Its Spartan unit, the largest franchisee of the Hardee's fast-food chain, he said, would fetch about $765 million, and Canteen, a vending and contract catering operation, about $737 million. **********Finally, American Medical Services, a chain of nursing homes, could add another $110 million. After subtracting $1.2 billion of debt, there would be $1.5 billion left to distribute to shareholders; thus, his $30-a-share estimate for the breakup value."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/20/business/market-place-willcox-gibbs-called-underrated.html": {"writer_name": "Isadore Barmash", "pub_date": "1988-10-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 860, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place; Willcox & Gibbs Called Underrated", "print_headline": "Market Place; Willcox & Gibbs Called Underrated", "body_text": " **********EVEN though Willcox & Gibbs is soon likely to report its 23d consecutive quarter of increased sales and earnings, it does not get the investor appreciation it deserves, analysts say. The stumbling block is that, like many conglomerates, investors are not sure what kind of company it is. **********Too many people, the analysts believe, are unaware of the earnings ability of this oddly put-together company, which makes parts for sewing machines and makes and distributes electronics parts in addition to manufacturing textile yarn. This year the company's common stock has swung between $19.875 and $7.50, although lately it has been steady at $16, its closing price yesterday. **********As Aaron Lehman of Balis Zorn Gerard Inc. said yesterday, ''Given our confidence in management's ability to successfully operate its acquisitions, its conservative style and growth prospects, we believe that as investors recognize that Willcox & Gibbs has a better mix of growth businesses, the stock will achieve a higher multiple.'' **********Mr. Lehman said he had been particularly impressed by management's acquisition policy and by its operation of the acquisitions. He estimates that the company will earn $1.40 a share this year and $1.70 a share next year, up from $1.11 in 1987. **********Willcox & Gibbs, founded in 1859, invented the chain-stitch sewing machine, which competed with Singer's lock-switch machine. While Willcox concentrated on industrial rather than home sewing, the two producers competed for the affection of the nation's sewing factories until the end of World War II. Soon afterward, the Japanese entered the sewing machine market and began to dominate it. **********In 1976, after diversifying, , Willcox & Gibbs filed for Chapter 11 protection under the Bankruptcy Act. Acquisitions turned it heavily into debt and the company also suffered financial losses from an unsuccessful polystyrene pallet for factories. **********In 1978, it emerged from Chapter 11, repaid its debts in 1980 and began selling off the bulk of its sewing machine business. In 1984, it acquired two important additions, the Eildon Company, which produces electronic productivity measuring and recording devices, and Consolidated Electric Supply. These purchases led to others over the next four years. In fact, the company announced a new one yesterday, a $17.6 million cash purchase of Clark Consolidated Industries, a Cleveland producer of paper tubes and steel pulleys. **********The acquisitions had a positive effect because the company divided its operations into parts distribution and yarn manufacturing and this time kept strictly to these fields. **********Mr. Lehman said: ''With 10 million shares outstanding at the current $16 a share, Willcox & Gibbs has a market value of about $160 million. But the Clark Consolidated purchase should add another $75 million in revenues, giving Willcox total revenues this year of about $450 million. That means that its stock is selling at only 35 percent of sales, and that is cheap.'' He said he expected Willcox's stock to rise to the low 20's in a year and said it ''could easily double in two to three years.'' **********In an interview, John K. Ziegler, Willcox & Gibbs's chairman and chief executive, said the company's diversification program was based on obtaining strong benefits from its various operations. He gave this breakdown of the company's sales and earnings: Electronics parts distribution, 55 percent of sales and 42 percent of profits; sewing machine parts, 25 percent of sales and 34 percent of profits, and yarn, 20 percent of sales and 24 percent of profits. **********But the concern's five-division group that produces and distributes sewing machine parts or supplies ''is our cash cow, even though we are serving an industry without much growth in the last decade,'' Mr. Ziegler said. ''But we have gotten stronger in it by enhancing our computer system to gain better inventory management,'' he added. ''It means that we can fill 98 percent of our customer's orders the same day.'' **********Last year, Willcox & Gibbs had sales of $317 million, up from $262 million in 1986. Earnings for 1987 came to $10.1 million, up from $7.6 million the year before. In the first six months of this year, sales rose 21 percent and net income 38 percent. **********Robert Sullivan, an analyst for Paine Webber Inc. in New York, said he was enthusiastic about the company. But his earnings estimates were slightly lower than Mr. Lehman's. ''I'm estimating $1.39 a share this year and $1.60 a share for next year, not including the latest acquisition,'' he said. **********Any negatives? ''The only negative I see is that their Consolidated Electric Supply division is related to the housing trend,'' Mr. Sullivan said. ''If it goes down, that big division could be hurt. As to the Regal subsidiary, which makes covered elastic yarns for panty hose, I think that is a fairly stable business.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/03/world/british-board-presses-effort-to-find-nazis.html": {"writer_name": "Howell Raines", "pub_date": "1988-04-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 955, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "British Board Presses Effort To Find Nazis", "print_headline": "British Board Presses Effort To Find Nazis", "body_text": " **********Government investigators have been sifting through more than 50 letters that have arrived in response to an unusual advertisement headlined ''War Criminals, Evidence Wanted,'' which appeared in British newspapers last weekend. **********The advertisement was placed by a new Government panel, the War Crimes Inquiry, in an effort to expand the panel's list of 53 former Nazis believed to have found refuge in Britain after World War II. War crimes experts said the campaign represented the most aggressive public effort by the British Government in 40 years to identify suspected war criminals. **********The advertisement also marked a victory for a small group of members of Parliament and Nazi hunters who have been pressing a reluctant Thatcher Admininistration to reopen the war crimes inquiries that the Government abruptly discontinued for diplomatic reasons 40 years ago. Wide Net Thrown Out **********Sir Thomas Hetherington, one of two members of the War Crimes Inquiry and a former director of public prosecutions, said he was seeking evidence worldwide. He said investigators would not hide any information about the 1948 decision by the Labor Government to halt war crimes prosecutions in Britain and in other Commonwealth nations. **********Government officials said it would take extraordinary findings by the War Crimes Inquiry to change Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's mind about revising the laws that have made Britain a hiding place for war criminals. **********Under existing law, British citizens cannot be prosecuted for crimes committed abroad while they were citizens of another country. Britain also lacks extradition treaties with the Soviet Union and Israel. Both countries have sought to prosecute British citizens accused of committing murder or genocide while serving with the German armed forces during World War II. **********Mrs. Thatcher has resisted legal changes related to war crimes. But the political pressure generated by the Parliamentary War Crimes Group, the Simon Wiesenthal Center of Los Angeles and by a Scottish television documentary on war crimes led her Home Secretary, Douglas Hurd, to name the War Crimes Inquiry on Feb. 8. Exploring the Evidence **********The board is to establish whether there is evidence to support the prosecution or extraditon of British citizens. The board would recommend to Mr. Hurd whether the law should be changed to allow such actions. ''The first task is to find the documentary material, find the witnesses and then, having assessed their worth, to go on to consider whether the law requires to be changed,'' said William Chalmers, the other member of the inquiry panel. **********Various sources have provided the investigators with the names of 53 suspects who are believed to have settled in Britain. The Wiesenthal Center has named 17 suspects. Members of a Scottish television documentary unit have provided 34 names secured from Soviet officials and two names have been obtained from other sources. Seventeen of the suspects are thought to be alive. **********Sir Thomas brushed aside the suggestion that the Government has enough evidence to move against some of the 17 suspects. ''There are lists of names that have been submitted to us by various people,'' he said. ''But there is not at present the evidence there to justify bringing any sort of case against anyone in this category.'' Damaging Documentary **********The investigators conceded that Scottish television had compiled a damaging argument against the best-know suspect in Britain, Antanas Gecas, a 71-year-old retired engineer who lives in Edinburgh. Scottish journalists taped interviews with Soviet citizens who said they saw Mr. Gecas take part in the mass shootings of Jews in Lithuania. Mr. Gecas was in a German police unit at the time. **********''If we go to the U.S.S.R. and get the same sort of evidence, that is something we would want to consider pretty closely,'' Sir Thomas said in discussing the Gecas case. He said Soviet officials, who have been pressing the British to act, have said their witnesses could testify in Britain. ''We'd have to be satisfied that they would be credible in a court of law,'' Sir Thomas added. **********Mr. Gecas has admitted that he was present when Jews were killed, but he has denied any role. He has said the testimony against him was coerced. **********The British investigators said they planned to visit Canada, Australia, Germany, Israel and the United States to review documentary evidence. They said they would also go to the Soviet Union to interview witnesses. A Secret Telegram **********An official of the Parliamentary War Crimes Group, who asked not to be named, said the Government may be nervous about revealing details of its 1948 order to ignore such cases. The War Crimes Group has brought to light a telegram, classified as secret, sent by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Affairs, Philip Noel-Baker, informing Canadian officials of Britain's decision to end the prosecution of German war criminals by August 31, 1948. **********''In our view, punishment of war criminals is more a matter of discouraging future generations than of meting out retribution to every guilty individual,'' Mr. Noel-Baker told the Canadian officials. Mr. Noel-Baker indicated that the decision was based on British, American and French discussions about the future of Germany. **********Sir Thomas said the investigators would not gloss over the Government record. ''We are an independent inquiry,'' he said. ''It's up to the Home Secretary what he does with the material, but I dont think what we put forward to the Home Secretary is going to be influenced in any way by scruples about embarrassing the Government.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/13/world/pinochet-looking-to-extend-tenure.html": {"writer_name": "Shirley Christian", "pub_date": "1988-06-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 796, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pinochet Looking to Extend Tenure", "print_headline": "Pinochet Looking to Extend Tenure", "body_text": " **********Facing a strong electoral challenge to his 15-year presidency, Gen. Augusto Pinochet is said by supporters to have begun searching for a strategy to assure that he remains in power after a coming plebiscite. **********The Chilean President's concern stems from recent polls which show that about a third of the electorate is undecided or unwilling to indicate how they will vote in the plebiscite. Voters who say they have made up their minds appear about equally divided. **********In recent interviews, people close to the Pinochet campaign said a date for the vote, expected to be held sometime between Sept. 11 and Dec. 11, was still being determined to find the best moment from the President's standpoint - for example, when he shows more strength in the polls or the improving economy sways more voters. **********But they said that other options were being considered. One possibility mentioned is a last-minute constitutional change to extend General Pinochet's eight-year term by two years, then hold open elections. **********Another possibility, considered remote at this point, is to call elections this year, on the theory that General Pinochet would run better against opposition candidates than in a plebiscite in which people would be asked simply to vote for him or against him. **********Leaders of the broad opposition front trying to replace the Chilean leader have repeatedly said that he will be tempted to resort to electoral fraud to retain power. He and his advisers have denied that. **********''After having purity and normality throughout the process, we are not going to stain our hands at the very end for some crazy thing,'' President Pinochet said in a recent speech. ''Why have fraud at the last minute?'' Fraud Is Not Necessary **********Rather than commit fraud, he said, he could just cancel the election. He added that he was ''setting an example'' in the conduct of the campaign, but that the opposition was not taking his intentions seriously. **********The President contended that his opponents were ''inventing'' the possiblity of election fraud to get financial assistance from foreign governments and other groups opposed to his leadership. In search of the undecided voters, General Pinochet and opposition leaders have been traveling up and down the country, giving speeches and opening local campaign centers. **********As Chile emerges from a long period of tight control over political activity, the newspapers and radio news programs are dominated by political oratory, name calling, charges and countercharges. The opposition has received only limited access to television, which is largely state-controlled. **********It is the continuing indecisiveness of the Chilean voter, according to Pinochet supporters, that is causing the nervousness in his campaign. The commanders of the navy, the air force and the national police - who along with General Pinochet as head of the army are supposed to nominate him and set the date for the voting -are said to be reluctant to do so unless the polls forecast victory. **********The plebiscite was established by Chile's 1980 constitution as a step toward restoring democracy. Under this process, Chileans are to vote yes or no on an eight-year term for president by the candidate nominated by the military leadership. A year later, a congress is to be elected. At the end of the president's term, in 1997, the next president is to be freely elected. **********In theory, the military leadership may nominate someone other than the 72-year-old General Pinochet, and for the last two years the other commanders have indicated that they would prefer a civilian president during the transition period. **********But they also want to avoid an open split within the armed forces, which will probably lead them to bow to General Pinochet's wishes The army is as large as the navy, air force and national police combined. **********A former Cabinet minister familiar with the President's campaign said that one group of strategists feels it is possible to obtain a majority in the polls over the next months with a continued aggressive publicity effort focusing on a growing free-market economy. **********But the former official said that another group of Pinochet strategists believe that is doubtful and that it is time to consider other steps. One such step, he said, might be to move up the congressional elections, now planned for late 1989 or early 1990, and then have the newly Senate elect the next president, an idea that had encountered opposition from the other military commanders."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/17/business/week-in-business-encouraging-news-on-trade-inflation.html": {"writer_name": "James Cobb", "pub_date": "1988-07-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 892, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Encouraging News On Trade, Inflation", "print_headline": "WEEK IN BUSINESS; Encouraging News On Trade, Inflation", "body_text": " **********Encouraging economic reports sent the dollar soaring. The U.S. trade deficit rose slightly in May, to $10.93 billion. Although higher than the revised $10.3 billion of April, it was the second-smallest imbalance in almost three years. Imports rose 3.4 percent, to $37.6 billion, while exports also increased 2.3 percent, to $26.6 billion. In another report, wholesale prices rose in June by only four-tenths of 1 percent - especially good news since raw food prices jumped by the steepest rate in more than 2 1/2 years. The food increases were offset by lower energy prices. *********** The dollar surged above 1.87 West German marks - its highest level in 11 months - and also climbed against the yen. Bond prices were also higher, but stocks were mixed, with the Dow Jones industrials rising 23.30 for the week, to 2,129.45. *********** A layoff-notification bill passed the House by 286 to 136 - four votes more than would be needed to override a Presidential veto. The bill, which has already been approved by the Senate, would require companies to provide 60 days' notice of factory closings or large-scale layoffs. It poses a political dilemma for the Administration, which opposes mandatory notification but senses that a veto could hurt the campaign of Vice President Bush. The layoff provisions had previously prompted President Reagan to veto comprehensive trade legislation, and a reworked version of that bill also passed in the House, 376 to 45. The trade bill is now in the Senate. *********** Big banks raised their prime rate half a point, to 9 1/2 percent - the highest level since March 1986.

The Broadcast Group had an operating profit of $155.1 million. *********** Polaroid will challenge Kodak and Fuji Photo with a plan to sell conventional color film. The company will also undertake a restructuring, which may help it to fend off any takeover attempts. It will cut at least 500 jobs, buy back $300 million of its stock, consolidate operations and trim its research and development program. *********** International banks must raise billions of dollars in capital to meet the new requirements of an accord signed by 12 central bankers. In the United States, bankers and the F.D.I.C. expressed concern over a related plan by the Federal Reserve that would raise capital requirements for the parent companies of domestic banks, contending that it will place U.S. banks at a disadvantage. *********** Eastern Airlines is at an impasse in talks with its machinists union, and the possibility of a strike is growing. The airline has asked for wage and benefit concessions while the union's latest proposal seeks wage increases of 6.5 percent over two years. Eastern also warned its pilots that it might cut its fleet to 211 planes, from 270. *********** Pan Am and its biggest union tentatively agreed on a plan that would save the airline $27 million a year in labor costs. The pact must be ratified by the 5,200-member Transport Workers. In return for the concessions, Pan Am said it would drop its threat to sell assets, including its Latin American routes. *********** The drought will cut the nation's corn crop by 2.1 billion bushels, or 29 percent, from earlier projections. The Agriculture Department also estimated a 25 percent drop in total grain production. *********** Sales of U.S.-made vehicles rose 1.7 percent in the first 10 days of July from a year earlier, but the annual adjusted selling rate dropped to 7.1 million, from 8.2 million in late June.

Mr. Delvalle has also asked Panamanian citizens to withhold payments from the Government. **********Mr. Delvalle's proclamation is his latest effort to reinforce his assertion that he remains the lawful President of Panama. According to Mr. Lewis, Panamanian consular officials in Hamburg, London and New York, all important shipping centers, remain loyal to Mr. Delvalle and have agreed to withhold any fees they receive. The situation at the embassies in the Far East is less certain, he said. **********A Reagan Administration official said the Panamanian Government ''needs every penny it can get because its reserves are way down.'' **********''They need money to meet their payroll and their foreign reserves are razor thin,'' he said. **********Panama does not print its own money, relying instead on American dollars. U.S. Aid Is Cut Off **********Congress added to Panama's financial burden last year by voting to cut off virtually all economic and military aid in a show of displeasure over General Noriega's continued rule. In addition, Congress ended Panama's sugar quota and required the United States to vote against all loans to Panama from any of the international banking organizations. The World Bank recently canceled a $50 million part of a loan to Panama, saying that it had refused to meet the bank's conditions. **********Administration officials said today that they were hopeful that General Noriega's civilian and military supporters would find it increasingly difficult to continue supporting him. But the officials acknowledged they have proceeded without a clear strategy in mind. **********''Once we started down the path'' of trying to oust General Noriega, ''we tried to seize opportunities,'' an official said. Specific steps were taken on an ad hoc basis, he said. **********The official said it was unfair of critics to say the Administration's policy had failed because it was still too early to ascertain the outcome of the American pressure and support for Mr. Delvalle's action. **********Deputy Secretary of State John C. Whitehead said today in a speech before the American Legion that General Noriega's fate ''is not entirely a decision, of course, of the United States, but it's more a decision of the people of Panama.'' Mr. Whitehead suggested that the United States was contemplating further sanctions against the Panamanian Government. **********''We have a lot of options,'' he said. ''We can't announce them in advance, but we are considering what further actions we should take.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/19/business/the-media-business-advertising-new-wyse-executive.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1988-09-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 138, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; New Wyse Executive", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; New Wyse Executive", "body_text": " **********Allan D.

Teheran Rejects Proposal **********They said this action should include acceptance by Iran of parity with Iraq, with both producers limiting themselves to an output of 2.3 million barrels a day. Iraq has refused to abide by an OPEC quota unless it is given a level equal to that of Iran, but Teheran has consistently refused to allow such parity. Iran's official radio rejected today's proposal, calling it ''totally unprincipled.'' **********The proposal will be discussed Thursday at a meeting of eight key OPEC oil ministers. **********In the United States, oil prices moved up on the Arab group's call for a cut in OPEC production. West Texas intermediate crude oil closed up 29 cents, at $15.21 a barrel. Oil prices also climbed in Europe. Tougher Policy Is Indicated **********The move by the four Arab oil producers, which together account for half of OPEC's present output of 21 million barrels a day, signals the willingness of Saudi Arabia and its allies to defy powerful enemies like Iran even though a confrontation could depress oil prices further. **********More important, this policy signals emergence of the Persian Gulf's conservative Arab group as the arbiter of world oil production and prices in the next decade with the ability to impose its policy on others or punish those who resist it. The Arab Gulf group controls one-fifth of the world's known oil reserves. **********Although Iran officially rejected parity with Iraq again today, oil experts said they believed Teheran would be unable to defy the Arab pressure if the consequence were to face a continued drop in oil revenues. The Iranian economy is crumbling, and money is needed for reconstruction after the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, which ended in August. **********''There is an important message in this resolution that cannot be ignored,'' said Nordine Ait-Laoussine, an Algerian oil expert and president of Nalcosa, a Geneva-based oil consulting firm. ''It is that the Gulf countries appear to be united on this point. I don't think the Iranians have any interest in saying no.'' Warning to Other Producers **********Arab oil officials who attended the Riyadh meeting said Saudi Arabia had privately notified other producers, including the United Arab Emirates and Iraq, that it would not tolerate freewheeling production in disregard of Saudi Arabia's position as the world's No. 1 oil producer with the world's largest oil reserves. The U.A.E. said last month that it would no longer abide by its quota of 940,000 barrels a day.. **********''Over the years, we have had a commitment to support parity in oil production between Iraq and Iran,'' said a senior Arab participant in the meeting who is familiar with the Saudi position and asked not to be identified. ''We have no commitment to support an increase of quota by anyone else. If they increase production unilaterally, we will follow and in much larger volume.'' **********The members of the Gulf Cooperation Council jointly control nearly half of OPEC's current production of 20.5 million barrels a day. **********During the summer Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and the U.A.E. increased their production by more than 2 million barrels, causing prices to plummet. Another Quota Suggestion **********One idea being discussed by OPEC members is to raise the organization's formal production ceiling from the present 16.6 million barrels a day to a new level of 19 million barrels a day. This would give all OPEC members an increase of about 9 percent above the official quotas they have ignored since June. **********Short of that, according to Arab oil-industry sources familiar with the Riyadh deliberations, Saudi Arabia warned that it would continue to increase its oil production past its present level of 6 million barrels a day. In June the Saudis began increasing their output from their quota of 4.3 million barrels a day after having failed to persuade the U.A.E. to observe its quota. **********An emergency OPEC meeting of eight key oil-producing countries is scheduled in Madrid on Thursday, and an OPEC gathering of all 13 members is set for Nov. 21 in Vienna. **********Oil experts are divided on whether the Saudi-led initiative can push OPEC toward an agreement. **********Some of them, like Mr. Laoussine, say they are mildly optimistic that under these conditions OPEC will feel obligated to agree to a solution before the end of the year, if for no other reason than to prevent a further decline in revenues. **********But Peter Gignoux, manager of the oil trading desk at Shearson, Lehman in London, said, ''The G.C.C. communique seems to suggest it is premature to predict an agreement in OPEC so soon.''

He mainly confines his activities to his Government-aided yoga center, where he gives yoga classes and tries to live a secluded life. **********But controversy is rarely far away.

'' the Cardinal declared. **********Recent tensions between the two countries have led politicians to conclude that the British-Irish agreement on Northern Ireland had reached a critical point, 27 months after its signing, with the quality of British justice a paramount Irish complaint. Thatcher Defends Decision **********In Parliament today, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher defended the British decision not to prosecute police officers who were found to have obstructed justice in an investigation into earlier fatal shootings by the police of six civilians in Northern Ireland. **********The British Attorney General had cited ''national security'' and the ''public interest'' in barring the prosecutions in that recent inquiry, which focused on allegations that the police were using ''shoot to kill'' tactics against unarmed guerrilla suspects in 1982 in Northern Ireland. **********Cardinal O Fiaich spoke in Northern Ireland at the funeral of an unarmed civilian who was shot to death Sunday by a British soldier at a checkpoint in County Tyrone. The British, who use both soldiers and the Royal Ulster Constabulary for security in Northern Ireland, have apologized for the machine gun death and taken a soldier into custody who reportedly maintained that the weapon fired accidentally. **********The family of the 24-year-old victim, Aidan McAnespie, has expressed skepticism that an accident was involved in the sidewalk shooting 200 to 300 yards beyond the checkpoint as Mr. McAnespie walked to a store. They noted a newspaper report a year ago in which Mr. McAnespie complained of repeated checkpoint harassment, declaring that the police searched him and his car 10 times in 11 days. An Unannounced Pardon **********The anger of Irish nationalists at his crowded funeral near the border with the Irish Republic was compounded by the news from unofficial sources of the unannounced pardon a year ago of a British soldier convicted of homicide in a 1983 shooting of an unarmed civilian in West Belfast. It was that pardon that was confirmed in London today. **********Critics of the parole were particularly incensed in comparing the soldier's short prison time and restoration to army service with far graver penalties meted out to convicted Irish guerrillas in Northern Ireland. **********''It proves there is no British justice in Ireland,'' declared Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political arm of the outlawed Irish Republican Army, which is a prime target of the British-Irish agreement. **********The Irish Prime Minister, Charles J. Haughey, has complained about the administration of justice in Northern Ireland in recent weeks, pleading with the Thatcher Government for improvements so that the British-Irish agreement is not endangered. The pact aims to provide Dublin a consultative role in Northern Ireland affairs in an effort to convince the embattled nationalist minority that civil rights can be improved and I.R.A. violence avoided amid the Protestant majority, which is loyal to Britain. Investigation in Ireland **********In the growing friction, the Haughey Government made a point of ordering the Irish Republic's police to begin their own investigation into the shooting Sunday even though it was beyond their jurisdiction, a development that has angered some British officials. **********The British Home Office said several factors went into the parole decision, including the circumstances of the case, the age of the soldier at the time - he was 18 years old - the year he waited in jail for trial, and his good behavior in prison. **********The soldier, Pvt. Robert Thain, had asserted that the 22-year-old victim, Thomas Reilly, seemed to be reaching for a weapon in a jacket pocket during a street confrontation. But the court found that the soldier ''concocted'' his story and that the victim was unarmed, bare-chested and trying to flee the scene of a sidewalk disorder. **********''It is unbelievable,'' said James Reilly, the victim's father, of the 1983 shooting.

They also agreed they would meet next month in Paris and that Mr. Uno would travel to Moscow this coming spring. **********Both Mr. Shevardnadze and Japanese Foreign Ministry officials pointed to the prospect of continuing discussions as a sign of progress.

That's why they have kicked out the Ambassador and cracked down internally.'' **********It remains unclear whether the Administration's new interest in diplomatic and political measures is really aimed at reaching an understanding with Nicaragua and seeking the expansion of political freedom there or is simply a means of putting pressure on the Sandinistas in a different way. **********The Sandinistas say they fear that the Administration will seek to weaken them politically, then re-arm the contras to attack them again militarily. To avoid this, they expelled the American Ambassador on Monday, accusing him of meddling in their internal affairs. **********American and contra officials assert that every time the Sandinistas face significant internal opposition, they use any excuse available to crack down and suppress it. Effect of Envoy's Expulsion **********The expulsion of the Ambassador, Richard H. Melton, is certain to have a major effect on Administration thinking. Mr. Melton was sent to Nicaragua with the specific mission of encouraging the political opposition to use the Central American peace treaty to demand increased freedom, a senior American official said. **********Another senior Administration official said in a telephone interview that he expected Mr. Shultz to press ahead with a political effort to put pressure on the Sandinistas, despite the expulsion of Mr. Melton and seven other American diplomats. **********A key indicator of the Administration's intentions will be whether it now seeks the resumption of weapons aid for the contras, or holds back while exploring diplomatic options. **********The success of a political and diplomatic approach to Nicaragua by the Administration appears to depend on several factors that cannot be easily controlled. **********They include internal fights within the Administration, the Nicaraguan rebel movement and the Sandinistas. Other important influences are the worsening internal situation in Nicaragua and the position taken by political leaders in Central America and other countries with influence in the region. **********President Oscar Arias Sanchez of Costa Rica, who won the Nobel Peace Prize last year for sponsoring the Central American peace plan, could play a particularly influential role. Cuba and the Soviet Union, which are the principal supporters of the Sandinistas, will also be important. Contra Sees Gain at Talks **********Alfredo Cesar, the chief political strategist for the American-backed contra movement that now calls itself the Nicaraguan Resistance, said in an interview that he believed the rebels maneuvered the Sandinistas into a position at peace talks in Managua last month in which the Sandinistas committed themselves for the first time to negotiating major political changes, rather than just the technical aspects of a cease-fire. **********The rebel strategy now, Mr. Cesar said, is to urge the Administration, the American Congress and the other presidents of Central America to support the Nicaraguan Resistance and internal opposition parties in Nicaragua for a major push in a final round of negotiations with the Sandinistas. **********The contras are working closely with senior State Department officials and members of Congress to define their political strategy and have found strong support in Mr. Shultz, senior contra and American officials say. **********Mr. Shultz recently made his first trip to Central America in several years and left the region believing that there was a genuine opportunity for diplomatic and political measures to put pressure on Nicaragua, American officials say. **********Mr. Shultz is to return to Central America on Aug. 1 to meet the foreign ministers of Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala and Costa Rica in an effort to forge a joint strategy."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/24/world/us-seen-as-confident-of-afghan-pullout-by-soviet.html": {"writer_name": "David Shipler", "pub_date": "1988-02-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 973, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Seen as Confident of Afghan Pullout by Soviet", "print_headline": "U.S. Seen as Confident of Afghan Pullout by Soviet", "body_text": " **********Intelligence reports from Afghanistan showing Soviet troops retreating to defensive bases and dependents leaving the country have increased American confidence that the Soviet Union is preparing to withdraw its forces, a senior official traveling with Secretary of State George P. Shultz said today. **********The Soviet troops are being ''garrisoned in a more defensive way,'' the official said, and departing military personnel are not being replaced. **********This information, combined with the statements of intention that Mr. Shultz heard from Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze during two days of talks in Moscow, has convinced the United States that no obstacles should be put in the way of an early agreement on a pullout, officials said. **********''Their statements are very clear and very public, unequivocal and unadorned,'' Mr. Shultz said at a news conference today. ''We certainly have that sense from their public statements and private statements they've made to me that they certainly do regard their presence in Afghanistan as counterproductive at this point.'' On Coalition Government **********In their wish to help expedite the Soviet withdrawal, State Department officials are decidedly cool to a demand by Pakistan that a coalition government be formed in Afghanistan before a final accord on a withdrawal is signed in Geneva. **********While such a coalition may be ''desirable,'' as Mr. Shultz has said repeatedly in recent days, nobody thinks the warring Afghan factions can arrange a political settlement before details of the Soviet pullout are final. **********''We wouldn't want to miss the bus,'' another senior American official said. ''We've been trying to get the Soviets out for years.'' Now, he said, the United States could hardly urge the Russians to ''stick around'' while the Afghans tried to put a coalition together.  [ In Washington, a State Department official said that while some Soviet troops had moved to defensive positions, the United States had seen no indication of any withdrawal of Soviet troops, and estimated that 115,000 Soviet troops are still on Afghan soil. The official said the United States expected that departing Soviet military personnel would not be replaced. ]  The Administration has been careful not to criticize Pakistan's position in public, and it is not clear how strongly the views will be conveyed when Michael H. Armacost, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, visits Islamabad in the coming days. Mr. Armacost, who accompanied Mr. Shultz from Moscow this morning, was scheduled to leave for Pakistan from Brussels after Mr. Shultz briefed the NATO foreign ministers. Pakistan Seeks Stability **********Pakistan, which has become a sanctuary for nearly three million Afghan refugees, is worried about continued fighting after a Soviet pullout and wants to be sure that any settlement brings stable enough conditions in Afghanistan that the refugees feel comfortable returning home. **********Some Pakistani and American officials say they believe that once a withdrawal agreement is ready for signing, the Afghan guerrillas and the pro-Soviet People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan will be propelled into some form of political accommodation. **********But a senior American official also cautioned that the closer the Russians came to leaving, the less leverage they would have to press for political concessions from the pro-Soviet Afghans who head the Government. Those leaders would be ''in the boat,'' meaning the lifeboat, the official said. **********Pakistan and Afghanistan have nearly concluded indirect negotiations in Geneva on an accord providing for a simultaneous beginning of a Soviet pullout and a cutoff of American military aid to the guerrillas. A 10-Month Withdrawal **********Mr. Gorbachev has proposed a 10-month withdrawal in which a high percentage of troops would leave during the initial period. **********Neither he nor Mr. Shevardnadze provided Mr. Shultz with details in the Moscow talks, probably, an American official speculated, because they did not want such information to emerge from Soviet-American negotiations and prefer to present them during the next, and possibly final, round of Geneva negotiations, being convened March 2. **********Mr. Shultz, spoke somewhat cautiously about the prospects for moving toward Arab-Israeli negotiations during his trip later this week to the Middle East. He leaves Wednesday for Israel and will visit Jordan and Egypt. **********''I don't think many people give me much chance,'' he said. ''That's the drift of the questions everywhere - intense skepticism.'' **********But he said: ''I believe if there are some chances, even if the chances are small, it's worth trying. You can't be too afraid of failing.'' **********The trouble, he said, was that all sides tended to take extreme positions. Perhaps, he added, the current turmoil - the violent clashes between Israeli troops and Palestinian Arabs in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip -would move the parties to stop insisting on their extreme views. **********Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Shevardnadze were very hard on their own negotiators in the Moscow meetings, the official said, chastising them for what the official called ''lassitude'' and pressing them to get down to serious and intensive work. Mr. Shultz also pressed his negotiators. **********But another official said that the Russians had resisted including in a joint statement a commitment to complete three side provisions to the prospective treaty by March 22, when Mr. Shevardnadze is scheduled to visit Washington. **********The three protocols would include provisions for inspections, elimination of nuclear weapons and data on the location of bases and production sites. Mr. Shultz said the aim would be to produce largely competed drafts within the next month."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/17/business/company-news-pilgrim-will-buy-hanson-fire-units.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-08-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 185, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pilgrim Will Buy Hanson Fire Units", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Pilgrim Will Buy Hanson Fire Units", "body_text": " **********Hanson Industries, a British industrial management company, said it had agreed to sell most of its worldwide fire-detection operations to Pilgrim House Group P.L.C., a British engineering group, for $265.8 million.

If such a policy were permanently instituted, it would be the first time that ordinary Chinese have been given a say in the running of the Government. Defends Development Strategy **********The party leader also defended his plan to step up the economic development of the eastern coastal provinces even if it meant that the country's vast interior lagged behind. His proposal has stirred opposition within the leadership and created strains in the Government's policy-making apparatus, according to many diplomats here. **********China's national television devoted the opening 10 minutes of its half-hour news broadcast this evening to shots of Mr. Zhao, dressed in a European-cut gray suit, speaking to the 175-member Central Committee at the Great Hall of the People in central Beijing. **********His address comes just one week before the opening of the annual session of China's nominal legislature, the National People's Congress. The congress will ratify laws designed to continue the restructuring of the economy, including a measure that would grant the managers of state enterprises much more autonomy and power. **********In his address, Mr. Zhao noted that in reordering China's economy, conflicts between ''different interest groups'' were certain to occur. ''Therefore,'' he said, ''at present and for a considerable time to come consultations and dialogues should be held to insure the smooth implementation of the various measures taken in reforms, to mitigate social contradictions and consolidate social stability and unity.'' 'Solicit Opinions of the People' **********''In the future, draft laws involving major reforms, as well as plans for major reforms such as the price readjustment and the labor and wage reform, should solicit the opinions of the people from all walks of life before and after they are being decided upon,'' Mr. Zhao said. **********Until now, the party and Government have largely ignored popular opinion in setting out national policy. This practice has eroded somewhat in the past year with the proliferation of public opinion polls, but there remains no systematic institutional process through which the average Chinese citizen can voice his or her views. **********The extraodinary attention devoted to Mr. Zhao's remarks suggested that there was recognition within the leadership that the party and Government have failed to respond effectively to citizen needs and complaints. **********''We must speak the truth to the whole people about major incidents concerning social stability, explain policies and enlist people's support and cooperation through extensive dialogues,'' he said. Mr. Zhao also spoke at length on the economy, promoting his coastal development scheme and stressing the need to rely on market forces rather than Government controls to improve the economy. **********Western diplomats here say Mr. Zhao's proposal to spur greater industrialization of the coast has encountered resistence from others in the leadership concerned about disparities between the coastal regions and the poorer interior of China, which has benefited far less from the new economic policies.

Bass Group won a crucial court ruling yesterday against Macmillan Inc. that will prevent the publishing and information company's planned restructuring into two separate companies. **********The Bass Group will now be allowed to proceed with its proposed tender offer of $73 a share, or about $2 billion, for the giant publishing and information company. People close to the Texas group said it was likely to proceed with the tender offer. **********The preliminary injunction, by Judge Jack B. Jacobs of Delaware Chancery Court, is significant in that it appears to limit Macmillan management's ability to gain control over the company if a higher bid is on the table. Move to Appeal Decision **********Macmillan said yesterday that it would appeal the decision in Delaware Supreme Court. Macmillan's appeal will rest on management's argument that the restructuring does not represent a sale of the campany. By this reasoning, the company was not for sale, so management had not rejected a higher bid. **********It is expected that a decision on the appeal could be made well before the end of the period of 20 business days during which a tender offer is open. **********The battle between the parties started when the Bass Group offered $64 a share in cash for the company. Macmillan countered with a restructuring package that offered each shareholder $52.35 in cash, a $4.50 principal amount of Macmillan subordinated debentures, a share in the Macmillan Publishing Company and a half share in the Macmillan Information Company. **********The Macmillan plan was valued at a base price of $64.15 a share. That package's ultimate value would, of course, have depended on the value of the stock. Macmillan's top management would have owned 39 percent of the information company. **********The Bass Group countered with a bid of $73 a share in cash, or, alternatively, a restructuring comparable to that proposed by Macmillan but with a cash componenet of $58 a share. Restructuring Is Criticized **********In his decision the judge criticized both the price of the restructuring and its treatment of top management. Management, which owned less than 5 percent of the company before the restructuring, would have owned 39 percent of one of the two new companies created in its aftermath. **********The restructuring plan had been widely perceived as unusually generous to Macmillan's top management. **********The judge's decision said, ''The proposed 39 percent level of management's equity ownership is derived from valuation methods that are either incorrect or, at the very least, highly questionable.'' **********''Each of the Bass offers is clearly superior to the restructuring,'' the decision stated. **********In explaining the decision, Michael Klein, a partner at Wilmer Cutler & Pickering, the law firm that represented the Bass Group, said that the court had found Macmillan's management has misled its board about whether Bass presented a threat. **********As Mr. Klein explained it: ''The threat relevant in Delaware is not a threat to management itself, but corporate policy and effectiveness. The court found the Bass Group was not a threat to that, as management had told the directors. The result was that the board was misled into adopting the restructuring.'' **********The Bass Group still faces other obstacles to the takeover of Macmillan. In particular, Macmillan already has a ''poison pill'' plan in place that would go into effect with the acquisition of more than 15 percent of its stock by an investor. **********It is possible that Macmillan could waive the poison pill should a tender offer succeed. Or the Bass Group could sue to have it waived, contending that the poison pill is being used to block an offer, rather than to bring about an orderly auction of the company."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/23/business/new-york-cost-gap-shrinks.html": {"writer_name": "Constance Hays", "pub_date": "1988-07-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 444, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New York Cost Gap Shrinks", "print_headline": "New York Cost Gap Shrinks", "body_text": " **********Consumer prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent last month in the New York-northeastern New Jersey area, continuing a pattern of moderate increases over the last nine months, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics reported yesterday. **********The consistency was good news for those who had feared a sharp rise stemming from inflationary pressures in a period of low regional unemployment, said Jesse Benjamin, the assistant regional commissioner for labor statistics. **********The national price rise was also three-tenths of 1 percent in June. The regional increase was closer to that of the rest of the country than at any time since 1982, Mr. Benjamin said.

Grocery store foods cost 1.3 percent more in June than they did in May. **********The drop in prices for apparel was largely credited to seasonal sales by retailers, Mr. Benjamin said. The apparel and upkeep index dropped 3.1 percent in June, most of which was traced to a 4.7 percent decline in women's and girls' clothing. **********Other goods posted a seasonal surge. Utility companies added their summer surcharges in June, helping to account for a 12.4 percent increase in electricity costs.

Gasoline prices rose 1.4 percent, after declines of 6.5 percent for the period between last September and May. **********The regional price index stood at 123.1 in June, meaning that it required $12.31 to buy what $10 would have purchased in the 1982-84 base period.

Teams Will Enter Afghan Areas", "body_text": " **********The first teams of United Nations aid and development experts are expected to enter Afghanistan next month to begin rebuilding the economy and caring for returning refugees, the coordinator of relief operations says. **********The official, Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, said in an interview this week that the teams would head first for relatively peaceful areas of the country where fighting has stopped. Their first task will be to rebuild villages and revive agriculture to encourage the return of refugees. **********''We will go first to these peace zones and get life going again properly with the help of people still there so that gradually refugees will be attracted back,'' he said. **********Prince Sadruddin, an Iranian who lives in Geneva, has held many positions at the United Nations, including that of High Commissioner for Refugees. He is the son of the late Aga Khan and the uncle of the current Aga Khan, the spiritual leader of the 15 million Ismaili Moslems. His appointment followed American demands that Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar appoint a single coordinator for Afghan relief efforts to prevent duplication or quarrels between United Nations agencies over their areas of responsibility. Will Set Up 'Peace Zones' **********The Prince said he planned to establish such ''peace zones'' in areas controlled by the Marxist Government of President Najibullah and those controlled by the nationalist guerrillas who have been trying to overthrow it. **********But he emphasized that the United Nations planned to channel its assistance directly to needy people through village councils, religious leaders and humanitarian organizations and would not allow its aid to be used for political ends by either side in the eight-year-old conflict. **********Prince Sadruddin said that when he visited the area last month, both the Najibullah Government and the guerrilla leaders assured him they would let United Nations aid and relief agencies operate freely in areas they control and would not try take advantage of them. **********In Teheran, which he also visited, Prince Sadruddin said Iranian leaders told him they would let United Nations officials enter Afghanistan through Iran if they wished. Iran, like the guerrillas, has not accepted the Geneva accords in May under which the Soviet Union agreed to withdraw the troops it sent to support the Kabul regime. Confident of 'a Good Start' **********''There was a lot of nervousness at first about whether the Geneva agreements would hold and whether the United Nations would be able to start reconstruction work,'' Prince Sadruddin said. ''But all parties say they want the relief operations to be a success so I'm really confident now we can get off to a good start.'' Despite the Soviet withdrawal, however, there is little expectation that the Afghan fighting will end soon. **********Prince Sadruddin was speaking after initial talks with prospective donors to the appeal by the United Nations for $1.1 billion in economic assistance for Afghanistan. **********The aid program for Afghanistan, which will be spread out over 18 months, is about equally divided between emergency food and rehabilitation assistance for returning refugees and development aid intended to get the country's largely agricultural economy working again. **********It will be carried out by several United Nations relief and development agencies, including the World Health Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization, the World Food Program, the United Nations Children's Fund and the United Nations Development Program. $25 Million Is Pledged At a meeting on Tuesday, countries that included Japan, Finland, Switzerland, Denmark and the Netherlands pledged a total of about $25 million in new aid for Afghanistan. Many other countries, including the Soviet Union and the United States, said they also hoped to contribute. **********Speaking for the United States, an Assistant Secretary of State, Richard S. Williamson, said the Reagan Administration would provide $119 million in economic and food assistance to Afghanistan this year as it did last, primarily through the World Food Program, despite budgetary difficulties. If possible, the Administration will ''augment this large program particularly with increased food contributions,'' Mr. Williamson said. **********Prince Sadruddin said he had also asked Canada to put the United Nations development plan for Afghanistan on the agenda of the annual summit meeting meeting of the seven major non-Communist industrial powers. The meeting begins in Toronto on Sunday. Land Mines Hinder Efforts **********A major difficulty facing relief and aid officials are the huge quantities of land mines scattered around the Afghan countryside by the two sides, Prince Sadruddin said. **********Just how difficult a task the United Nations faces in getting rural life back to normal in Afghanistan is underlined by a report on Afghan agriculture published by a Swedish humanitarian organization, the Swedish Committee for Afghanistan. **********On the basis of a survey of farms carried out by a team of 68 specially trained guerrillas, the Swedish committee estimates that agricultural output last year was about a third of what it was in 1978, the year before the Soviet Union sent in its forces to shore up the Kabul regime. **********The committee says that a third of all farms have been abandoned and that crop yields have dropped by about half. It estimates that on average an Afghan farmer has 70 percent fewer sheep and goats than in 1978 and 40 percent fewer draft oxen."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/12/business/company-news-details-given-on-splitting-mgm-ua.html": {"writer_name": "Geraldine Fabrikant", "pub_date": "1988-07-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 837, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Details Given On Splitting MGM/UA", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Details Given On Splitting MGM/UA", "body_text": " **********The MGM/UA Communications Company yesterday announced the details of a complicated reorganization plan through which the company would be divided into two entities: United Artists and MGM. **********Confirming reports of the breakup plan, the company said that Barris Industries would then acquire 25 percent of MGM for roughly $100 million. The Barris management team includes Burt Sugarman, an entrepreneur, and two movie producers, Jon Peters and Peter Guber. **********According to the company, Kirk Kerkorian, the entrepreneur whose Tracinda Corporation owns 82 percent of the stock in MGM/UA Communications, has decided that current MGM/UA shareholders will be offered 18 percent of the spun-off MGM for $8 a share. Stake in Distribution Unit **********After the deal's completion, MGM would consist of a motion picture and television production unit, and it would retain a 50 percent interest in a distribution operation jointly owned by MGM and United Artists. Three years ago MGM sold its library of 3,600 films, which includes ''Gone With the Wind'' and ''The Wizard of Oz,'' to Ted Turner, the television entrepreneur. **********The newly formed United Artists Corporation will own a 950-film library that includes the ''Pink Panther'' and James Bond films. That company, presumably 82 percent owned by Mr. Kerkorian, would be debt-free. It would continue to produce and distribute feature films. **********Under the complex plan, Tracinda would buy 82 percent of the new MGM's 50 million shares, or 41 million shares, for about $320 million. Of this amount, Tracinda, in turn, would sell 12 million shares, or 25 percent, of MGM to Barris. Mr. Kerkorian would thus be left with at least 57 percent of the newly formed MGM. Bank Debt to Be Retired **********Of the $8 received for each share, MGM will keep $2, or a total of $100 million, and United Artists will receive $6, or a total of $300 million. MGM plans to use its proceeds from the deal to finance motion pictures. United Artists would retire its $230 million in bank debt, leaving it with roughly $400 million in long-term debt. **********The deal is, in effect, a capital infusion and a restructuring. Harold Vogel, an entertainment analyst at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, said that ''it is a way for Kerkorian to increase the asset value of United Artists, of which he will still own 82 percent.'' **********''The refinancing plan reduces United Artists' debt burden, retains the valuable film library and puts the costly deficit-financed television operation into MGM,'' he added. ''And even though Tracinda appears to be spending as much as $300 million to buy stock in MGM, that money in fact goes back to United Artists, controlled by Kerkorian, to help reduce its debt, thereby increasing the value of his equity stake.'' Agreements on Shares **********If the public, which now owns 18 percent of MGM/UA Communications, does not buy all the offered stock in the new company, Mr. Kerkorian has agreed to buy the unsold shares. Barris has an option to buy an additional nine million MGM shares. **********MGM/UA said it was considering further transactions that, if they came to fruition, could result in the stockholders of United Artists being offered the opportunity to dispose of all or part of their shares. This seemed to imply that United Artists shareholders could be bought out at a premium, although no buyer was mentioned. **********Yesterday the shares of MGM/UA closed at $15, dropping 75 cents on the day. Analysts expect the stock in the new United Artists to trade at $12 or less. Equal Number of Nominees **********Under the plan, Mr. Guber would be chairman and chief executive of MGM and Mr. Peters would be president and chief operating officer. Tracinda and Barris would each name an equal number of nominees to the MGM board. **********Mark Manson, an analyst at Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette, said: ''United Artists is the asset play, but MGM may emerge as a company with earnings potential if Guber and Peters are successful. Kerkorian has put up money, but he now has two pieces of stock that may be worth more than MGM/UA was alone.'' Films and Television Shows **********Barris is engaged in the development and production of films and television shows. It is also involved in the production of original programming for television, including ''The Newlywed Game.'' The credits of Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters include ''The Color Purple,'' ''The Witches of Eastwick'' and ''Flashdance.'' **********The deal, which was negotiated very quietly, apparently came as a surprise to many at MGM/UA, and it was not clear whether Lee Rich, chairman, would remain with the company. **********The futures of several other top executives - Alan Ladd Jr., head of MGM's film production operation; David Gerber, head of its television operation, and Anthony Thomopolous, who runs United Artists' film production business - are also unclear."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/12/business/your-money-caution-advised-on-bankruptcy.html": {"writer_name": "Clint Willis", "pub_date": "1988-03-12", "snippet": "LEAD: Filing for personal bankruptcy is often the only way to solve some debt problems.

But lawyers and credit counselors warn that bankruptcy has serious consequences and they urge people to consider it only as a last resort. **********Filing for personal bankruptcy is often the only way to solve some debt problems. But lawyers and credit counselors warn that bankruptcy has serious consequences and they urge people to consider it only as a last resort. **********Generally, two forms of bankruptcy are suitable for individuals. The most common is a Chapter 7 filing, in which a debtor surrenders most of his property to a court-appointed trustee who sells the property and distributes proceeds to creditors. A Chapter 13 filing calls for the debtor to present the court with a plan for repaying debts from assets and future income. **********People who complete bankruptcy proceedings are free from obligations to most of their past creditors. However, they remain responsible for certain obligations, which include alimony and child support, student loans and some taxes. **********Routine personal bankruptcy proceedings can cost from $200 to $2,000 in legal and court fees. But there is more to calculate than just the immediate cost. A bankruptcy can remain on an individual's credit record for up to 10 years. As a result, such individuals have trouble obtaining home mortgages, auto loans and other types of credit, and sometimes have to pay higher interest rates. Some landlords are reluctant to accept tenants with poor credit records. **********Filing for bankruptcy may also damage a person's career. ''Some employers assume that a bankruptcy filing indicates that a person is irresponsible or untrustworthy,'' said Frances Smith, director of the Consumer Credit Institute at the American Financial Services Association, a trade group in Washington. **********In spite of such drawbacks, the number of bankruptcies has sharply increased during recent years. Non-business bankruptcies rose from 298,000 in 1985 to 473,000 in 1987, according to the American Financial Services Association. The increase ''is a combination of the economic times and the reduced social stigma attached to bankruptcy,'' said Edward S. Cowen, chairman of the committee on bankruptcy and corporate reorganization of the Bar Association of the City of New York. **********People who guarantee loans to businesses sometimes declare personal bankruptcy when the ventures fail. Circumstances like prolonged illness or job loss also account for many bankruptcies. **********And, of course, extravagant spending leads to many bankruptcies. Credit counselors advise people to keep careful records of their spending, draw up a strict budget, put away credit cards and pay off excess consumer debt before they are forced to file for bankruptcy. **********Debtors who fall behind on payments still need to keep in contact with their creditors. ''It is a bad idea for a person to ignore phone calls and letters from creditors,'' said Grant Nicholls, president of Personal Financial Advisers in Hackettstown, N.J. ''That only encourages them to take stronger steps to recover their money.'' **********But whatever the reason for their financial problems, very few people actually need to file for bankruptcy. ''I see a lot of people filing for bankruptcy when they shouldn't even consider it,'' said Ed Creel, a partner at Creel, Atwood & Phillips, a Dallas law firm. **********As a first step, people should call their creditors and offer to work out a plan for repaying debts. Many creditors will agree to extend a loan's repayment period or reduce its interest rate, because such arrangements may save the expense of collection efforts and legal action. **********Individuals who are unable to come to terms with their creditors should contact a nonprofit credit counselor before resorting to bankruptcy. There are 345 nonprofit counseling agencies affiliated with the National Foundation for Consumer Credit in Silver Spring, Md. ''Half of the people who go through bankruptcy could avoid it by going to a consumer credit counseling service,'' said Ken Scott, a spokesman for the foundation. **********If necessary, a credit counselor will approach creditors and negotiate a repayment plan. Such plans typically call for the counseling agency to collect money from the debtor each month and distribute it to creditors. **********But people who are sued for repayment of debt or who face imminent foreclosure on their home may have little alternative but to file for bankruptcy. That will gain them temporary protection from creditors while they work out a plan to discharge debts. Individuals planning such a move should hire a lawyer who specializes in personal bankruptcy to help them fill out the necessary forms and deal with creditors. **********A lawyer can also help an individual decide which form of bankruptcy to select. Under a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, the debtors retain their assets and are allowed three to five years to repay debts. However, during the period of repayment, they must devote a sizable portion of their income to repaying debts. **********Individuals who are eager to make a fresh start may prefer to file for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which requires liquidation of assets to satisfy creditors. But first, such individuals should consider which of their assets will be exempt from liquidation, lawyers say. **********Exemptions vary between states. In Texas, for example, individuals can retain their homes and personal possessions valued at $15,000, as well as insurance and pension and profit-sharing benefits, Mr. Creel said. Other states are far less liberal. In New York, for example, people who file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy are only permitted to keep household furniture, clothes, some appliances and personal possessions and $10,000 of equity in a home. **********People who file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy cannot file for bankruptcy again for another six years. People who choose Chapter 13 bankruptcy, however, face no such restriction."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/01/business/the-media-business-advertising-y-r-wins-campaign-for-british-reserves.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1988-06-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 133, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Y.&R.

The company, which designs and makes minisupercomputers, changed its name to Convex when it learned that another company operated under the name Parsec. Convex awarded stock bonuses (ranging from 25 shares to several thousand) to its workers. **********After the company went public in October 1986, Mr. Kimmel said his options had a net worth of more than $200,000. ''To me, that's a lot of money,'' he said. **********Mr. Kimmel, who has not remarried, lives in a three-bedroom house in an upper-income area of Dallas. He used some of his profits from the exercised stock options to make home improvements - landscaping the front and side lawns and adding a hot tub. He also spent about $8,000 to restore a 18-year-old Datsun 240Z sports car. **********Since he had not yet devised an investment strategy, at first Mr. Kimmel put his money in bank accounts earning taxable interest, but realizing he could do better, he asked IDS Financial Services, a division of the American Express Company, to send him information on financial planning. **********IDS put him in touch with Shawn A. Taylor, a personal financial planner in the Richardson, Tex., office, and, over the past year and a half, they worked out a strategy for both his immediate needs and his key long-term goal of retiring at the age of 55. **********Mr. Kimmel has since put more than 80 percent of his cash holdings into three types of IDS products: real estate limited partnerships; several growth-oriented mutual funds; and fixed-income assets such as money market accounts and IDS certificates, which are similar to bank C.D.'s. **********The real estate investments, which amount to around $30,000, are illiquid, but are meant to generate long-term capital appreciation and be an inflation hedge. **********The mutual funds were purchased to produce capital appreciation as well as dividend and interest income. The fixed-income assets, Mr. Taylor said, are to provide steady current revenue and quick access to funds in case of emergencies. **********Like most investors, Mr. Kimmel is concerned about Federal income tax. As a result, he has placed about $50,000 in annuities with the IDS Life Insurance Company. Contributions to the annuity are not tax deductible, but all investment income accrues tax-free until withdrawal. **********Under the IDS variable annuities, Mr. Kimmel can allocate his contributions among a family of mutual funds, including stock, bond and money market funds. **********Mr. Taylor advised Mr. Kimmel to place only part of his funds in tax-deferred investments because premature withdrawals are taxable, and there is a 10 percent penalty on withdrawals before age 59 1/2. **********Mr. Kimmel also participates in a company-sponsored 401(k) plan, to which he contributes $7,300 annually, the maximum allowed by law. This key area in his portfolio gives him immediate tax savings, he said, as well as tax-deferral on the earnings. **********His mid-year meeting with Mr. Taylor is perhaps the pivotal point of Mr.Kimmel's investment planning. This is when they review his portfolio to determine what changes, if any, need to be made. **********This year, a key area of discussion was how to avoid the alternative minimum tax. Under the revised tax code, Congress raised the alternative minimum tax to 21 percent, from 20 percent, and has lengthened the list of tax breaks that have to be added back to income in computing the alternative tax. In addition there is a narrower gap between the alternative tax rate and the highest regular tax rate, which has dropped to 33 percent from 50 percent. **********Mr. Kimmel's salary, which amounts to more than $50,000, combined with his investments, place him in the highest tax level. So Mr. Taylor advised him to move into some tax-exempt products like the Liberty partnership, which invests in low income rental property. Mr. Kimmel invested $5,000 in Liberty and will receive an $800 tax credit for the investment. **********Since last year's market plunge Mr. Kimmel has become more cautious, although his portfolio was not harshly affected by the crash. But to minimize risk without abandoning the stock market, for the past year he has been using a strategy called dollar cost averaging, whereby he invests a certain amount into the equity markets each week. The result is that he gets more shares when the price is low and fewer when it is high. This system reduces the average cost per share. **********Mr. Kimmel said he is planning to diversify his portfolio even further during the next year. ''I want to be prepared for the next time the market slumps,'' he said. ''With a diversified portfolio, I can withstand the ups and downs of the economy.''  A Couple's Strategies **********Steve and Fern Schapiro were married two days before the stock market crash, and when the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled more than 500 points, they were honeymooning in the British West Indies. **********A week before the wedding, the couple bought a railroad stock option at $3.50. By the time they returned from their honeymoon, the option, which had risen to $11, had fallen to $9. While most investors were dumping stocks in the hope of preventing further losses, the Schapiros held on. They finally sold at $3. **********The Schapiros acknowledge that holding on was not one of their smartest investment decisions, but said they were able to write the loss off on their tax return. **********The pair, who last year earned somewhere near $125,000 between them, consider themselves to be a typical upper-middle income couple. Mr. Schapiro, who is 30 years old and a graduate of the University of Texas, where he earned an M.B.A. in real estate finance, works as a commercial mortgage broker for the New York Urban Servicing Company in Manhattan. **********Mrs. Schapiro, 28 years old, works as a marketing manager for NFO Research Inc., a company that specializes in consumer research based in Greenwich, Conn., and has an M.A. in marketing from Boston University. She says they lead a quiet lifestyle. ''We tend to be neighborhood-type people. Most of our entertaining is done at home.'' According to Mrs. Schapiro, a large part of their salaries is used to pay basic expenses like mortgage payments, maintenance, food and school loans. **********''We are not extravagant, just risky,'' she said, referring to their stock market activities. ''We feel that if we're going into the market and we believe shares are going to rise, we should really put money forth.'' **********They have one clear investment goal -financial independence. To achieve that goal they invest profits from stock transactions in real estate, which they see as the key to their future. **********In 1987, the couple bought an Upper East Side co-op and paid 25 percent down. The high down payment enabled the Schapiros to avoid paying private mortgage insurance and to secure a loan more rapidly with a locked-in rate, since the bank waived income verification. Mrs. Schapiro describes this as their ''biggest investment ever,'' but says it was not done solely for investment purposes. ''We needed a place to live, and this is where and how we want to live.'' **********Mr. and Mrs. Schapiro, who are proud of their knowledge of the markets and real estate, make their own investment plans. ''We have enough knowledge and enough personal contacts in the area to guide us. We don't feel we need to hire a financial consultant,'' said Mrs. Schapiro. **********They do, however, meet at least twice a year with their accountant, to make sure they have not become vulnerable to the alternative minimum tax rate and have not exceeded withholding limitations. **********One of the essential strategies of the couple's real estate investment program is the use of their credit cards and credit lines. While that is relatively expensive credit, the Schapiros say that it pays off because investments they select usually carry the interest payments, mortgage and maintenance charges. ''We seek banks that offer credit cards with lower interest rates,'' said Mrs. Schapiro. ''Currently, we have no equity in our home so we would not qualify for a home-equity loan yet.'' She noted that the approval for credit cards was easily obtained and that together they have ''more than $50,000 in available credit through the credit cards and lines.'' **********Mr. Schapiro said they try to keep between $10,000 and $15,000 in money market accounts so they can move into equity positions quickly. ''At any time I'll take $7,000 in cash and margin to $14,000 on stock,'' said Mr. Schapiro, noting that he favors companies rumored to be involved in takeovers. ''Our theory is that in most cases we will not lose the entire investment,'' he said. **********Some of the investment decisions the Schapiros made last year with the help of their accountant were dictated by the sweeping changes in the Federal tax code. For example, they stopped contributing to their Individual Retirement Accounts because, under the revised rules, individuals who are covered by an employer-sponsored pension plan and have adjusted gross income above $50,000 on a joint return are not entitled to deduct I.R.A. contributions. Instead, they placed 10 percent of Mrs. Schapiro's salary in a company-sponsored 401(k) plan. ''We look at this as our one secure investment,'' Mrs. Schapiro said. **********Although the new tax law still enables homeowners to deduct interest payments on first and second homes, the lure of investment real estate has been severely diminished by the new tax code. But, undeterred, they are currently negotiating a small apartment building in Buffalo. ''Our properties will generate cash flow and will appreciate, and that's the main lure,'' Mr. Schapiro said.  A Caring Grandmother **********One evening long ago, while riding a bus, Ola Mae Rucker spied an advertisement seeking investors to buy desert land in New Mexico. Mrs Rucker, now a 67-year-old retiree, took one of the cards and mailed it. A short time later, representatives of the company were sitting in her home in Brooklyn flashing slides against her living-room wall. **********Mrs. Rucker, who at the time was eager to make an investment, bought three acres - one representing each grandchild. **********That was 22 years ago. Today Mrs. Rucker and her husband, John, 66, live near that land in their retirement home, a one-family brick-stucco in Rio Rancho, N.M., a suburb of Albuquerque. **********The land deal was Mrs. Rucker's first major investment, but a few years later, having developed a taste for real estate investment, she ceased being a renter and bought a home in the East New York section of Brooklyn. From there, she went a step further. Over the years, she bought four more houses as rental properties. Then with the birth of a fourth grandchild, Mrs. Rucker bought another acre of land in 1970, this time in Arizona. **********A deeply religious person, who attributes her prospering affairs to her faith in God, Mrs. Rucker acknowledges that she is the investment strategist of the family and that her husband, while he abides by her decisions, has chosen to be a ''silent'' partner. She became interested in investing by listening to her clients during 20 years as a barber - a career that ended prematurely when she became allergic to the chemicals and hair sprays. At the age of 48, she trained as a nurse's aide and joined Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn. **********The Ruckers went into investment with two goals in mind. In the short term, they hoped to become prosperous themselves; the long-term purpose was to benefit their seven grandchildren. **********To do this, they created a portfolio largely made up of real estate. But it also contains mutual funds, as well as life insurance policies and annuities, purchased with the advice of Lloyd S. Mapp Jr., an account executive at Forest Hills Financial Group Inc., a 10-year-old financial planning concern based in Queens. **********Mr. Mapp has been counseling the Ruckers for nine years. He suggested that they invest in annuities because they provide a safe investment for older individuals. Mrs. Rucker placed about $60,000 in a fixed annuity, in which the premiums are invested in bonds. From this contract, she receives a monthly payment of $550. **********Mr. Mapp also suggested that Mrs. Rucker buy life insurance policies as a way to set up funds for their grandchildren's education. Over the years, she bought five insurance policies, with a total face value of $125,000. **********Mrs. Rucker retired from her job at the hospital in 1985, and last year they moved to New Mexico. **********''The doctor said I needed to be where it was warm, and since we had the land in Rio Rancho, we decided to move here,'' she said. ''Also, it's very affordable.'' **********Mrs. Rucker said she reaped a 30 percent profit when they sold the Brooklyn houses last year to relocate. Most of that money has been reinvested in Rio Rancho, where the Ruckers have bought three homes. In addition to the rental income they receive from two of the properties, they have a combined pension income of more than $2,400 a month and Social Security payments of close to $1,000 a month. **********''In New Mexico, that's more than enough to live on,'' Mrs. Rucker said. **********Mrs. Rucker's portfolio gives her a secure feeling that the grandchildren will be provided for. The one area that seems not to have made any upward progress is the original land that she bought as a result of her bus ride, but Mrs. Rucker remains optimistic. **********''I consider it a good investment because development is due any day now,'' she said. ''All of the town has been built up and the next development would have to be on that land. There's no place else to build.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/25/business/brisk-trading-in-vw.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-03-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 142, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Brisk Trading in VW", "print_headline": "Brisk Trading in VW", "body_text": " **********The West German Government today offered the public its 16 percent stake in Volkswagenwerk A.G., Europe's largest auto maker, and demand was brisk.

The company, which produces athletic shoes and apparel, employs about 100 investigators who track the production of bogus Reebok goods and close copies of Reebok designs in the United States and overseas. **********With its sales growing from $1 million to $1.4 billion in seven years, Reebok, based in Canton, Mass., found that its success had attracted counterfeiting that confused consumers and drew customers away. Problem Is Curbed **********''Our litigation is leveling off these days,'' said Jack Douglas, the company's vice president and general counsel. ''The reason is that we have geared up in the last two years to control the problem, and that seems to have helped to curb much of it.'' **********In fact, international counterfeiting and infringement of design rights appear to have peaked two years ago. As Mr. Douglas put it: ''There was a substantial amount of copying of Reebok designs, especially of apparel. It's easy enough to do. All one needs is a silk-screen machine and a garage. Footwear counterfeiting is another matter. You would need a factory.'' **********Levi Strauss, the big San Francisco-based clothing company, also said that illegal copying of its jeans had declined. Prevalent in Europe **********''We're in the best shape we've been in in years,'' said Kim Durgen, a spokeswoman for Levi Strauss. Counterfeiting and copying of Levi design features were much more widely practiced in Europe and Asia than in the United States, she said. **********In 1986 and 1987, several European countries enacted strong legislation against counterfeiting and several East Asian countries have taken steps to curb the problem, Ms. Durgen said. In addition, the weak dollar has made American exports more attractive, reducing the demand for counterfeits of such goods, she said. **********''But for Levi Strauss, Thailand is the one country where we continue to have problems with counterfeiting because of the absence of strict controls,'' Ms. Durgen said. 'We Sue Everyone' **********Neal Gordon, vice president and general counsel of Cartier International Inc. of New York, finds that ''there are definitely fewer Cartier counterfeits out in the market.'' **********Cartier has been aggressively fighting counterfeiters for years. ''We sue everyone who counterfeits our design trademarks,'' Mr. Gordon said. **********''Presently, there are only two lawsuits pending, but we have been seizing counterfeits from street peddlers under court order,'' he said. ''But we only sue for a trademark infringement when our name isn't on the watch. When it is, we simply seize the item with the court's approval.'' **********At Reebok, the company's rapid growth was not accompanied by the development of systems to control counterfeiting. There was no legal department and no investigator. But as the number of copied T-shirts and sweatshirts grew, the company hired Mr. Douglas in March 1986 to set up a legal department. Protected by Law **********Four more attorneys and investigators were hired. From the end of 1986 through 1987, the focus was on tracking down counterfeit Reebok apparel. Since then Reebok began advertising that its design features were protected by law. **********In an Aug. 15 advertisment in The New York Times, Reebok declared in a headline: ''Copies of our shoes won't hold up in any court.'' The copy read in part: ''Those who've purchased copies of our shoes have been very disappointed. They just don't hold up like a pair of Reebok athletic shoes. But those who've manufactured and sold copies of our shoes suffered even greater disappointments. In a court of law, they don't have a leg to stand on.'' **********Reebok, with the aid of police, has made raids in recent years in flea markets in California, North Carolina, Texas, and Tennessee to seize counterfeit Reebok apparel and shoes. In the New York area, its investigators swooped down on flea markets in Englishtown, N.J., and Garden City, L.I. Such seizures are legal under a 1984 Federal anti-counterfeiting law if a local police officer takes part. Fines up to $100,000 **********''We've taken thousands of such items,'' Mr. Douglas said. ''They're typically of poor quality. We destroy them all.'' Fines for counterfeiters awarded by the court or in out-of-court settlements can run from $500 to as much as $100,000 for a large quantity, he said. **********The counterfeit products sometimes travel a circuitous path before they are offered to consumers. **********In one case, Mr. Douglas said, Reebok found that the shoes ordered by a California retailer were produced by a Taiwanese company, transferred to a second Taiwanese company, shipped to Singapore, then to Japan and later to Belgium."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/12/business/company-news-new-bank-product.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-05-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 118, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Bank Product", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; New Bank Product", "body_text": " **********Into the hotly contested New York City consumer-banking market, the Chemical Bank has introduced a product aimed specifically at recent college graduates.

Mr. Tierney and his wife, Barbara, were visiting the cemetery with their children, Sarah, 8, and Lauren, 3, to see the grave of Mrs. Tierney's uncle. Like the others buried at Henri-Chapelle, the uncle, Robert D.

''I said 'Germany' and she just didn't understand how that could be.'' A Task for German Prisoners **********The cemetery, in fact, was converted from temporary graves after the war by German prisoners. They leveled the ground and lined up the markers. Now there are acres of plantings among the lines of white marble crosses and Stars of David, and the beds of rhododendron shelter incessant birds that stopped trilling Saturday only at the memorial volley. Burt Dewey of Earlville, Ill., 74 years old, was superintendent of the cemetery for 31 years until he retired in 1976. He still lives nearby and surveyed his handiwork proudly. **********''That's 31 years of my life you're looking at,'' he said. He remembered that the former prisoners used to come back to see him, and that one even brought a prospective bride from Germany for his approval. ''I told him she looked kind of strict to me, like a policeman,'' Mr. Dewey recalled. ''A year later he came back and said 'Mr. Dewey, you had reason, she won't leave me alone.''' **********At Saturday's ceremony the principal address was delivered by Adm. Powell F. Carter, who is the United States representative on the NATO Military Committee. He talked of eternal vigilance. ''These young men died to give humanity one last chance to learn the follies of weakness in the face of danger,'' the admiral said. **********Afterward some of the visitors walked among the graves, the first names a roll-call - Victor, Harold, Seymour, Burl; Danny, Grady, Baltazar, Verne. Mr. Dewey said so many graves out there in rows used to bother him. ''I kept wondering what they were there for,'' he said. He Returns to Place a Wreath **********Among the tombstones Weldon E. Limmroth of Mobile, Ala., crouched with his camera for a view. Mr. Limmroth, a retired movie-theater owner, was a staff sergeant in the war, laying signal wire for the Third Armored Division. He had landed at Normandy in 1944 and his unit had passed near the place where the cemetery is. He had come back to place a wreath in memory of his buddies. **********Sometimes, he said, the war seemed a long time ago, but sometimes it was still close. ''Well you know I remember we fought in through here,'' he said.

The lack of information about the crash and the length of the investigation have prompted speculation that the plane's mechanical system failed because of tampering. **********The officials said the findings of the American investigating team, made up of experts from the Air Force and Lockheed, had been forwarded to the Pakistanis, but they provided no details. Thirty people were killed in the crash, including Arnold L. Raphel, the American Ambassador to Pakistan, and Brig. Gen. Herbert M. Wassom, the American military attache there. Pakistani Elections Cited **********Officials at the State and Defense Departments said they would not hear anything definitive from the Pakistanis about their investigation before elections were held there Nov. 16. But they said the United States had received assurances from Pakistan that it would share its findings with Washington. **********There has been widespread speculation that President Zia was the victim of an assassination plot. Suspects have ranged from his domestic opponents to Afghans, Russians and Indians. Recent reports that Pakistani military officers sabotaged the plane were dismissed by both United States and Pakistani officials as idle speculation and rumor. No evidence has been presented to indicate that any country or group was responsible. **********Phyllis E. Oakley, deputy to the State Department spokesman, said that Pakistan was responsible for the investigation and that the United States provided only technical assistance. Mrs. Oakley said it was up to the Pakistanis to make any announcement on the investigation. The Pakistani Air Force attache in Washington, Nasar Mahmoud Butt, said that the investigation was still in progress and that no statement could be made until it was completed. **********American officials discounted reports that a bomb was smuggled aboard President Zia's plane or that the plane was shot down by an anti-aircraft missile. According to United States Government experts, if the plane had exploded in the air, wreckage would be widely scattered. **********Reports from the scene indicate the wreckage was largely in one area, although some pieces, including an engine, were said to be some distance from the fuselage, indicating that at least part of the plane came apart in the air. No Flight Recorder **********American officials said the investigation was hampered because the plane carried no flight recorder, commonly known as a black box. Most American C-130's do not carry flight recorders either. If a flight recorder had been aboard, experts say, it would have provided information on the status of the plane and its flight systems at the time of the crash. **********In the absence of the recorder, the cause of the crash must be deduced from a detailed examination of the wreckage and the pattern of the debris. The crash site was disturbed by those first at the scene and by the removal of the remains of the victims before the arrival of the American investigators. This reportedly made it difficult for the team to reconstruct what had occurred. **********One of the mysteries is the absence of information on radio transmissions from the stricken aircraft. Normally an airplane in distress transmits emergency radio calls if the pilot and crew remain capable. There has been no hint that President Zia's aircraft did so. **********The existence of such a transmission would be crucial in piecing together the puzzle of the crash. Officials decline to say whether distress signals were sent in the final moments of the flight or whether there was evidence that the crew was incapacitated."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/14/business/company-news-essex-chemical-spurns-hostile-bid.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-06-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 228, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Essex Chemical Spurns Hostile Bid", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Essex Chemical Spurns Hostile Bid", "body_text": " **********The Essex Chemical Corporation formally rejected the $119 million hostile tender offer from the Swiss-based Gurit-Heberlein A.G. and disclosed that it was negotiating with several banks and certain unidentified parties about ''possible alternative transactions'' to the unwelcome bid.

Gen. Prosper Avril has wielded power in Haiti for years. Until now he had been content with influencing his poor country from the shadows. **********But on Saturday and Sunday he stepped out of the shadows, seizing control of the Government in a military coup and ousting Lieut. Gen. Henri Namphy, a man he had twice helped bring to power. **********Speaking of the new leader, a diplomat in Port-au-Prince, the capital of Haiti, said: ''The consensus is that Avril is a much smarter man than Namphy. He is worldly and recognizes that Haiti requires a lot of changes if it is to get back on its feet.'' **********General Avril declared himself president on Sunday in an early-morning television address. Aide to the Duvaliers **********A graduate of the Haitian military academy, the 50-year-old soldier was a member of the Presidential Guard under the late dictator Francois Duvalier. Later, he was a close adviser to Mr. Duvalier's son and successor as the so-called President-for-life, Jean-Claude. **********His relationship with the younger Duvalier was not always smooth. Mr. Duvalier, who succeeded his father in 1971, forced General Avril, who was a junior officer at the time, into retirement in 1983. But three years later, when Mr. Duvalier was fighting a popular revolt, Mr. Duvalier promoted him to full colonel. **********According to Reuters, officials close to the Government have said the general was Mr. Duvalier's closest financial confidant during that time and kept accounts of all the dictator's financial transactions. The Associated Press reported that he was believed to have had an office at the National Bank, where he reportedly managed Jean-Claude Duvalier's special bank accounts. **********In 1986, when Mr. Duvalier fled Haiti for France, ending 28 years of dictatorship by the family, the deposed president is believed to have taken hundreds of millions of dollars from the impoverished republic. **********Yesterday, a businessman in Port-au-Prince who has had extensive dealings with the general described General Avril as ''a very intelligent guy, a wheeler-dealer.'' Humble Beginnings **********General Avril, who is married to a nurse, is a career soldier of humble origin. He was born in the small town of Thomageau, a short distance from the capital. The A.P. reported that he is believed to be a millionaire. **********General Avril graduated at the head of his class from the military academy, where he was a classmate of Brig. Gen. Williams Regala, who later would be part of the five-man provisional government that ruled Haiti immediately after the younger Duvalier fled into exile. **********General Avril is said to have few enemies in the army. But his strong links to the Duvalier family prompted violent demonstrations when he joined the Namphy junta as a political adviser in 1986. **********The demonstrators were demanding the ouster from the newly formed government of anyone with links to the Duvaliers, and General Namphy forced then-Colonel Avril to resign. **********But it was a short absence. Colonel Avril became inspector of the Presidential Guard, a job he kept when President Leslie F. Manigat took office on Feb. 7, 1986, after being elected in a military-controlled election. **********Then, in June, Colonel Avril helped General Namphy regain power in a bloodless coup. Colonel Avril was promoted to brigadier general and appointed adjutant general of the army, an administrative post. He later became lieutenant general. **********Despite his staunch support for the Duvalier dictatorship, General Avril has no reputation for cruelty. **********The sergeant in the Presidential Guard who announced on television that General Namphy had been overthrown introduced General Avril as ''the most honest man in the army.'' 'Intelligent and Crafty' **********Nevertheless, Larry Birns, director of the Washington-based Council on Hemispheric Affairs and a critic of United States policy in Haiti, said that when the Duvaliers were in power, General Avril was ''a particularly corrupt figure in the heyday of the regime.'' **********''But he's extremely intelligent,'' Mr. Birns said. ''He's known for being an intelligent and crafty man.'' **********It was not clear what General Avril's political stance might be. He has given few interviews. **********In a rare published comment in March of 1986, shortly after the departure of Jean-Claude Duvalier ended the family dynasty, General Avril told The Manchester Guardian that Haiti would have to wait ''plenty of time'' before calling free elections. **********''You must remember we are starting from zero,'' he told the paper. **********In the same interview, General Avril took a hard line aganst allowing Haitian refugees to return to their country, saying he would maintain a policy of requiring Haitians who are overseas to apply for visas to return to their own country. **********''We can't have people who want to foment disorder,'' he told the British newspaper."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/20/business/several-top-executives-promoted-by-the-times.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-04-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 896, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Several Top Executives Promoted by The Times", "print_headline": "Several Top Executives Promoted by The Times", "body_text": " **********Senior management changes at The New York Times were announced yesterday by Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the newspaper's publisher and chairman and chief executive of The New York Times Company. **********Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr., the assistant publisher, was promoted to deputy publisher with responsibility for news and business departments.

Smith, referring to Pillsbury's shareholders. **********Mr. Smith, in a telephone interview, also said, ''We will not be stampeded into this highly conditional offer.'' Rival Has Dominated the News **********These were Mr. Smith's first public remarks since Grand Metropolitan P.L.C. made its surprise $60-a-share, $5.23 billion offer for Pillsbury on Tuesday. Since then, the British conglomerate had dominated the public arena - holding news conferences in Minneapolis to try to assuage local concerns that it planned to break up Pillsbury, issuing a flurry of news releases and meeting with Minnesota's Governor and other state officials in an effort to win their support. **********Today, however, Mr. Smith, who joined Pillsbury only a few months ago, decided to take the offensive. Citing securities laws, which require him to bring all offers for Pillsbury before its directors, he was careful not to comment on the adequacy of Grand Met's offer. Nor would Mr. Smith say whether Pillsbury had begun talking with other companies that might come to its rescue or whether it was considering a management-led leveraged buyout. Analysts have cited all these alternatives as possibilities. **********But Mr. Smith hinted strongly that he believed that restructuring and capital-investment programs already under way at Pillsbury could produce more than $60 a share for stockholders. The company has said it would reorganize its foods business to eliminate certain administrative layers and would spend $100 million over the next few years to upgrade its Burger King unit. **********''We will be able to flow increased value to our shareholders through our programs,'' Mr. Smith said. **********On Wall Street, however, Mr. Smith faces an uphill battle. The majority of Pillsbury's stock is said to be in the hands of arbitragers, professional investors who generally prefer to get their money now rather than at some unspecified time in the future. And securities analysts, who advise big institutional investors and individuals about their holdings, also appear to be leaning toward Grand Met. 'Go With the Known Offer' **********''There have been many managements in the past who have taken the same rationale as Pillsbury and ultimately couldn't produce on it,'' said Barry Ziegler, an analyst at Tucker, Anthony & R. L. Day. ''It turned out to be a mistake for shareholders.'' **********June D. Page, an analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company, said: ''The question is, Do you want to go with a sure $60 offer, or do you want to bet on Phil Smith and the record of Pillsbury? I'd go with the known offer.'' **********Although he declined to disclose what defenses Pillsbury might try, Mr. Smith said the company would vigorously pursue the reasoning that Grand Met's offer was illegal under ''tied house'' laws. These are statutes in most states that essentially prohibit a manufacturer and distributor of liquor, such as Grand Met, from also selling liquor to the public. Pillsbury's Steak & Ale and Bennigan's restaurant subsidiaries serve liquor, as does the Inter-Continental Hotel chain, which Grand Met is in the process of selling."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/09/business/key-rates-568388.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-08-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 196, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "KEY RATES", "print_headline": "KEY RATES", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/20/business/apple-introduces-a-faster-macintosh-computer.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-09-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 664, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Apple Introduces a Faster Macintosh Computer", "print_headline": "Apple Introduces a Faster Macintosh Computer", "body_text": " **********Apple Computer Inc. today introduced the Macintosh IIx personal computer, which it said performed 10 to 15 percent faster than the current Mac II, the company's most expensive machine. **********The new machine is Apple's first to be based on the Motorola 68030 microprocessor, the chip at the heart of a new generation of personal computers just coming on the market.

Merhige Jr. did not explain the order, noting that an opinion would be filed today in Richmond. But the move follows a request by lawyers for some of the 195,000 claimants who have charged that the trustees have acted in violation of their fiduciary duties by proceeding too slowly. **********The trustees who were removed denied that they had done anything improper. ''All of the trustees have been working in good faith,'' Barbara Blum, one of the trustees, said. **********Meanwhile, people close to the case disclosed yesterday that the trustees had recently agreed to make an initial offer of $700 to $800 to women who used the Dalkon Shield. **********Two sources who asked not to be identified said the trust would also offer a smaller amount to other claimants - husbands whose wives were hurt or children born with defects. **********All the claimants have the right to decline those offers, and a process for evaluating the severity of injuries is being developed.

In September, six lawyers in California who represent more than 100 claimants asked the court to remove the trustees, saying that the trustees were inexperienced and failed to act prudently and expeditiously on a claims center. **********They also said that Ms. Samani should not serve on the board because it was a conflict of interest for a claimant to be a trustee. **********Participants in the case said the judge was angered by the three trustees when they voted to retain the law firm of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft and a partner, Murray Drabkin.

Ultimately, another Federal judge removed Cadwalader after finding that it would be a conflict of interest for the firm that represented the claimants' committee also to represent the trustees. **********Mr. Feinberg and Mr. Saltzburg urged the trustees not to retain Cadwalader. **********''The three people who were removed were all selected by the claimants' committee,'' said one trustee who was ordered off the board and asked not to be identified. ''It's clear to me that this was all about power and control.'' **********A report by a court examiner that was made public last month described a panel deeply divided over many issues critical to the disbursement of the fund. Several said the trust had become bogged down in discord over issues like the role to be played by Judge Merhige and the expenses being incurred by the trust. **********Next week a Federal appeals court in Richmond will hear oral arguments by a group of women who say that the procedure for establishing the compensation fund violates Federal bankruptcy laws."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/30/business/advertising-justamere-gets-account.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1988-03-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 118, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; Justamere Gets Account", "print_headline": "Advertising; Justamere Gets Account", "body_text": " **********Justamere Advertising Agency of Hopatcong, N.J. has announced that it has become agency for the City Federal Services Bank, which, Justamere said, bills some $4 million.

The commission also said it would bring a flexible attitude to case-by-case consideration of external trade problems between now and the end of 1992. **********The declaration came on a day when the commission forecast a 3.5 percent growth rate for its 12 members for 1988 and an increase of 7 percent in industrial investment - the largest percentage increase in 20 years. It cited the preparation of private companies for the post-1992 expanded market as part of the reason for the increased forecast. **********The 12 members are France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Denmark, Ireland, Britain, Greece, Spain and Portugal. 'Fortress Europe' Feared **********The commission's declaration on trade reciprocity, which will serve as a guide in case-by-case negotiations from now to the dropping of the remaining trade barriers among the member states in 1992, comes after repeated expressions of concern by American officials this summer. **********These officials, like other trading partners of the community, fear that the post-1992 market will create a ''Fortress Europe,'' coddling members while repelling outsiders seeking entry to the rich market of 320 million people. Some even fear that any restrictions might be made retroactive, affecting foreign companies already established within the community. **********The commission, represented today by Lord Francis Cockfield of Britain and Willy de Clercq of Belgium, tried to put concerns to rest. ''There can be no question of depriving the subsidiaries of foreign firms already established in community member states of the rights they have acquired,'' their statement said. **********In general, the commission stressed the positive aspects of the expanded market, saying Europe sought to be a partner rather than a opponent. Since exports represent 10 percent of Europe's gross national product compared with 5 percent for the United States', for example, Europe would be foolish to turn protectionist, the commission said. **********The removal of customs barriers among community members at the end of 1992 will mean vastly decreased customs and other formalities for imports. ''Any product which is introduced on the community territory, as long as it satisfies the legislation of the importing country, and is admitted on its markets, will be entitled, as a matter of principle, to the benefit of free circulation throughout the community,'' the declaration said. **********But the commission made it clear that Europe expected equal treatment elsewhere. ''The commission reserves the right to make access to the benefits of 1992 for nonmember countries' firms conditional upon a guarantee of similar opportunities -or at least nondiscriminatory opportunities - in those firms' own countries,'' the declaration said. Grounds for Optimism **********Lord Cockfield said Europe expected the post-1992 market to serve as a spur to world economic growth, much as growth in the third world helped the economic expansion in the 1960's and 1970's before the oil shock and overwhelming debt. **********The commission's economic forecast today, which must be reviewed by the European Parliament and debated by the member states, offered grounds for optimism. The last forecast of growth in 1988 gave an estimate of 2.75 percent, compared with today's 3.5 percent. **********But the commission also noted problem areas: the unemployment rate was expected to stay at about 11 percent, ranging from 20 percent in Spain to 6.5 percent in Portugal; inflationary pressures, while under control in most countries, remained a threat; budget deficits in Greece, Ireland, Italy and Belgium were ''excessive,'' and the widening differences in trade balances among member countries was causing disequilibrium."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/16/business/judge-rules-belzbergs-hid-ashland-stake.html": {"writer_name": "Gregory Robb", "pub_date": "1988-06-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 415, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Judge Rules Belzbergs Hid Ashland Stake", "print_headline": "Judge Rules Belzbergs Hid Ashland Stake", "body_text": " **********A Federal judge ruled today that Marc Belzberg, of the wealthy Belzberg family of Canada, deliberately concealed purchases of Ashland Oil stock. **********The judge found that he had acted to circumvent reporting requirements mandated by Federal securities laws, delaying the disclosure of his family's plans to take over Ashland. **********Mr. Belzberg is the son of Samuel Belzberg, chief executive of First City Financial of Vancouver, British Columbia.

Neither Mr. Greenberg nor Bear, Stearns have been accused of wrongdoing in connection with the stock purchases. **********At the time of the March 4 agreement between Bear, Stearns and the Belzbergs, the Canadians had already accumulated a 4.9 percent stake in Ashland.

All the major firms, Mr. Benedetto said, are chasing after the 300 largest issuers of securities and overwhelming them with advice, while just under that tier is a vast universe of relatively smaller companies unblessed by investment banking services. **********The large firms have to go after the largest companies to create the fees that can pay for their huge overhead, Mr. Benedetto said. A firm lacking such overhead can pick up plenty of business among the neglected smaller companies that have turned to consultants, lawyers, accountants and venture capitalists for financial advice, he said. **********And traditional ''advice driven services'' is what the partners plan with their company, Mr. Benedetto said.

Religious leaders, disappointed at the defeat of the opposition in the presidential elections last December, are standing aloof from politicians. Students, who suffered the most in the fight to win a free election, are also divided, with some retreating to campus issues and others set on a more radical course because they feel that moderation has failed them. **********As a result, President Roh Tae Woo, who was elected on Dec. 16 with 36.6 percent of the vote, and his Government are in a stronger position than ever to consolidate power. Some Opposition Strength **********Diplomats, academics and other political analysts have cautioned that the opposition would not disappear as a political voice. Although divided, the opposition could still win enough seats in the April 26 legislative elections to avert disaster. **********And it may have a potent new issue in the corruption scandal surrounding Chun Kyung Hwan, the younger brother of former President Chun Doo Hwan. The younger Mr. Chun was arrested Thursday on charges of embezzlement. But with the failure of their common goal - to keep the military-backed Roh forces out of power - opposition groups are foundering. **********''The future is not very bright,'' said Choi Jang Jit, an associate professor of political science at Korea University. ''The opposition is failing to build a consensus about what should be its future, because the movement is composed of forces with very different political goals and ideas.'' Pre-existing Fissures **********The South Korean opposition has always been diverse, ranging from conservative politicians to students whose declarations echo the revolutionary left. But they managed to hold together despite Government harassment and suppression, only to fall prey to personal rivalries after the Government capitulated to their demands for democratization. The opposition leaders Kim Dae Jung and Kim Young Sam insisted on running for President, splitting the opposition vote and embittering many former supporters. **********''It was almost a Shakespearean tragedy,'' said a religious leader long sympathetic to the opposition. ''If you are enslaved by the past, you end up killing your friends. The ruling party was harnessing modern techniques such as image-building and how to manage a television campaign. The opposition leadership was still clinging to the past, saying, 'I've done so much and sacrificed myself and therefore the nation must choose me.' '' Issues for Opposition **********Compelling issues remain for the opposition: human rights, abuses of power by the police and by the Korean intelligence agency, the presence in Mr. Roh's Cabinet of officials from the previous administration. But so far the opposition has not been able to make these issues stick. Mr. Roh's Government has scored a number of public relations victories with symbolic gestures such as his decisions to carry his own briefcase and to open the streets near the presidential residence to pedestrians. **********By contrast, opposition groups continue to fight each other, sometimes literally, as when members of Kim Dae Jung's party, denied endorsements to run for the Legislature the other day, smashed doors and vases at his party headquarters and tried to storm his home. Wide Disappointment **********Disappointed with opposition politicians, students and religious leaders are pursuing their own agendas. The National Council of Churches, a group long close to the opposition, is embroiled in a controversy over proposals to promote a dialogue with North Korea. A student leader at Yonsei University said students wanted to dissociate themselves from opposition politicians and to fight instead for labor rights and against American trade pressure and American interference in Korean affairs. **********Some prominent opposition politicians argue that Koreans will vote for the opposition in the upcoming elections despite its tarnished image because they want a check on Government power. Others are less optimistic. ''There is nothing left except to prepare for defeat in this election,'' said Lee Chul, an opposition lawmaker who broke away from the mainstream opposition parties before the election to protest the split between the two Kims. **********''But the positive side of defeat is that it will mean that the influence of the two Kims will diminish,'' Mr. Lee said. ''The most serious problem will be if people's desire to criticize the Government would not be channeled through the Legislature, but would spill onto the streets again.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/16/business/finance-new-issues-citicorp-rates-fall.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1988-03-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 92, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Citicorp Rates Fall", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; Citicorp Rates Fall", "body_text": " **********Interest rates fell at Citicorp's weekly auction of commercial paper.
