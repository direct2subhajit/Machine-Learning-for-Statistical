United Nations relief officials working in Afghanistan have been unusually public in their criticism. Private agencies also lobbied the Council against taking this step. ''It is not going to facilitate our peace efforts, nor is it going to facilitate our humanitarian work,'' Mr. Annan said of the Security Council action. ''I think we had given adequate indications of that to the Council. But the decision belongs to the Council and of course, once they take the decision, we have to adapt and take the necessary measures that are required.'' **********Today, the United Nations removed all its remaining relief workers from the country, fearing a backlash from the Taliban, who will be almost completely isolated diplomatically when the resolution takes effect in 30 days, a grace period during which the Taliban could avoid sanctions by meeting the Council's demands. Air links will be cut and an arms and military training embargo will be imposed only on the Taliban, not their armed opposition, which is supplied by Russia, Iran and India. All assets belonging to Osama bin Laden, who is thought to be living in Afghanistan, will be ordered frozen around the world. **********The United States has been demanding Mr. bin Laden's expulsion from Afghanistan to stand trial for masterminding explosions at American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998. The new sanctions imposed today are linked to the refusal of the Taliban to meet that demand, made in a first round of sanctions a year ago. For Russia, the Taliban are assumed to be behind an Islamic rebellion in Chechnya. **********Russian and American pressure on Security Council members and some officials in the United Nations secretariat has been intense, diplomats said. Two weeks ago, as the sanctions resolution was circulating, the Russian representative complained to Deputy Secretary General Louise Frechette that the coordinator of relief work in Afghanistan, Erick de Mul of the Netherlands, was undermining the anti-Taliban campaign by drawing attention to what he believed would be the adverse effects of the tightened embargo on ordinary Afghans, already among the poorest people in the world. **********United Nations officials have warned that as many as a million Afghans could face starvation in coming months because of a drought and continued civil war. **********Ambassador Nancy Soderberg, speaking for the United States today, said that the Security Council was taking ''a strong stand against terrorism.'' She described Mr. bin Laden as ''the world's most wanted terrorist.'' **********''The Taliban cannot continue to flout the will of the international community and support and shelter terrorists without repercussions,'' she said in the Council following the vote. ''As long as the Taliban continues to harbor terrorists, in particular Osama bin Laden, and to promote terrorism, it remains a threat to international peace and security. **********Sergey Lavrov, the Russian ambassador, said that the one-sided nature of the sanctions was fully justified. ''It is the Taliban who has provided their territory for the use of terrorists and open support for the Chechen, Uzbek, Tajik, Uighur and other extremists,'' he said. **********Barnett Rubin, director of the Center for International Cooperation at New York University and an expert on Afghanistan and Central Asia, characterized the Council resolution today as an expression of Russian and American interests that bears little relevance to Afghanistan's real problems. **********''Certainly there is a legitimate concern about Osama bin Laden and other training camps,'' Mr. Rubin said in an interview. ''There is a legitimate concern not only about attacks on United States forces but also about cross-border attacks by extremist groups into Central Asia -- although most of those attacks actually come from bases in Tajikistan, which is controlled by the Russian Army. **********''But I think we have to ask ourselves,'' he said, ''What is the strategic goal of international action in Afghanistan, bearing in mind that this is a country that has had 21 years of war, that has which has the highest rates of infant, child and maternal mortality, the lowest life expectancy, the lowest literacy rate and the highest rate of hunger -- tied with Somalia -- in the world. **********''Even sanctions that are carefully targeted -- and these are intended to be -- have some negative impact on civilian populations,'' Mr. Rubin said, ''and the civilian population in Afghanistan does not have a margin for survival.'' **********Human Rights Watch petitioned the Security Council on Friday not to impose a one-sided arms embargo when both sides in the lingering Afghan civil war are guilty of abuses. While the letter, signed by Human Rights Watch's executive director, Kenneth Roth, and its United Nations representative, Joanna Weschler, accused the Taliban of scorched-earth policies, attacks on ethnic minorities, particularly the Hazara, and continuing abuses against women.  The letter also mentioned atrocities committed by the alliance of former mujahedeen armies now fighting the Taliban in a pocket of northeastern Afghanistan."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/26/business/business-digest-853879.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-08-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 423, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********California Company Victim Of a Fake Press Release **********A fake press release sent over financial news wires set off a 60 percent decline in the shares of Emulex, a California company that makes fiber optic communications equipment.

And since then, Netscape has hardly been heard from, except when it testified in the government's antitrust case that Microsoft's tactics were unfair. **********Now, a year after America Online completed the acquisition, the company is getting ready to roll out the first major new Netscape release since the 4.0 browser was introduced in August 1997. (The new version, scheduled for an April preview, will be called Netscape 6.0 -- skipping the long-delayed 5.0 version like an unlucky 13th floor, and challenging Microsoft, which introduced Internet Explorer 5.0 in March 1999.) **********But even as Netscape touts a series of features and technological improvements in the new browser, just as it has in years past, the entire field of the battle has changed under America Online. **********As an independent company, Netscape's strategy was to use the browser to build a base of users that would help sell the server software that corporations use to create Web sites. In contrast, America Online, which has farmed out Netscape's server business to a joint venture run by Sun Microsystems called iPlanet, sees the browser as the key to a series of interactive consumer services. **********So it is no surprise that many of the new features of the browser tie to America Online's strengths. **********A window of the new browser can display America Online buddy lists and send instant messages to them. The mail feature will let users read corporate and personal e-mail in one place. And the browser is filled with buttons and features that drive users to America Online's shopping area and the advertising-supported areas of an expanded Netcenter Internet portal. **********''For us, the key to the browser is the integration of consumer services,'' said Bob Pittman, America Online's president. ''If you want to build a corporate data network, Microsoft may have the widgets you need.'' **********What is more, America Online has found an unexpected dividend from one of Netscape's last and most controversial decisions: to make its browser ''open source,'' like the Linux operating system. That means publishing all the key Netscape components, on a Web site called Mozilla.org, so independent programmers can improve on them and use them in their own products. **********Now that America Online has agreed to buy Time Warner, it plans to use the modular nature of the browser to build versions of it for major Time Warner brands. That means a CNN browser, for example, would have the look of the CNN Web site and perhaps features like updated headlines and video feeds. Money magazine's Money.com might include stock symbols. And a site for teenagers might have links to the WB network and AOL chat rooms. **********After saying little about Netscape over the last year, America Online is now talking up its benefits largely to combat the impression in Silicon Valley, reported in a number of published accounts, that Netscape is in disarray and a shell of its former self. **********Indeed, nearly all of Netscape's top management and a big chunk of its talented engineering staff have left the company. Of 2,600 employees right before the merger, 400 were laid off immediately, and another 760 have left the company over the last year. More than 500 people have been hired, including Jim Martin, a publishing executive brought in to run Netcenter. **********America Online executives said this rate of turnover was to be expected. **********''We went in with our eyes totally open,'' said Barry M. Schuler, president of America Online's interactive services unit, who oversees Netscape. ''This was a turnaround situation. We really did keep all but a handful of the people we wanted to keep.'' **********But even if America Online is able to rebuild Netscape in its own image, it remains an open question whether it will earn enough to be worth the effort -- not to mention the $4.5 billion in stock that America Online exchanged for Netscape. **********Jamie Kiggen, the well-regarded Internet analyst at Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette and normally a big fan of America Online, has called the acquisition of Netscape tragic and too risky for the potential reward. **********But Michael Kelly, America Online's chief financial officer, said the Netscape investment was well on its way to paying off. Sun has guaranteed $1.3 billion in payments from the iPlanet alliance over three years, although America Online is obliged to devote 1,200 employees to the effort. **********The Netcenter portal turns a small profit, in large part because it can use the huge technical and sales infrastructure of America Online. Even before the big increase in traffic that America Online hopes for from Netscape 6.0, Netcenter has more than held its own against the competing portal sites. **********Among portal sites, Netscape.com had 22.8 million visitors in January -- up 26 percent in a year, according to Media Metrix, a ratings company. It was behind Yahoo.com, Microsoft's msn.com, and America Online's aol.com, but it was ahead of Disney's Go.com, Lycos.com and Excite.com, all of which have flat or lower user ratings from a year ago. **********Of course, much of Netscape's traffic is people looking to download the browser and related software. But thanks to marketing savvy from America Online, Netcenter users are now staying longer and looking at double the pages they did a year ago. **********Taken together, iPlanet and Netcenter, Mr. Kelly said, earn more than enough to cover the costs of the browser development. **********And America Online executives say there are a number of benefits to the Netscape deal that are impossible to quantify. **********For one, 350 engineers from the browser and Netcenter groups to form a new unit called AOL Products charged with developing advanced technology that can be used by all of America Online's units. The group wrote much of the software that powers the shopping channels on America Online's main service, CompuServe, Netscape and AOL.com. After the Time Warner acquisition, this group will gain more importance as it develops technologies to be used in the much broader array of Internet services. **********Netscape also provides a base of operations amid Silicon Valley, both in location and culture, into which America Online's acquisitions can be assimilated. For example, When.com, a company that made calendar software, was folded into AOL Products to develop the popular calendar America Online introduced late last year. **********This group, in fact, has suffered much less attrition than either Netcenter or iPlanet. **********''For technology guys, the most important thing is to see their work get used,'' said John Paul, the head of AOL Products, and one of the few Netscape veterans in a senior role with America Online. ''If you're at a start-up, no one will ever see your cool things. Here we can put them in front of tens of millions of people.'' **********And while America Online will not make money by selling the browser software itself, it will use the components it has developed in upcoming versions of its other products including CompuServe ICQ and AOL Instant messenger. Indeed, America Online executives expect that it will most likely switch its core online service from Microsoft Internet Explorer to Netscape once the antitrust trial is over. **********''We thought it would be a big problem if there was only one browser in the world, not only for AOL but for the entire industry,'' Mr. Schuler said. ''What price can you put on keeping the standards that run the Internet open and free?''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/12/business/documents-indicate-ford-knew-of-engine-defect-but-was-silent.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Labaton", "pub_date": "2000-09-12", "snippet": "Ford Motor Co documents show array of company officials were aware during 1980's and 1990's of problems with computerized car ignition systems that would make engines stall if they became too hot, even though they reassured customers who complaine...", "word_count": 2343, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Documents Indicate Ford Knew Of Engine Defect but Was Silent", "print_headline": "Documents Indicate Ford Knew Of Engine Defect but Was Silent", "body_text": " **********When thousands of car owners  complained in the 1980's and 1990's that their Fords unexpectedly stalled, often on highways and while making left turns across oncoming traffic, top company executives repeatedly assured regulators that there was no way to know what might be causing the problem. **********But throughout the period, Ford documents show, the company's engineers, safety officials and even its board were aware of growing problems with one particular part -- a computerized ignition system attached to the engine's distributor -- that would shut the engine down if it got too hot. **********Even as federal investigators opened and closed five investigations based on Ford's assurances that it knew of no particular defect, the company never provided regulators with more than a dozen documents that would have shed light on the problem. **********On the same day in 1986 when the regulators closed their second investigation based on Ford's assurances that there was nothing defective to warrant a recall, members of the company's board meeting in a private session discussed the rising number of service complaints about the part, according to Ford documents. **********Also that day, Ford officials prepared a memo raising questions about the company's plan to continue attaching the system, known as a thick film ignition, or T.F.I. module, to the engine in a future model in light of the problems and complaints. **********Neither the notes from the board meeting nor the Ford memo was ever provided to federal investigators. Ford continued to deny there were problems for the next nine years, in spite of repeated internal company studies, consumer complaints, numerous reports of deadly and other serious accidents, wrongful death and personal injury lawsuits and warranty claims that topped 40 percent in some years. **********The company, which denies the defect has caused any fatal accidents, has settled at least four lawsuits involving serious injuries and at least four deaths. A study prepared for the plaintiffs in one case asserts that the drivers of the 22 million cars equipped with the ignition system faced a 9 percent greater chance of being in a fatal crash. Ford contests that finding but stopped putting ignitions on distributors after the 1995 model year. **********The company's handling of complaints about the ignition system -- detailed in court papers, as well as interviews with witnesses, safety experts, government officials and lawyers -- has taken on new significance in light of the recall of 6.5 million Firestone tires after dozens of deadly crashes involving Ford Explorers. **********In recent days, documents have emerged showing that the companies were aware of problems with Explorers equipped with the tires several years before the recall. **********Congressional investigators are now examining whether the ignition case is part of a broader pattern in which Ford misled regulators by failing to disclose what its engineers and safety experts know of possible defects. **********Alan J. Kam, a recently retired official at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said in an interview that in his 21 years as the agency's top lawyer for defects and enforcement issues, he had never seen a greater deception perpetuated on the government by an auto company. **********''When I looked at this material I was astonished,'' said Mr. Kam, who has been retained as an expert witness for the victims and is preparing an affidavit outlining his views that will be filed in a case in Tennessee. **********''Ford Motor Company had obfuscated the existence of the T.F.I. module problems even though it had problems on a massive basis,'' he said. ''They had concealed signs of failures that were occurring at an astronomical level, at a figure far beyond any measure I have seen before. They were telling the agency they didn't know what was causing stalling while they were doing extensive studies showing they knew what was causing the stalling.'' **********The ignition cases have been described in news reports. But Mr. Kam's involvement in the case and many of the Ford internal documents Congressional investigators are now studying have not been previously disclosed. **********Two weeks ago, a state court judge in California concluded in a tentative decision in a class-action lawsuit involving the ignition system that Ford had engaged in a huge corporate cover-up, concealing from both regulators and consumers a design flaw affecting 22 million cars produced between 1983 and 1995, almost 15 million of which remain on the road. **********If, as expected, he makes the decision final in the next few weeks, the judge will become the first in American history to order an auto recall. Such a ruling combined with other damages could cost Ford as much as $3.5 billion in California alone. **********Cases are also pending in five other states, and like the tire recall, Ford faces the prospect of action abroad, where tens of millions of autos are on the roads with the ignition part affixed to the distributor. **********Ford executives and lawyers say they intend to appeal the ignition case if the judge's decision becomes final. They said the judge had no basis for reaching his conclusions of cover-up and liability and exceeded his authority by ordering a recall. Ford executives said the only similarity between the ignition and tire cases is that company officials did nothing improper and took necessary steps to correct any problems. **********Warren Platt, a Ford lawyer, said that in the tire case, Ford was under no legal obligation to report on problems being encountered abroad. And in the ignition case, he said, the company's position is that there were many possible causes of cars stalling on the road beyond problems with the ignition module. **********''The frequency of the stalls caused by a T.F.I. failure were not nearly as large as a number of other factors,'' he said. ''N.H.T.S.A. looked at the adequacy of our filings and with the exception of seven documents that Ford didn't produce, it found that we produced all that was required. It's hard to argue that Ford has been less than forthcoming.'' **********In court papers outlining its legal defense, Ford maintained that the module was far more reliable than earlier ignition systems and there had not been an inordinate number of accidents caused by cars that stalled. The company said there were sound engineering reasons for putting the module on the distributor, and that the company corrected any problems by replacing more than one million parts under warranty. **********Moreover, while there was a high rate of warranty claims filed over the ignition module, Ford executives testified that nearly 90 percent of the parts replaced were found not to be defective. **********Ford's handling of the ignition complaints points up the shortcomings of a regulatory system that, short of manpower, relies heavily on the candor of the auto companies. **********The penalties for failing to disclose defects to federal auto regulators are not onerous. In the ignition case, the highway safety agency concluded two years ago that Ford had improperly withheld important documents but declined to impose any penalties at all, in part because the cars were no longer covered by federal laws on recalls sponsored by a manufacturer. **********Documents that have been made public in recent months show that in both the tire and ignition cases, Ford executives knew about increasing consumer complaints and accidents surrounding the parts. In both cases, regulators were not immediately told of the complaints. **********Although the leadership of the company has since changed hands, some of the same Ford executives, including the company's top executive for safety issues, Helen O. Petrauskas, have been involved in both cases. **********And in both cases, the company followed its practice of settling personal-injury and wrongful-death lawsuits raising safety concerns by requiring that the cases be sealed and that the plaintiffs return all incriminating company documents to Ford. In some cases, the settling parties had to also agree that they would take no steps to assist plaintiffs in other cases who assert similar claims. **********''The objective in both the tire and the ignition cases was to avoid a costly recall in the United States, to handle costly defects through settlements in individual cases and then have those cases sealed,'' said Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety and an unpaid expert witness for the plaintiffs in the ignition lawsuits. ''In both instances, Ford was under an obligation to self-report to N.H.T.S.A., and in both instances, Ford failed.'' **********Michael E. Ballachey, the California Superior Court judge who ruled against Ford, blamed Ford for a corporate culture in which the careers of executives can be ruined by reporting design defects to higher-ups. The judge said, for instance, that the testimony in his case of a top Ford engineer's reluctance to convey bad news about the ignition module had reminded him of ''The Emperor's New Clothes.'' **********''No one wanted to be the one to deliver the bad news to the president of Ford,'' Judge Ballachey wrote. ''That reluctance, and Ford's commitment to failed technology, cannot be accepted as a realistic attempt to solve the obvious safety problem confronting Ford: the massive failure of distributor-mounted T.F.I. modules due to excessive heat and thermal stress.'' **********The ignition cases brought in California do not involve auto passengers who were injured or killed, but were filed as fraud lawsuits that accuse the company of deceiving car owners about the safety of their products. **********Lawyers for the plaintiffs said they decided, as a matter of strategy, not to pursue claims for death or injury. Engines that stall can often be restarted after cooling down, making it difficult to establish to a legal certainty that a particular accident was caused by an ignition defect. **********In the California case, Judge Ballachey ordered Ford to disclose details of several sealed lawsuits. One of these cases involved an April 14, 1990 accident. Andy Pham, a 19-year-old who rented a 1990 Mercury Sable in San Jose was driving to Reno with seven passengers when his car stalled, hit the center divider and rolled over and crashed off the road. Mr. Pham and two others died in the crash. Another passenger, Asali Johnson, was left a quadriplegic while the other passengers suffered less severe injuries. **********At the center of the case is the T.F.I. module, which Judge Ballachey described as ''delicate electronic, computer-driven technology,''  prone to shutting down at high temperatures. It was placed near the engine on a number of Ford models,  from 1983 to 1995 and including some makes of the Bronco, Escort, Grand Marquis, Mustang, Sable, Taurus, Tempo, Thunderbird, Topaz and Town Car. **********Although some Ford engineers and officials argued that early electronic ignitions be placed inside the passenger compartment of vehicles in part to eliminate exposure to high temperatures, Ford rejected that approach. **********Jeffrey Fazio, the San Francisco lawyer who has been the driving force behind the cases, said the Ford documents uncovered in the litigation detail years of concern about the part. Most of the documents were never provided to federal traffic safety officials during their investigations. **********In 1981, the documents show, the company decided against mounting the ignition system away from the engine in future models ''for cost/ function reasons.'' **********As early as April 1982, Ford engineers began to raise concerns about overheating of the ignition module. **********A warranty analysis in January 1984 projected that the ignition module -- which was supposed to last for the lifetime of the vehicle -- would fail at a rate of 56 percent at five years or 50,000 miles. **********In May of that year, Ford engineers compiled a list of components that could cause a ''quits on road'' condition -- a failure that causes the vehicle to shut down while being driven. The document questioned whether a recall was necessary. **********The company continued to tell the safety agency there was no ''common pattern or cause'' behind the complaints about stalling. **********In July 1985, Ford executives were told that a special company task force was studying why the ignition module and another part failed in ''hot climates'' within warranty and more temperate climates after the warranty expired. **********In October 1986, federal safety officials, relying on such Ford assurances, shut down their second investigation. That same day, the company's directors began to raise questions about the high costs of fixing the module. **********Although the module was one of 14,000 parts of the car, costs of replacing it threatened to eat up more than $200 million of the $350 million that Ford had reserved for all warranty claims. **********In November 1986, a month after that meeting, Ford executives prepared a report on the issue for the company's top management, including Harold A. Poling, then the chairman. But according to testimony in the case, Mr. Poling never received the report, although he and other executives learned of many of its details. **********The study noted the nodule's high rate of failure at hot temperatures. It said that 4.3 million vehicles in model years 1984 and 1985 were at risk of ignition problems and that about 500,000 already had their modules replaced at the owners' expense. **********A survey of Ford customers who reported stalling found that 66 percent had their cars towed because of the module's failure and 29 percent ''experienced a T.F.I.-related failure that caused the engine to quit while the vehicle was in motion.'' **********At that point, company officials recognized that the potential cost to an across-the-board fix would be staggering, more than $429 million. The company also concluded that such a fix was ''not feasible'' because they did not have enough replacement parts and opted for a ''selective notification,'' even though executives recognized it would leave many cars on the roads that would continue to ''quit on road.'' **********Even after the limited notification program, which affected slightly over one million cars, executives continued to raise concerns about the placement of the module on the distributor. In a July 1988 memo, officials in the electrical and electronic division said they were ''concerned about long-term customer satisfaction due to the anticipated high T.F.I. module operating temperatures.'' **********''As you are aware,'' the memo said, ''the failure mode for the T.F.I. module under these conditions is a quits-on-road.'' **********''We have reviewed this subject with you in the past, and we understand the cost pressures,'' it concluded. ''However, this posture is not consistent with company quality goals.'' **********A list of Ford vehicles that plaintiffs say have stalling problems caused by an ignition module is available at The New York Times on the Web: www.nytimes.com/business"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/09/world/nebraska-at-last-gets-a-visit.html": {"writer_name": "Marc Lacey", "pub_date": "2000-12-09", "snippet": "Pres Clinton visits Nebraska, the only state he had not yet visited during his presidency (S)", "word_count": 338, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Nebraska, At Last, Gets a Visit", "print_headline": "Nebraska, At Last, Gets a Visit", "body_text": " **********After scores of trips to California, repeated stops in New York and appearances from Maine to Missouri, President Clinton finally set foot today in the only one of the 50 states that he had snubbed throughout his presidency. **********One explanation for Mr. Clinton's prolonged avoidance of Nebraska surely boils down to politics.

''I came down here to see him because he's the president, not because of the man, but because of respect for the office,'' said Matt Weekly, who held his infant son in his arms. **********For his part, Mr. Clinton said to an outdoor crowd, ''One of my critics once said it would be a cold day when I came to Nebraska.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/17/world/israel-ponders-constitution-with-head-throbbing.html": {"writer_name": "Deborah Sontag", "pub_date": "2000-09-17", "snippet": "Most of senior Israeli academics and political figures who have been debating fine points of possible constitution for two years dismiss Prime Min Ehud Barak's surprise proposal as prescription for failure; hold issues are too loaded, Israeli soci...", "word_count": 1256, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Israel Ponders Constitution With Head Throbbing", "print_headline": "Israel Ponders Constitution With Head Throbbing", "body_text": " **********For 52 years, Israel has avoided drafting a constitution for fear of provoking a civil war between secular and religious Jews. But when Prime Minister Ehud Barak returned empty-handed from his latest frustrations with the peace effort, he switched to an agenda of civic reform and proposed a constitution, just like that. **********Stunned, a group of senior Israeli academics and political figures who have been working to lay the groundwork for a constitution were propelled into furious debate about whether they should take advantage of this sudden interest from an Israeli leader. **********But having spent two years in seminar rooms dissecting every delicate issue -- the separation of religion and state, the rights of minorities, women's rights, among others -- most mocked the idea of an instant constitution as a prescription for failure. The issues are simply too loaded, Israeli society too polarized and its democracy too fragile, they said. **********''It's like somebody who offers to marry you on the first date,'' said Yaron Ezrahi, a senior fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute. ''Given the complexity of the issue and the significance for this country, a leader doesn't generate a constitution in a month to save his political career.'' **********The constitutional experts' skepticism about Mr. Barak's initiative reflects the way the public at large has received his ''civil-social agenda,'' dubbed the Secular Revolution by the news media. His proposals are widely seen as a transparent political ploy to rescue his faltering government or provide a platform for his next campaign. **********In addition to creating a constitution, Mr. Barak has proposed a laundry list of changes, most of which have been blocked by the religious establishment for years. These include civil marriage for those ''hundreds of thousands of Israelis'' who are not Jews or not recognized as Jews by the rabbinate, eliminating the ''nationality'' listing on identification cards that distinguishes between Jews and non-Jews and the operation of El Al Airline and public buses on the Sabbath. **********Some, like Yossi Beilin, the justice minister, suggest that Mr. Barak's motives be disregarded and that this rare moment -- when no religious parties are in the government -- be seized. The religious parties and a small Russian immigrant party defected before Mr. Barak traveled to the Camp David summit meeting in July, leaving him with an unstable minority government. **********In a strategy session this week, Mr. Beilin urged the constitutional committee at the Israel Democracy Institute to act quickly. **********''I'm a great believer in windows of opportunity,'' he said. ''Now Barak wants a constitution. He asks, 'Where's a constitution?' We should say, 'Here's a constitution,' and hand him a document.'' **********Avraham Ravitz, a strictly Orthodox member of Parliament, said he had no objection to a constitution, ''so long as it includes one paragraph that says constitutional law cannot be above religious law, that's all.'' In other words, he does object to a constitution -- which he described as ''the strange need of secular people in Israel to import something from Canada or Sweden rather than use what belongs to them.'' **********Israel's Declaration of Independence stipulated that a constitution would be established no later than Oct. 1, 1948. Its first Parliament, in fact, was elected to serve as a constitutional convention. **********But from the beginning the secular-religious divide was wide, and as far as religious Israelis were concerned, they already had their constitution: the Bible. Rather than rip apart a young nation that needed to focus on pragmatic matters, the country's first leaders decided that a constitution should be assembled piecemeal, through a series of basic laws. **********It took eight years for Parliament to pass the first basic law, the one that establishes the existence of Parliament. The next seven laws mostly set up the institutions of the state, including the role of the president, the army and the courts. It was not until 1992 that the subject of human rights was touched -- and then incompletely because of the controversy sparked by even the fundamental idea of making man, and not God, central. **********In a passing political moment when the government was not dependent on religious votes, Parliament did adopt a basic law of human dignity that Israel's Supreme Court has interpreted liberally. **********But it does not address, among other issues, freedom of religion, freedom from religion, freedom of speech, freedom of association and basic equality -- equality, that is, between Jews and non-Jews as well as between men and women (something that the powerful strictly Orthodox and the powerless Bedouins do not want imposed on them). And as a whole, the basic laws are not empowered as the supreme law of the land; they can be overturned by a simple plurality in Parliament. **********Dan Meridor, a centrist legislator, tried as justice minister in 1989 to pass a full bill of rights, which got whittled down to the basic law of human dignity several years later. **********Now a member of the democracy institute's constitutional committee, Mr. Meridor advocates a ''thin'' constitution that, among other things, leaves aside the Jewish character of the state, so as not to alienate Israeli Arabs or create legal contradictions between the state's Jewish identity and the idea of equality for all. **********''We don't want to create a constitution that causes conflict,'' he told the constitutional committee. ''Religious and ethnic wars are devastating, and we should avoid them.'' **********Ruth Gavison, a Hebrew University professor, a leading civil libertarian and the only woman on the committee, threw her hands in the air. ''What are you talking about, put religion aside, put the equality of women aside, put this aside and that aside?'' she asked. ''We know that these are issues that will blow up the whole thing. We must tackle them.'' **********A poll released on Friday by the newspaper Maariv showed overwhelming public support for a constitution -- 73 percent -- and little confidence that a dysfunctional government could produce and pass one. **********But what would it say? The Justice Ministry has prepared three more basic laws -- concerning due process, free speech and social rights like education and housing -- that go to a parliamentary committee on Sunday. Deputy Attorney General Joshua Schoffman said that if they were passed, ''they would produce something close to a constitution,'' especially if Parliament also approved a bill that elevated their status and made them more difficult to annul or amend. **********Justice Minister Beilin suggested immediately pursuing those laws and, in a separate effort, a full constitution at the same time. But Professor Gavison, a secular Jew who has become a hero to many of the strictly Orthodox for her criticism of the Supreme Court, advocates a slow deliberative process that grows out of a dialogue with the right wing and the religious. **********Beyond the institute, there is a rival, more populist and clearly anticlerical constitutional advocacy group. Under the guidance of Uriel Reichman, who is president of a private college in Herzliya, it wrote the basic law that changed the political system to provide for the direct election of the prime minister. The democracy institute says the change has radically destabilized Israel's politics, although Professor Reichman still supports it as a way to keep extremists out of power. **********Observing the heated debate at the democracy institute, Uri Dromi, the institute's publications director and a retired colonel, said he could not help but think of the old joke about the Yeshiva University rowing team. It had a terrible record, and so it sent a spy to Yale to ascertain the key to their success. On return, the spy said, ''You wouldn't believe it! We've been doing it backwards! It's supposed to be eight people rowing, and one shouting!''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/08/business/technology-motorola-issues-another-profit-and-sales-warning.html": {"writer_name": "Barnaby Feder", "pub_date": "2000-12-08", "snippet": "Motorola says it expects to earn just 15 cents a share in current quarter because of sharply reduced demand for its semiconductors and continuing profit margin erosion in its cell phone business (M)", "word_count": 856, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Motorola Issues Another Profit and Sales Warning", "print_headline": "TECHNOLOGY; Motorola Issues Another Profit and Sales Warning", "body_text": " **********In yet another sign that the economy may be slowing, Motorola said yesterday that it would fall well short of Wall Street's sales and profit projections for the current quarter because of sharply reduced demand for its semiconductors and continuing profit margin erosion in its cell phone business. **********Motorola also warned that its efforts to get earnings and revenue growth back on track might not bear visible fruit before the middle of next year. **********The warning was the second Motorola was forced to issue this quarter, a dubious distinction it shares with Apple Computer and Circuit City, among others. **********The company's shares, which had already lost more than 70 percent from their peak of $61.50 in March, fell 19 cents further yesterday, to $17.69, in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. **********But few analysts were brave enough to say that the stock had reached bargain levels. **********''This stock is where it deserves to be,'' said Todd Koffman, an analyst at Raymond James & Associates. **********Motorola, which is based in Schaumburg, Ill., said that it expected to earn just 15 cents a share in the quarter, down 44 percent from analysts' consensus 27 cents as reported by First Call/Thompson Financial. The analysts had been expecting 37 cents when the quarter began Oct. 1, but they had cut their projections after Motorola's first warning on Oct. 10. **********Motorola also cut its revenue projections for the quarter yesterday by $500 million, to $10 billion. It said that it should earn 12 cents a share on sales of about $8.8 billion in the first three months of 2001 but would not issue its downwardly revised projections for all of 2001 until its regular January conference call. Wall Street's projections for 2001 before yesterday's announcement were $1.20 a share on sales of $44 billion. Before the October warning, analysts had foreseen $1.43 a share on sales of $47 billion. **********Motorola noted that the projections for the fourth quarter did not take into account one-time charges, which are expected to be substantial for both the current quarter and the first quarter of next year. Write-offs will cover plant closings and other measures to cut production costs. **********Motorola's woes were partly attributed to internal manufacturing and marketing problems, particularly in the cell phone business, where overall demand is still growing strongly but where Nokia of Finland has supplanted Motorola as the market leader. Wireless communications is Motorola's biggest business, accounting for over a third of its revenue, but the company has been on the defensive since the mid-1990's when it was slow to make the shift from analog to digital phones. **********Motorola bet heavily that phone users would rapidly embrace new products that allowed them access to the Internet, but that market has been slow to take off. In addition, it built up inventories of expensive components after shortages had crimped sales in 1999. When Nokia sharply cut prices to meet the strong consumer demand for inexpensive phones, Motorola was unable to follow suit without drastically reducing profits. The competitive squeeze has also slowed its move to cut production costs by outsourcing manufacturing. **********But yesterday Motorola described wireless sales as ''robust'' and endorsed industry estimates that the number of cell phones sold would reach 420 million this year and grow to 525 million to 575 million next year. **********''We see this as a very normal fourth quarter for the industry and for ourselves from the demand side,'' Ed Gams, senior vice president and director of investor relations, told analysts in discussing the phone segment. **********Motorola also noted that the fourth quarter was progressing as expected on the earnings and sales front for smaller company segments like broadband communications. **********By contrast, though, Motorola said slowdowns in the computer and automotive industries and sharp cutbacks by electronic component distributors in their inventories were hurting its semiconductor operations. It now expects both sales and profits to be down from the third quarter. **********''This is a volume issue,'' Robert L. Growney, president and chief operating officer, said in a conference call with analysts. **********The semiconductor unit, which earned $190 million on sales of $2.1 billion in the third quarter, would undoubtedly be faring better if Motorola's phone business were living up to expectations. Motorola consumes 25 percent of the semiconductors it makes and a vast majority of them go into its wireless products. But the main problem in the semiconductor business is slower sales to outside users. **********''We didn't anticipate just how weak the semiconductor sector would be,'' said Matthew Hoffman, who follows Motorola for SoundView Technology Group. **********Analysts noted that the economic outlook was not necessarily as bleak as the slowdown in orders at Motorola and other chip makers might suggest. Because of component shortages in 1999 and early this year, customers were pressing chipmakers to rapidly increase their production. Most everyone in the supply chain from the distributors in the middle to end purchasers bought extra components as a cushion. **********Unfortunately for the chip makers, once the supplies caught up with demand and end users stopped fearing shortages, they cut their orders and began using up the inventories they had built up. **********''Things got heated up in several parts of the supply chain and we are in a burn-off period,'' Mr. Growney said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/02/business/about-the-tables.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-10-02", "snippet": "New York Times is set to temporarily introduce second business section, World Business, on Tuesdays through Fridays; section will consist of international business news and tables for United States exchanges plus preferred stocks", "word_count": 181, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Editors' Note", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "About the Tables", "print_headline": "About the Tables", "body_text": " **********Beginning tomorrow and continuing through Dec. 29, Business Day will include a second section, World Business (Section W), on Tuesdays through Fridays.

To help dig them out and stimulate the economy, the government has embarked on a program of deficit spending, with plans to go into the red by 110 billion baht, or $2.93 billion, in the fiscal year ending in September. **********Last June, the Thai finance ministry issued its first savings bonds to the public in nine years. Hundreds of eager buyers descended on central bank offices, where the bonds were sold, to get their piece of the 25 billion baht issue.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the price of crude oil for October delivery jumped 80 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $32.02 a barrel, while the price of heating oil for September delivery rose 5.26 cents, or 5.8 percent, to 95.61 cents a gallon. **********What this means for this winter is still hard to predict. But the average price of home heating oil this month is 52.5 percent more than it was in August 1999 and 23 percent above the average for last fall and winter. And although last fall and winter were warm by historical standards, the average cost of home heating oil, based on the futures price, was the third-highest since the winter of 1989-90 and missed being second highest by less than 0.2 cent. **********By examining some of the factors that will affect the price of crude oil and home heating oil, one can, at the least, get a sense of what will make for a really bad winter or where some relief -- in addition to more OPEC oil -- can come from. **********One way to do this is to look at the winter of 1996-97. That was the last time that distillate oil stocks, from which home heating oil is made, were even tighter than they are now. According to the American Petroleum Institute, there were 106.1 million barrels of distillate in inventory at this time in August 1996, compared with the current inventory of 111.1 million barrels. **********At this time in August 1996, the price of home heating oil was around 60 cents a gallon and on its way to a peak of 76.49 cents a gallon in October. That price was not surpassed until last winter, after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries curtailed its production to push crude oil prices back up from lows of less than $11 a barrel to their highest levels since the Persian Gulf war. **********A very cold fall in 1996 helped keep the price of home heating oil bouncing up back near the October high. According to the Northeast Regional Climate Center in Ithaca, N.Y., that fall in the Northeast was the 15th coldest since 1895. **********But the pressure was let off as the actual winter turned out to be one of the warmest ever, the 11th warmest, according to the Northeast Regional Climate Center. By the end of January, when the weather pattern was becoming apparent, the price of home heating oil began to plunge, falling as low as 52.54 cents a gallon on March 5, 1997. **********Still, that fall and winter had the second-highest average home heating futures price since 1989. **********If it is cold this fall, ''the price can go very high,'' said Irene King, the senior markets analyst at J. P. Morgan & Company. **********She also said that the high cost of natural gas, which jumped 8.5 cents yesterday, to $4.605 per million British thermal units, will probably lead many companies that have the ability to do so to switch to distillates. That would put more pressure on heating oil supplies and prices. Natural gas inventories themselves are near six-year lows. **********Beyond the fall and winter weather and what happens to inventories in that time, the politics of the United State presidential election and the politics and production problems within OPEC will be the other big factors affecting how much it will cost to keep warm this winter. **********The Clinton administration is again mentioning the possibility of using oil from the government's Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help push prices lower. And the connections of the Republican ticket of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney to the oil industry will sharpen the focus on the issue this fall, especially if it is cold. **********Within OPEC, the key player, in terms of possible relief, is still Saudi Arabia, which pretty much went out on its own to pump more oil as oil prices rose earlier this summer. So far, strong demand has kept oil inventories surprisingly tight, offsetting the benefit of that extra production. **********Many oil analysts think that the rising price of crude oil, which is just below its decade high of $34.13, and heating oil will put added pressure on the OPEC members to agree to pump more oil when they meet in Vienna in early September. **********The members have already agreed on an informal trigger for the pumping of more oil: if crude oil stays above $30 a barrel for West Texas intermediate for 20 consecutive trading days. **********But oil politics could make OPEC members ignore this mechanism or work to get the price just below the trigger level just long enough to force the beginning of another 20-day period. One reason that many OPEC members are not interested in approving an increase in production is that they are already pumping at full capacity. Only Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, oil analysts say, have the ability to increase their current production levels of crude oil. **********President Clinton said yesterday that he would discuss the high oil price this weekend when he meets with President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, a member of OPEC. In comments to reporters in Washington, Mr. Clinton indicated that he understood that capacity restraints within OPEC were a problem. ''We have to look at where there is excess capacity,'' he said, adding that ''this is a question of whether the OPEC nations can increase their production.'' **********But, he added, ''I'm going to do what I can to keep these prices moderated and to continue to argue to all the OPEC nations that if the price gets too high they will cause recession.'' **********''The oil price,'' he said, ''needs to be, I think, in the low $20's somewhere.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/09/business/german-exchange-plans-internet-portal.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "2000-12-09", "snippet": "Deutsche Borse, parent company of Frankfurt Stock Exchange, plans to start Internet site to provide financial information for private investors that more closely resembles information available to institutional investment professionals (M)", "word_count": 149, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "German Exchange Plans Internet Portal", "print_headline": "German Exchange Plans Internet Portal", "body_text": " **********Deutsche Borse, parent company of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, is planning to start an Internet site to provide financial information for private investors in the first quarter of next year. **********The investment portal, to be called NeuerMarkt.com, will provide a forum for individuals, online brokers and companies.

Back-channel peace negotiations in Stockholm continued, and the American peace envoy, Dennis Ross, met separately here with Mr. Barak and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader. And Mr. Barak's government, which had seemed on the verge of collapse, was still intact, though not quite harmonious. **********Not long ago, that same gunfire would have led to harsh retributions and sustained tension. Now, the absence even of a sense of crisis seemed to speak to a new self-confidence on both sides, and to the shared belief of Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat that they have too much to lose if they allow themselves to be dragged into another cycle of violence. **********Some Palestinians commended Mr. Barak for demonstrating a commitment to the peace effort that, until now, they were not sure he had. In the midst of gun battles on the periphery of Jerusalem and despite a shaky coalition, Mr. Barak managed to secure Parliament's approval for turning over three villages to the Palestinian Authority. Instead of using the violence as an excuse to flee his obligations, he persevered, and that was unexpected, they said. **********''This was a very important litmus test, and people felt relieved,'' said Munther Dajani, director of the Palestinian Center for Regional Studies in the West Bank. ''At this juncture in the peace process, it gave people hope, because Barak delivered when the chips were down.'' **********In neighboring Jordan, the state-owned Jordan Times was similarly pleased, saying, ''It is not often that we take our hats off to Israeli officials, but Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is to be respected for his decision to put his political career on the line for the sake of a much higher cause, that of peace.'' **********Emotions still ran strong in the West Bank, where three families buried the Palestinian men killed in the clashes with Israeli troops on Monday. **********And many Palestinians and Israelis were quick to stress that they considered Mr. Barak's near crises to be the self-inflicted wounds of an inexperienced politician. Critics said he had failed to appreciate the intensity of the Palestinians' frustration with slow-moving peace talks, and their anxiety that his domestic troubles were turning him into an unreliable peace partner. **********''Barak creates his own monsters,'' said Hanan Ashrawi, a Palestinian legislator. ''He shoots himself in the foot and then points to it and says, 'See how difficult life is.' '' **********And until he finally acted on Monday, the prime minister had allowed  Israeli rightists to convert the three dusty towns into a charged political symbol, while his most troublesome coalition partner, the Shas party, made its support into a bargaining chip to get shekels for its school system. **********In their commentaries today, Israeli political analysts paid little attention to Mr. Barak's handling of the violence in the West Bank. Instead, several praised him for finally taking charge and catching his political opponents off guard in a parliamentary ''blitzkrieg.'' **********After months of indecision, he dared balky parties to make good on their threats to quit his government and won decisive backing for his peace initiative. Only one small party, the National Religious Party, said it would defect to the opposition. **********Now, when Mr. Barak goes to Washington this weekend to meet with leaders of American Jewish groups, he will go ''as a man,'' one of his advisers said. **********''Yesterday, only yesterday, did Barak begin his real term as prime minister,'' Nahum Barnea, a longtime political analyst, wrote on the front page of the newspaper Yediot Ahronot this morning, almost a year to the day after Mr. Barak was elected by an overwhelming majority with a mandate to make peace. **********Already on Monday afternoon, when Israeli legislators focused almost exclusively on their political game despite the violence raging in the West Bank and Gaza, it was evident that a new diplomatic environment had changed the political one to allow for a kind of self-absorption among many Israelis. **********There was a curious disconnect between events in Jerusalem and those just miles away in Ramallah, where street violence deteriorated into a rare gun battle between Israeli and Palestinian forces. But it was a telling one. **********It suggested an instinctive faith on the part of Israeli politicians that the situation would not flare out of control and that, through dialogue between Israeli and Palestinian leaders, it would be contained. Which it was. **********''It will all be O.K.,'' Nawaf Masalha, Israel's deputy foreign minister, said calmly in his office in Parliament shortly before armed Palestinian men advanced on the Israeli-guarded Joseph's Tomb in Nablus on Monday night, where they were met by Israeli gunfire, Israeli helicopters and Israeli tanks. ''There is a direct phone line between Barak and Arafat. They will make it fine.'' **********Speaking in Ashkelon today, Mr. Barak said: ''I do not want us to delude ourselves on the way to peace agreements. There will be further difficulties. But we are strong, determined to reach our destination, and we will reach it.'' **********Underlying this calm was the fact that no Israelis were killed, even though three Palestinians died of gunshot wounds on Monday and one on Sunday, and hundreds of Palestinians were wounded. If today had brought Israeli instead of Palestinian funerals, the calculus in Israel probably would have been different. **********Only Hatzofe, a small daily newspaper of the National Religious Party, sounded alarm bells today. ''War in Judea and Samaria,'' its headline said, using the Biblical place names for the West Bank. **********The accepted wisdom among Israelis and Palestinians was that Mr. Arafat allowed, or even initiated, the street protests. He did so partly because his people needed an escape valve for mounting frustration with their lot in general, with the Palestinian Authority itself and with what they perceive as Israeli intransigence in the peace negotiations. **********There already had been a week of protests over Palestinian prisoners in Israel before the outbreak of intense violence on Monday, the anniversary of the ''nakba,'' or ''catastrophe,'' as Palestinians call the creation of the state of Israel. The protests over the prisoners, organized by Mr. Arafat's Fatah political organization, channeled other unrest into an anti-Israeli demonstration. **********Temporarily, Mr. Arafat gained a measure of domestic peace: Teachers earning $300 to $350 a month suspended a bitter wage strike, and West Bank college students halted protests about the alleged political misuse of university funds. **********And the protests could have proven diplomatically useful, allowing Mr. Arafat to dangle the specter of a popular uprising before Israeli eyes to underscore the need for progress on the peace front. **********But Mr. Arafat, all agree, lost control of the situation. Maj. Gen. Moshe Yaalon, the chief of Israel's Central Command, said today that the Palestinian leader had intended to keep the disturbances ''at a low flame but could not control the intensity of the fire.'' **********One factor limiting Mr. Arafat's control was the ambivalence of his own security officers. At times, they prevented Palestinians from confronting Israeli troops. At other times, they joined the protesters and turned their weapons on the Israelis. **********The repressive and sometimes lawless behavior of the Palestinian police has earned them widespread enmity in the Palestinian territories. Yet many police officers are themselves proud veterans of past street battles and, Mr. Dajani said, cannot countenance the impression ''that they are now siding with the Israelis against their own people.'' **********''The attitude towards the police went from very negative to very positive yesterday,'' he said. ''There was a sense of camaraderie, that everyone was on the same side for once.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/14/business/company-news-icahn-in-new-bid-to-take-control-of-nabisco.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "2000-03-14", "snippet": "Carl C Icahn says he is seeking election of nine directors to board of Nabisco Group Holdings Corp, initiating his fourth attempt in five years to gain control of company; Icahn also says in filing with Securities and Exchange Commission that he a...", "word_count": 87, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ICAHN IN NEW BID TO TAKE CONTROL OF NABISCO", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; ICAHN IN NEW BID TO TAKE CONTROL OF NABISCO", "body_text": " **********Carl C.

Sweeney, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., plans to meet several thousand union members early today in a parking lot in Tacoma, Wash., and lead a march on a relatively obscure and financially troubled company in the business of supplying temporary blue-collar workers. **********Since July, the Building and Construction Trades Department of Mr. Sweeney's union has been attacking the company, Labor Ready Inc., in the courts and through federal regulators, accusing it of mismanagement and taking advantage of the mainly unskilled laborers it hires to fill day-to-day jobs with building contractors, manufacturers, freight handlers, landscapers and others. **********Today, after Mr. Sweeney confronts senior executives at Labor Ready's annual meeting, aides to the labor leader plan to make public A.F.L.-C.I.O. research suggesting that the company has been cheating on its payments to workers' compensation systems in at least two states, Washington and Ohio. **********Dick King, who joined Labor Ready in mid-May and became chief executive in July, said if there had been any shortfalls in the company's workers' compensation payments, they were unintentional. ''We have no intention of being dishonest,'' he added. **********While financial analysts say they have been surprised at the force of the union campaign, it clearly reflects concern that Labor Ready and other suppliers of temporary workers have become a threat to the unions and their members. And there may be an element of anger and revenge as well. Terry O'Sullivan, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s Laborers' Union, said Labor Ready had sent temporary workers across picket lines in at least six strikes the last few years. **********While union ranks have been stagnating, temporary work has been growing by leaps and bounds. Labor Ready, a Tacoma company with operations nationwide, says revenue from the temporary worker industry is expected to reach $140 billion this year. Annual growth, according to the American Staffing Association, has been running at 18 percent, with 90 percent of American companies now using temporary workers. **********The union campaign has had a limited effect on Labor Ready, Mr. King said. But the company, which grew rapidly from its beginnings in 1989, has had plenty of trouble of its own. Largely because of a miscalculation that Labor Ready could do without a sales representative at each of its offices to attract new business, revenue growth began slowing in mid-1999; profits began declining as well. The company is now rebuilding its sales force. In July, the founder and chief executive, Glenn Welstad, was forced to resign after the board accused him of taking an unauthorized loan of $3.5 million to cover a margin call on his Labor Ready stock. The stock, which peaked at about $28 in mid-1999, closed yesterday at $3.94. **********Labor Ready says it is the top provider of manual laborers for temporary tasks, but it remains a niche player with revenue only now approaching $1 billion. **********Jeff Grabelsky, the organizing director of the Building and Construction Trades Department, said the A.F.L.-C.I.O. zeroed in on Labor Ready because its biggest segment was the construction business. **********''They are No. 1 in sending workers into our industry in ways that undermine the standards of the industry,'' Mr. Grabelsky said. ''What happens when we negotiate with union contractors, is, they say, 'We can't afford to pay union workers decent wages because nonunion contractors are going to win every job because of lower costs.' '' **********Union officials said their members working as laborers were paid $15 an hour plus benefits. Mr. King said Labor Ready supplied laborers for $11 an hour and last year paid workers an average of $6.94 an hour. It also pays for their workers' compensation coverage, Social Security and Medicare contributions but makes no provision for current health care and has no pension fund. **********The A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s goal, Mr. Grabelsky said, ''is to unionize the workers'' of the temporary agencies. But Wayne Lottinville, an analyst for Red Chip Review in Portland, Ore.,  said the Labor Ready employees might be among ''the hardest population or workers to organize.'' **********''They are at the very low end of the unskilled labor market,'' he said. Referring to the company by its New York Stock Exchange symbol LRW, Mr. Lottinville said: ''If you can dig a ditch and need a little cash, LRW has a job for you.'' **********Several analysts said they had been contacted by the union about Labor Ready. ''They told me they're fighting for the workers,'' said Jeanne M. Ernst, an analyst for First Security Van Kasper in San Francisco. ''But I don't see that these workers are being mistreated.'' **********Officials in Washington and Ohio said yesterday that, after hearing from the A.F.L.-C.I.O., they were auditing Labor Ready's workers' compensation payments. But in Ohio, Jim Samuel, the spokesman for the Bureau of Workers Compensation, said ''no red flags jumped out'' immediately. **********The A.F.L.-C.I.O. first moved against Labor Ready in July. Based on A.F.L.-C.I.O. research, two former employees accused Labor Ready in a suit in Georgia of charging workers an average of $1.50 to withdraw their daily pay from cash dispensing machines. Similar suits were later filed in New York and California. **********Analysts said they doubted the suits would succeed because using the cash machines is not mandatory; workers can choose to get their pay in a check or in cash from a machine. **********The A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s Building and Construction Trades Department, which owns 515 shares of Labor Ready stock, has also peppered the company with letters about management decisions and potential liabilities and then broadcast its queries in news releases. **********In one line of questioning, followed by a suit that was quickly dismissed, the union demanded that Labor Ready set a date for its annual meeting, which was not held as usual in August. But Mr. King said that before the letter arrived and the suit was filed, the Labor Ready board had already scheduled the annual board meeting for today."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/17/business/preludes-learning-to-value-our-own-labor.html": {"writer_name": "Abby Ellin", "pub_date": "2000-12-17", "snippet": "Abby Ellin column says people just starting their careers should not hestitate to ask potential employer for the best salary they can get; drawing (M)", "word_count": 853, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Learning to Value Our Own Labor", "print_headline": "PRELUDES; Learning to Value Our Own Labor", "body_text": " **********IF only we could be a little more like the six stars of ''Friends,'' the NBC hit comedy.

Creative types and those just starting out ''often feel privileged to get paid to express themselves, and they forget that they're providing a service,'' said David Wallis, a freelance writer and chief executive of Featurewell.com, a Manhattan-based syndicate for established journalists. **********I know just what he means: The first time I published an article, at the age of 21, I was so thrilled that someone was willing to pay me to write I would have paid them the $25. It didn't occur to me that I could have asked for $30. After all, why be contentious when a million other eager young writers are out there, all waiting to take your place? **********''When you're younger, you don't realize that you're supposed to play the business game, and you have no experience at it, anyway,'' said David Seigerman, 34, a producer at CNN/Sports Illustrated. ''I always folded too quickly, and I probably lost a lot of money because of it,'' he said of some earlier jobs as a writer. **********Then there are the transactions themselves. Do you wait for the potential employer to mention money, or do you bring it up yourself? Should you ask if there is room to go higher, or should you say something like, ''Oh, $500 is fine, but my dog needs a liver transplant and my roof is caving in, so do you think you could up it a few grand, and let me start my workday at noon?'' **********Never ask to negotiate, said Brian D. Krueger, author of ''College Grad Job Hunter'' (Adams Media) and a Webmaster and content provider at Collegegrad.com, a career Web site for recent college graduates. **********''You should go into every situation assuming that everything is open to negotiation,'' he said. ''Without that assumption, you would give up a negotiating chip without getting anything in return -- a fatal error in negotiating -- and may never even get to the table, since they could slam the door in your face. To bring up external and/or personal circumstances is also not a valid approach, since there's no ownership of these issues on the other side.'' **********The best approach, he said, is to be straightforward and ''never give away anything without gaining something in return.'' **********Easy for him to say. I've orchestrated deals that I naively thought were clear to both parties, only to find that our definitions of, say, ''flexible hours'' and ''nontraditional workplace'' were radically different. **********The solution, Mr. Wallis said, is to ''get it in writing.'' **********''Assume that you could always be misunderstood,'' he said, ''so don't be afraid to ask for a three-line clarification, even a 'what if' scenario.'' To that end, be sure to get a second opinion from a trusted professional -- a friend who has been in the same situation, or an industry expert -- before signing on the dotted line. That advice applies even if that line was put there by your agent or lawyer. **********The process is less awkward than it used to be, because more people of all ages are conducting their job negotiations through e-mail, which leaves a record of the discussions.  ''You can carefully choose your wording to present the information in the most effective manner, perhaps even including additional back-up information, which might not normally be included in an oral exchange,'' Mr. Krueger said. ''In this way, the negotiating becomes much more controlled and systematic.'' **********OF course, you may still have to accept that a ''final offer'' means just that. If the job is beneficial to your career (your first writing gig, for example), ''be practical,'' Mr. Wallis advised. **********''At the same time, you must be prepared to walk away from what you really want,'' he said. ''Clients respect you more if you stand up for yourself. Be a little cocky. Don't be too overeager. Let them think you don't need them as much as you do.'' **********And what if they say they cannot match your price -- and let you wander into the sunset? Find five buddies to stand up on your behalf. It might not get you $750,000 an assignment, but at least you'll know who your friends are."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/30/world/russia-eu-seek-political-solution-in-chechnya.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-10-30", "snippet": "PARIS -- Russian President Vladimir Putin and European leaders agreed Monday on the urgent need to find a political solution in the breakaway region of Chechnya, but insisted that Russian sovereignty must not be compromised.", "word_count": 443, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Russia, EU Seek Political Solution in Chechnya", "print_headline": "Russia, EU Seek Political Solution in Chechnya", "body_text": " **********PARIS -- Russian President Vladimir Putin and European leaders agreed Monday on the urgent need to find a political solution in the breakaway region of Chechnya, but insisted that Russian sovereignty must not be compromised. **********\"Europe is concerned about the situation\" in Chechnya, French President Jacques Chirac, whose country currently holds the rotating European presidency, told a news conference after the European Union-Russia summit. **********France has been one of the most severe critics in Europe of Russia's war against Chechen separatists.

AT&T's Digital One Rate wireless phone offering a couple of years ago, which eliminated roaming and long-distance fees, was one example. The 10-10 ''dial-around'' long-distance plans from MCI (now WorldCom) came close. **********Now, Bell Atlantic, the local phone giant, is in the middle of a positively Ruthian blast into the long-distance market in New York. By the end of next month, Bell Atlantic will almost surely announce that it has signed up a million long-distance customers in New York just since the beginning of this year. **********That is something like a quarter-billion dollars in annual revenue swiped from the likes of AT&T, WorldCom and Sprint in seven months. And you wonder why AT&T's consumer long-distance business is shrinking. **********But here is the strange part: This trend is just getting started. Today, New York is the only state where consumers can buy long-distance service from their incumbent Bell company. By the end of the year, that is likely to be the case in at least four states: Connecticut, Georgia, New York and Texas. By the end of next year, that figure could be a dozen, or more, with California, Florida, Kansas, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania fairly likely to join the list. **********For this, the Bells have to thank the Federal Communications Commission, the Justice Department and their own new-found sobriety about just what it will take to win approval from those agencies to offer long-distance service. After years of yammering and breast-beating, the Bells have finally quieted down on this issue, mostly, and come to grips with the fact that the F.C.C. and the Justice Department are not going to be buffaloed. By slogging through the hard, unglamorous work necessary to win over the regulators rather than wailing to all and sundry about how unfairly they have been treated, the Bells have put themselves on the brink of getting all they really wanted from the Telecommunications Act of 1996: a chance to jump into the pot of gold they see in the long-distance market. **********It also didn't hurt that John Nakahata, a highly respected former chief of staff at the commission, was recently able to win approval for a deal he brokered that will reduce the per-minute access charges that long-distance companies pay to local carriers for connecting calls. **********That's a bit of a mouthful, and it gets even a little more complicated. But here is why it matters for the Bells' long-distance aspirations. **********For years, one of the biggest revenue streams for the Bell companies, and other local carriers like GTE, has been the billions of dollars they collect from the long-distance carriers for beginning and ending long-distance calls. Those per-minute fees have inflated long-distance rates for consumers. **********Now, as part of Mr. Nakahata's deal, the Bells may increase one of the fixed monthly fees they charge consumers, so from an overall revenue standpoint, the deal is supposed to be a wash for the Bells. (Of course, the long-distance companies like it because they can pay less to the local incumbents.) **********But shifting from the per-minute fees to the monthly charges helps open the road to the long-distance arena because it helps assuage fears both at the commission and at the long-distance companies that the Bells could ''double dip'' were they allowed into long-distance under the old regime. **********The fear was that the Bells would, with one hand, continue to collect the big per-minute fees while, with the other, enjoy unfair success in long-distance because the rates charged by the competition would be inflated by those very same fees. **********So by reducing the per-minute fees, the Nakahata deal levels the playing field to a certain extent. **********But the primary issue for the Bells remains the fact that before they are allowed to sell long-distance services in a given state, they must first convince the F.C.C. that they have opened their local networks in that state to competitors. In that regard, Bell Atlantic and the tough New York State regulators, who reviewed the Bell Atlantic case, have set the standard for the rest of the nation. **********In New York, Bell Atlantic had to pass a detailed and rigorous battery of tests devised by KPMG, the consulting firm, which tested whether Bell Atlantic's systems were capable of supplying competitive local phone companies with access to parts of Bell Atlantic's networks. **********The commission is not likely to accept anything less for any other state, and in the short run that has made life a bit tougher for the other Bells. A year ago, top executives from SBC Communications, which does business as Pacific Bell and Southwestern Bell, thought they could actually beat Bell Atlantic into long-distance by breaking into the Texas market. After they saw what Bell Atlantic went through in New York, however, they had to go back and come up with piles of additional documents to satisfy the regulators. **********But that additional work will pay off, because now SBC knows just what it has to do in other states. It appears that SBC is now a shoo-in to win long-distance approval in Texas, and the company is hoping to file applications for California and probably Kansas and Oklahoma in the next six months. **********In the Southeast, BellSouth is working hard in Georgia and is hoping to win long-distance approval for that state by Thanksgiving, though New Year's Eve is probably a more realistic target. BellSouth had not gone through serious testing in Georgia before seeing what Bell Atlantic did in New York, but has now gone back to conduct such tests. **********Bell Atlantic is trying to replicate its New York experience in Massachusetts, New Jersey and Pennsylvania while the laggard still appears to be U S West, which has agreed to be acquired by Qwest Communications International Inc."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/13/business/machine-tool-orders-down-13-in-month.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "2000-03-13", "snippet": "United States orders for tools that make manufacturing parts fall in January, with decreases in Northeast, South and Midwest (S)", "word_count": 215, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Machine Tool Orders Down 13% in Month", "print_headline": "Machine Tool Orders Down 13% in Month", "body_text": " **********United States orders for tools that make manufacturing parts fell in January, with decreases in the Northeast, the South and the Midwest, according to an industry survey. **********Machine tool orders declined 13 percent to an estimated $432 million from $494 million in December, a joint report of the Association for Manufacturing Technology and the American Machine Tool Distributors' Association said. **********Still, January orders were 5 percent higher than a year earlier.

The conference will be in the city's International Peace Center, which houses permanent exhibits on war, including the American atomic bombing of Japan in World War II and Japan's brutal military campaign in China in the 1930's. **********For several days running, the Chinese government and news media have bitterly attacked the conference as the work of people eager to falsify history and raise tensions between the two countries. **********''By planning the rally, Japanese rightists want to distort history, paper over the aggression and undermine Sino-Japanese friendship,'' said a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Zhu Bangzao, in a statement published in the official China Daily. **********Ryutaro Nakakita, an Osaka lawyer opposed to the event, said that the organizers' intention was ''to bring chaos to a hall that was meant to promote peace, and to muddle history.'' City officials say, however, that the Peace Center is a public place and that to refuse to allow the conference to be held there would be an infringement on free speech. **********The organizers deny that the conference is meant to stir up trouble. They say it was conceived as a debate between experts who accept conventional accounts of the fall of Nanjing, which say that Japanese soldiers butchered as many as 300,000 people, and those who deny  any large-scale atrocities took place. **********''Originally, we had planned for a forum between the two sides, in order to verify the facts,'' said Yasuhiko Yoshida, one of the organizers. ''But those who have claimed that there was a massacre declined to participate.'' **********Mainstream Japanese historians of the 1930's and 1940's, the period of Japan's aggressive militarism, say that to accept such an invitation is akin to legitimating the views of German extremists or others who would deny the existence of the Holocaust. **********Although casualty estimates vary, it is widely accepted among scholars that after the sudden collapse of the Chinese defense of Nanjing in December 1937, rampaging Japanese soldiers executed thousands of prisoners of war, men suspected of being soldiers and civilians, and burned the homes of Chinese to keep warm. Thousands of Chinese women are also believed to have been raped. **********In discussing this history, parallels with Germany are inevitably strained. Germany has broadly owned up to the horrors of its wartime past and has paid compensation to many of its victims. But Japan as a society has generally avoided any deep reflection and contrition over a period in which its army ran roughshod over much of Asia. It has generally refused to compensate its war victims and has even avoided paying veterans benefits to Korean citizens  forced to fight in Japan's defense. **********Japan's aggression and the atrocities it entailed are treated only cursorily in most schools here. Even recent concessions to textbook reform in this area, like mention of the rape and sexual slavery of thousands of Korean and Chinese women, is under attack by conservatives, who cast doubt on the accounts and say these subjects should not be taught to young Japanese. **********''The people claiming there was no Nanjing Massacre, including the organizers of this conference, are the people who would maintain that Japan's war in China was legitimate, that it was not an invasion,'' said Tokushi Kasahara, a professor of Chinese modern history at Tsuru University in Tokyo. ''Many Japanese do not know much about these events, and the people of this camp are trying to influence them.'' **********But while fringe figures who deny the Holocaust exist in Germany and elsewhere, voices here dismissing or greatly playing down Japan's wartime crimes are regularly heard from the political, academic and media establishment. The governor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara, for one, has frequently called the Nanjing Massacre a lie. **********''People think by analogy that because Germans committed a Holocaust, that Japanese must have done something like that too,'' said Dr. Shudo Higashinakano, a historian of social thought at Asia University in Tokyo. ''But you must look at the facts.'' **********Dr. Higashinakano, who is scheduled to speak at the Osaka conference, said the Nanjing Massacre, also commonly known as the Rape of Nanjing, was ''groundless war propaganda.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/12/your-money/IHT-softbank-is-all-over-cyberspace-but-its-stock-is-in-orbit.html": {"writer_name": "Miki Tanikawa", "pub_date": "2000-02-12", "snippet": "A graph of its stock price looks like a lawn chair with the back raised for reading: From 1995 until 1999, Softbank Corp. fluctuated between 2,000 and 12,000 yen (currently dollars 18.34 and dollars 110.04).

Then, last year, it shot skywards, rising from 6,670 yen to the current price of 148,000 yen (dollars 1,357.11). Now, the former software distributor with stakes in a mesmerizing array of Internet companies is valued at dollars 149 billion, roughly dollars 20 billion more than America Online Inc. **********Can it possibly be worth so much? Softbank has come so far so fast, that the whole exceeds vastly the sum of its parts. Its stock, which is listed only in Tokyo, is worth far more than the stakes it holds in other companies, and many of those \u2014 such as Yahoo Inc. and E*Trade Group Inc. are themselves richly valued (See articles below and on page 17). While Yahoo trades at almost 500 times expected profit in the coming year, an astronomical level, Softbank's price-to-earnings ratio is on the order of 1,300. **********In June, shareholders voted to make Softbank a pure holding company, pushing its operations into subsidiaries and turning the parent into a mammoth Internet investment fund. Now, Softbank is at the center of a web of related companies, an on-line version of the traditional Japanese keiretsu. **********Yet for all that it has assumed the traditional form of a big Japanese company, Softbank has little in common with the country's post-war corporate titans. Its founder, Masayoshi Son, is a third-generation Japanese whose family moved from Korea. Twenty-three generations before that, they had migrated from China. **********In part to escape prejudice, Mr. Son moved to the United States at 16 and soon entered the University of California at Berkeley, where he invented the prototype for the Sharp Wizard, a hand-held organizer. He used a dollars 1 million payment from Sharp Corp. to create Softbank. **********The company \u2014 which Mr. Son has said has a 300-year plan \u2014 began as a software distributor in 1981 and added sales of networking products, in conjunction with Novell Inc., in 1990. He took Softbank public in 1994, moved into trade shows that year with the purchase of a division of Ziff-Davis, added the Comdex trade show the next year and then purchased the rest of Ziff-Davis in 1996 and made its first major Internet purchase with an dollars 80 million investment to buy about a third of Yahoo. **********It was a swift climb in value of Yahoo that set off Softbank's rally early in 1999. In the middle of the year, however, Softbank took on its own momentum. Now it is worth 16.27 trillion yen, while the value of its holdings hovers around 4.9 trillion. **********What accounts for the premium of more than 10 trillion yen? Analysts cited several reasons, among them a bonus for the role that Softbank plays as a management company, for its vast influence over the Internet and for the ability of investors to gain exposure to many affiliates with the purchase of a single stock. **********For one thing, Softbank owns interests in a string of new Internet companies that are not yet public but whose stock is expected to be floated soon. Examples include some of its joint ventures with American companies, such as Morningstar Japan KK, the mutual-fund information provider, and E*Trade Japan KK, the on-line broker, as well as Softbank Investment Corp., which runs venture-capital funds that invest in Internet properties. **********With such a big presence on the Internet, Softbank also has what analysts called gravitational pull: the ability to draw promising companies into its fold. **********Having Softbank as an investor likewise generates a premium for an affiliated company. Those in the Softbank fold can expect it to foster synergies among its units. **********In Japan, many of Softbank's subsidiaries are based on existing American companies, such as Yahoo and E*Trade. These versions generally garner higher premiums than their American counterparts because competition is, for now, less fierce in Japan. They are also relatively inexpensive to create, since much of the technology and marketing development has already been done. **********Mahendra Negi, an analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc. said these imports were valued two to three times more highly than their models in America. \"If the company is valued at 200 times its earnings in the United States, it would be 600 times in Japan,\" he said. **********With its global reach, Softbank can bring these concepts to other countries. There is, for example, a Yahoo Korea and an E*Trade Korea, and Softbank has investments in Latin America and China. **********Juliette Chow, an Internet analyst at Lehman Brothers Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong, said that Softbank was the only global Internet company, with potential to go further by cultivating untapped markets. Because of its international reach, brand recognition, network and deal-making capabilities, \"Softbank is the partner of choice in Internet,\" said Ms. Chow. **********Lehman Brothers, in fact, has just raised its 12-month target price for Softbank to a stunning 400,000 yen, 2.7 times its current value. **********Right now, everybody seems to want Softbank, and the demand for the stock is feeding on itself. Institutional investors find it difficult to avoid the company because it occupies much of the technology weighting of Topix, the broad index of all of the shares on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Fund managers hold Softbank for fear they may be left out of the index movement, observers noted. **********The recent tide of money from retail investors flowing into the Tokyo stock market, a factor in bringing the Nikkei index back near 20,000 for the first time since the summer of 1997, has largely been targeted at technology issues, creating yet another constituency for Softbank. **********Yet all this enthusiasm for Softbank and its affiliates could be a self-generating delusion, other analysts said. \"When things start to go wrong, it becomes a Softbank bubble,\" said Toby Rodes, analyst for Nikko Salomon Smith Barney Ltd. in Tokyo. **********Some analysts said that speaking negatively about Softbank generally is avoided because their firms could lose underwriting assignments from Softbank's initial public offerings. **********Meanwhile, Merrill Lynch's Mr. Negi said the coming 18 months were crucial for Softbank stock as many of the company's holdings are battling to establish their brand names as cyberspace leaders. **********Mr. Negi said there was only a limited amount of room in cyberspace for such megabrands, and the results of the battle would be clearer within two years. \"Then it will time for investors to invest directly in individual companies,\" said Mr. Negi, who added that he believed that for now Softbank was still headed up. **********For further information: **********SOFTBANK CORP.

Posner, chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals in Chicago, has laid out an aggressive weeklong schedule of proposals and counterproposals between Microsoft and the Department of Justice. It stipulates that if there is no agreement by next Wednesday, the mediation will end. **********But Judge Posner's schedule order immediately caused some state attorneys general to bristle. After reading it, some concluded that they were being left out of the process until the very end. **********Although the Justice Department and 19 state attorneys general are partners in the suit, Judge Posner's schedule appears to leave the states out of the discussions over the next week. According to an official who has seen the document, it says that if the federal government and Microsoft agree on a settlement proposal by next Wednesday, the state attorneys general will have two days to ratify it. **********''And the states are not going to stand for that,'' the official said. **********Another official noted: ''All it takes is for one attorney general to say no, and there's no settlement, and Judge Jackson issues his ruling.'' Several officials said some hard-line state attorneys general would in fact prefer that because no one doubts that Thomas Penfield Jackson, the trial judge, will find Microsoft in wide violation of federal and state antitrust laws. **********But another official said that while the wording of Judge Posner's scheduling order seemed to leave the states out, that was probably not the judge's intent, and the states could be involved if they chose. **********By the end of the day it was not clear whether the dispute would be resolved, or how important it ultimately would become. But it did serve as a clear illustration of the divide between these uneasy partners in the case, one that will have to be crossed if a settlement is to be accepted. **********The issuing of the schedule does not necessarily indicate that real progress has been made. As late as Monday night, as the judge's document was being distributed, some government officials were saying they thought Microsoft's offer was simply inadequate, though one official suggested that some of the tough talk might simply be a negotiating tactic. **********In any case, the written scheduling order is a new strategy for Judge Posner in this case, and one that makes some of the litigants uneasy. They were not expecting such a strong-willed mediator. **********Last Tuesday, Judge Jackson called the litigants into his office and told them that they had a week to settle or he would issue his ruling. Settlement talks have been under way since Nov. 30. **********On Friday, Microsoft offered its settlement proposal. Among other ideas, the company offered to provide computer makers a version of Windows that did not include access to Internet Explorer, Microsoft's Web browser. The proposal would apply to present and future versions of the operating system. The company also agreed to charge common prices for Windows so Microsoft could not use pricing to penalize or reward computer makers for their level of cooperation. **********But government officials concluded that the offers were riddled with potential loopholes and that they included no mechanisms for enforcement. The Justice Department asked Microsoft for clarification, and Microsoft promised to respond. With that, Judge Posner apparently decided he had enough to keep the process going. **********Microsoft's stock has risen and fallen sharply since late last week with the ebb and flow of settlement prospects. Today, with Judge Jackson's decision apparently put off for at least a week, the stock closed at $104.3125, up 25 cents. **********The state attorneys general hold a wide range of views about the Microsoft proposal. Several have said they do not believe the changes Microsoft is proposing -- even if they are clearly delineated and easily enforceable -- are adequate to solve the problem. Some are holding out for a breakup of the company, some officials said without being specific. **********State government officials held discussions through the day on numerous issues related to the settlement negotiations, including the way the states are treated in Judge Posner's schedule. **********Some attorneys general are worried that they might be perceived to be second-class players in the case. The Justice Department largely led the prosecution during the trial, through the work of David Boies, the lead trial lawyer. He was so effective in court that the states made no effort to right the balance of power. **********But as soon as the courtroom phase ended, several state officials said they would insist on playing an equal role in settlement discussions or, if the case goes to a ruling, in proposing court-ordered remedies. So the wording of Judge Posner's document, even if it was inadvertent, struck a nerve. **********In theory, the states have the ability to end the partnership with the Justice Department and pursue the final stages of the case on their own. The states filed their own suit when the Justice Department filed the federal suit in May 1998. The two suits were merged for trial. Still, Judge Jackson has made it clear he wants to deal with only one plaintiff. So the states will almost certainly try to keep the partnership intact. **********But ''if this is going to fly, the states are going to want to add some things'' to the Microsoft offer, one official said. **********Another said Judge Posner's schedule might not matter in the end, because ''there can be no settlement'' without the states."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/27/business/international-business-mexicos-debt-situation-takes-a-new-twist.html": {"writer_name": "Dan Fineren", "pub_date": "2000-06-27", "snippet": "Mexican government is once again embroiled in borrowing problem with Citibank; but this time Mexico is not late in its payments; Citibank says Mexico paid too early; Mexico's prepayment of $2.5 billion loan means Citibank loses hundreds of million...", "word_count": 830, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; Mexico's Debt Situation Takes a New Twist", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; Mexico's Debt Situation Takes a New Twist", "body_text": " **********The Mexican government is once again embroiled in a borrowing problem with Citibank, resurrecting memories of the Latin debt crisis two decades ago. But this time Mexico is not late in its payments. Rather, the bank says, Mexico has paid too early. **********It may seem odd that a bank would get upset if a borrower with a legacy of financial instability wanted to pay off a debt early, known in banking as a prepayment. But for Citibank, Mexico's prepayment of a $2.5 billion loan means the bank loses hundreds of millions of dollars in interest income it had assumed would flow in over the next six years. **********For Mexico, the prepayment helps minimize the taxpayer cost of salvaging the country's banking system, which is still burdened with insolvencies. **********The government has been under intense fire from opposition parties to curb the mushrooming cost of the bank bailout. And as the Citibank debt was among the most costly on the books of the government's bank bailout agency, the government said it decided to repay now and save taxpayers at least $300 million. **********Citibank has insisted the prepayment is illegal and has gone to a Mexican court to press its case, essentially arguing that Mexico is not permitted to pay off the debt yet. The timing of the dispute, coming just days before Mexico's presidential elections, has made it a sensitive political issue. **********The government does not want to alienate foreign banks and other overseas investors whose money is critical to Mexico's economic stability. At the same time, no Mexican politician wants to be seen as fearful of a big financial power like Citibank, which to many Mexicans symbolizes the hold that the United States has historically exerted over Mexico and other Latin American nations. **********It was Citibank, after all, that was among the most aggressive American lenders to countries like Mexico and Brazil, which struggled to renegotiate billions of dollars of delinquent debts in the 1980's. The chief negotiator for American banks during that crisis, William R. Rhodes, is a vice chairman at Citigroup, Citibank's parent company. **********Mexico's current dispute with Citibank revolves around Citibank's May 1998 agreement with the government to buy Banca Confia, a 230-branch commercial bank that had a history of bad management, money laundering and corruption scandals. **********Citibank purchased Confia for $185 million on the understanding that the government would assume $2.5 billion in Confia debt and repay it to Citibank over eight years. This would provide Citibank with about $120 million a year for the restoration of what Julio de Quesada, the chief executive of Citibank's Mexico subsidiary, called ''a broken bank.'' **********In an interview, Mr. de Quesada called the debt a subsidy, ''an integral part of the deal to compensate the bank for fixing Confia.'' If the government had not assumed the debt, he said, Citibank would not have bought Confia. **********The bank bailout agency, for its part, maintains that the Confia agreement allows the agency to pay Citibank back at any time. Vicente Corta, a lawyer who is executive secretary of the agency, said it would never have made the prepayment without legal grounds to do so. **********Some banking analysts agree. Lawrence Madsen, who follows the banking industry for the investment firm UBS Warburg in New York, said that if the bank bailout agency had not researched the legality of a prepayment, ''I really would be very surprised.'' **********A Mexico City judge will hold a June 30 hearing on Citibank's request for an injunction to stop the prepayment. It is unclear what the next step in the process would be. **********Both Citibank and the bank bailout agency have pledged to use all the legal tools at their disposal to defend their positions. **********Lawyers who have been following the case say the argument is likely to center on whether the Confia sale documents specify that Mexico's bank bailout agency can pay back the debt in advance. **********Citibank argues that the documents allow only the prepayment of the total equity value of Confia, now worth about $137 million. Mr. Corta of the bank bailout agency says there is no prohibition against further payments. **********Citibank also argues that the bailout agency, known as the Bank Savings Protection Institute, violated the Mexican Constitution by assuming it is empowered to act at all, because the Confia deal was signed by another Mexican regulatory agency that no longer exists. **********Fauzi Hamdan, an opposition party legislator who presides over a congressional committee overseeing Mexico's bank bailout, said the bailout agency was acting within its legal rights."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/16/business/the-imf-will-revamp-its-lending.html": {"writer_name": "Joseph Kahn", "pub_date": "2000-09-16", "snippet": "International Monetary Fund approves plan to overhaul its loan programs; more money will be available for emergency situations; IMF will raise interest rates to all but poorest borrower nations; Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers had pushed for t...", "word_count": 834, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The I.M.F.

Will Revamp Its Lending", "body_text": " **********The International Monetary Fund approved a plan today to overhaul its loan programs and keep more money available for emergencies, a victory for Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, who had been pushing for the changes since late last year. **********The global lending agency, based in Washington, will charge higher interest rates and limit the duration of many loans, while discouraging repeat borrowers from relying on the fund for routine aid. The idea is to make certain that plenty of money is on hand to shore up financial systems in emerging markets when panic strikes, as it did in much of the developing world in 1997 and 1998. **********Some poor nations had resisted the changes. Several delegates to the monetary fund from developing countries have said they feared losing access to the money the fund makes available for medium- and long-term programs aimed at helping nations set up Western-style capital markets or make their currencies fully convertible. **********Just last month, the fund's board rejected the same changes in an informal vote, delivering a rare rebuff to the United States, its largest shareholder. But Mr. Summers lobbied other wealthy nations and some major developing countries and persuaded enough board members to reverse that result, people involved in the vote said. **********While the overhaul approved today eliminates four lending programs outright and makes several others less attractive to borrowers, the changes preserve the fund's role as a medium-term and, in special cases, long-term lender. **********And the fund's antipoverty programs will continue much as before, despite some discussion of eliminating it as largely ineffective and redundant with programs directed by the World Bank, its sister agency. **********Mr. Summers has said that investment from private sources so dwarfs official lending in normal times that the fund should keep its resources ready for those rare occasions when private investors lose confidence and stop lending or investing abroad. Those are the times when official lending can make the difference between a mild recession and an economic collapse, he has said. **********''This is very much in line with our emphasis throughout the year on the importance of reforming the I.M.F. to ensure that its role is to support, rather than supplant, private capital markets,'' Mr. Summers said. ''We believe these steps go a long way toward creating a more modern I.M.F., one better focused on responding to financial emergencies.'' **********The overhaul falls short of the radical revamping demanded by some of the monetary fund's loudest opponents. Many critics say the fund often seeks to interfere too much in the domestic affairs of borrower nations, while some have accused the fund of ignoring or even fostering corruption in places like Russia. **********One Congressional study of the fund recommended that it cease medium- and long-term lending altogether, and limit its role to providing emergency financing to nations that have good track records of sound macroeconomic management. Monetary fund officials have said that changes of that nature would essentially obliterate its role. **********The streamlining endorsed today did not go so far. But it did give Mr. Summers ammunition to argue that he had achieved notable results in his push to improve the monetary fund, potentially helping fend off some members of Congress who have demanded a complete rethinking of the fund's mission. **********It was unclear today if the overhaul would persuade Congress to release more money for another major Clinton administration priority, debt relief for developing nations. Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, has held up money for debt relief, part of which comes from monetary fund coffers, until the fund agrees to changes that are more sweeping than those announced today. **********The fund is considering other ways to make itself more efficient and more responsive to critics. Horst Kohler, the monetary fund's new managing director, plans to disclose his own overhaul plan during the Prague summit meeting of world financial leaders next week. **********Mr. Kohler, a former German government minister who took over at the fund last spring, has said he intends to persuade the fund's board to reduce the conditions it attaches to its lending. That would hold the potential for giving borrowing nations more input and control of lending programs. **********The fund did not provide details of how it intended to restructure lending programs. But Mr. Summers told reporters that the fund would cut the length of time a country could borrow under its core lending fund to a range of two and a quarter years to 4 years. That is down from a range of three and a quarter years to 5 years. The fund will also reduce the duration of its longest-term loans to 7 years from 10 years. **********Mr. Summers did not say how the fund would put higher interest rates into effect. But fund officials said the rates would rise with the size of a loan and be structured to encourage early repayment. **********The poorest countries, most of them in Africa, will be spared the brunt of the overhaul. They will not have to pay more for loans from the fund or pay back the loans sooner, Mr. Summers said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/20/your-money/IHT-strength-in-numbersprivate-banks-gear-up-to-serve-the.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Wall", "pub_date": "2000-05-20", "snippet": "THE WEALTH of the world's high-net-worth individuals is expected to grow by more than 12 percent annually to $44.9 trillion by 2004, according to a recent report by Merrill Lynch & Co. and the global management consultancy Gemini Consulting, a div...", "word_count": 3571, "score": null, "source": "International Herald Tribune", "section_name": "Your Money", "type_of_material": null, "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Strength in Numbers:Private Banks Gear Up to Serve the Ever-Richer Rich", "print_headline": "Strength in Numbers:Private Banks Gear Up to Serve the Ever-Richer Rich", "body_text": " **********THE WEALTH of the world's high-net-worth individuals is expected to grow by more than 12 percent annually to $44.9 trillion by 2004, according to a recent report by Merrill Lynch & Co. and the global management consultancy Gemini Consulting, a division of Cap Gemini SA. **********The 2000 World Wealth Report, the fourth in an annual series, found that the wealth of high-net-worth individuals, who have financial assets of $1 million, grew by 18 percent in 1999, to $22.5 trillion, up from $21.6 trillion in 1998. **********Big winners in 1999 were the 1.7 million Asian high-net-worth individuals, whose wealth grew by 23 percent.

The report suggested that future growth in high-net-worth individuals' assets will not just be driven by economic prosperity and expansion of assets through reinvested interest payments, dividends and capital appreciation, but also by the fact that this group of individuals is likely to invest a higher proportion of assets in high-risk, high-return financial instruments \u2014 such as equities \u2014 and venture capital. **********Mark Tilden, global head of financial services at Gemini Consulting, said that providers of private-banking services must gear up to meet the needs of these individuals in what is becoming an increasingly competitive environment. **********\"Success in serving these needs will belong to players who offer unparalleled service in terms of product, advice and technology, and can link these areas of expertise to both personal and corporate wealth,\" Mr. Tilden said. **********The report said that the needs of the super-rich are significantly more sophisticated than those of high-net-worth individuals.

His naming last week of Andrei Illarionov, a liberal economist, as his chief economic adviser was seen as support for continued economic reform. **********The Russian economy, helped by high oil prices, has performed better than expected a year ago, but Mr. Putin has reportedly called for a tight budget for next year, to be ready in the event of lower energy prices."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/27/business/your-taxes-beating-the-tuition-blues-and-earning-some-tax-breaks.html": {"writer_name": "Charles Delafuente", "pub_date": "2000-02-27", "snippet": "Advice on choosing tax strategy that will provide best option for saving for college costs; photo (Money & Business, part 2) (M)", "word_count": 1684, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Beating the Tuition Blues and Earning Some Tax Breaks", "print_headline": "YOUR TAXES; Beating the Tuition Blues and Earning Some Tax Breaks", "body_text": " **********THERE are many ways that Eleanor Terzian and Antonio Ciolino could save on income taxes while also saving for their son's college education. They could invest in a child's name, buy savings bonds, open an Education I.R.A., build up savings in a state-sponsored tuition-payment plan or even increase contributions to their own retirement plans. **********The problem faced by Ms. Terzian and Mr. Ciolino -- and many couples like them -- is that they have to choose among these available strategies, because the tax code does not allow all the breaks to be used at the same time and sets income limits on others. Further, some of the choices are complicated by scholarship-eligibility rules that depend on future income. **********Predicting which strategies will work best years from now is tough, to say the least. **********Ms. Terzian and Mr. Ciolino, who live in Mineola, N.Y., have so far chosen just one way to put away college money for their son, Giancarlo, 11. When he was about 5, they bought $5,000 of stock in three major companies for him. (They declined to specify the companies.) **********''I'm not a fan of mutual funds,'' Ms. Terzian said, differing with most financial planners. ''I'd rather pick a stock and take my chances.'' **********The shares are owned by Giancarlo, with his mother as custodian, under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act, a law adopted by most states that allows a parent or other custodian to set aside money in a minor's name. The arrangement gives the minor the tax responsibility while the custodian makes the investment decisions. **********Monetary gifts to Giancarlo, including some from his grandfather, of about $200 a month, also have been invested in those same stocks. And Ms. Terzian participates in the companies' commission-free dividend-reinvestment plans. **********From a tax standpoint, this has been ''a reasonable first step'' in a college-financing plan, said Sidney Kess, a New York tax lawyer and accountant. **********Because Giancarlo's stock has yielded annual dividends of less than the amount of a standard exemption for a dependent, which was $700 for 1999, he has never had to pay any tax. If he had more than $700 in dividends, he would owe tax at the 15 percent rate on the next $700. After that, under the kiddie tax rules, his income would be taxed at his parents' rate of 28 percent. **********With some planning, Giancarlo will not have to pay much tax on the increase in the stock's value. When he turns 14, he will no longer be subject to the kiddie tax and his income will be taxed at the lowest rate, currently 15 percent, or 10 percent for long-term capital gains. **********The College Board, which tracks the cost of higher education, says the average annual cost of attending a private four-year college, including tuition and room and board, was $20,500 during the 1999-2000 school year. The average cost of a public school was $10,909. Multiply that by four, and it is clear that most people will need to make every smart financial move they can. **********There are other steps that can be taken by Ms. Terzian, a teacher in New York City, and Mr. Ciolino, a chef who is both an owner of and a salaried employee of Spazzi, a restaurant in Fairfield, Conn. **********They could buy United States Series EE Savings Bonds. The interest is tax free for joint filers with income below $79,650 (or $53,100 for individuals) if the proceeds are used for college. But the tax break is phased out after the parents' income reaches $109,650 for couples or $68,000 for individuals in the year the bonds are redeemed. **********Giancarlo's parents could also open an Education I.R.A. for him, or he could open his own, but the maximum contribution to each child's account is only $500 a year. Because of that low ceiling and the various strings attached, such accounts are not popular. The amount is not deductible from income, but the growth of the investment is tax free if the money is withdrawn to pay tuition bills. Married taxpayers with adjusted gross income of more than $160,000 cannot contribute, nor can singles with adjusted gross income of more than $110,000. However, a child can open the account, even with gifts from ineligible parents. **********Alternatively, the couple could invest in a state-sponsored prepaid tuition plan or a college savings plan. (The Internal Revenue Service, however, does not permit both that and an Education I.R.A.) According to the Ayco Company, a national financial planning firm based in Albany, the Montana Family Education Savings Program (800 888-2723), is the only prepaid state tuition plan available to residents of every state. The plan will calculate how much is needed to pay for the college education, including room and board, of a child of a given age. If that much is invested over a prescribed period, the plan guarantees to pay for the child's education. For Giancarlo, the Montana plan would require a lump-sum investment of $94,238 or six annual investments of $18,000 for a private college. The earnings would be tax free. **********As Ayco pointed out in a recent report to its clients, the drawback of such a plan is that the account holder does not benefit if asset growth outruns the inflation rate for college tuition, now about 4.25 percent a year. What the plan does provide, the report notes, is a guarantee that the money will be there when it is needed. **********Among state-sponsored college savings plans, Ayco says one that stands out is the New York College Savings Program (877 697-2837, www.nysaves.com), which Mr. Kess calls ''a terrific new thing.'' That would be the next step in his suggested strategy for Giancarlo. **********Unlike the Montana plan, college savings plans are not tax-exempt, according to Ayco, but no tax is due on the investment's growth until the principal is withdrawn for college. New York State residents can also deduct contributions of up to $5,000 a year each from their state income taxes, a break worth $686 a couple to most middle-income and upper-income taxpayers and less to low-income parents. **********But the fund, not the investor, decides on the investment mix, and Ayco says the New York fund's investment allocations ''are very conservative.'' Ayco suggests that a growth mutual fund might provide a higher return for younger children. **********Several other states offer similar plans. Details are available on the Internet (www.savingforcollege.com). **********A drawback of both the Education I.R.A. and the state-sponsored plans is that the money belongs to the child, not the parents. That can make a big difference to a child who is being considered for scholarship aid. **********Most colleges determine a student's financial need using a formula that requires a student to contribute 82 percent of his or her assets over four years, but requires parents to contribute only 21 percent of their assets. One way to escape the kiddie tax and also avoid limitations on financial aid is to use a child's assets for purposes other than tuition once he or she turns 14 but before it is time to apply for aid. **********The state-sponsored plans are so new that it is not yet clear whether they will be counted in the formula that reduces scholarships based on a student's assets, although many financial planners predict that they will. Michael H. Iacolucci, the chief technical, training and investment officer for Ayco's financial-related services division, said an informal survey showed that some colleges had not yet decided the issue. **********Another strategy available to Mr. Ciolino is to contribute $2,000 to a traditional I.R.A. every year. He can deduct the contribution from current income because he is not covered by a pension plan and because the couple's adjusted income is less than $150,000. If Ms. Terzian were not covered by a plan, either, she could take the same step. (For people who are covered by a plan at work, I.R.A. contributions are deductible only if the gross income on a joint return is less than $61,000.) **********Normally, I.R.A. withdrawals are subject to a 10 percent penalty if the account holder is less than 59 1/2 years old. But withdrawals to pay a dependent's tuition are free from penalties, although income tax is due on the amount withdrawn. **********A similar strategy for parents is to increase contributions to voluntary retirement plans at work if they are not investing the maximum. The contributions reduce taxable income dollar for dollar, and most plans will allow participants to borrow against their holdings. **********Ms. Terzian, for instance, contributes 14 percent of her salary to a tax-deferred 403(b) retirement plan. If she put in another $2,400, as she could, she would cut her New York State and federal tax bill by $791. **********The 401(k) plans sponsored by corporations are similar, and many companies make them even more attractive by matching a portion of their employees' contributions. Employees can contribute up to 15 percent of their income, to a maximum of $10,500 a year in 2000. **********David S. Rhine, a partner who is national director of family wealth planning at BDO Seidman, the accounting firm, said that ''for the average middle-income taxpayer, retirement plans are the best way to save for college.'' That is because of employer matches and wider investment choices, he said. Also, retirement savings do not count against the financial aid formulas, he said. **********Mr. Rhine recommends borrowing over withdrawing from retirement funds as part of a strategy of maximizing financial aid. A parent who withdrew $20,000 in retirement funds during a child's freshman year, he explained, would have $20,000 more in income that year, and that might disqualify the child from getting aid the next year. **********Another borrowing strategy with favorable tax implications for parents who own homes is a home-equity loan. The interest on loans up to $100,000 is deductible. **********One other strategy mentioned by Mr. Kess is for Giancarlo to earn some money each year when he is old enough. If he earned $2,000 as a kitchen helper in his father's restaurant each summer, he would owe virtually no income tax. If he put that money into a Roth I.R.A., the principal, which is not subject to tax, could be withdrawn to help pay tuition. Mr. Kess would leave the account's earnings alone, because they could become the foundation of Giancarlo's own retirement plan."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/11/technology/as-ipos-stumble-anger-and-skepticism-rise.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-04-11", "snippet": "April 11, 2000", "word_count": 1474, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "As IPO\u2019s Stumble, Anger and Skepticism Rise", "print_headline": "As IPO\u2019s Stumble, Anger and Skepticism Rise", "body_text": " **********April 11, 2000 **********By BRUNO GIUSSANI As IPO\u2019s Stumble, Anger and Skepticism Rise ENEVA -- There are a lot of angry tech investors around Europe these days. There are a lot of skeptical non-investors, too, who now feel vindicated in their belief that Internet IPO\u2019s mean trouble, and that they should stay away from them. **********This is not just a result of the drop in Europe\u2019s high-tech stock markets after their peak at the beginning of the year. The grounds for both the anger and the further disbelief were laid by a few highly hyped initial public offerings over the course of the last month that have gone way wrong for the wrong reasons, and have infused a crisis of confidence in Europe\u2019s still fragile share-owning culture, where most people are still reluctant to put savings into equity. **********It started out on March 14, when Britain\u2019s Internet darling, Lastminute.com , an 18-month-old online reseller of discounted travel packages and other last-minute items, went public in London. Listed at \u00a3 3.80 (about $6) the shares briefly soared to \u00a3 5.35, then rushed downward all the way to \u00a3 1.75, less than half the issue price, before recovering a little to \u00a3 2.18 on Friday. **********As the story went, despite modest revenues of only \u00a3 409,000 (about $650,000) in the fourth quarter of last year and losses in the millions, the company\u2019s shares were oversubscribed nearly 40 times, which prompted Lastminute.com to raise the initial price at, yes, the very last minute. **********Pricing the stock more conservatively would have left more room for it to climb, and turn the IPO into a great brand-building event. Yet the company and its main adviser, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, went instead for maximizing the capital-raising opportunity, and ended up damaging its brand and its reputation in a way that may ultimately prove more costly than the additional money raised. **********Related Article **********Dutch Company on a Quest to Be Europe's No. 1 **********(December 15, 1998) Moreover, in an attempt to maximize the number of shareholders, Lastminute.com decided to offer 35 shares each to investors who, because the offering was so oversubscribed, could not be allocated the full quantity of shares they requested. The company presumably was trying to give to the largest possible number of people an incentive to be loyal customers of the site. While some of them put stop-payments on their checks, most ended up frustrated because profits, if any, generated by such small holdings are generally swallowed by transaction fees and other costs. **********Anger surfaced immediately on investors\u2019 bulletin boards on the Internet and in the press. A typical posting on the Internet reads \"Lastminute.con.\" **********One of the company\u2019s co-founders, Martha Lane Fox, a very visible 26 year old, became overnight the subject of derision and vitriol by the very same media that had profiled her until then as the poster girl for the whole \u201cbritain.com\u201d scene. One newspaper portrayed her in a cartoon answering a phone call from a customer asking about bargain offers: \"We've got some very cheap shares at the moment.\" **********Things got worse three days later. On March 17, the Dutch-based service provider World Online went public in Amsterdam in what was supposed to be Europe\u2019s biggest Internet flotation to date and which turned instead into a disaster. **********Again, the stock was largely oversubscribed (by 21 times), which encouraged WOL\u2019s founder and executive chairwoman, Nina Brink, and her bankers, Goldman Sachs and ABN Amro, to choose the top price of their listing range, at 43 euros a share (about $42). This gave the company a theoretical valuation of over 12 billion euros, which is massive even by American standards, valuing each of the 1.9 million subscribers at 6,400 euros. World Online\u2019s 1999 revenues totaled 64 million euros while net losses reached 91.2 million euros. **********For an hour or so the stock did well, going up to 50.2 euros, then dropped. It closed the first day at 43.2 euros, practically at the offer price. The slide continued down to 13.8 euros (at last Friday\u2019s closing the shares had recovered slightly, to 19.25 euros, still 55 percent off the listing price). **********The drop in price was accelerated when investors learned, days after the listing, that Nina Brink had sold 15 million shares of World Online (two-thirds of her holdings and 6.35 per cent of the total outstanding stock) to three investment groups three months before the IPO. **********One of them, BayStar Capital, a U.S. hedge fund, did not agree to the usual \u201clock-up restrictions\u201d preventing major shareholders from selling stock immediately after an IPO, and dumped 1.2 million shares on the market. **********The sale was actually mentioned in the final version of the IPO\u2019s prospectus (released only two weeks before the listing) but in an obscure fashion: a paragraph on page 99 simply says that Brink \u201ctransferred\u201d her shares. **********An additional note states that she is entitled to share profits made by BayStar on resales of the shares, which made people think that Brink used this mechanism to get round the lock-up period, and boosted the fall of the stock: if the chairwoman sells, why should outsiders buy into the company? **********So far Brink, who is known for being a tough and ambitious manager, has been silent to any request for explanation of her behavior, walking away from reporters and limiting herself to express \u201cregrets for the commotion in the market.\u201d World Online\u2019s chief executive, Simon Duffy, spoke, but just to offer comments like \u201cshe was not aware [of the lock-up], she is an entrepreneur, not a stock market expert.\u201d **********World Online is expected to give its account of the events soon, but in the meantime Brink is said to be under pressure by the underwriting banks to quit as chairwoman. According to accounts in the Dutch press, lawsuits are being prepared by groups of investors, and the Dutch banking and regulatory agencies are scrutinizing the case. **********Some of the 1,250 employees of World Online have also expressed anger. Brink had encouraged them to take out interest-free loans to buy shares in the company. Employees were given a total 22 million euros ($21 million) to buy about half a million shares, which are currently worth less than half what they paid for. **********These events (and others, such as the recent computer system problem that kept the London Stock Exchange closed for more than seven hours) have prompted a large discussion about the myths and realities of the European markets. **********Blaming the Lastminute.com and World Online problems on unfortunate timing (amid a general slide in technology stocks), to a rapidly changing business environment, or to a sudden oversupply of Internet stocks seems shortsighted. It is true, of course, that last year investors had trampled on each other to get a cut of the tiny supply of new economy issues, pushing the valuations of Italy\u2019s Tiscali, Spain\u2019s Terra Networks, and Britain\u2019s Freeserve sky high. **********But most stock offerings keep being oversubscribed many fold, so it seems hard to talk about an oversupply. Sure enough, some 1,000 companies across the continent are lining up to test the IPO waters, including heavyweights like Chello and Jumpy, two portals in the Netherlands and Italy, and T-Online, Deutsche Telekom\u2019s Internet subsidiary, due to float on the German Neuer Markt on April 17. With 4.2 million subscribers, T-Online is the biggest ISP in Europe. **********Others, however, are also to blame for having undermined investors\u2019 faith in the markets. **********Stock exchanges, on one hand, have been drastically easing eligibility criteria in order to attract Internet listings, and are often competing against each other to give better possible conditions to companies. Some markets, like the Amsterdam\u2019s AEX, where World Online went public, have a dual role of operating the market and regulating itself and the listed companies, which creates a fragile situation. **********Related Articles **********Eurobytes column index **********Sites of Interest **********Eurobytes links **********On the other hand, investment bankers handling the issues also carry responsibility: by overpricing the IPO\u2019s and not being strict enough with the companies they advise, they have contributed to discredit the market. **********\"They have poisoned the pool,\" a banker from a rival investment house told the British press about the Lastminute/Morgan Stanley decision to raise the initial price hours before the floating. Several companies are now reconsidering IPO plans. T-Online itself cut back last week its offer price by one-fourth in response to the change of mood among investors. **********Europe has probably learned the hard way, during the last month, a few valuable lessons about the Internet economy, one of which is that a healthy system needs tough (and continent-wide) stock market rules, and an entity entitled to enforce them, an equivalent to the Security and Exchange Commission in the United States. **********EUROBYTES is published monthly.

And even if it could muster the ships, China does not have the means to secure control of the sea or air separating it from the island to carry out such a deployment. **********''There's no way at this moment that Beijing has the weapons in its arsenal in sufficient numbers to undertake and sustain a major, full-scale assault on Taiwan,'' says Jonathan Pollack, a China specialist at the Rand Corporation in California. **********China does have nuclear weapons, but using them against avowed compatriots in Taiwan is highly unlikely.  Most Western military experts say it will be years, if not decades, before the mainland mounts a credible threat. **********Beijing's vow to use force, made in a policy paper last month at the start of Taiwan's presidential election campaign and repeated in an editorial in a military newspaper today, is meant to warn the island away from formal independence and push it toward serious negotiations on reunification with the mainland. Beijing still regards Taiwan as its territory, occupied by the Nationalist authorities who fled there during China's civil war in the 1940's. **********But forcing the island to the table is a delicate game; were Taiwan to survive a misguided mainland military campaign, it would probably declare independence and win widespread diplomatic support abroad. **********Beijing does have alternatives to an invasion, though none of them seem likely. **********The option that experts in Taiwan and the West take most seriously, because it is the one most available to China today, would be a short, Kosovo-like missile campaign intended to devastate Taiwan's economy -- either by direct strikes on sites in Taiwan, or by disrupting shipping lanes. China has hundreds of short-range ballistic missiles pointed at the island. **********Supplemented with information warfare -- using computer viruses and electromagnetic pulses to knock out Taiwan's communications and transportation, for instance -- and perhaps sabotage by Beijing's agents on the island, incoming missiles could demoralize Taiwan's people and undermine support for Taipei from the island's business elite.  Many in that group have investments on both sides of the strait and might prefer political compromise to economic ruin. **********''If it didn't work, Beijing may not be greatly harmed by great loss of forces, as may be the case with other options,'' said Eric McVadon, a retired United States Navy rear admiral and a former defense attache in Beijing. He says this is the possibility that most worries him. **********But the domestic risks if such a strategy failed would be dire. Mr. McVadon added that such a dramatically belligerent act could isolate China diplomatically and halt most exports to the United States and other major markets. **********Foreign investment might dry up, as it did in the year after Beijing's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators at Tiananmen Square in 1989. China's economic engine, still dependent on export revenue and foreign investment inflows to keep its people employed, would probably sputter and slow to a crawl. **********China's economy is already at low ebb and so in some ways more fragile than in 1989. The country has spent billions of dollars to prop up  slowing economic growth in the last two years and cannot afford to do so indefinitely. **********Unemployment is as high as 30 percent in some parts of the industrial northeast, and the economic shock that would follow military action against Taiwan would worsen conditions for many already disgruntled people. If an action against Taiwan failed, Beijing could face a groundswell of domestic opposition. **********''A defeat would mean the end of the regime,'' said a Hong Kong-based economist who asked not to be identified. ''The risk to the party is far more than just more economic stress.'' **********Such a brutal approach, meanwhile, would cast China as an international pariah and reverse decades of diplomatic confidence building. Beijing is still stinging from the international condemnation that followed the killings of protesters near Tiananmen Square. **********The trade concessions it has offered to join the World Trade Organization are, in part, an attempt to erase that legacy. The deal is contingent upon Congress ending its annual review of China's trade status, an exercise put in place after the Tiananmen crackdown. **********And China would not win much of a prize if it did cripple Taiwan's economy. It would jeopardize a major source of investment -- Taiwan has invested more than $30 billion in the mainland -- and would destroy what little good will it has on the island. **********In any case, China is years from being able to ''take'' Taiwan. **********Any large-scale attempt to cross the strait would be obvious for weeks ahead of time as China massed men and equipment on its shores. And once at sea, such a force would be sitting ducks for Taiwan's Air Force or even two submarines positioned at either end of the strait. **********China's chief problem is air cover: It has far more planes than Taiwan, but most are out-of-date blowflies compared with Taiwan's jets. The 72 SU-27 fighters that China has bought from Russia could outmaneuver Taiwan's aging F-5's, but probably not the island's 150 F-16's, 60 French Mirage 2000's or air defenses, which include advanced Patriot missiles. **********Equally daunting are the many ground and airborne radar systems that the United States has supplied to Taiwan to coordinate air and sea assaults. **********China lacks the technology in its offensive forces to cope with those defenses, military experts say, though it is trying to acquire such technology from Russia and Israel. **********China does have air defense missiles, but they lack the range and ability to effectively clear the strait's skies long enough to permit safe movement of an invasion force. **********The best China could hope for would be to disable Taiwan's Air Force by pounding its airfields and communications centers with short-range ballistic missiles and then land enough men to take an airport or other strategic installation, giving them a base to build on. **********But the chances that such an isolated invasion force could survive would be slim, while the chances that those soldiers would end up as prisoners and bargaining chips for Taipei is high enough to argue against that course of action. **********China could seize one or two of Taiwan's outlying islands; Jinmen and Matsu lie just a few miles off the mainland's coast. But those islands are heavily fortified with thousands of Taiwanese troops, and so the cost of taking them would likely be high and the gain slim. **********Or Beijing could attempt a naval blockade, hoping to bring Taiwan to heel. **********China's Navy has enough ships to enforce a quarantine. And the island's economy is almost entirely dependent on trade, including imported oil. Taipei might buckle to domestic pressure and negotiate terms of reunification if its factories stopped running. **********But coordinating such an action is far more complex than anything China's Navy has attempted before. And blockades are easier to circumvent than to sustain. **********Worse, Taiwan might decide to fight rather than negotiate if backed into a corner; that could prove disastrous for Beijing because it is outgunned both at sea and in the air. **********For now, China's most likely military action will be more war games and other training exercises in the coastal provinces facing Taiwan. China has mounted such maneuvers many times before, most recently in September. The size and threatening nature of those exercises could increase, but they are likely to remain games for now. **********Meanwhile, China's is working to upgrade its arsenal. It is improving the accuracy and number of short-range ballistic missiles aimed at the island and is developing a land-attack cruise missile with accurate ''terminal homing'' -- in other words, a ''smart'' bomb. **********Russia has agreed to supply China kits for 200 more SU-27 jet fighters, and Beijing reportedly will soon buy even more advanced SU-30's. And Israel is expected to supply China with an airborne warning and control system mounted on Russian IL-76 jets that could be used for battle management. **********But the new weapons will not necessarily shift the balance of power in China's favor anytime soon. Taiwan will also continue to improve its arsenal and operational skills. And it will take years before China's military is proficient enough to use the high-tech weapons effectively. **********''Troops equipped with weapons produced by various countries are virtually incapable of integrating them in modern, high-tech warfare,'' said Wang Weixin, a senior researcher at China's Military Academy. **********Mr. Wang, quoted this week in China's armed forces paper, Liberation Daily, was talking about Taiwan's troops, but the judgment applies equally to those of his own country."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/04/business/world-business-briefing-europe-german-cable-purchase.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "2000-04-04", "snippet": "United Pan-Europe Communications NV, based in Amsterdam, Europe's number 2 cable television company, will buy EWT/TSS Group, Augsburg, Germany, for one billion euros ($950 million) in cash, stock and assumed debt; EWT has 650,000 subscribers (S)", "word_count": 60, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GERMAN CABLE PURCHASE", "print_headline": "WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: EUROPE; GERMAN CABLE PURCHASE", "body_text": " **********Europe's No. 2 cable television company, United Pan-Europe Communications N.V., will buy EWT/TSS Group for one billion euros ($950 million) in cash, stock and assumed debt.

The visitor was the comic sock puppet, which looks like a mongrel dog, that has appeared on all the television commercials of Pets.com, an Internet pets-supply company. **********On the air, the ''Pets.com sock puppet'' -- as he insisted on being referred to -- was a charming clown. He called Mr. Gibson ''Chuck'' and sang ''Three Times a Lady'' to Ms. Sawyer. The glamorous news personality responded flirtatiously by scratching the puppet's ears and asking the puppet if it had a ''girlfriend.'' **********At no time did the sock puppet hawk dog food or other products offered by the Internet site he represents. But at no time did the anchors mention a fact already known to them and Good Morning America's executive producer, Shelley Ross: that Go.com, the Internet arm of the Walt Disney Company, ABC's parent company, had bought a stake of roughly 5 percent in the pet site only a month earlier. **********Ms. Ross, ABC News and Pets.com all deny that Disney's stake in the Web site played any part in the decision by ''Good Morning America'' to use the lengthy interview as well as a video clip of the sock puppet earlier in the month. Ms. Ross said the idea to book the puppet was her own and was based on the fact that the puppet was ''the hot buzz of the moment.'' Ms. Ross added that she felt that Disney's stake in Pets.com was ''insignificant'' and that she saw ''no conflict of interest'' in using the sock puppet. **********But the incident shows the difficulties of news divisions in policing potential conflicts of interest these days -- a time when television networks, or their owners, are rushing to build substantial portfolios of Internet companies by swapping equity in such start-ups for advertising time. NBC, a division of General Electric, owns outright or has a stake in nearly 40 Internet properties. CBS , which has agreed to be acquired by Viacom, owns outright or has a stake in nearly two dozen Internet concerns. **********''As we move on, things are becoming more and more complicated,'' said Eileen Murphy, the spokeswoman for ABC News. **********Adding to the problem is the fact that while news staffers may be aware of deals the news division makes -- for example,  The New York Times and ABC News are experimenting with jointly producing feature segments for ''20/20'' and ''Good Morning America'' -- they may not know of the deals made by other arms of the organization. Even though Disney owns or has stakes in only four Internet properties, clearly informing its news staff of those deals has been less than comprehensive. **********On Feb. 11, the Pets.com sock puppet appeared on ''Nightline.'' The ABC news program devoted the evening to the decision by Peanuts cartoonist, Charles Schultz, to retire. The sock puppet was one of many guests asked to pay tribute. Between commentary offered by luminaries like the Harvard Professor Alvin Poussaint and Jim Davies, the creator of Garfield, the sock puppet offered bits of wisdom like: ''Snoopy paved the way, you know, before Marmaduke before Clifford, there was the Snoopster, you know?'' **********''I had absolutely no idea'' that Pets.com was partly owned by Disney, said Chris Bury, who was the correspondent for the report. ''Any suggestion that we were trying to advance the cause of Pets.com is absolutely ridiculous.'' **********But Ken Bode, the dean of the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University, argues that ignorance is not an excuse. **********''When Disney's enterprises are as far reaching as they are today, you have to be alert not even to use the news division even to give the appearance of the cross promotion of corporate interests,'' he said. ''ABC news ought to have someone watching for this.'' **********After several interviews with The New York Times, Ms. Murphy said that from now on, if the puppet appeared in another long feature segment on ''Good Morning America,'' Disney's stake would be noted for the viewers. But Ms. Murphy said that if the puppet or Pets.com appeared in just a brief news item, its association with Disney might not be acknowledged. **********Ms. Murphy said ABC News would use a ''common-sense'' approach in making disclosures in the future. NBC News said it would make such decisions on a case-by-case basis. Only CBS said it had a set policy for notifying viewers of the network's investments in Internet companies.  ''Wherever CBS News is aware of an affiliation with a Web-based company, it is common practice to disclose that affiliation to the viewer,'' said Dana McClintock, vice president of communication for the network. **********Ms. Ross makes a persuasive enough case that corporate higher-ups at Disney played no part in her attraction to the sock puppet. In fact, the puppet, which has been promoted heavily in 13 different television ads, including a Super Bowl spot, does seem to have ballooned into a legitimate pop-cultural phenomenon before ABC put it on its shows. **********Pets.com says it has received more than 10,000 e-mails from fans of the ads, which generally feature the dog clowning with real animals or singing goofy renditions of rock classics such as ''Spinning Wheel'' and ''If You Leave Me Now.'' The puppet has also been interviewed by non-Disney owned properties like Access Hollywood and magazines like People, Time and Entertainment Weekly. **********Of course, the popularity of the puppet gives ABC many other openings for featuring it in ways that would not affect the news division -- something the network has taken advantage of. **********In addition to appearing twice on ''Good Morning America'' and on ''Nightline,'' the sock puppet has appeared on shows in ABC's entertainment division, where disclosing affiliations is not an issue. The puppet did a long interview on ''Live! Regis & Kathie Lee,'' where it sang a duet of ''I Got You Babe'' with Ms. Gifford. And last week he was the subject of a question on the immensely popular game show ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' **********The question: What company has a sock puppet on its commercials? **********The contestant's final answer: Pets.com.

Putin, Russia's acting president, in his first interview with a Western news organization, says Russia must be a ''strong, powerful state'' that sheds confrontational cold war politics, avoids isolation from the West and remains willing to seek ''more profound integration'' with NATO even by joining it so long as Russia ''is regarded as an equal partner.'' **********Seated in an armchair in the Kremlin, Mr. Putin recorded the interview last Tuesday with Sir David Frost of the British Broadcasting Corporation. It was broadcast today, and was also picked up by Russian television networks. **********Though there is little prospect that Russia will become a member of NATO anytime soon, Mr. Putin's remarks were clearly tailored to a Western audience, emphasizing a desire to develop stronger ties with the West as Russia rebuilds its economy. But they also revealed his eagerness to reduce the tensions over NATO's eastward expansion and the bombing campaign in Yugoslavia. **********''Attempts to exclude us from the process is what causes opposition and concern on our part,'' he said, referring to NATO, ''but that does not mean we are going to shut ourselves off from the rest of the world. Isolationism is not an option.'' **********The Russian leader gave a spirited defense of the military campaign in the breakaway southern Chechnya region, comparing rebel forces there to ''Nazi criminals.'' Responding to reports of human rights abuses by Russian forces, he said, ''If there are facts of cruelty, of crimes against peaceful citizens of Chechnya, then that goes against the aims that the Russian leadership sets for itself, and they're my own goals at the same time.'' Such cases ''will be scrupulously investigated,'' he said. **********He contended, though apparently somewhat prematurely, that Russian forces had stamped out ''organized opposition'' in Chechnya. Two days after the interview was recorded, a column of Russian officers and soldiers was ambushed near the Chechen capital, Grozny, leaving 20 dead and 29 wounded. **********Though Mr. Putin has a commanding lead in public opinion polls to win the March 26 presidential election, he said, ''I am not inclined to believe that I am assured of victory, that I have it in my hand, that the campaign is over.'' He now leads his closest rival, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, the Communist Party leader, by nearly 40 percentage points. **********Today, after the BBC broadcast the interview, Mr. Zyuganov criticized Mr. Putin's statements on joining NATO as ''naive and unpardonable for a politician of his level.'' **********The Communist leader said, ''Our fathers and grandfathers did not liberate Europe from fascism for the NATO military alliance to make seven-mile steps advancing to the east and posing a threat to Russia's national security.'' **********Mr. Putin said his desire to rebuild Russia into a ''strong, powerful state,'' had ''nothing to do with aggression.'' He added, ''If we again and again go back to the terminology of the cold war, we are never going to discard attitudes and problems that humanity had to grapple with a mere 15 to 20 years ago.'' **********Asked whether he saw NATO as a rival or enemy, Mr. Putin said: ''It is hard for me to visualize NATO as an enemy. I think even posing the question this way will not do any good to Russia or the world. The very question is capable of causing damage.'' **********He argued that the expansion of NATO that has brought Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic into the military alliance should not be conducted without taking Russia's strategic interests into consideration, though he seemed to struggle to state what those interests were. **********''When we talk about our opposition to NATO's expansion, mind you, we have never, ever declared any region of the world a zone of our special interests,'' Mr. Putin said, adding, ''I prefer to talk about strategic partnership.'' **********When Russia states its opposition to NATO expansion, he said again, ''we're not saying we have some sort of special interests there; what we are thinking about is the kind of place that our own country holds today and will hold tomorrow.'' **********''But pretending, or proceeding from the assumption that Russia has nothing to do with it and trying to exclude it from the process is hardly feasible,'' he added. **********When asked whether from Russia's standpoint it would be possible to join NATO, he replied: ''I don't see why not. I would not rule out such a possibility, but I repeat if and when Russia's views are taken into account as those of any equal partner.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/24/business/george-foerstner-91-amana-founder-and-advocate-of-the-microwave-oven.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-01-24", "snippet": "George Foerstner, entrepreneur who founded Amana Appliances during Depression and led it for 48 years while introducing microwave oven and side-by-side refrigerator, dies at age 91; photo (M)", "word_count": 523, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Obituary; Biography", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "George Foerstner, 91, Amana Founder and Advocate of the Microwave Oven", "print_headline": "George Foerstner, 91, Amana Founder and Advocate of the Microwave Oven", "body_text": " **********George Foerstner, an Iowa entrepreneur who founded Amana Appliances during the Depression and led it for 48 years while introducing the microwave oven and the side-by-side refrigerator to American homes, died Monday in Miami, near his winter home in Bal Harbour, Fla. He was 91 years old. **********After leaving school at 13 to work in his father's auto parts business, Mr. Foerstner proved a natural salesman and promoter, founding in 1934 what became Amana when he was challenged by a local businessman to build a reliable commercial beverage cooler. Over the years he built Amana into an internationally recognized brand with the help of such Hollywood stars as Groucho Marx, Cecil B. deMille and Gary Cooper hired to appear in its advertisements. **********Mr. Foerstner started with two employees in a corner of a small furniture shop, with production of beer coolers leading to the making of refrigerators for butchers and then to frozen-food lockers that farmers could use to store foods outside their homes. **********Its reputation for high quality drew on the meticulous work of craftsmen and cabinetmakers in the Amana Colonies, a communitarian German settlement founded in east central Iowa in the mid-1850's. **********Mr. Foerstner's original Electrical Equipment Company was renamed Amana Refrigeration when it was sold to the Amana Society in 1936 but he remained as principal manager. In 1950 Mr. Foerstner and a group of investors that included Howard Hall, an industrialist, bought Amana back from the society. They in turn sold it in 1965 to the Raytheon Company, which had developed the microwave oven and needed an established appliance company to manufacture and market it. **********When Amana's Radarange came under inevitable attack as unsafe, Mr. Foerstner ''took the media head on,'' an official said, in a fervent defense that included bringing in a scientist from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration who said he would be willing to sit on a Radarange for a year. **********He continued to lead the company, which had long been the world's leading producer of home freezers, until 1982, when he retired as chairman. **********In 1997, Raytheon sold the company to Houston-based Goodman Manufacturing, but refrigerators continue to be made at the plant in Middle Amana, Iowa, across the street from the house where Mr. Foerstner spent most of the year. On one occasion, he was the first person on the scene when the plant caught fire. **********Mr. Foerstner was a demanding but generous man, paying the highest wages in the area, the company official said, and was often found at the plant in off-hours, dressed like a farmer. One of his innovations was to sponsor a sales competition among dealers that offered as prizes shares in a mutual fund, which Mr. Foerstner described as ''an investment rather than a one-shot reward.'' **********Besides the Hollywood stars he enlisted to promote Amana products, Mr. Foerstner, who lived modestly, had associations with Vince Lombardi, the football coach, as well as with Dwight D. Eisenhower and other Washington notables, on at least one occasion leading an Iowa contingent to the White House. **********Mr. Foerstner is survived by a daughter, Joanne Meyer, of Middle Amana and a son, Richard, of Iowa City.

Greene, a drafter of landmark civil rights and voting rights legislation but best known for presiding over the dismemberment in 1984 of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, died on Saturday at his home in Washington. He was 76. **********The cause of his death was a cerebral hemorrhage, his son, Dr. Michael D. Greene, said. Judge Greene had undergone a series of brain operations. **********His 45-year career as government lawyer and federal judge -- he never set up a private practice -- helped shape profound changes in American life and earned for the soft-spoken native of Germany a reputation as having one of the most acute legal minds of his generation and a practical one as well. **********He strongly opposed sentencing guidelines, for example, saying they were unconstitutional because they forced judges to order prison time for defendants who did not deserve it. He also managed to impose tight administrative rein on the AT&T proceedings, which a Justice Department lawyer described as ''history's biggest case'' and which had languished for years before he inherited it. **********At the time, a presidential panel had just concluded that the government was mishandling complex antitrust cases to such an extent that unless ways were found to control and expedite them, corporate America might come to regard the laws as unenforceable. Judge Greene's success may have emboldened those who in the 1990's brought such a case against Microsoft, the company with the nation's highest stock valuation. **********''His management of the case was able to demonstrate that the legal system was up to the task,'' said Morgan Frankel, a clerk to Judge Greene at the time. **********As refugees from the Nazis, Judge Greene's family was forced into circuitous escape and Anne Frank-like hiding, ultimately arriving in the United States early in 1943. He was soon drafted into the Army and sent back to Europe to interrogate German prisoners of war. **********Upon discharge, he breezed through two years of night school at George Washington University, working at the same time as an interpreter and translator at the Office of Alien Property, a unit of the Justice Department. **********Law school beckoned, though largely by default. As a teenager, he had learned something of the jewelry business from his father but had no interest in the field. He found as well that he had no scientific bent, nor was he drawn, as friends had been, into the Foreign Service or intelligence work. **********''Law was the alternative that came along,'' he said. **********While attending George Washington's law school, he was a clerk for former Senator Bennett Champ Clark at the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. **********After graduation, Judge Greene went to the Justice Department. His work there was dominated by civil rights issues, which gained prominence in the late 1950's and early 60's. **********He was soon heavily involved in drafting what would become the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and he helped lobby for them in Congress. The unit he led also contributed to the department's day-to-day handling of racial confrontations. **********''The attorney general,'' Judge Greene later recalled, ''would call at 5 o'clock in the evening and say: 'Tomorrow morning we're going to try to integrate the University of Mississippi. Get us a memo on what we're likely to do, what we can do if the governor sends the National Guard there -- and I want to have it on my desk at 8 o'clock tomorrow morning.' That's the kind of thing that I did and my people did.'' **********In drafting the 1964 legislation, Judge Greene and his colleagues had to choose whether to base it on the 14th Amendment, which bars discrimination, or on the commerce clause of the Constitution. The latter, though less the stuff of idealism, was chosen as able to better stand up to legal challenges. **********Judge Greene marveled at how quickly the new law had its intended effect. ''Within days,'' he once observed, ''it was everybody all over the South -- restaurants, hotels, motels -- just gave up their previous opposition.'' **********After 12 years, Judge Greene moved to the Court of General Sessions, a local court now called the Superior Court for the District of Columbia, where he brought order to a demoralized institution in near chaos from an overload of cases. He was also deeply engaged in planning for a new courthouse building, successfully arguing that it should not contain a jail. His position was in accord with his longstanding belief that courts should not be regarded as portals to prison. **********It was this part of his career, not the civil rights work or the telephone case, that he was most proud of, his son, Dr. Greene, said recently. **********In 1978, President Carter appointed him to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. **********There, among the 140 to 150 cases he was assigned, was the one that would transfix the telecommunications world for the better part of a decade, the antitrust case of United States v. AT&T. **********The government contended essentially that the telephone colossus -- which then provided both local and long-distance service -- was illegally stifling competition, using regulator-sanctioned profits from the telephone business to subsidize unregulated businesses, like manufacturing equipment. **********The government's position was not widely popular, with much of the public wondering why Washington seemed to be putting in jeopardy what was generally acknowledged to be the world's best telephone system. **********Eventually, the settlement that followed an 11-month trial won acceptance -- even if complaints are still heard. **********Without the breakup, Stanley Sporkin, a federal district judge and colleague of Judge Greene's, said recently, the United States would now probably have a ''rudimentary'' telephone system without cellular phones, caller I.D. and a host of other options, and competition that has brought long-distance rates for millions down to pennies a minute. **********He called Judge Greene's work ''one of the great decisions of all time, an important part of the technological revolution we're now in.'' **********Looking back at the case in an interview for the court's oral history project, Judge Greene said his main contribution was to require the parties to submit statements of contentions and proof -- their assertions and the evidence they had to support them -- that he insisted be progressively whittled down. **********The judge then forced the two sides to stipulate points of agreement, reducing to one year a trial that he said might have dragged on as long as five years. With the clock running down, the government and the company reached a settlement over the Christmas holidays and announced it in January 1982. **********Although Judge Greene was out of town and knew nothing of the proposed deal, many said he brought the company to the negotiating table because of a lengthy opinion he wrote halfway through the trial in which, responding to a motion to dismiss the case, he rejected most of AT&T's contentions. **********''It has been said that that was responsible, at least in part, for the settlement because they felt I gave them an in as to what I would do,'' should he need to make a ruling, Judge Greene recalled. ''But that wasn't my purpose. My purpose was to deal with the motions that had been filed.'' **********According to his son, ''he always said he didn't know for sure'' how he would have ruled. **********After wrangling with a court in New Jersey over who should decide whether the settlement, splitting AT&T into seven regional companies, was in the public interest, Judge Greene approved it subject to various conditions. The breakup of AT&T -- the old ''Ma Bell'' -- was completed on Jan. 1, 1984. **********Years later, when asked about his response to criticism of the breakup -- customers' complaining about things like complicated bills and the need to choose from a confusing array of long-distance companies and to buy telephones that would no longer be fixed free -- Judge Greene said he was convinced that the right outcome had been achieved. **********''Most of the time I don't react at all because you cannot possibly persuade people that what they have firmly in mind is not so,'' he said. ''I am perfectly content in my own view that the breakup was a good thing. It brought competition into a field where there hadn't been any competition and that's the American way. Competition brings down price and brings up quality. **********''It had exactly that effect. The rates, particularly long-distance rates, are way down. Even the local rates, although initially they were up, have since decreased. So far as quality is concerned, many, many things that have come in since then were not there when AT&T had a monopoly.'' **********Another prominent case he handled involved John M. Poindexter, national security adviser to President Ronald Reagan, who was charged with lying to Congress about the Iran-contra dealings, in which his subordinate, Lt. Col. Oliver L. North, diverted proceeds from arms sales to aid American-supported rebels against the Sandinista government in Nicaragua's civil war. **********With the defense arguing that Mr. Poindexter acted under instruction, Judge Greene ordered Mr. Reagan, by then out of office, to be a witness, the first time a president was compelled to testify on matters involving his own administration. **********In another instance, Judge Greene ruled in the landmark case Edwards v. Habib that a tenant could not be evicted for requesting enforcement of the housing code. **********Aides and colleagues described Judge Greene as extraordinarily diligent, often volunteering to relieve the caseload of fellow judges and sometimes rising in the middle of the night to commit his views to paper. But while other judges would need to spend hours preparing written instructions to juries, Judge Greene would charge them with scarcely a note. **********''When you went into the Greene court, you knew he was the smartest person in the room,'' Judge Sporkin said. **********Still, he suffered defeats, one of them when as an assistant attorney general, he was given the rare chance to argue a case before the Supreme Court, which at the time included the venerable Felix Frankfurter. **********His task was to argue that the government had the right to appeal a motion. Judge Greene recalled decades later that the court rejected the idea, 9 to 0, after Justice Frankfurter first raised his hopes by accurately summarizing his presentation, then deflated him by declaring, ''If that's your argument, there's no need to go on.'' **********''Everybody knew -- I knew -- that if it was a winnable case, the solicitor general would have argued it most likely, or people close to that seat of power,'' Judge Greene said. ''But it was still a great emotional high.'' **********He also admitted to a professional disappointment because the AT&T case was settled before he could issue a final ruling. ''I felt it would have been kind of nice to write a major antitrust opinion,'' he said. **********In addition to his son, Dr. Greene, of McLean, Va., Judge Greene is survived by his wife, Evelyn; a daughter, Stephanie Cavagrotti, of Los Angeles, and three grandchildren."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/09/world/argentine-president-is-trying-to-keep-coalition-together.html": {"writer_name": "Clifford Krauss", "pub_date": "2000-10-09", "snippet": "Argentine Government of Pres Fernando de la Rua is in crisis for failing to deliver on promises to jump-start the economy and cleanse political system corroding from corruption and public distrust; he shook up cabinet in wake of bribery investigat...", "word_count": 880, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Argentine President Is Trying To Keep Coalition Together", "print_headline": "Argentine President Is Trying To Keep Coalition Together", "body_text": " **********Ten months after President Fernando de la Rua took power promising to jump-start a depressed economy and cleanse a political system corroding from corruption and public distrust, his government is in crisis for doing neither. **********The Argentine economy remains in the doldrums and a federal judge is investigating whether members of his cabinet paid bribes to up to 11 senators to pass a new labor code. And with the resignation of his vice president, Carlos Alvarez, on Friday, a day after a shake-up of his cabinet, Mr. de la Rua is scrambling to salvage his coalition government. **********The president, who goes by the nickname ''the pacifier,'' met reporters on Saturday dressed informally in an ascot and suede jacket, projecting a sense of calm. **********''The vice president resigned, and that is an important event,'' Mr. de la Rua conceded. ''I lament that, but the president is in charge and the president continues exercising power. There is no institutional or governmental crisis.'' **********Mr. de la Rua's words of reassurance came as his standing in opinion polls is slipping badly, international investors are growing increasingly anxious about Argentina's ability to pay its debts and his intelligence chief is under scrutiny in the bribery investigation. **********The Argentine press, which granted Mr. de la Rua a long honeymoon after his election last October, is punishing the administration with daily depictions of paralysis and disorder. **********''The resignation of Carlos Alvarez as vice president has sown a profound crisis in the governing alliance,'' said an editorial published today in the country's largest-circulation daily, Clarin, ''which has deep repercussions for the country's political life and probably the economy as well.'' **********Mr. Alvarez's resignation came in disagreement with the cabinet changes, in which the president retained two high-level officials implicated in the bribery scandal. **********One, Labor Minister Alberto Flamarique, was promoted to presidential chief of staff, but he resigned from the government after Mr. Alvarez's departure. **********Former President Raul Alfonsin, the leader of Mr. de la Rua's centrist Radical Party, is trying to persuade Mr. Alvarez, of the social democratic Frepaso Party, to remain allied with the government by becoming formal leader of the governing Alianza coalition. But in comments to reporters on Saturday, Mr. Alvarez appeared ready to become a leading critic of the administration until there is a sweeping investigation of government and Senate corruption. **********''There is a deep moral crisis in Argentina,'' Mr. Alvarez said. ''The government weakens itself when it does not do what the society demands. It will further weaken itself if it does not take decisive action into what happened in the Senate.'' **********As leader of Frepaso, which is allied in the government with Mr. de la Rua's Radicals, Mr. Alvarez was more influential than any other Argentine vice president in modern times. He says he will remain active in politics, and he should be in a strong position to influence Mr. de la Rua's policies or break up the governing alliance altogether. **********For now, the alliance appears intact. In a sign of unity on Saturday, Mr. de la Rua appeared arm-in-arm with Social Development Minister Graciela Fernandez Meijide, a close ally of the former vice president, at a ceremony honoring the Argentine Olympic team. **********But leaks to the local press show that there is much grumbling inside the government. Unnamed officials in the Anti-Corruption Office, a unit intended to clean up the government, were reported in today's newspapers to be complaining that the appointment of Jorge de la Rua, the president's brother, as justice minister hurt the government's credibility in legal affairs. **********Others in the coalition questioned the qualifications of the new labor minister, Patricia Bullrich, and privately wondered how the president could retain his friend Fernando de Santibanes as director of intelligence and the second-most-powerful official in the government when he is being investigated. **********Mr. de la Rua's political fortunes, pollsters and political consultants say, will probably rise or fall depending on the performance of the Argentine economy, South America's second largest. Since taking office, Mr. de la Rua has followed a tack of raising taxes and cutting spending to reduce an expanding budget deficit. But unemployment has risen and consumer spending is stagnant. **********After declining 3 percent last year, the economy is now expected to grow less than 2 percent this year. **********Much of the reason for the mediocre economic performance has been beyond the government's control. Prices for soybeans, wheat and other agricultural commodities have lagged. A scare that foot-and-mouth disease may have returned to Argentina has cut deeply into beef exports. **********With the Argentine peso pegged to a strong dollar and the euro weakening, Argentine exports have lost competitiveness in Europe. And since Brazil devalued its currency last year, many Argentine companies have transplanted their operations to Brazil to take advantage of lower production costs. **********A twist in fortunes is possible, economists say, and an Argentine recovery could be sudden and strong next year. But any further tightening of interest rates by the United States would strengthen the peso along with the dollar, further depressing Argentine exports. **********Economy Minister Jose Luis Machinea spent much of the weekend reassuring Wall Street analysts and international bankers that the government would not budge from its policies of cutting its deficit to decrease interest rates. **********But if economic growth does not resume soon, some economists warn, pressures will rise for the government to reverse its tight spending policies."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/16/business/personal-business-road-warriors.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-04-16", "snippet": "Comments solicited on subject of commuting", "word_count": 103, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Personal Business; Road Warriors", "print_headline": "Personal Business; Road Warriors", "body_text": " **********As cities continue to sprawl, the trip to work, by whatever means, consumes more and more of the day.

Another man shouted, ''Plane, plane!'' as a shimmering sliver streaked through the sky. But the plane passed, leaving the wrinkled men and women clinging to swaying branches like birds with broken wings. **********Today, after having been stranded for five days in the trees above the flooded Limpopo River valley, the survivors finally stumbled from a military helicopter onto firm ground. But their rescue from this submerged village -- named for the date that marks national Heroes' Day -- solved only one of their pressing problems. **********''We lost everything,'' said Joaquim Novunga, a 73-year-old farmer, who lost his cattle, his house and his village to the floods that have devastated this country. ''Now, how will we live?'' **********This misery in Mozambique, a country that has been heralded as one of Africa's success stories, has played out most vividly in this week's dramatic rescues of nearly 9,400 people. But the economic consequences, while less visible, are staggering. **********The United Nations estimates that about a third of the country's corn, Mozambique's staple crop, has been destroyed. The government says that the corn and other crops on more than 250,000 acres have been washed away, along with the topsoil. In addition, more than 40,000 head of cattle have drowned, and 141 schools have been wiped out. **********This year, Mozambique, which was expected to have one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, may see its gross domestic product shrink by as much as a third as thousands of people find themselves without work or a place to live, according to officials familiar with the government's finances. **********And President Joaquim Chissano, who had hoped to focus this year on boosting the blossoming economy, now finds his government scrambling to build thousands of homes, replace washed-out roads and feed tens of thousands of people who have lost their livelihoods. **********Recognizing the need, the government and the United Nations have already issued an urgent appeal for $65 million in foreign aid. But so far, only $13 million has come through, the United Nations says. Nearly 1 million of this country's 17 million people have either lost housing, farms or food supplies to the floods that began last month. **********''We've been telling people, 'Let's get through the immediate crisis,' '' said Michele Quintaglie, a spokeswoman for the United Nations' World Food Program, which estimates that at least 500,000 people will be unable to feed themselves during the next six months. ''But the devastation to the infrastructure and economy is massive.'' **********In a reflection of the shifting priorities, relief workers began emphasizing the emergency delivery of food and supplies today as the flood waters and the number of people stuck in trees or on rooftops declined. **********Pilots for the South African National Defense Force, which has led the search and rescue effort, say they are seeing fewer and fewer stranded people. The defense force plans to send three helicopters flying over the Limpopo River valley on Saturday to assess exactly how many people are still waiting to be rescued. **********Now, relief workers say, the most crucial needs are food, tents, medicine, plastic sheeting and blankets for the thousands of people who lack food and shelter. In Chiaquelane, for instance, nearly 30,000 people desperately need such items. **********The flooding has knocked out bridges and made many major roads impassible, preventing the free movement of people, cars and commerce. **********It is no longer possible, for instance, to drive directly from Maputo, the capital, to Xai-Xai, which is near here. The narrow, two-lane road simply ends in muddy water in the town of Palmeira, forcing villagers to slog through the waist-high tide to carry sacks of corn meal to friends and relatives on the other side. **********Today, a team of high-ranking ministers from Mozambique and other flood-affected countries -- which include South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe -- met in Pretoria to assess such damage and to develop a program to rebuild the regional infrastructure. **********And next week, the World Bank plans to send a team to Mozambique to conduct a full evaluation of the flood and its impact on the country's economy, which had been expected to grow by about 8 or 9 percent this year before the flooding. **********The World Bank representative in Mozambique, James Coates, who advises and monitors Mr. Chissano's government, said he believed the country's economy would recover. **********''The impact is going to be significant, but it's not a death bell,'' Mr. Coates said. ''It's a setback, but it's something the Mozambicans can manage and deal with. The real problem, of course, is the humanitarian crisis and all the lives at risk.'' **********The humanitarian crisis here cannot be precisely measured. No one knows exactly how many people have died, for instance, although relief agencies have estimated that thousands were killed. **********But the toll is clearly visible in the red eyes and weary faces of the survivors, who were battered again last week when Cyclone Eline pushed the angry Limpopo River beyond its banks. Suddenly, the entire world was water, with thatched roofs bobbing in the muddy tide. **********Ernesto Matevelo, who believes he is about 69, said he was sleeping on Sunday night when the water rushed into his house. ''My father told me when the water gets up high to climb high,'' he said, explaining how the villagers ended up in the trees. **********They survived by eating the carcass of a dead bull, drinking the muddy flood water and frantically waving for help. **********But when the roaring Oryx military helicopter finally rescued them this afternoon, pulling them from the trees into the arms of a South African soldier, they began to wonder whether they could ever truly remake their lives. **********Luckier survivors, who were processed along with everyone else at the refugee center in nearby Chibutu, managed to salvage something useful -- a wooden hoe, a plastic plate, a pair of sturdy rubber boots. **********But the 12 people who flew out of this village today left most of their best things behind. Some of their most valuable possessions -- a black metal pot, a blue suitcase with red trim, an orange plastic water jug -- remain tethered to tree branches. **********Mr. Novunga bundled his clothes into a leather bag and tied them to his shoulders with rope. He has spent his entire life as a farmer, working the land, but now he does not even own a handful of seeds. **********''We don't have even a plate,'' he said. ''It's all in the water.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/06/world/us-gives-cold-war-spy-files-to-germany.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-04-06", "snippet": "Central Intelligence Agency hands over first of large cache of East German files listing intelligence agents and their code names; files were spirited out of Berlin in 1989; protracted dispute over their release had soured German-American relation...", "word_count": 175, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Gives Cold-War Spy Files to Germany", "print_headline": "U.S. Gives Cold-War Spy Files to Germany", "body_text": " **********After a protracted dispute that soured German-American relations, the Central Intelligence Agency has handed over the first of a large cache of East German files listing intelligence agents and their code names, the German government said today. **********The files, which will fill critical gaps in Germany's knowledge of the activities of the old East German intelligence service, known as the Stasi, were spirited out of Berlin in 1989 and are widely believed to have been acquired by the C.I.A. in Moscow. **********Germany has long demanded the return of the files, saying they belong in Berlin and should never have been taken to Washington. **********But until an accord was reached late last year, the C.I.A. had insisted the files were too sensitive to be returned. **********''The United States handed over the first CD-ROM containing the files on Friday,'' a government spokeswoman said today.

But the chief judge, Lord Ranald Sutherland, had lost patience. **********In his 90 minutes on the stand, Mr. Talb, a stocky 46-year-old in a goatee and dark suit, described himself as a longtime soldier in the Palestinian cause. He joined the People's Palestinian Struggle Front as a young man in Egypt, he said, traveled on false passports and lived in Jordan and Lebanon, working in the front's military wing and its security wing and as a bodyguard for its secretary general. **********In 1983, he said, he left the front and moved with his wife and children to Sweden to seek asylum. However, he was later accused of bombing Jewish and American targets in Europe, and since 1989 has been serving a life sentence for the fatal bombing of an airline office in Copenhagen. **********The police have linked him to a cell of Palestinian terrorists arrested by the German police in October 1988, three months before the Lockerbie bombing. In those raids, the police found bombs hidden inside Toshiba Bombeat radio-cassette recorders -- just like the bomb that brought down Pan Am 103. **********Mr. Talb was not asked by the prosecutor today whether he took part in the Pan Am bombing. Cross-examination will begin on Tuesday, and will presumably be harsher. To get their Libyan clients acquitted, they need not prove that Mr. Talb bombed Pan Am 103; they need only raise a reasonable doubt that their clients did. **********The mysterious evidence that delayed Mr. Talb's testimony for a month has been referred to only obliquely in open court. The prosecution received it in early October and quickly handed it over to the defense, as Scottish law requires. A defense lawyer, William Taylor, has said the evidence, ''if true, would have the greatest possible effect on the trial.'' **********One Scottish newspaper, quoting anonymous sources, has said ''some form of confession'' was handed over by Syria, whose new president, Bashar al-Assad, is trying to win favor with the West or with Libya. **********A later article in the same paper, Scotland on Sunday, said it describes the bomb's route from Syria to Germany on a Lufthansa flight. None of that has been confirmed in court, and court representatives declined to comment on evidence not yet introduced. **********Remarks in court today gave hints: Some pages from the document the defense seeks are missing. Tapes and depositions describe the missing bits. The prosecution contends that it does not mention Mr. Talb; the defense says it cannot be sure. Neither the defense nor the prosecution is positive the document is genuine; the defense wants more time to investigate. **********Today the court refused to send some official letters asking foreign countries to help the defense. **********Mr. Taylor reminded the court of its duty to ensure a fair trial and said it was ''unfair and contrary to the interests of justice'' to take testimony from Mr. Talb before the defense finishes. But when asked by Lord Sutherland how long the defense inquiry would take, he answered, ''How long is a piece of string?'' and Lord Sutherland let Mr. Talb's testimony go ahead."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/25/business/technology-briefing-hardware-intel-looking-into-new-area.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-08-25", "snippet": "Intel Corp is forming industry working group to foster standards and protocols for so-called peer-to-peer computing, particularly in business environments; peer-to-peer computing is set of technologies that enable direct exchange of services or da...", "word_count": 116, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTEL LOOKING INTO NEW AREA", "print_headline": "TECHNOLOGY BRIEFING: HARDWARE; INTEL LOOKING INTO NEW AREA", "body_text": " **********Intel is forming an industry working group to foster standards and protocols for so-called peer-to-peer computing, particularly in business environments.

Over the past 75 years, large-cap U.S. stocks have returned an annual average of 12 percent, and international stocks as a whole have done nearly as well (though accurate records span a shorter period). History shows that patient investors are rewarded, but they always go through scary times \u2014 always. This is one of them. **********Moreover, no one knows when a market decline will end. Look at the spectacular turnarounds after the 554-point one-day decline in the Dow on Oct. 27, 1997, after the debacle of the Russian default and Long-Term Capital Management collapse in the fall of 1998, and after the shakeout in tech stocks in the summer of 1999. Unless you were about to cash in your entire stock account for retirement, a market decline should be viewed not as a tragedy, but an opportunity. But even if small investors have learned in recent years to muster the courage to ride out a rough market by resisting the urge to sell, they typically cannot bring themselves to buy \u2014 to add good companies to their portfolios at bargain prices. **********The timid can learn an important lesson from the recent activities of Warren Buffett, probably the most successful investor of the last century. As the stock market has been sliding, his diversified holding company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., with more than dollars 30 billion in cash and highly liquid on its balance sheet, has taken off on a buying spree. **********Berkshire is a miraculous company. It has beaten the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index in 31 of the past 35 years. In 1969, a share of Berkshire's A-class stock was worth dollars 45; at the end of 1999, it was worth dollars 47,000 **********Still, Berkshire performed uncharacteristically poorly last year, and Mr. Buffett, in his annual report, took the blame: \"We had the worst absolute performance of my tenure,\" he wrote. \"Even Inspector Clouseau could find last year's guilty party: your Chairman.\" **********Mr. Buffett does not split his stock, and a single A-class share of Berkshire peaked in mid-1998 at about dollars 80,000; by earlier this year, it had dropped to dollars 40,800. But since then, it has bounced back to dollars 65,000 while the prices of most stocks around the world have fallen. **********Berkshire is an unusual stock for this difficult year \u2014 trading near its high and more than 50 percent above its low. It is up for two reasons: First, most of the companies it owns \u2014 all of them in simple businesses like making razor blades (Gillette Co.) and soft drinks (Coca-Cola Co.), marketing credit cards (American Express Co.), selling insurance (Geico Inc. and General Re) and publishing newspapers (The Washington Post Co., which is part-owner of the International Herald Tribune) \u2014 have been doing relatively well this year; they are the kind of staples to which investors return in troubled times. Second, the market has confidence that Mr. Buffett will use his cash hoard to snatch up bargains. **********That appears to be what he is doing. Last week, Berkshire disclosed that it had bought 6.5 million shares, or 15 percent, of USG Corp., one of the world's largest makers of gypsum wallboard and ceilings. Talk about cheap! Before the Berkshire announcement on Nov. 27, USG was trading at dollars 15 a share; it jumped to dollars 19 on the news. Over the past 12 months, the company has generated dollars 8 per share in earnings, so its price/earnings ratio for the period is just a little over 2. In other words, in terms of after-tax profits, USG is producing an annual return for current investors of about 40 percent. By contrast, the P/E ratio for the Standard & Poor's is 27, for an earnings return of less than 4 percent. **********USG does have its problems. The company, writes David Wilson of Bloomberg News, \"faces hundreds of millions of dollars in payments to settle asbestos-related lawsuits.\" Three companies have filed for bankruptcy protection this year because of asbestos claims, but USG seems better prepared to handle the damages, and Berkshire, after all, is mainly an insurance company so Mr. Buffett knows how to assess risk. **********The consensus of analysts is that USG will earn about dollars 6 this year and dollars 3.50 next (for a P/E, based on current prices, of less than 6). The Value Line Investment Survey expects growth after that of about 7 percent a year. **********Also last month, Berkshire bought all of Benjamin Moore & Co., the venerable paint company, whose stock had dropped by 80 percent in two years. Just before that, Mr. Buffett closed a deal to buy 87 percent of Shaw Industries Inc., the world's largest manufacturer of tufted broadloom carpets. Shaw is growing twice as fast as USG, and its P/E ratio is only a little more than 10. **********Notice that none of these companies is a high-tech high-flier that has fallen to earth. There are lots of those around, and some, like Yahoo Inc., which has fallen from a high of dollars 250 to just dollars 41 last week, and Dell Computer Corp., down from dollars 60 to dollars 18 and now trading at a P/E of 22, are worth close examination. **********This is not to say that there are no tech bargains out there. It is only to say that Mr. Buffett only buys companies he understands, and tech does not fall into that category. He has done very well without owning some of the flashy new economy successes, like Dell and Nokia Oyj, which have each risen more than 12-fold since 1995 despite recent stumbles. **********Shares in Berkshire \"will not make us rich fast, but they will make us rich,\" write Samuel Mitchell and Christopher Niemczewski of Marshfield Associates. a money-management company. **********But owning Berkshire is not the only answer. Investors can grow just as rich if they build long-term diversified portfolios of companies that are standouts in their fields, that have churned out strong profits, and that, now, on practically every market in the world, are inexpensive. **********Will shares go lower? In the short term, no one knows. But in the long term, investors get rich as partakers, betting on the success of great companies, not as outsmarters, betting against them. **********James K.

Al Gore himself, locked in a down-to-the-wire battle, can only wonder why this year may be different. ''We've had such prosperity for so long and Greenspan gets more credit for it and technology gets more credit for it,'' explained Tom Gallagher, a political economist in Washington for International Strategy and Investment. **********Declining stock prices are also working against Mr. Gore. While economic news remains relatively rosy -- unemployment is low, and so are mortgage rates -- share prices have gone sour. **********Although the broad market averages are basically flat this year, the Nasdaq composite, where individual investors have placed many of their bets, has been hammered. It is down 33 percent from its March high. **********Individual stocks are faring badly, too, according to Salomon Smith Barney. As of Oct. 31, Nasdaq stocks were down 47.8 percent, on average, from their 52-week highs. Stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 index were off 24.4 percent, on average. **********Although the Nasdaq numbers have gotten a bit better in recent weeks, they are ugly when viewed historically. Today's average decline exceeds the 44.5 percent of November 1987, immediately after the market crash. The current decline is also much larger than the 42.2 percent drop seen in October 1990 after Iraq invaded Kuwait. **********If Mr. Gore triumphs on Tuesday, the market should continue to move sideways. A Gore administration would probably continue attacking tobacco companies and would squeeze profits at health maintenance organizations and drug companies. Indeed, Mr. Gallagher said few industries or companies were likely to benefit from a Gore presidency. His short list included environmental cleanup companies and those developing alternative fuels. **********If George W. Bush is elected, investors can expect more. The cloud over drug and tobacco stocks would lift. A Bush victory would also help Microsoft, Mr. Gallagher said, as a government-ordered breakup of the company would be less likely. **********Christine A. Callies, chief United States investment strategist at Merrill Lynch, said  airlines, whose stocks have fallen as oil prices have risen, could benefit from a Bush presidency. While Mr. Bush might consider modernizing the Federal Aviation Administration and relieving the staffing crunch in air traffic control that has caused an enraging increase in flight delays, Mr. Gore would probably not, she said. **********Another favored area in a Bush administration, Ms. Callies said, would be stocks of electric utilities. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which sets price ceilings for utilities, is dominated by Democrats. Under Republicans, price caps could be raised, increasing profitability for power companies. **********The only investors who might not celebrate a Bush victory would be the nattering nabobs of negativism in the bond market. Gemma Wright, director of market strategy at Barclays Capital in New York, expects bond prices to fall -- and interest rates rise -- if Mr. Bush wins. **********''His proposal will give more of a quick stimulus to the consumer in the form of tax cuts,'' she said. ''The bond market will be concerned that this will keep the Fed more inclined to leave interest rates higher than lower.'' **********But the bond market would also be uneasy with a Gore victory. What it really wants is a continued stalemate between the White House and Capitol Hill. ''When fiscal policy is a battle,'' Ms. Wright said, ''the bond market is relieved.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/12/business/world-business-briefing-asia-softbank-to-start-latin-unit.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "2000-01-12", "snippet": "Japan's largest Internet investment company, Softbank Corp, will set up venture capital fund called Softbank Latin America Ventures to invest in similar companies in Latin America to try to gain from boom in region's online market; fund has $100 m...", "word_count": 62, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SOFTBANK TO START LATIN UNIT", "print_headline": "WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: ASIA; SOFTBANK TO START LATIN UNIT", "body_text": " **********Japan's largest Internet investment company, the Softbank Corporation, will set up a venture capital fund to invest in similar companies in Latin America to try to gain from a boom in the region's online market.

That is shaping up as a central issue in the highly competitive world of online shopping, and it is spawning creative solutions for getting the goods to customers more quickly. **********''I can order a book on my lunch break, but if I have to wait a week to get something, it becomes less valuable,'' said Stacey McCullough, a senior analyst at Forrester Research, in Cambridge, Mass., explaining the frustration that sends many potential online shoppers to the mall. **********Delivery delays are often attributed to the parcel carrier, but mishaps frequently occur before an order leaves the warehouse. Not that this matters to the customer, who knows only that the order did not arrive on time. **********The cost for such delays can be high. In a recent Boston Consulting Group study 19 percent of online customers said the delivery of their orders either took longer than they expected or never occurred. As a result, many stopped shopping online, while others simply refused to do more business with the offending e-tailer. **********Internet merchants hoping to build brand loyalty need to give customers much more than point-and-click ordering convenience, said George Shaheen, the chief executive of the online grocer Webvan, based in Foster City, Calif. ''Everybody thought that ordering was the secret sauce,'' he said. ''But if you're going to win over a large group to Internet shopping, you have to provide them a full shopping experience.'' **********Theresia Gouw Ranzetta, a partner at Accel Partners, a venture capital firm in Palo Alto, Calif., added: ''We haven't figured out how to beam things, but that's sort of what people expect. The Internet has trained consumers that they should be able to access information anytime, anywhere.'' **********To cope with customers' expectations in this fiercely competitive climate, many online retailers are redoubling their efforts to assure shoppers that every step is covered, from mouse to house. While they aren't yet zapping books and videos via modem directly to your computer, they are devising ways to deliver goods faster, better and more cheaply. **********Same-day service is already becoming a fixture in large metropolitan areas. For example, Barnesandnoble.com guarantees same-day delivery in Manhattan by 7 p.m. for Internet orders placed by 11 a.m. In Los Angeles and San Francisco, electronic items and toys ordered by 2 p.m. from the aptly named Sameday.com will arrive by 8 p.m. Other couriers with catchy monikers like Kozmo.com, Urbanfetch.com and Pinkdot.com deliver videos, ice cream and other convenience items store-to-door within an hour in large cities. **********Many sites are also providing precise information about when an order will ship and when it will arrive. Amazon.com has a feature on its site called ''Where's My Stuff?'' that allows customers to follow their orders in transit. Information is a powerful tool, and a customer who feels in charge is frequently a satisfied one. A high degree of personal communication and care seems especially important to shoppers in the cyber world, where orders and service lack face-to-face interaction. **********Behind the scenes, many e-tailers are taking control of crucial inventory and warehouse functions, trying to avoid delays. Filling orders quickly -- using sophisticated technology to get a shipment out of the warehouse and on the road -- has become an imperative for astute Internet merchants. **********''You have to have fresh information and the ability to track that information and keep abreast of the order,'' said Dennis Spina, the chief executive of SubmitOrder .com in Dublin, Ohio. The company is an online order-fulfillment provider for e-tailers that monitors inventory, processes orders and handles shipping, delivery and customer service. **********Most online merchants contract these back-office operations to independent providers like SubmitOrder, whose clients include BlueLight.com, the nascent Web venture of Kmart, and the toy seller Zany Brainy. Shippers like Federal Express and United Parcel Service are also billing themselves as one-stop e-commerce solutions. ''We know how to run a warehouse,'' said Harvey Rickles, the general manager of e-logistics for U.P.S. ''We have inventory management systems and tracking systems already in place.'' **********Still, many of the more popular Internet retailers, including Amazon, Webvan and eToys, handle their own logistics. Webvan, for example, raised $275 million in a private placement of stock last year to build new distribution and fulfillment centers and expand its fleet of delivery trucks. Webvan operates two giant warehouses in or near each of its metropolitan markets -- the San Francisco Bay Area and Atlanta, -- that are stocked with perishables, dry goods, household products, beauty items, clothing, books, portable electronics, music CD's, and even pet supplies. Employees select and pack the orders and load the merchandise onto the company's small, distinctive delivery trucks. **********Many Webvan vehicles use Global Positioning Systems to guide drivers, a high-technology technique that ensures delivery  within a 30-minute window of the customer's choosing. By the end of the year, Webvan expects to do business in Chicago, Seattle, Baltimore and Bergen County, N.J. ''You have to keep in mind what the consumer wants,'' Mr. Shaheen said. **********Amazon is trying to enhance its seven merchandise-distribution centers. The company, based in Seattle, has been criticized for building such capital-intensive structures, but Jeff Wilke, the general manager for operations, said that Amazon's size required massive internal controls on inventory and orders. ''We could not deliver the same performance if we cobbled together some outsourced partners,'' he said. **********Amazon also intends to furnish same-day delivery for some top-selling products --  books, CD's and toys -- to customers through a partnership with Kozmo. (Last December, Amazon invested $60 million in Kozmo, which uses bicycle messengers in 10 cities to whisk movies, snacks and other easily carried items to urban dwellers.) **********CITY couriers like Kozmo and Urbanfetch store products close to their customers, much as Amazon or Webvan does, but on a reduced scale. **********Urbanfetch, which offers one-hour delivery in New York and will do so soon in London, taps a network of sites that stock its  electronics, beauty products, food, movies and CD's. And because couriers arrive at their destinations within minutes, customers do not need to juggle schedules or ask a neighbor for a favor. **********''The ability to schedule a delivery when you know you're going to be home becomes a real asset,'' said Ross Stevens, the chief executive of Urbanfetch, which is based in New York. **********Same-day delivery, or same hour? That choice will depend increasingly on the customer. And anyone who thinks that only city folk will relish these perks, take heart: Urbanfetch also owns the Internet name Suburbanfetch.com."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/29/business/the-markets-key-rates.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-03-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 116, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "THE MARKETS; Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/23/business/media-talk-the-prizes-are-ready-but-the-e-books-aren-t.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-10-23", "snippet": "Frankfurt Book Fair sees introduction of Frankfurt eBook Awards, conceived to encourage electronic publishing; Microsoft vice president Dick Brass forsees growth of electronic book sector; judging current award entries proves difficult; photo (M)", "word_count": 279, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Prizes Are Ready, But the E-Books Aren't", "print_headline": "MEDIA TALK; The Prizes Are Ready, But the E-Books Aren't", "body_text": " **********Conceived about a year ago by Dick Brass, a vice president of Microsoft, the Frankfurt eBook Awards were intended to publicize the idea of reading from a screen and to encourage the publication of new electronic books. **********But at the Frankfurt Book Fair last week, they provoked widespread derision instead. **********''It was somewhere between a joke and a debacle,'' said Stewart Brand, founder of ''The Whole Earth Catalogue'' and one of the judges.

''The dot-coms understand buying and selling. But the real efficiencies come in that middle part of the equation: making things.'' **********Long before the Web, sophisticated old-economy companies were using computer networks, and even the Internet, to communicate with suppliers, to fine tune inventories, to streamline back-office functions. **********But the Web, as an easy-to-use interface for the Internet, has opened large swaths of uncharted territory for industrial America. Through Web-based buying groups, through auctions and reverse auctions and various other types of e-marketplaces, companies are saving millions of dollars in the procurement of supplies and services. **********The Web is changing the sell side, too. With well-designed home pages, companies can pitch their products at businesses too small to warrant a sales call and at consumers who may live hours away from the nearest store or distributor. The companies can anticipate questions and post answers before the queries are even made. They can let customers download software that helps them update their products. **********Diversified corporations, meanwhile, are learning to use the Web to bundle services. In the near future, for example, someone buying a refrigerator from GE Appliances' Web site might receive an offer from GE Capital to finance the purchase. **********G.E., with its corporate tentacles reaching into businesses as diverse as X-ray machines, mortgages and light bulbs, provides perhaps the leading example of what an old-economy company can do with new-economy tools. GE Plastics put up the company's first Web page on Oct. 21, 1994; today, each G.E. business sells products on the Web. And this year G.E. will probably buy $6 billion of goods through the Web. **********''We'll save hundreds of millions of dollars,'' Mr. Welch said. ''Nothing else would give you that type of quantum change.'' **********The Web is also letting G.E. help its own customers compare notes. G.E. posts data  on its Web pages -- stripped, of course, of identification -- on how efficiently hospitals use its CAT scanners, how often airlines do routine maintenance on its engines, how well utilities use waste heat or water to generate more electricity. Customers with a password can tap into the data and use it to benchmark their own performance. **********G.E. is even using the Web to let customers test-drive software, including the programs the company has developed to help hospitals make more efficient use of some medical equipment. G.E. will let them download the software and use it free -- for 30 days. After that, the software self-destructs, unless the customer has paid to receive a permanent version. **********''With the Web, every day you wake up and laugh at how little you knew the day before,'' Mr. Welch said.

The Australian government is expected to consider in the next few weeks whether to give final approval for Speedrail to construct a fast train link between Sydney and Canberra, the national capital. **********\"Australians don't really understand what modern high-speed rail is,\" Mr. Baker said. \"They are used to slow travel and poor service on trains.\" **********The proposed electrified rail line and its trains using Europe's TGV, or train \u00e0 grande vitesse, technology would cost an estimated 4.8 billion Australian dollars ($2.81 billion) and could start running by 2006. **********The federal government \u2014 together with the local administration of the Australian Capital Territory and the state government of New South Wales, which includes Sydney \u2014 selected Speedrail in August 1998 to develop and operate the high-speed rail link. **********Traveling at speeds of up to 320 kilometers (200 miles) an hour, express services would take just over 80 minutes to complete the 320-kilometer journey between Sydney and Canberra, cutting the current overland travel time by more than half. Air travel takes about 50 minutes, an average car or bus trip three and half hours, and existing trains four and half hours. **********Speedrail is a joint venture between Leighton Holdings Ltd., Australia's largest project-development group, and Alstom, the French-British heavy engineering group that builds the TGV train systems operating in France and other parts of Europe. **********The Australian airline Qantas will be contracted to carry out passenger handling, including on-board services, ticketing and station management. The line will also have stations at the Sydney and Canberra airports. **********\"The Australian project is a very major one for us,\" said Frank Bosci, marketing director of Alstom Australia Ltd. Alstom is competing in the Asia-Pacific region for business with the consortium that built the Japanese Shinkansen, or bullet train, network that began operating in 1964. Taiwan signed a deal in June with the Shinkansen consortium to build a high-speed rail link between the capital, Taipei, and the southern port of Kaohsiung. **********Alstom has secured a contract for its TGV system in South Korea and is among the European bidders vying with the Shinkansen consortium for a contract in China. **********The Sydney-Canberra project would have nine Alstom TGV train sets worth about 500 million Australian dollars. Each train would have about 450 passenger seats configured in business and economy class. **********On the drawing board are plans to expand the Sydney-Canberra link by extending it to Melbourne in the south and Brisbane in the north. Speedrail executives said that this would put 75 percent of the 19 million Australians within 90 minutes travel time of a major city \u2014 stimulating economic growth and revitalizing regional towns. **********The federal government sees the Sydney-Canberra link as a way of delaying the unpopular and expensive construction of a second airport in Sydney by siphoning off to the train large numbers of passengers who would otherwise fly to Canberra. The project also could have appeal for voters in the general elections next year, analysts noted. **********Speedrail has proposed that the government provide 30 percent of the cost of the high-speed rail link in the form of cash and tax rebates. The private sector would fund the remaining 70 percent. **********The New South Wales state government has said that it cannot afford to contribute and that the venture should be a federal project. **********Dale Budd, Speedrail's public-affairs director, said that no other high-speed rail group had made such an attractive offer and that most systems elsewhere in the world were entirely government-funded. **********Prime Minister John Howard's government has said that it is prepared to back the Sydney-Canberra link, provided there is no net cost to taxpayers before Speedrail transfers ownership to the public sector after 35 years. **********Speedrail has forecast a net economic benefit from the project of 5.3 billion dollars, measured in tax payments, new employment, savings on highway construction and reductions in highway pollution and \"greenhouse\" gases."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/27/technology/virtually-speaking.html": {"writer_name": "Joe Ward", "pub_date": "2000-01-27", "snippet": "Sportvision's approach to virtual first-down line will be on display during ABC's broadcast of Super Bowl; photos, diagrams and detailed description of process (M)", "word_count": 790, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Virtually Speaking", "print_headline": "Virtually Speaking", "body_text": " **********In football's television broadcasts, an on-screen yellow line marks how far the team with the ball must go to make a first down. The simplicity of the line belies the technology that makes it happen. The trick is to make the line seem painted on the field and to have the players appear to run over it. What appears to be done with smoke and mirrors is actually an intricate process that includes rigging cameras and mapping the field. Sportvision's approach to the virtual first-down line will be on display on Sunday during ABC's broadcast of the Super Bowl and is described here.   By JOE WARD **********Setting the Stage **********Mapping Contours -- A laser placed in the center of the field is used to collect data on elevation points. That information is used to draw a computer map of the contours of the field, and the map is overlaid onto the camera's view of the actual field. **********The Virtual Meets the Real -- The computer map is tweaked and twisted so it matches the field as seen by each of the three main cameras as they pan, tilt and zoom. For each of the three camera views at left, for example -- of the corner of the goal line and of far-side and near-side yard lines -- the computer map image is lined up with the corresponding part of the camera image. All the cameras hooked up to the system repeat this registration process at 10-yard intervals on both sides of the field. **********THE VIRTUAL FIELD -- The computer-generated map of the field appears as a blue grid on the computers used. It is manipulated to fit the cameras' views. **********During the Game **********At the Helm: Four people run the system on game day. **********SPOTTER -- Inside the stadium with a view of the whole field. The position of each first down is relayed to the truck by radio. **********LINE-POSITION TECHNICIAN -- Gets the first-down information from the spotter and enters it into the F Ten computer. Monitors the position of the broadcast line and makes adjustments. **********1ST & TEN OPERATOR -- Monitors the broadcast line for quality and position. Uses the Matte computer to check the colors of the field continually. **********TROUBLE-SHOOTER -- Looks for problems and fixes them. **********IN THE TRUCK -- Scott Simon and Drory Yelin readying Sportvisions' 1st & Ten computers before last weekend's N.F.C. championship game. **********TROUBLE SPOTS -- Field colors change constantly, depending on sunlight, clouds and stadium lighting. The Matte computer data is updated so the line can be drawn even as shades change. **********Tracking the Shots **********Computers need to know what the on-air camera is viewing to display the virtual yellow line accurately. **********The method **********1. PAN ENCODER -- Measures the degree of movement when the camera pans from side to side. **********2. TILT ENCODER -- Measures, in degrees, up and down movements. **********3. REMOTE CAMERA SENSOR -- Collects the data on panning, tilting and zooming, encodes it and sends it to computers in the television production truck. **********An L.E.D. readout tells the operator if the camera is level, which is essential to the process. **********Following the Zoom **********As cameras zoom in and out, the virtual line must follow suit, staying in perspective and getting larger and smaller, as needed. To calibrate the system, the camera is set at full view and the computer map is adjusted to match. The coordinates are recorded. The calibration is repeated several times, as the camera zooms in, step by step. **********CAMERA POSITIONS -- Three cameras are used in the process. One is at the 50-yard line, and the others are at about the 25-yard lines. **********THE LOOK OF THE LINE -- The size and appearance of the line can be changed. It can look like paint on artificial surfaces or like chalk on grass fields. **********Drawing the Line **********Five computers are used to draw the virtual first-down line. **********GATHER PC -- Receives the pan, tilt and zoom data transmitted from the cameras. **********TALLY -- Keeps track of the on-air camera and tells the F Ten computer which computer map to use. **********F Ten -- Displays the on-air video, overlaid with the right computer map. The line is drawn by specifying the left or right side of the field and the yard line, to nearest tenth of a yard. For example: left, 37.8. **********Registrations are done on the F Ten computer, above. **********Matte Tells the Render computer how to draw the line so the players will appear to run over the line. **********RENDER -- Receives data from the other computers, then draws the line. **********The Final Result **********All things lead to this: a virtual yellow line drawn at the first down mark, in perspective, on top of the field and under the players."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/13/business/paid-notice-deaths-fitch-james-marston.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-04-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 92, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Paid Death Notice", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Paid Notice: Deaths  FITCH, JAMES MARSTON", "print_headline": "Paid Notice: Deaths  FITCH, JAMES MARSTON", "body_text": " **********FITCH-James Marston.

Even as these companies preach the gospel of Internet integration to the public, some of the best-known merchants are telling government regulators that their Internet and physical-world operations are distinct and separate businesses -- and therefore should enjoy the tax advantages of maintaining separate operations. **********Those advantages are sizable. Like catalog companies, Internet-only businesses can sell to customers in any state but are required to collect sales tax only in the states where they have a physical presence -- a company headquarters, for instance, or warehouse. For Web merchants, the rules regarding physical presence -- or nexus, in tax parlance -- can also be set in motion in states where the merchants operate Internet server computers, or even backup servers. **********But traditional retailers have a problem. If they integrate their physical stores and their Internet operations, they run the risk of causing a nexus in every state where they have a store and must then collect a sales tax in that state -- even for sales on the Internet. And the more their stores act as agents for the Web sites -- by accepting merchandise returns in their stores for purchases made on the Web, for example, or promoting their Internet sites within the bricks-and-mortar stores -- the greater the chances that states will require them to collect sales tax. **********When these merchants do charge sales tax, not only do they often lose price battles against pure e-tailers; they must also invest in high-price tax software, so they can calculate, collect and then disburse sales taxes for nearly every purchase. **********Bricks-and-mortar retailers, of course, are fighting the tax codes with every nickel of lobbying money they can scrape together, saying that tax laws unfairly favor Internet retailers. And despite the fact that the House recently voted to extend a moratorium on new Internet taxes, the earthbound retailers are hopeful that the Senate will modify the legislation so that all Web merchants could be required to collect state sales taxes. **********Meanwhile, traditional retailers are approaching Internet sales taxes in widely varying ways. Some, like Wal-Mart Stores and the bookseller Borders, are being particularly aggressive. In both cases, the Web sites charge sales tax only in the few states where the companies have actual Internet operations -- even though they allow goods bought on the Web to be returned to all of their stores and even though they promote their sites within the stores. **********Some tax analysts say such an approach is pushing the boundaries of tax law in some states, even if a separate corporate division is handling the dot-com side of the business. But according to Rich Fahle, a Borders spokesman, ''Every lawyer we've spoken to said we're legally in the clear. And our competitors aren't charging tax online either, so that would put us at a serious competitive disadvantage.'' **********Because Borders' big competitor, Barnes & Noble, has spun off its dot-com operations into a separate company, Barnesandnoble .com's sales tax practices are similar to Amazon.com's and other pure Internet retailers. **********One industry executive, said Wal-Mart might be inviting a court case -- something he said he would welcome, ''so we could all get some clarity on this issue and maybe level the playing field'' for non-Internet companies. **********Les Copeland, a Wal-Mart spokesman, declined to ''speak to someone else's theory.'' **********''When we approached this,'' Mr. Copeland said, ''we just looked at how other dot-com companies were structured, and we set up Wal-Mart.com similar to the other dot-com companies.'' He said that, to keep things at arm's length, Wal-Mart stores serve as a contractor to Wal-Mart.com, when it comes to accepting product returns from the Web site's customers. **********Other retailers that have set up separate companies for their online stores are taking a more conservative approach. Kmart, which, in league with Softbank Venture Partners, founded Bluelight.com as a separate business, is one example. **********''Are we charging taxes? Absolutely,'' said Mark H. Goldstein, Bluelight's chief executive. ''Did we buy an expensive software package to do that? Absolutely. Do we think it's right? Absolutely not.'' **********Mr. Goldstein said the company might become more aggressive about taxes later this year, ''when we can focus on this issue more clearly and directly.'' But for now, ''there are municipalities that are counting on this money,'' he said. ''We don't want to be the lightening rod for holding back revenues. We don't want to do anything that's illegal. And we don't want to alienate communities where Kmart has stores.'' **********And although charging sales tax can put his company at a pricing disadvantage, Mr. Goldstein said that gap was narrowing because Internet-only retailers have been slowly raising their prices in an effort to make a profit. ''It was a larger issue when the dot-coms were being subsidized'' by venture capitalists, he said. ''That's disappearing quickly.'' **********For other traditional retailers, the advantages of integrating business units far outweigh the sales tax hit. ''Spinning off a piece of the company just detracts from the overall business,'' said Ken Weil, vice president of new media for Victoria's Secret, a unit of the Limited Inc. ''I recently talked to one company that separated the businesses,'' Mr. Weil said. ''They put their U.R.L. on the shopping bag in stores, and the stores division wanted to charge the Internet division. They got bogged down in a channel conflict.'' **********Victoria's Secret charges sales tax on its Web site in any state that has a sales tax. **********And so far, Mr. Weil said, there is no evidence that Victoria's Secret is rankling consumers who might have expected tax-free Internet shopping. ''We get hundreds of customer service contacts a week,'' he said, ''and taxation never comes up.'' **********Mr. Weil acknowledged that because his site sells only goods bearing the Victoria's  Secret brand, customers are essentially unable to engage in price-comparison shopping, as happens with many other kinds of retailing sites. But according to a recent report by Jupiter Communications, an Internet research firm, even among goods that consumers can buy from multiple retailers, sales tax is less an issue than many retailers may believe. **********In a survey of 1,600 online shoppers, Jupiter found that when shopping for goods priced $50 or less, only 29 percent of respondents said they would consider rejecting the purchase if the retailer charged sales tax. That number climbed to 41 percent for goods over $100. **********So from a tax standpoint, companies should avoid integrating their Internet and existing retail operations ''only if they're selling high-priced, commodity products, like computers,'' said Ken Cassar, a Jupiter analyst. ''Otherwise, the opportunities for serving customers and promoting the site are big enough that even if you do have to charge tax, they're well worth it,'' he said. **********Mr. Cassar noted that 42 percent of those surveyed said that, if given the option, they would want to return products purchased online to the Web site's affiliated store -- an option that, for most retailers, includes charging a sales tax to Internet customers. **********That logic is not lost on Kent Anderson, president of Macy's.com, which tightly integrates the Web site and physical stores, in areas like inventory management and marketing. And it charges sales tax in any state with Web operations or Macy stores, which are owned by Federated Department Stores. **********''We just completed some research which told us that the ability to take merchandise back to the store is a key element for our customers,'' he said. ''It came out as number one or two in almost every customer feedback session.'' **********And sales tax? ''It was not an issue,'' Mr. Anderson said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/14/business/e-commerce-report-for-online-sellers-gift-certificates-business-business-sales.html": {"writer_name": "Bob Tedeschi", "pub_date": "2000-02-14", "snippet": "Online sellers of gift certificates find their weekly sales are actually rising, despite post-holiday drop in sales to consumers; benefit from corporate gift programs that use online gift certificates as cheap and easy way to bestow employee perqu...", "word_count": 1229, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "E-Commerce Report; For online sellers of gift certificates, business-to-business sales are a buffer against seasonal swings.", "print_headline": "E-Commerce Report; For online sellers of gift certificates, business-to-business sales are a buffer against seasonal swings.", "body_text": " **********MANY e-commerce rookies approached this post-Christmas season with a fair measure of apprehension, given the dearth of remaining advertising money and nagging questions about how many of their customers would return after all the gifts had been bought. **********Few had as much to worry about, however, as those companies whose core function was selling gift certificates online. With so much of the business dependent on holiday shoppers, and with so many companies crowding into this niche, even executives of the most well-known sites felt uptight about what the new year would bring. **********''It's definitely something we were concerned about,'' said Robert Levitan, chief executive of Flooz.com, a site that enables  users to buy and send an online scrip -- essentially the equivalent of gift certificates -- that can be redeemed at various stores on its site. ''Would we have a big drop? Would our business be too cyclical?'' **********Surprisingly enough, Flooz and its cadre of competitors -- including GiftCertificates .com, Giftpoint.com and 800GiftCertificate .com, among others -- need not have lost sleep. So far this year, most of these sites report that weekly revenues are actually increasing, despite the fact that post-holiday sales to consumers have leveled off. **********Sound like a contradiction? As it turns out, the online gift-certificate business is benefiting from, of all things, the nation's labor shortage. As companies struggle to attract and retain workers, many are turning to corporate gift programs -- and online gift certificates, they say, are a cheap easy and way to bestow employee perquisites. **********For instance, Cohen's Fashion Optical, a regional chain of eyewear stores, rolled out a program six months ago with 800GiftCertificate.com. When they meet certain sales goals, the company's 300 employees receive  points they can redeem for gift certificates, according to Robert Cohen, the company's chief executive. ''Employees use them to buy books, dinners -- they're all over the place with them,'' Mr. Cohen said. **********For management, one of the primary benefits of such a program is that workers can log onto a page on the 800GiftCertificate site to track points earned toward their awards. The service, Mr. Cohen said, saves  ''tons of paperwork'' and eliminates a multitude of phone calls to the human resources manager by employees checking on their incentive status. **********Michael Dermer, chief executive of 800GiftCertificate.com, said that roughly 70 percent of the company's sales were to corporations, not consumers. As a result, he said, the site is buffered from the major seasonal swings that might otherwise beset the gift business. **********''In the fourth quarter, much of the corporate giving that happens is about cash bonuses,'' Mr. Dermer said. As a result, the company's corporate sales softened even as the consumer sales jumped, resulting in less of an overall spike in holiday sales than other types of e-commerce sites may have experienced. **********Doug Nielsen, chief executive of Giftpoint.com, said the whole point of the company's business-to-business initiative was that it would provide sales stability. ''We're clearly hoping Christmas 2000 will be gigantic -- and I can't believe I'm talking about Christmas 2000 -- but the business-to-business program will level things off'' between now and then, he said. **********Giftpoint.com offers buyers the choice of receiving gift certificates through the mail or e-mail, many companies choose the e-mail option ''because they want them to be more Internet savvy,'' Mr. Nielsen. ''In general, more of the business-to-business market is moving to the online gift certificates.'' **********Mr. Levitan, whose Flooz.com site has also experienced increasing revenues in the post-holiday weeks, said corporate sales during that time had exceeded 50 percent of the total. American Greetings, he said, purchased 300,000 Flooz certificates for a corporate gift program, while Starbucks also bought a large block of certificates for its salespeople. **********Flooz.com typically makes a 5 percent commission on every sale made through the site. Recently, however, Mr. Levitan said he had been able to increase his take by negotiating a ''customer acquisition fee'' from some retailers in lieu of a commission. **********Mr. Levitan would not disclose fees paid by specific retailers. But he offered a hypothetical example. ''Instead of making $2.50 on a purchase of $50, a store might pay, say, $20 for that customer,'' he said. ''You've got a 40 percent margin all of a sudden.'' **********The company earns that acquisition fee regardless of how many, or how few, times the customers return to the retailer through Flooz. But that may change, Mr. Levitan said, as retailers seek to fine-tune the fee structure. **********Mr. Levitan says Flooz can extract such fees, in part, because it offers retailers near exclusivity within a particular category. For instance, Flooz added Toysrus.com, the Internet arm of Toys ''R'' Us, Inc., to its store last week, he said, ''but we won't have EToys.'' **********''People might say that with time, customer acquisition costs will go down, but it's actually getting harder to find customers,'' Mr. Levitan said. ''And I don't see that changing anytime soon.'' **********Such revenue-boosting strategies may become more important in the coming months, analysts said, as more online gift companies and gift certificate sites look to the so-called B-to-B -- or, business-to-business -- sector for sales. If the economy continues to steam ahead and the labor shortage drags on, a glut of gift-giving companies is all but a sure thing. **********''Everybody's approaching the B-to-B market now,'' said Ken Cassar, an analyst with Jupiter Communications. ''Rather than spending huge amounts of money on branding efforts to appeal to the consumer market, they can spend that money on sales forces to court corporate America. But because everyone's pursuing that strategy, they're going to find their sales forces tripping over each other.'' **********And they will also be tripping on the feet of companies outside their category. Businesses like 1800Flowers.com and Proflowers.com are moving more aggressively into the corporate gift market, as are gift sites like Camdens.com and RedEnvelope.com. These businesses can provide corporations a range of gifts for their customers to select online, analysts said, just as the gift certificate companies do. **********Of course, the gift certificate companies are not being ignored by consumers simply because the December holidays have passed. ''There's a lot of background noise gift giving that goes on all year,'' said Jonas Lee, chief executive of GiftCertificates.com. ''Sales are still pumping. We're seeing a lot of birthdays, thank you's, that kind of thing.'' **********Those types of gift-giving events are precisely the reason why the chocolatier Godiva, a unit of the Campbell Soup Company, turned to online gift certificates, and Flooz in particular, late last year. Archie van Beuren, Godiva's chief executive, said: ''People tend to think of Godiva around now, and around the holidays maybe. This gives us a way to stay top-of-mind for other gift-giving times when maybe they might not otherwise think of us.'' **********Asked whether Godiva had seen an increase in gift certificate sales for Valentine's Day, Mr. van Beuren said ''sales are continuing to build, but it's hard to tell if it's seasonal.'' **********Mr. Dermer, of 800GiftCertificate.com, played down Valentine's Day as a big holiday for his industry. There is a decided lack of romance to receiving online scrip. ''At the end of the day, you're still giving someone a code,'' he said, although he noted that his company did offer an electronic gift certificate intended for Valentines Day. **********''It might work for moms and sons, maybe women buying for husbands -- but definitely not for men to give to women,'' Mr. Dermer said. ''I'm sure someone will try it, though, and get themselves in a lot of trouble.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/07/business/market-watch-nasdaq-s-limited-progress.html": {"writer_name": "Gretchen Morgenson", "pub_date": "2000-05-07", "snippet": "Gretchen Morgenson Market Watch column discusses Securities and Exchange Commission report charging that prompt display of investor limit orders, as required by securities laws, occurs with distressing haphazardness; finds investors who place limi...", "word_count": 650, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Nasdaq's Limited Progress", "print_headline": "MARKET WATCH; Nasdaq's Limited Progress", "body_text": " **********VETERAN investors know that, in a stock market as jumpy as this one, limit orders are the only way to trade. Setting prices on trades means that investors are less likely to overpay to buy or reap too little on a sale. **********But limit orders benefit investors only if their brokerage firms actually post the orders for others to see. According to a Securities and Exchange Commission report last week, the prompt display of investor limit orders, as required by securities laws, occurs with a distressing haphazardness. **********The report is a result of S.E.C. examinations in 1999 at the nation's stock and options exchanges and at various, unnamed brokerage firms. **********Prompt and proper display of customer limit orders is good for investors and bad for dealers, so the reluctance of some firms to abide by the rules is understandable. After all, if a dealer gets a limit order to buy shares at a price slightly below the prevailing market, he can sell shares to the customer at a profit, never allowing another investor, who would be happy to sell his shares for a slightly higher price, to interact with the buyer. **********Customer limit orders also narrow the difference between the prices at which a dealer will buy and sell a stock, known as the spread, driving down investor costs. Because this reduces dealers' profits, they have an incentive not to show the order. **********The rules surrounding limit orders were enacted in 1996 after the S.E.C. and the Justice Department found extensive investor abuse on the Nasdaq stock market. Four years and more than $1 billion in penalties later, many brokerage firms still seem to view investor fairness rules with contempt. **********Investors who place limit orders in Nasdaq stocks appear to fare the worst, according to the S.E.C. Many Nasdaq dealer firms, for one thing, do not have automated systems to handle their customer limit orders. And not surprisingly, when orders are handled manually, the S.E.C. examiners found significant problems. At one large Nasdaq dealer firm, a trader working manually failed to display 83 percent of customer limit orders properly. **********Problems arose even among firms with automatic order display systems. One employee of a firm unplugged the automatic system for its entire Nasdaq trading desk for several months without anyone noticing. **********Other firms failed to display the full extent of customers' orders. At one firm, according to the report, when an order came in from a customer at a better price than the firm's, it simply improved its own quote to match the customer's price. The firm told the S.E.C. that since the customer's order was no longer better than the firm's price, it did not have to display the full order. **********Investors who trade on the New York Stock Exchange do not appear to encounter such difficulties. The exchange said that last December, it handled just over six million limit orders. Of those, only 21 were displayed improperly. **********Most troubling, perhaps, the S.E.C.'s report calls into question whether self-regulation works in securities markets. According to the report, some self-regulatory organizations were found to conduct no surveillance of limit-order display. One self-regulator examined only a small percentage of executed limit orders, ignoring those that were not displayed. In addition, some self-regulatory groups failed to refer even egregious rule violations to their enforcement staffs. **********Steve Luparello, executive vice president for market regulation at the National Association of Securities Dealers, said that it had brought 49 limit-order enforcement cases in the past two years. Since limit orders make up two-thirds of Nasdaq orders, this number may not seem large, he conceded. But the N.A.S.D. is comfortable with it, he said. **********Because the S.E.C. report doesn't name names, it is hard to tell where investors are safe and where they are sorry. But investors who are unhappy with limit-order executions should carp loudly to the S.E.C. The commission says it will step up surveillance of limit-order handling. And it needs all the help it can get."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/04/business/company-news-brunswick-technologies-rejects-takeover-offer.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "2000-05-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 92, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRUNSWICK TECHNOLOGIES REJECTS TAKEOVER OFFER", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; BRUNSWICK TECHNOLOGIES REJECTS TAKEOVER OFFER", "body_text": " **********Brunswick Technologies Inc., a maker of industrial and construction materials, rejected a $45.9 million takeover offer from Compagnie de Saint-Gobain, Europe's biggest building-materials distributor.

''The big players of the oil market have already said there needs to be more oil,'' Mr. Tellez said. ''The message has gotten through. The facts are there. I think a proper decision will be taken.'' **********Some American lawmakers -- their constituents paying soaring prices for home heating oil and facing the prospect of continued steep gasoline prices -- have sought to press the producers to pump more oil. Senior members of Congress have called on the Clinton administration to take antitrust action against the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. **********Mr. Tellez said President Clinton had ''achieved a very fine balance'' with his relatively mild suggestions to speed up production. **********Since Mexico is not a member of OPEC, Mr. Tellez said he would not attend its oil ministers' meeting that begins on Monday in Vienna, but would send a deputy. He has been on the phone in recent days, telling many of his counterparts that Mexico has decided to raise output and encouraging them to do the same. **********Mexico will disclose the final figures for its increase as soon as OPEC makes it announcement. Starting in March 1998, when demand was lagging and prices down, Mexico responded with cutbacks that amounted over time to 325,000 barrels a day. The reductions were part of an agreement with Saudi Arabia and Venezuela that expires on April 1. Mr. Tellez said the new increase would not completely erase that cutback. Mexico, the world's fifth-largest oil producer, now pumps 2.9 million barrels a day. **********With a presidential campaign under way in this country, the government's opponents have accused Mr. Tellez of deferring to the United States and sacrificing Mexican interests by favoring larger supplies of oil to bring down prices. A newspaper cartoon depicted him as receiving credentials as ''the second ambassador from the United States.'' **********But Mr. Tellez argued that continued high prices could slow the world economy and eventually depress growth in Mexico. ''We are most interested in having a dynamic world economy,'' he said, adding: ''What we want is a stable, profitable price. For that, we need a stable supply of oil.'' **********A government poll shows that most Mexicans, despite their strong patriotic attachment to the nationalized oil industry, agree with him. In a nationwide survey, 75 percent approved of raising production to bring down prices. **********In December 1998, Mexico was getting less than $8 a barrel for its crude oil. Today, after price increases powered by OPEC's cutbacks as well as the continued economic boom in the United States and the rebound of some Asian nations, Mexican oil is selling at $24.26."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/22/news/asian-countries-urged-to-tackle-corruption-issue.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Friedman", "pub_date": "2000-09-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 539, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Asian Countries Urged to Tackle Corruption Issue", "print_headline": "Asian Countries Urged to Tackle Corruption Issue", "body_text": " **********PRAGUE\u2014                     The president of the World Bank urged Asian countries, particularly South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia, to take steps to eliminate rampant corruption and cronyism, saying Thursday he was \"deeply concerned\" that the region's economic recovery had removed the incentive to tackle the problem. **********\"You can mask the problems by economic growth, but you have within it the seeds of the next crisis,\" said the bank chief, James Wolfensohn.

Those with more modest portfolios may find security in the safe havens of bonds and convertible securities. **********According to seasoned investment professionals, however, one of the most rewarding and economical defenses against volatile investment conditions is a stock portfolio that is naturally hedged. **********Of course, there are ways to hedge with derivatives created for that purpose, but they are often beyond the means of those with modest portfolios \u2014 the very investors least able to weather a downturn. **********While some hedge funds offer good risk diversification, they are generally recommended to investors with portfolios of at least $500,000. Funds of hedge funds are being developed with minimum thresholds of around $15,000, but these are still typically aimed at fairly wealthy investors, those with portfolios of $150,000 and more. The idea here, according to a London-based investment adviser, is that anybody investing in such alternative vehicles should limit their exposure to 15 percent of an overall portfolio. **********Knowledgeable investors can always buy put options \u2014 which increase in value as the market goes down \u2014 to protect themselves in a decline in specific stocks. But while options on individual stocks might not seem very expensive, the costs soon mount if you are buying an option on every stock in your portfolio. Also, unused options expire without value, so you have to keep buying these hedging instruments if you want continual protection. **********This is where cash can come in handy. Mark Dampier, head of research at Hargreaves Lansdown Asset Management Ltd., in Bristol, England, said that one of the best defenses against volatile investment markets is a well-diversified equity portfolio with a strong cash element \u2014 though he conceded that investors seldom heed that advice. **********\"When the direction of equity markets is uncertain, there is a tendency for investors to bail out of stocks and buy so-called safe-haven investments, such as fixed-interest securities or guaranteed funds,\" Mr. Dampier said. \"When markets are doing well, the opposite tends to happen. Investors throw caution to the wind and buy everything in sight.\" **********Such attempts at market timing often fail, Mr. Dampier said, estimating that even professionals lose about 90 percent of the time. He added that although bonds look safe, they can quickly lose value in a rising-interest-rate environment. **********Greed, he continued, can just as damaging as fear in the stock-picking game. \"Overzealous investors can buy into the latest fads without really understanding what they are buying,\" he said. **********Just two years ago, funds that tracked major stock-market indexes were in fashion, but Mr. Dampier said many investors now realized that these funds rarely beat the market. **********Convertible bonds are often recommended as part of a defensive strategy. These instruments provide an income stream and the right to buy an issuer's stock at a set price during the life of a bond. Investors who bought convertible bonds nine years ago would have good reason to be pleased with their investment, Mr. Dampier said. But in the current interest-rate environment, low-yielding convertible bonds are probably less attractive, he added. **********Mr. Dampier said that he would generally advise clients to restrict their investments to equities and keep between 20 percent to 50 percent of their portfolios in cash, depending on their view of the markets. **********Mark Robinson, an investment manager with Berry Asset Management PLC in London, agreed that investors needed cash in a portfolio to take advantage of investment opportunities, but he recommended a 10 percent allocation. Too much cash and investors miss the market recoveries that underpin good long-term performance, he said. **********According to investment strategists, now is a good time to shake out portfolios and get rid of stocks that are unlikely to regain their previous heights. **********There have been several spectacular casualties in the technology sector in recent months, but Mr. Robinson said he would advise investors against abandoning that bandwagon. Prices have returned to realistic levels, and it is time for some judicious pruning, he said. **********For those investors who prefer to leave stock picking to the professionals Mr. Robinson suggested a portfolio of funds of different styles.

In the initial phase of the pilot project, universities in the United States and two Latin American countries will train high school teachers to develop course materials that can be used in their own countries and across borders. **********The program will tap the resources of universities around the world. **********\"We are tapping the resources of universities around the world to produce the best content possible,\" said Elizabeth Lowe, director of the project, which is financed by a $1.5 million grant from the Lucent Technologies Foundation, the charitable arm of the telecommunications company. The company is also donating about $1.5 million in equipment to the project. **********Lowe is an associate director of the Center for Latin American Studies at the University of Florida in Gainesville. Over the next three years, researchers there will be collaborating with counterparts at one Mexican university and three Brazilian universities: the Instituto Tecnol&#243;gico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey in Mexico; the Fundacao Getulio Vargas in S&#227;o Paulo; the Pontif&#236;cia Universidade Cat&#243;lica in Rio de Janeiro and the Universidade Estadual de Campinas , near S&#227;o Paulo. **********The universities will adopt selected high schools in their areas and train teachers there in the development of Web-based curriculum materials for business and science subjects, including biology, chemistry and physics. Lowe said the program is concentrating on these fields because they are considered important areas of knowledge for students who want to work in an increasingly technological global economy. It is also hoped that some students who use the materials might become interested enough in the subjects to pursue university degrees in them. **********Lowe said the course material might include tutorials that would let students proceed at their own pace, or even sites using videogame techniques to drive home lessons. **********Among the decisions still to be made is what language or languages will be used in the course materials, because project participants speak three different languages: English, Spanish and Portuguese. Lowe said some sites could be developed on the assumption that they will be used by speakers of one language, others for a bilingual audience. Still others might be developed in such a way that they could be easily translated, or machine-translated using new software programs. **********If all goes as planned, Lowe added, the project will be expanded to other Latin American countries as well as Asia. Eventually, college-level material will be added, as will content delivered using other technologies, like interactive video. **********Lowe said she would eventually like to see not just course materials but entire classes produced for international distance-education classes. \"We could have high school students in Gainesville taking physics with students in S&#227;o Paulo,\" she said. \"That's the real vision.\" **********One purpose of the project is to increase the amount of high-quality educational content online. Even in English, the language that dominates the Internet, there is a dearth of such material now. And experts in educational technology in developing countries say the problem is particularly acute for non-English speaking nations. **********Sites **********Internet links of interest to readers of the Education column **********Forums **********Join a Discussion on Technology in the Classroom **********\"There is very little content in Arabic, for example,\" said Robert Hawkins, country coordinator for World Links for Development , a three-year-old initiative of the World Bank to bring technology and teacher training to high schools in 17 developing countries. **********Another goal of the program is to see if the Internet and other technology can be used to help developing countries teach an exploding population of school-bound young people. **********In Brazil, for example, high school enrollment has grown at a rate of about 10 percent annually in recent years, according to Helio Waldman, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the university in Campinas and project director at that institution. Researchers there want to see if distance learning, using electronic media, can help meet the demand. \"The main emphasis is the use of technology to help developing countries like Brazil and Mexico in reaching more people,\" Waldman said. **********Today, he added, the Internet is not in widespread use in Brazilian high schools. But Brazilian schools, like their American counterparts, are feeling increasing pressure from parents and others to change that. The reason is the same for both countries: a sense that students need familiarity with technology to find good jobs in an economy increasingly dependent on computers. **********Waldman said he hopes the materials developed in his country will have a distinctly Brazilian flavor. \"I would expect, for instance, that Carnival would be dealt with,\" he said, referring to the annual Mardi Gras celebrations in his country. \"Brazilian themes will be more present.\" **********The EDUCATION column is published weekly, on Wednesdays.

But since the fund peaked on March 9, it has had drastic swings and is now down 42 percent from the high, although it is still up 14 percent since the end of 1999. **********Mr. Slattery's strategy called for putting about 80 percent of the fund's money into the 30 fastest-growing companies and holding them no matter how much their price rose. The remaining 20 percent of the fund was used for quick investments, often trying to anticipate what stocks would get hot and then selling them after they had gained a dollar or two. **********In an interview last week, Mr. Slattery said that in the first year of the fund's existence, it had shown gains of at least 1,000 percent on the stock of three companies: MicroStrategy, SDL and InfoSpace.com. Each peaked in March and has fallen substantially since then.

It also rose rapidly, gaining 78 percent from the end of 1999 through March 10, before it too began to fall back. Through yesterday it was down 37 percent from its peak, although it was still up 12 percent since the end of 1999. **********The New Opportunities Fund peaked at more than $570 million in March.

It stated: **********- **********\"Passengers traveling with a European Union airline will receive full compensation in the case of an accident regardless of where it happens, and also up-front payments if needed to help with immediate economic hardship.\" **********- **********\"There is no limit on the financial liability of a European Union airline to compensate for the death, wounding or any other bodily injury to a passenger. In other words, there is no upper limit on the claim that can be made.\" **********The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, says that advance payments must be made within 15 days of the accident and must not be less than 15,000 Special Drawing Rights, an international currency conversion that equals about $20,000 \u2014 the sum paid to the families of the mostly German passengers aboard the Concorde. **********Only if it can prove in court that death or injury was caused by a passenger's own negligence can an airline seek to limit its liability to a maximum of 100,000 SDRs, or $130,000. **********The EU measure also applies to charter airline passengers, who are otherwise often unprotected under international rules, and to the victims of terrorism. **********The commission claims that passengers are better protected in Europe than in many other parts of the world, where liability is determined by a 71-year old intergovernment agreement called the Warsaw Convention, a summary of which is included on the back or airline tickets. The commission is seeking to get worldwide adoption of a similar set of standards to its own by having the EU and its member governments ratify a new airline agreement called the Montreal Convention. Governments agreed on it last year, but the convention will not enter into force until at least 30 states have ratified it. **********The new agreement \u2014 which is intended to replace the Warsaw Convention \u2014 would establish unlimited liability, and also set 100,000 SDRs as the level below which airlines cannot limit their liability, even if death or injury is caused through the passenger's own fault. **********In its proposal for the EU to ratify the Montreal agreement, the commission says that international rules to govern the liability of air carriers for injury or death were drafted \"at a time when aviation was a fledgling industry with a dubious safety record and in need of protection from excessive claims for compensation.\" **********In 1929, the Warsaw Convention capped the liability of airlines in the event of death or injury to the equivalent of $10,000, which has since been raised to $75,000 in the United States and elsewhere. Beyond this, passengers flying with a ticket governed by the convention have to prove negligence by the airline in order to obtain a larger amount in compensation, unless the airline has signed a voluntary agreement to waive the liability limits. The agreement, established by the International Air Transport Association, includes most major carriers in North America and Asia, an IATA spokesman said. **********Compensation in air disasters is a lottery. The U.S. system, for example, makes a legal distinction between passengers flying on an international ticket, to which the Warsaw liability cap applies, and domestic passengers to whom no such ceiling applies. **********\"U.S. law has discriminated against international travelers for many years,\" said David Rapoport, senior partner of a Chicago law firm that specializes in representing the families of the victims of aircraft disasters. **********The EU system calls for compensation based on actual economic loss according to the custom in the victim's place of residence. This means that families in the industrialized world would generally receive greater compensation than those in developing countries. Mr. Rapoport said the European system was unfair in that it does not take noneconomic loss into consideration."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/22/world/us-and-india-trying-to-reconcile-hit-bump.html": {"writer_name": "Jane Perlez", "pub_date": "2000-03-22", "snippet": "Pres Clinton and India's Prime Min Atal Behari Vajpayee sign what they call 'vision statement' defining their common interests while pointing out that they disagree on India's possession of nuclear weapons; Clinton, in address to Indian Parliament...", "word_count": 1428, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. and India, Trying to Reconcile, Hit Bump", "print_headline": "U.S. and India, Trying to Reconcile, Hit Bump", "body_text": " **********The United States and India opened what they called an era ''of new beginnings'' on Tuesday in an effort to rebuild a relationship that  President Clinton said had been neglected for more than two decades.  But a series of encounters, including a sharp rebuke of the president in the evening, showed that the opening chapter was spiked with surprises. **********Against a backdrop of a massacre of 35 Sikhs in the Indian-held part of Kashmir just before Mr. Clinton's arrival on an official visit, the Indian prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, and the president signed what they called a ''vision statement.'' It defined their common interests while pointing out that they disagreed on India's possession of nuclear weapons. **********In an address to the Indian Parliament today, President Clinton appealed to the government to give up its nuclear arsenal, saying that most of the world was moving toward the elimination of nuclear weapons. **********Speaking forthrightly but with what he called ''respect for the great nation of India,'' Mr. Clinton said, ''Only India can determine whether it is safer today than before the tests.'' India tested nuclear weapons in May 1998, followed by similar tests conducted in response by Pakistan. **********''Only India can know whether it can afford'' such weapons, he told the Parliament. ''These are questions that others may ask but only you can answer.'' **********Then in a sterner tone, Mr. Clinton added: ''In a nuclear standoff, nothing is so dangerous as thinking there is no danger.'' **********During the cold war, he said, the former Soviet Union and the United States had come ''all too close to nuclear war'' despite a good understanding of each other's intentions. **********Mr. Clinton then urged India to take the lead in starting a dialogue with Pakistan over the disputed territory of Kashmir. **********''I believe India has a special obligation to show its neighbors that democracy is about dialogue,'' he added. ''Engagement with your adversaries is not the same as endorsement.'' **********Mr. Clinton's address was received with some scattered applause but the impassioned plea about nuclear weapons was received with attentive silence. **********After talks with Mr. Vajpayee on Tuesday, President Clinton said relations between the United States and India were ''too important to ever fall into disrepair again.'' Thus, the two countries said, the joint statement was a device to lay the foundation of a relationship without letting precise issues slow the process. **********But by Tuesday evening, the tensions inherent in forging an Indian-American friendship surfaced when India's president, Kircheril Raman Narayanan, rebuked Mr. Clinton in a toast at a state dinner. **********Standing before Mr. Clinton at a long banquet table, Mr. Narayanan scolded him for his description of the Indian subcontinent ''as the most dangerous place in the world today.'' **********The president has publicly used that term twice in the last two months to describe a situation where India and neighboring Pakistan have nuclear weapons and are also at the edge of a conflict in Kashmir. **********But Mr. Narayanan, in a rare display of blunt talk at a black-tie diplomatic affair, said that the description was ''alarmist.'' **********''It has been suggested that the Indian subcontinent is the most dangerous place in the world today and Kashmir is a nuclear flash point,'' he  said. ''These alarmist descriptions will only encourage those who want to break the peace and indulge in terrorism and violence.'' **********Mr. Clinton did not reply to the chiding, sticking in his toast to his theme of friendship. **********The president's day began here on Tuesday with a formal review of Indian armed forces assembled in the courtyard of the colonial-era presidential palace, Rashtrapati Bhavan, and then moved on to a wreath-laying ceremony at the memorial to Mohandas Gandhi. **********Mr. Clinton then drove through roads swept clear of people to Hyderbad House, a former princely residence, for his meeting with Mr. Vajpayee, whose policies on nuclear weapons, more assertive than those of Pakistan, have won growing respect among educated Indians. Mr. Vajpayee, the 72-year-old white-haired leader of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, and Mr. Clinton had not met before. **********Because the Indian leader is not considered an easy conversationalist, there was some uncertainty among administration officials about how the talks would proceed. Afterward, an administration official said that the ''tone was good but it would be misleading to say that there was a brisk and free flow of ideas.'' **********The measured atmospherics in the encounter with the prime minister combined with the sharp comments by the Indian president seemed to underline the difficulty of Mr. Clinton's undertaking to improve relations with India without having the United States appear to be a lecturing superpower. **********From the time India first tested nuclear weapons, Washington has tried to convince the government here that maintaining a nuclear deterrent is not helpful to peace in the region. But India, striving to be more than just a regional power, sees its nuclear weapons as the right of an emerging major power that is a neighbor not only to Pakistan but also to China. **********At the ceremonial signing of the ''vision statement,'' Mr. Vaypayee warned that India had limited tolerance for the violence in Kashmir, which it accuses Pakistan of masterminding. ''We have the means and the will to eliminate this menace,'' the prime minister said. **********The Tuesday statement itself included a summary of the differences on nuclear weapons, saying: ''The United States believes India should forgo nuclear weapons. India believes that it needs to maintain a credible minimum nuclear deterrent in keeping with its own assessment of its security needs.'' **********''Nonetheless,'' it said, ''India and the U.S. are prepared to work together to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery. To this end, we will persist with and build upon the productive bilateral dialogue already under way.'' **********In elaborating on the statement, the Indian prime minister said he had repeated in the private meeting with Mr. Clinton India's commitment not to conduct further nuclear explosive tests and not to be the first to use nuclear weapons. **********In replying, Mr. Clinton recognized that India was not close to signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, a position that Washington has been urging on the government without success since the 1998 test. The president said he hoped that the ''democratic process'' in India would lead to the eventual signing and ratification of the treaty by India, just like, he added, ''I hope the democratic process will ultimately produce a ratification of the test ban treaty in America.'' **********The joint statement touched on two other nuclear issues with which the administration has had only limited success with the government here. In a round of talks with the Indian foreign minister, Jaswant Singh, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott has failed to persuade the Indians to join international talks aimed at ending the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons. **********The statement said only that the two countries would ''work together'' for an early start of the talks. On the question of export controls for nuclear-related materials, the statement said that both the United States and India would ''continue to strengthen'' such controls. **********The killings in Kashmir on Monday night, which American officials said appeared intended by Pakistani-backed insurgents to draw Washington into a mediation of the dispute between India and Pakistan, presented Mr. Clinton with an opportunity to emphasize his prepared message of restraint. **********The president made clear before coming here that he was not planning to mediate the Kashmir dispute -- a role that the Indians reject but the Pakistanis want. **********But Indian officials interpreted a statement by Mr. Clinton as an embrace of their position that Pakistan must stop infiltrating Kashmir with militant fighters before talks can start. Mr. Clinton sounded as though he was saying just this when, in his joint appearance with Mr. Vajpayee, he said that talks between India and Pakistan could not be expected ''unless there is an absence of violence.'' **********White House officials quickly tried to clarify Mr. Clinton's intent, saying that because the United States was not a party to any talks between India and Pakistan it could not set any preconditions. **********But a senior administration official said the Indians should take heart from ''the message of support''  that Mr. Clinton delivered against the violence in Kashmir. **********The president summarized his position on Kashmir in four points. Both sides, he said, should exercise restraint, show respect for the Line of Control, which is the de facto border dividing Pakistani-held and Indian-held Kashmir, renew their dialogue and ''stand against violence.'' **********In a limited economic gesture to mark Mr. Clinton's visit, the White House said a $25 million program to help reorganize India's financial markets, suspended with other nonhumanitarian aid after the 1998 nuclear tests, would be resumed."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/10/technology/fiveyear-extension-of-internet-tax-moratorium-clears-house.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-05-10", "snippet": "Five-Year Extension of Internet Tax Moratorium Clears House", "word_count": 725, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Five-Year Extension of Internet Tax Moratorium Clears House", "print_headline": "Five-Year Extension of Internet Tax Moratorium Clears House", "body_text": " **********Five-Year Extension of Internet Tax Moratorium Clears House **********May 10, 2000 **********Five-Year Extension of Internet Tax Moratorium Clears House By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS ASHINGTON -- Pointing, clicking and surfing the Internet could not be singled out for taxes through October 2006 under a bill rushed through the House on Wednesday, part of a broader Republican agenda aimed at gaining favor with the high-tech industry and millions of computer users. **********Related Article **********House to Vote on Net Tax Ban **********(May 9, 2000) **********Critics including most of the nation's governors and traditional brick-and-mortar retailers said extending the moratorium on Internet-specific taxes, such as taxes on access, ignores the more troublesome issue of how state sales taxes should apply to e-commerce. **********But the House voted 352-75 to pass the bill, part of a Republican \"E-Contract 2000\" agenda intended to underscore their support for the high-tech sector, a prime campaign contribution battleground for both parties this election year. Other priority issues include repealing the 102-year-old 3 percent telephone excise tax, increasing visas for highly skilled foreign workers and granting digital signatures the force of law. **********\"The high-tech industry is the future,\" said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. \"The last thing we want to do is impede our future with high taxes and excessive government regulation.\" **********The moratorium bill, sent to the House floor without a single hearing, would extend for five years a current ban on Internet-specific taxes that expires in October 2001. The bill also would repeal a grandfather clause enacted in 1998 that allowed the states of Connecticut, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin and 16 cities to keep taxes they had in place at the time. **********Without the moratorium extension and repeal of the grandfather clause, thousands of state, county and local taxing bureaucrats could slow down Internet growth and \"drown the whole thing in a sea of red tape,\" said Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif. **********\"Don't pile new taxes on the Internet,\" he said. **********Opposing the five-year extension are state and local government officials, including 39 governors worried about future revenue losses for services ranging from roads to schools. Also against the bill are many traditional retailers, including big chains like Wal-Mart and Sears, that fear Internet competitors will gain an unfair advantage due solely to tax laws. **********The moratorium does not directly address sales taxes. However, under a Supreme Court ruling, states cannot collect them from remote sellers -- such as an Internet or catalog business -- unless the company has a physical presence such as a warehouse or store in that state. The moratorium extension, opponents say, would effectively put those central issues on the back burner for far too long. **********Rep. William Delahunt, D-Mass., pointed to a recent University of Tennessee study estimating states could lose $20 billion in sales tax revenue by 2003 if things remain as they are. **********\"These issues will not go away,\" said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. \"State and local governments will need clear rules on what they can and cannot tax.\" **********The White House issued a statement opposing the five-year extension, saying it would \"in effect enact a hold on any further consideration of Internet tax issues, creating uncertainty in a vital and rapidly growing industry.\" **********But Rep. Robert Goodlatte, R-Va., said the moratorium \"has absolutely nothing to do with the sales tax. We will have the opportunity to have that debate.\" **********The House voted 219-208 to defeat an amendment supported by the White House that would have extended the tax moratorium for only two years and kept the grandfather clause for some state and local taxes. Another amendment that would have made the tax moratorium a permanent ban also was defeated by a 336-90 vote. **********The five-year tax moratorium measure now heads to the Senate, where it faces an uncertain future.

She was 84. **********Mrs. Bandaranaike's final act was to vote in a parliamentary election she hoped would return the family's party to power leading a governing coalition known as the People's Alliance. Her death from a heart attack on Election Day seemed poetically timed for a woman whose family business is politics and whose political career spanned four decades. **********Mrs. Bandaranaike rose to power in 1960 as a bereaved wife and mother of three, just a year after her husband, Solomon, then prime minister, was assassinated by a Buddhist monk. She quickly established herself as the undisputed leader of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party -- founded by her husband -- and a formidable politician in her own right. **********She also became the matriarch of a political dynasty. In the final years of her life, her daughter, Chandrika Kumaratunga, succeeded her as the standard bearer of the family party and has served as president of the country since 1994. The father, mother and daughter have led Sri Lanka for 21 of the 52 years since it gained its independence from the British. **********''Mrs. Bandaranaike's legacy is this: After her husband died, there was so much confusion and the party was almost collapsing,'' said K. M. de Silva, a Sri Lankan historian. ''She was an untried leader. But she not only survived, she sustained the party and the family in politics.'' **********Her body was taken to her stately  home on Rosemead Place in the Cinnamon Gardens section of Colombo, the capital. State radio canceled regular programs to play elegiac music and state television looked back on her life. **********She will be buried alongside her husband on Saturday in a state funeral at the family's ancestral home in Horagulla. Friday and Saturday have been declared days of national mourning. All liquor shops, bars, cinemas and slaughterhouses have been ordered to close. **********''She was a heroic mother of the nation,'' the Sri Lanka Freedom Party said in a statement. **********But the Sri Lanka Freedom Party has come to stand for very different policies and values than it had in her day. **********Mrs. Kumaratunga firmly repudiated her mother's brand of Sinhalese nationalism, which had inflamed ethnic tensions between the mostly Buddhist Sinhalese majority and the predominantly Hindu Tamil minority. The daughter's years in office have been dominated by her as-yet-fruitless efforts to end a 17-year-old war with separatist Tamil rebels. Mrs. Kumaratunga also steered the party toward a more open, market-oriented economy and away from the centralized, state-dominated socialism that had been her mother's trademark. **********Mrs. Bandaranaike was born Sirimavo Ratwatte on April 17, 1916, into one of the island nation's wealthy feudal families, one that was at the pinnacle of Sri Lanka's social hierarchy. In 1940 -- 60 years ago today -- she married S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike, the scion of an elite, feudal clan that had thrived for generations with the patronage of the British Empire. **********Mr. Bandaranaike made the transition from his Anglicized, upper-class background to become a populist and a nationalist. And his wife carried forward his passions with even greater decisiveness and vigor,  historians say. She was a shrewd political leader with a wide base in the Sinhalese majority. **********In a recent interview, Anura, the Bandaranaike's youngest child and only son, said their father had been the affectionate, demonstrative parent while their mother was aloof. **********Mrs. Bandaranaike -- known simply as Mrs. B -- served twice as  head of state, from 1960 to 1965 and again from 1970 to 1977. She nationalized many foreign and local enterprises and left Sri Lanka's economy into one that was heavily state dominated. **********She also zealously pursued efforts to make Sinhalese the sole national language, a stance that deeply alienated the country's Tamil speakers. And she changed the university admissions policy to benefit the Sinhalese, disadvantaging the Tamils. **********During five years of her daughter's presidency, Mrs. Bandaranaike served as prime minister, which had become a largely ceremonial role under the Constitution adopted in 1978. Increasingly feeble and unable to speak clearly, she resigned as prime minister in August, though she retained her seat in Parliament. **********She lived on Rosemead Place with her elder daughter, Sunethra, a philanthropist who is 57 and never got involved in politics. **********But the political family she had nurtured splintered in her later years. Her son, Anura, 51, who lives  next to his mother's home in the family compound, went over to the family's despised rival, the United National Party, after his sister, now 55, won the right to succeed their mother. But both the son, as a leader of the opposition, and the daughter, as president, have carried on the family's political tradition."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/02/business/business-renault-pins-its-survival-on-a-global-gamble.html": {"writer_name": "John Tagliabue", "pub_date": "2000-07-02", "snippet": "Renault chairman and chief executive Louis Schweitzer has focused company on car operations, shed other business and bet company's future on several global initiatives; if his moves do not pay off, company risks falling prey to takeover or being f...", "word_count": 2780, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Business; Renault Pins Its Survival on a Global Gamble", "print_headline": "Business; Renault Pins Its Survival on a Global Gamble", "body_text": " **********LOUIS SCHWEITZER does not look like a gambler. **********Tall and lanky, a kind of Gallic Abe Lincoln, Mr. Schweitzer, 57, is a grandnephew of Albert Schweitzer and a distant cousin of Jean-Paul Sartre. Like many of the business elite of France, he is a product of L'Ecole Nationale d'Administration; he was chief of staff in the 1980's for Prime Minister Laurent Fabius, now the finance minister, and still enjoys good political connections. Mr. Schweitzer is, in short, the very model of French establishment probity. **********Yet he now finds himself chairman and chief executive of the auto giant Renault, which likes to boast that it was built on a bet. In company lore, its founder, Louis Renault, started by winning a wager in 1898 that a Renault with an innovative crankshaft could beat a car with a bicycle-like chain drive, common at the time, up a winding road in Montmartre. Renault won. **********So Mr. Schweitzer has become a gambler of sorts, too. Last year, he flew to Japan to sign a $5.4 billion deal to acquire a controlling stake in Nissan Motor after DaimlerChrysler had rejected the carmaker as unsalvageable. Mr. Schweitzer is wagering that a restored Nissan will become a solid partner in a globe-circling alliance. **********Nor is Nissan his only high-stakes wager. In 1996, he ventured into Latin America, building a $1 billion factory in Brazil, the first that Renault had built anywhere in 20 years, to make its successful Megane sedan. Last year, he paid $50 million for 51 percent of the Romanian carmaker Dacia, to gain a steppingstone into Eastern Europe. He also struck a deal to manufacture Renaults in an idle factory near Moscow. And this year, he bought a controlling stake in Samsung, the bankrupt South Korean carmaker. **********In the process, he has focused Renault on cars. First, he unloaded the company's foundry, bus-making divisions and Renault Automation, which makes auto factory equipment, to Fiat. In April, he sold the  industrial vehicles division to Volvo, while taking a 20 percent stake in that company. **********What is sobering, however, is that Renault has often lost on its biggest bets. In 1987, not long after Mr. Schweitzer joined the company, a strategy to enter North America by acquiring American Motors went sour. Six years later, after Mr. Schweitzer had become chairman, a marriage he had arranged with Volvo collapsed. **********Never before, moreover, has the company had more at stake. If Mr. Schweitzer's bets do not pay off, Renault risks falling prey to a takeover, or being forced into a humiliating surrender of independence. Renault was nationalized after World War II, and  while part of it was sold to private investors in the 1990's, the government retains 44 percent. Would the government stay neutral if the independence of such a national institution were threatened? **********Renault once believed that the future belonged to the swift, not to the big. Today, Mr. Schweitzer says the world auto industry will one day be dominated by a half-dozen giants, like General Motors, Ford Motor, Toyota Motor, Volkswagen and DaimlerChrysler. He wants Renault to be one of them. **********''If Renault survives, it will be one of the great world carmakers,'' said Elie Cohen, a leading French economist. ''If it fails, it will disappear.'' Mr. Cohen, echoing other experts, said Renault was, in a sense, ''condemned to take important risks, if it wanted to have a chance at survival.'' **********The challenges are enormous. In Romania, economic progress has been dismal; at Samsung, Renault's reorganization has yet to begin. But the biggest test, most experts agree, will be in Japan. If Nissan, a stumbling, debt-ridden company, fails to revive in Japan and in the United States, the burden on Renault could prove unsustainable. **********''The future of Renault is being played out in Tokyo,'' Mr. Cohen said. **********FEW people would have predicted all this when Mr. Schweitzer took over in 1992. Then, Renault was struggling with bad quality, a narrow product line and an overreliance on the French market. A few years before, without huge infusions of taxpayer money, Renault would have gone under or been taken over -- if anyone had wanted to buy it. **********Today, the company is among Europe's leaders in building cars cheaply and has largely overcome its quality problems. Models like the Scenic minivan are among Europe's most reliable. ''They are looked upon much more seriously today by the German manufacturers,'' said Stephen Reitman, who follows Renault at Merrill Lynch in London. **********The changes have meant profits. Renault's operating profit, before absorbing Nissan's losses, is strong, reaching 1.48 billion euros, about $1.4 billion, in 1999. It faced a loss of 330 million euros from Nissan last year, and that will hit 376 million euros just in the first half this year. Renault's stock price has gyrated accordingly. After soaring in January to a 52-week high of 54.95 euros, it fell to 38.60 in February and recovered to 51.80 in late May. But it has since slipped to 47.6 euros. Most analysts, not surprisingly, have adopted a wait-and-see attitude about the company's prospects. **********Still, the transformation of Renault reflects deep changes in France. As the government privatizes industries, executives like Mr. Schweitzer, steeped in traditional business practices, have learned to compete in a brasher, riskier climate. **********Mr. Schweitzer's analysis of Renault's situation was simple: The breakdown of his proposed marriage with Volvo resulted in large part from continued government control of Renault, which Volvo shareholders felt was a threat to independence in making business decisions. **********Moreover, with Renault factories running at low capacity, cars were pricey; the slightest market downturn led to losses, as happened in 1996, three years after the Volvo breakup, when Renault had a net loss of just over $1 billion. **********Mr. Schweitzer began by pushing the government to slash its stake. Helped by the election in 1993 of a conservative prime minister, Edouard Balladur, Mr. Schweitzer induced the government to cut its holdings to 52 percent, then to relinquish control by dropping to 44 percent. **********That was only the beginning. In 1996, to bring down costs, Mr. Schweitzer hired the man who, if all bets pay off, will probably be his successor: Carlos Ghosn. **********Mr. Ghosn, now 46, had been the boy wonder at Michelin, the tire maker. When he was still in his 20's, he built Michelin's business in Latin America amid volatile national economies and, in Brazil, a soaring inflation rate. In 1990, he steered the merger of Michelin in North America with Uniroyal Goodrich. Though his methods earned him the title of ''le cost-cutter,'' colleagues recall human touches. When a Goodrich factory in Ardmore, Okla., was switched to multiple shifts, Mr. Ghosn (rhymes with loan) contacted local ministers, patiently explaining why some Sunday school teachers might not be available every week. **********Asked recently why he joined Renault, Mr. Ghosn showed his hunger to be tested. ''Renault, in Europe, is a prestigious name, with a very good history,'' he said. ''But I have always had an intuition that you don't join a company when things are good. You join when there are challenges, to earn your position.'' **********MR. GHOSN'S recipes are classic. In purchasing, he cut the number of suppliers, to reduce administrative costs. In engineering, he created teams to develop products. In manufacturing, he reduced the number of models per plant and negotiated more flexible shifts. His plan was to save 20 billion francs -- $2.8 billion today -- in three years. ''We delivered it,'' he said. **********Nigel Griffiths, an analyst at Standard & Poor's DRI in London, said one of Renault's greatest strengths was its use of manufacturing capacity, which he put at over 90 percent, close to American levels. ''Far better than the average in Europe,'' Mr. Griffiths said. **********Mr. Ghosn's arrival signaled to workers and shareholders that ''this company has changed,'' said Philippe Martinez, head of the leftist labor union at Renault, Confederation Generale de Travail. ''It was good for the owners, but the message was political. It was a culture shock.'' **********It was Mr. Ghosn who provoked the first test of Renault's independence. In 1997, he decided to close a factory at Vilvorde, Belgium, cutting 3,000 jobs. Renault workers in France and Belgium took to the streets, and the recently elected Socialist prime minister of France, Lionel Jospin, begged Mr. Schweitzer to reverse the decision. Mr. Schweitzer  said no. **********For many people, Vilvorde reflects just how much Renault has changed. Once a union stronghold, the company by 1997 had stopped being a social laboratory where politicians tested labor reforms before introducing them nationwide. Mr. Schweitzer's predecessor, Raymond Levy, signaled the change in 1992, closing Renault's oldest plant, at Billancourt, on an island in the Seine near Paris. The plant had long been a symbol of French labor militancy: in 1968, when students protested in Paris,  Mr. Schweitzer's cousin Jean-Paul Sartre stood at Billancourt's gates to call auto workers to join them. But at Vilvorde, the unions ultimately accepted the inevitable. It was Renault's last major labor unrest. **********THE changes at Renault say much about Mr. Schweitzer's own evolution. His experience has enabled him to manage both politics and business. Mr. Cohen, the economist, says a peculiar blend of French culture and Protestant ethic enabled him to make painful decisions. ''He lost friends on the left,'' Mr. Cohen said, adding that ''he is a man totally identified with Renault.'' **********A French executive who has known Mr. Schweitzer since college days calls him a ''quintessentially French mind: conceptual, yet not lost in fantasies; able to decide.'' **********Indeed, Mr. Schweitzer and the Brazilian-born Mr. Ghosn worked hand in glove, despite enormous personal differences. Mr. Schweitzer is an expert in numbers; Mr. Ghosn received his degree from L'Ecole des Mines, a top engineering school, though he later earned a doctorate in economics at the University of Paris. While Mr. Schweitzer had been chief aide to a Socialist prime minister, Mr. Ghosn had always been in business. And the cerebral strain in Mr. Schweitzer contrasts with Mr. Ghosn's Latin exuberance. **********Yet the success of the two men would probably have been impossible without the artistic flair of a third. **********In 1987, when Mr. Schweitzer was chief financial officer, Renault hired a new chief designer, Patrick Le Quement, whose talent shaped the education of Louis Schweitzer -- and the transformation of Renault. **********Born in France and educated in Britain, Mr. Le Quement earned a reputation as one of Europe's most daring designers while working in the 1980's for Ford and Volkswagen. He joined Renault, he said, because of its tradition of risk taking. ''When you're a kid, you have your favorite Dinky toys,'' he said in an interview, referring to the toy cars known by generations of young English boys. ''Mine were Renault.'' **********His first task was to complete the design of a diminutive model, later dubbed the Twingo. Mr. Le Quement took an earlier design, widened it and gave it headlights like frogs' eyes and a snoot that made it look, he said,  ''like a pet: in winter you don't want to leave it outside; you place it next to the fireplace.'' **********The design polarized management. Some, like Mr. Schweitzer, hated it, though he now says his objection was to the way the project was financed. In a desperate appeal to the chairman at the time, Raymond Levy, Mr. Le Quement said he wrote that ''the biggest risk with the car was to take no risk.'' Mr. Levy agreed. **********By 1994, Renault was selling little Twingos about as fast as it could make them, nearly 20,000 a month. Under Mr. Le Quement, other remarkable models followed, including the Scenic, a micro-minivan that has also been a big seller. **********By the mid-1990's, when Renault decided to revive its luxury car line, Mr. Schweitzer was easily won over to a daring design based on a concept car called the Avantime, a futuristic sedan with an oddly truncated rear end and wraparound rear window. **********Not only are Renault's designs changing, but so is the way they are put together. Mr. Le Quement's office, adorned with bright canvases, has for two years been in Renault's new $785 million Technocentre, which opened in 1998 on former farmland west of Paris. In its central wing, La Ruche (the hive), and adjacent wing, Le Diapason (the tuning fork), experts from design and research, vehicle engineering, purchasing and product cost analysis -- once scattered over 50 sites -- work jointly to bring down costs and development time. Renault's successful subcompact, the Clio, took 40 months to develop before it was introduced in 1991; recent models have taken 36 months, and the target is 20. **********As for shopping for a partner in Asia, Mr. Schweitzer says the idea was born during the Asian economic crisis. ''We saw an opportunity,'' he said. Nissan ''was fundamentally a sound company, with good products.'' **********The process was accelerated in 1998 when Daimler-Benz announced its takeover of Chrysler. ''This was an electric shock in the industry,'' Mr. Ghosn said. ''It was obvious for us that we had to connect fast.'' **********The next year, Renault took its stake in Nissan, and Mr. Ghosn was dispatched to revive it. Now chief operating officer at Nissan, he will become president this summer, the first foreigner to assume such a prestigious role at a major Japanese corporation. **********At Nissan, Mr. Ghosn has set clear goals, and his record for meeting objectives is enviable. By the end of 2002, he said, 22 new models are planned, including four in Japan later this year. By the end of 2003, he wants to cut Nissan's debt by half, from $16.8 billion at the end of March. And he expects the company  to be profitable in the current fiscal year, which ends next March, after losses in seven of the last eight years. **********Change is also apparent elsewhere in the global operations. Today, Mr. Schweitzer says Renault is focusing on distribution. It is the European leader in shrinking order-to-delivery times, building about half its cars to order and delivering them in six to eight weeks. The goal, at least in Europe, is to make three-quarters of its cars to order and to deliver them in 14 days, matching what the Japanese often do in their home market. In April, to cut purchasing costs, it joined Covisint, the online marketplace set up by G.M., Ford and DaimlerChrysler to consolidate the search for parts and services. **********Mr. Schweitzer said he wanted to emphasize different Renault brands in different markets, making Renault strongest in Europe and Latin America; Nissan (and its Infiniti luxury division) in North America; Nissan and Samsung in Asia; and Dacia in Eastern Europe and emerging markets. It is not a novel recipe. Volkswagen supplemented its VW and Audi brands by snapping up Skoda in the Czech Republic and Seat in Spain. Yet unlike Volkswagen's cars, Renault's brands do not compete with one another. ''Why buy a Volkswagen at German prices,'' Mr. Cohen said, ''when you can get a Skoda, the same car, at Czech prices?'' **********Mr. Schweitzer says Renault's plans are on track, though much work remains. In Europe, Renault and Nissan have begun melding their sales organizations, but the bulk of reorganization is still ahead at Dacia and Samsung. In Latin America, Nissan models will be produced at Renault plants, and Mr. Ghosn says that by 2010 he wants 10 common platforms, or underbodies, so that the companies can build Renaults and Nissans everywhere, while maintaining the look, feel and identity of their separate brands. Nissan alone currently has some two dozen platforms, none of them shared with Renault or other brands. **********THE investment in Nissan has already paid off handsomely. Mr. Reitman of Merrill Lynch calculates that Renault's stake is now worth roughly 8.25 billion euros, or $7.8 billion, 65 percent more than Renault paid for it. **********One bottleneck could be finding managers to run all the operations. Mr. Reitman says one reason for selling the industrial-vehicles division to Volvo was to free up Renault management. To replace Mr. Ghosn when he left for Nissan, Mr. Schweitzer lured a senior Volkswagen executive, Pierre-Alain De Smedt, a Belgian who was chief executive of VW's Seat division. **********But that was an exception. Local talent is crucial to Mr. Schweitzer's concept, for despite all of Renault's globalization -- the common language of executive meetings and reports is now English, which Mr. Schweitzer speaks fluently -- he misses no occasion to stress his appreciation of national qualities. **********''I think car companies need roots,'' he said, since ''there are links between products, company culture and the nationality of the group.'' **********The heart of his vision is the link with Nissan. ''We are talking about a binational group,'' he said, adding that such a structure could be ''clearly only fully productive if the two companies are working well.'' **********''An alliance,'' he said, ''is not a substitute for bringing your house in order.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/10/business/qwest-fails-to-convince-u-s-west-to-back-deutsche-telekom-deal.html": {"writer_name": "Seth Schiesel", "pub_date": "2000-03-10", "snippet": "Last-ditch effort by Qwest Communications International to rekindle its negotiations to be acquired by Deutsche Telekom of Germany ends as Qwest fails to convince US West, its previous merger partner, to go along with Deutsche Telekom deal (M)", "word_count": 534, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Qwest Fails to Convince U S West to Back Deutsche Telekom Deal", "print_headline": "Qwest Fails to Convince U S West to Back Deutsche Telekom Deal", "body_text": " **********A last-ditch effort by Qwest Communications International to rekindle its negotiations to be acquired by Deutsche Telekom of Germany ended yesterday as Qwest failed to convince U S West, its previous merger partner, to go along with a Deutsche Telekom deal. **********Qwest, which has never publicly acknowledged that it was in talks with the German company, said in a statement last night that a ''major telecommunications company has withdrawn from discussions to acquire Qwest and U S West.'' **********The talks between Deutsche Telekom, Europe's largest telephone company, and Qwest effectively ended on Tuesday when the German company realized that any deal with Qwest would be plagued by complications. Most important, there was no realistic way to extricate Qwest from its previous agreement to acquire U S West, the smallest of the Bell local phone companies. **********U S West, a relatively stodgy old-line phone company, was far less attractive to Deutsche Telekom than was Qwest, a young upstart that has built an advanced national fiber-optic network and that is selling Internet services to exploit that system. Deutsche Telekom would have had to pay at least $100 billion to acquire the two companies. **********Last week, Joseph P. Nacchio, Qwest's chairman, indicated that he was exploring ways to negate his deal to acquire U S West. But had Qwest tried to back out of its deal with U S West to pursue a solo acquisition by Deutsche Telekom, U S West might have exposed Deutsche Telekom to billions of dollars of liability for interfering with the original pact between U S West and Qwest. **********On Wednesday, Mr. Nacchio embarked on a last-minute effort to bring Deutsche Telekom back to the bargaining table, said executives close to the talks. After perhaps two weeks of talking with the German company on his own, it appeared critical that Mr. Nacchio now bring U S West into direct contact with Deutsche Telekom. **********Yesterday, people close to Qwest said that U S West executives refused to meet with their German counterparts, though other people close to the talks contradicted that account. Either way, Mr. Nacchio's effort failed. **********In Qwest's statement late yesterday, Mr. Nacchio said, ''We regret that U S West apparently wouldn't even consider an alternative transaction involving a major telecommunications company and Qwest despite the possibility of greater value for U S West shareholders.'' **********Based on Qwest's closing share price yesterday of $57.1875, U S West's shareholders were set to receive about $51 billion in Qwest stock for their company. **********Executives close to the talks said that U S West realized that Deutsche Telekom was not prepared to match that figure. Deutsche Telekom was, however, prepared to pay more than the $39 billion that U S West was to receive before Qwest's stock spiked on reports of the Deutsche Telekom discussions. **********In a statement issued several hours before Qwest's announcement, U S West said that any deal to be acquired by a company other than Qwest ''must also be better than or consistent with our existing transaction with Qwest.'' **********Executives close to the talks said that one of U S West's priorities was simply to close its deal with Qwest. Once that happens later this year, perhaps the combined U S West-Qwest will re-enter talks to be acquired by Deutsche Telekom."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/14/technology/letters-to-the-editor.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-09-14", "snippet": "Bypassing College", "word_count": 1020, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Letters to the Editor", "print_headline": "Letters to the Editor", "body_text": " **********Bypassing College **********To the Editor: **********Re \"Choosing a Salary or Tuition\" (Sept. 7), about high school graduates who are going straight into technology jobs: It occurred to me that our nation and the media perpetuate two popular myths: the gifted young athlete and the genius teenage programmer. **********We have paraded before us the tall, handsome basketball player or the geeky child-at-computer, both primed for stardom and millions of dollars.

Now they bring the chance to combat ugliness and create a transitional industry and new jobs. **********What our politicians should be talking about is not missing the boat twice. AARON KESSLER New York **********\u2022 **********To the Editor: **********I am dismayed but not surprised that my hometown, Middletown, R.I., yielded a painfully exquisite visual example of suburban blight. **********In fairness to Middletown, I feel compelled to point out that for all the remedial work that is clearly necessary, there remain many stunning landscapes in our town, in which our heritage as a farming community is evident. Your point, however, is irrefutable, and the article is timely. **********We are fortunate to have a strong land preservation movement here on the island, which Middletown shares with Newport and Portsmouth, our neighbor to the north. The Aquidneck Island Land Trust has, for 11 years, worked to preserve open spaces, to protect our farmers' livelihood against the inevitable suburban invasion from the Boston and New York metropolitan areas, and to promote smart growth practices. **********I hope that we (and others who follow the coverage on open-space issues) can learn from our mistakes and leave this world a more inviting place for generations to come.

It was a twist of fate that now has the British executive moonlighting as a co-founder of one of the first time-share owner-advocacy groups in Europe. **********Time-sharing is aptly named. Investors buy time, usually in increments of a week, in a vacation property. Every year, they have the right to use the property for their assigned weeks; or they can swap for different periods at the same resort or other sites, or rent out their holdings. Some time shares last for a set number of years, others are perpetual. Costs typically run from $5,000 to $50,000 a week **********A concept begun in Europe in the late 1960s and subsequently made mainstream in the United States, vacation time shares have become a big business, generating $7 billion annually in sales. Today there are more than 4,000 resorts in 80-plus countries. The American Resort Development Association estimates there are 6 million time-share owners around the world, the bulk of whom reside in the United States and Europe. **********Popular they may be, but time shares also are controversial. Historically sold by tactics that included promotional offers of questionable value, many buyers found they could not sell their units for anything near what they paid for them, let alone at a profit. Even today, proponents suggest that time shares are not meant as investment tools but rather as a cost-efficient way of vacationing. **********Someone who has seen both the best and worst of what vacation time shares have to offer, Mr. Grey helped found the Timeshare Consumers Association of the United Kingdom in part to counter the unsavory sales practices. The three-year-old group is pushing for British legislation that will help do away with the scam artists and arm-twisting practices that have given time-share ownership a bad reputation. It also works closely with a recently established German group, the Schutzvereingung fuer Time-Sharing, based in Wiesbaden. **********Bill Rogers, a time-share owner in the United States, tells a similar tale. Thanks to a time-share exchange vacation that went grossly awry, Mr. Rogers founded the Timeshare Users Group. The Internet-driven nonprofit organization is run by 40 volunteers supporting an active membership of 5,000 time-share owners worldwide. **********On the group's comprehensive Web site, which grew out of a Prodigy chat room, members post their time shares, looking for possible exchanges. They can share experiences about resort properties good and bad, with ratings of each site. There is an archive of articles and perspectives pertaining to nearly every facet of time-share ownership, including legal and tax issues. Every Sunday, the site is host to a time-share users chat. **********Both Mr. Grey and Mr. Rogers said that while they had been frustrated by the poor reputation of the industry, they have also had positive experiences that convinced them that time-sharing is a good thing. They are seeking to get consumers to band together and help push scammers out of the market. **********According Joyce Kessler, a longtime time-share owner, the investment was a life-changing experience for her and her husband, Don. **********\"It has forced us to do what we absolutely love to do,\" she said. \"We have traveled all over the world and have felt very lucky that we can afford to travel in luxury, and, in reality, the cost is minimal.\" **********The Kesslers own a handful of time shares that carry top ratings from the two organizations that dominate the swapping and renting of units, Resorts & Condominiums International LLC and Interval International Inc. As a result, they have been able to trade for time shares that Mrs. Kessler said would have been out of their reach had they had to pay on a per night basis. They have visited resorts in Spain, the Netherlands, Scotland, Mexico and Canada as well as many in the United States. **********Before reaching for your checkbook, take note: Time shares, generally speaking, are not a terrific investment in terms of capital gains. Like automobiles, they almost always depreciate from the original sale price. This is particularly the case with primary sales, meaning new properties bought directly from developers, who build marketing costs into the prices the first buyers pay. The new owners rarely are able to recoup that premium in a secondary sale. **********Time-share properties sold for limited periods, under what are called right-to-use terms, will go down in value every year; it is the nature of the beast. With a right-to-use time share, occupancy rights are specified across a number of years, usually 20 to 25. This option is particularly popular in places like Spain and Mexico that have legal restrictions regarding vacation-property ownership. **********\"A time share is not an investment,\" said Jim Perkins, resort services director for Stroman Realty Inc. in Conroe, Texas, a leading resale agency. \"A time share's value is in its use. If you were to rent hotels weeks for 10 years or 20 years, what do you have left? Memories.\" **********There are exceptions to the rule. There have been people who have sold deeded ownerships in low-inventory, high-profile time-share properties in such key destinations as the Vail ski resort in Colorado or Sanibel Island off Southwest Florida. Owners holding on to the latter are presently able to sell their intervals \u2014 as weeks at time shares are known \u2014 for twice their initial investments because no new time-share properties are being built on the island. **********But in nearby Orlando, a hotbed of time-share resorts, you do not stand a snowball's chance in Florida of getting a return on your investment, said Chip Ballew, owner and founder of Timeshares.com, an Internet information service that has a free classified section, among other things. **********\"There is such as a glut of time-share properties on the market today,\" he said. \"It is really a buyer's market.\" **********But Mr. Ballew, a former member-services manager for RCI, warned prospective buyers to be careful about how and what they buy. For as much as the market has evolved in its legitimacy, he said that incidents of scam and pressure selling remained too prevalent. **********One of the biggest developments to hit the industry in recent years \u2014 and one that has added immensely to its legitimacy \u2014 is the entry of such major American resort developers as Marriott International Inc., Walt Disney Co., and Hilton Hotels Corp. **********Other major hoteliers and developers, especially outside the United States, have shown little interest in the concept. A spokesman at Granada Group PLC's Forte Hotel Group said: \"Time share is not something that we are considering. We do not see it as part of our business plan or core to what we do. We see time share as a specialist sector and not one we wish to enter.\" **********Marriott, on the other hand, has three time-share offerings, all of which are tied into its Marriott Reward Point, a frequent-stay program that also covers business travel and other resort use. Marriott visitors can earn points while staying at a resort \u2014 typically a point for every $10 spent **********Most of Marriott's time shares are in the United States, though the company has properties in Spain. A spokeswoman said it would soon have one in Asia, although she refused to specify where. **********When it comes to purchasing a week of time share from Marriott \u2014 or anyone else, for that matter \u2014 you can expect quite a range in price. Low-end offerings start around $5,000, but Marriott's top-end time-share properties, which are sold under the Ritz-Carlton Club brand, sell for $49,000 **********Time-sharing continues to evolve. What began as mostly fixed weeks now offers prospective buyers the option of floating weeks, split or fractional shares in properties, or more recently buying points in resort clubs. At Disney, the point system allows time-share buyers to purchase the right to use any of its vacation properties until 2042 for $10,500 and up, according to its Web site. **********When you buy a time share, either as right to use or as deeded property, you will have to pay at least a couple of hundred dollars a year in maintenance and homeowners' fees. At first, these fees may seem nominal, but that might be because the developer is subsidizing them to make the time share attractive to potential buyers, the Timeshare Users Group Web site says. Eventually, a homeowners' association takes over, and the fees may then quickly rise to unsubsidized levels. **********Likewise, the site notes, special assessments are sometimes added to maintenance fees to cover unexpected expenses, such as storm damage. **********If you decide to sell a time share, expect to pay a licensed agent a commission of around 10 percent as well as general closing costs. Have a brand resort chain sell the property, and the commission might be closer to 25 percent. **********- **********TRYING TO UNDERSTAND what to buy \u2014 deeded property or right to use \u2014 is not an easy task. But Timeshare Users Group offers some pretty sound advice on this front: If you intend to return to your resort frequently and exchange occasionally, your best choice is a resort you enjoy often. If your primary intent is to maximize trade value and you do not intend to stay at your own resort very often, then you should buy at a resort, that is in high demand. **********The Timeshare Users Group advises, \"There are many variables that would apply to any particular choice and a potential buyer is strongly advised to research factors that affect time-share trade values before making a final choice.\" **********Mr. Perkins, the Stroman agent, regularly hears from people whom he says did not do their homework, bought from an unlicensed agent or paid unnecessary appraisal fees \u2014 and as a result want to offload timeshare properties. **********Mr. Perkins owns two time-share properties himself. One is at a resort in the Lake Tahoe region on the California-Nevada border. He generally does not exchange this interval but instead uses it to take his children skiing. He also owns a resale property in South Africa that he has never seen or visited. But he loves it for its high exchange value. Located near a game preserve and South Africa's Sun City resort, the property has a premium exchange value that has enabled Mr. Perkins and his family to trade for vacations at other top resorts. **********The Kesslers own six weeks' worth of time-share intervals. Mr. Kessler advised prospective buyers: \"The real trick in owning and exchanging time shares is to be flexible with your location requests and the time requirements. We always allow a week either way for our requests, and we usually request one of several resorts at a set location.\" **********Ian and Teresa Clancy of Oxfordshire in England have been Interval International members since 1989. They own two weeks at Ocean Club on Ramla Bay, Malta, but they have never stayed there. Instead, they exchange for places like Portugal, Spain, Italy and Antigua. **********How do you find out about time shares? In the past, they often found you, as cold-calling salespeople trolled through phone listings looking for customers who would accept allegedly free or discounted invitations to visit resorts. **********The Internet changed all that, making the market far more efficient and opening up the opportunity to deal in the potentially less expensive secondary market. Now prospective buyers can search through thousands of resale properties from individual owners as well as licensed real estate agents. They can also easily compare primary offerings. **********It still is not uncommon to pick up the phone and receive a cold call from a resort, including a posh Marriott, promoting a new development with a free night's stay or something to that affect. **********Marriott owns Marbella Beach Resort. Right now, it is promoting a one-week stay, including rental car, valued at $1,800, for those folks willing to check out its time share in Costa del Sol, Spain, and pay $900 of their own money to do so. To qualify you need to attend a 90-minute resort tour. **********Even when plunking out $900 to Marriott, a reputable concern, read the fine print. Time-share companies buy such promotions from independent suppliers. The resort may have every intention of seeing that those promotions are honored, but the supplier can have other ideas. **********Such was the case with a California couple, Terry and Ed, who purchased a time share at a major San Francisco resort. They have yet to use the time share, as they have tried for more than a year to cash in on the three-night-stay promotion they were promised as a result of their purchase. The promotion company continues to tell them that dates they want are not available. Numerous appeals to the time-share developer have failed to result in the couple's receiving the free stay. **********In addition, the resort recently switched over to a more flexible point-based system for its time shares that will require Ed and Terry to spend as much as $2,000 as an upgrade fee. The whole experience has made them wary of whether the time share itself was a good idea. **********Such stories are what industry veterans say give time-sharing a bad name. **********Steve Morgan is a real estate agent with Azur France Ltd., an English company that specializes in \"upmarket villas and apartments as outright, freehold purchases.\" He said he did not have a problem with the concept of time shares if they were associated with legitimate developers pushing a straightforward sales. **********\"I know the industry in Europe has been making efforts to clean up its image, but it still has some way to go,\" he said. **********What he finds problematic is the industry's use of what he deems misleading direct-mail circulars offering \"free holidays.\" He is also turned off by what he calls the \"street-corner practice\" of employing young seasonal workers on a commission-only basis who approach vacationers, giving out what he says tends to be false or misleading information to get them to consider buying time shares. **********There are signs things are changing. Marriott time-share properties generally have a sales gallery where potential buyers can walk in off the street and peruse displays or sit in on presentations without being hounded. Mr. Ballew of Timeshares.com pointed to the Crane Resort in Barbados, which has successfully drawn in buyers by promising a \"no-pressure approach to time shares.\" **********The market is evolving in ways that are likely to be appealing to consumers. There are a lot of places now for a prospective buyer to do research. Interval International has a huge catalogue of properties, which it regularly rates. The company maintains a customer satisfaction index that covers 20 countries. Those ratings are considered standard decision-making fare among time-share veterans. **********Craig Nash, chairman of Interval International, said if a resort falls below his company's accommodation and service standards, it will be removed from the resort program. There have been companies that have been dropped, he said. **********Mr. Nash, a lawyer by trade, said that when the time-share industry started out in America, \"it was not regulated, and people in industry were concerned it would kill it. It did the opposite. Having rules and structure in this country has helped grow it in this country.\" **********The Organization for Timeshare in Europe, the equivalent of the American Resort Development Association, backs proposed European Union legislation that would better protect consumers. One requirement would force developers to hold buyers' down payments in escrow accounts until sales have closed. **********But when in doubt, rent, Mr. Grey advises. If anyone gives you a hard time doing that, then walk. These days, it is a buyer's market. **********For more information: **********BUYRESORTPROPERTIES.COM.

I hope to join them one day, and though I haven't asked, I'm pretty sure they'll have me. They're not choosy. **********The people I have in mind are not country club types; nor are they the well-heeled snowbirds who have taken up roosts along the fairways of Hilton Head or Palm Springs, or even those hordes of savvy pensioners who unloaded the family homestead at the top of the market and got a good deal on a Myrtle Beach condo with a greenside view and a golf cart in the driveway. Those people are all happy, too, but I suspect they take their happiness for granted. **********The people I'm talking about beam with contentment. ''It's like dying and going to heaven,'' one of them, a retired chauffeur named Vin, explained to me once. ''I never wait for a tee time.'' (Well, of course he never waits for a tee time; he gets to play on weekdays. Even heaven is crowded on Saturday and Sunday.) **********You find my kind of retirees at municipal courses and scruffy nine-holers; at my favorite haunts in southeastern Massachusetts, for example: Wampanoag, a k a Swampanoag, where, I have sometimes heard it claimed, mosquito repellent was developed; Hidden Hollow, a time capsule from the 1950's, where drives from the first tee sometimes ricochet off a fossilized gravel mound; and Pine Valley, the other Pine Valley, where some of the most challenging hazards are the giant pylons holding up high-tension wires. **********The golfers I have in mind are the ones you see in the clubhouse -- golf caps pushed back on their seamed and tanned foreheads -- playing pinochle and rummy late into the afternoon, without a cell phone or a pager in sight. They always seem to know the starter and the rangers, because in many cases they are the starter and the rangers, willing to put in a few part-time hours in exchange for a break on greens fees. **********They also economize by never, ever paying for a golf ball. Their eyes may be going, but they can still disappear into the woods and emerge 50 yards later with pockets bulging. They will find your ball for you when you have given up, and they will throw in a couple of extras. Many of them also have extra-long aluminum ball retrievers, which they patiently dip into the drink, like herons probing for minnows; they never fail to turn up a shiny morsel or two. **********When they open their car trunks at the end of the day to stow their gear, you can see, stashed behind the spare tire, buckets and buckets of barely used Titleists, Top-Flites, Wilsons, even some of those extra-costly Nike balls -- the ones guaranteed to fly straight. Imagine what's in their basements: coffee cans, laundry baskets, trash barrels -- all brimming with dimpled white eggs. They're like underground hatcheries. **********Have I mentioned that these golfers seldom lose a ball of their own? That's because, with time on their hands, calmness in their hearts and mellowness sluicing through their brainpans, they have made the discovery that only comes with maturity: straight is better than long. Though self-taught, most of them, retired players are good. At a little nine-holer, I once went around twice with a retired electrician so old and frail-seeming that I thought he might evaporate in the heat -- just vanish, leaving a puddle of golf clothes on the fairway. He wound up shooting a 73, which could easily have been a 71 had he not missed a couple of two-footers I tried to give him. (That's another thing: retired golfers don't cheat; they don't need to.) **********Here is how you know you're not ready to become a retired golfer: you are so stupid, so filled with rage and yearning and delusion, that you still want to crush the ball. You know it's wrong, but you do it anyway.  Good sense will come, as surely as the Social Security checks will. In the meantime, I have been studying and classifying some of the basic retiree golf swings: **********1. The Propeller. Actually, I have seen this only once, used by a guy named Ralph, but it was so remarkable that it deserves special mention. Ralph wristed his club around so that it passed right in front of his head and was pointing, upside down, back at the target; then, as if powered by a rubber band, he unwound the club back the other way. Rrrrrp -- 150 yards, right down the middle. **********2. The Phone Booth. Probably the most familiar of all retired swing patterns. The backswing and the follow-through are almost equidistant, about 18 inches on each side. No matter what club is used, all shots hit this way tend to go the same distance, but so what -- they are straight as string. **********3. The Folding Ruler. Often used by women, this is a sound technique for men as well. Contrary to the preachments of Hogan, Harmon, Ledbetter et al., the left side is allowed to collapse, in pieces -- leg, arm, wrists -- until the club is neatly stashed away, out of sight and out of mind; then, click, click, click, the process is reversed and there the club head is again, squarely smacking the ball. **********4. The Sneak Attack. Good for golfers whose paunches get in the way. The club is taken back slowly, out and around the distended area, and then, before the rest of the body knows what's going on, the canny retired brain instructs the hands to lash the club down and under the radar, so to speak. The ball is already on its way, a missile that cannot be recalled -- not that you'd want to take back a stinger like that. **********None of these techniques look particularly good, it must be said; neither, for that matter, does the standard retiree's uniform of Bermuda shorts, knobby knees and hairless shanks. But retirement is about what works. Only connect, E. M. Forster wrote; he said nothing about form. **********SOME of the retirees I have played with have achieved a level of wisdom that transcends the golf course. A few years ago, for example, I played a couple of rounds at Wampanoag with a threesome that had been together so long they routinely finished one another's sentences. Talking in a kind of interrupted chorus, they gave me stock tips; they instructed me in how to get better gas mileage; they told me which local restaurants served the best Wednesday evening all-you-can-eat buffets. At the seventh tee, while we were waiting for the group ahead -- a ladies' foursome, as it happened -- to get out of range, one of them asked me how long I had been married. Thirty years, I said. **********''A rookie!'' the chorus began. **********''A novice!'' **********''A kid!'' **********They then proceeded to deliver almost two centuries' worth of collective wisdom about relations between the sexes. Some of what they said was unprintable. Much of it, now that I try to recall specifics, was variations on the old theme: can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em. But it all seemed profound at the time. These guys were living proof. Here they were, still married -- more than a hundred years of connubial experience striding up the fairway -- and still playing golf together. They would be the first to tell you that they were having the best years of their lives."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/15/business/world-business-briefing-europe-rjb-mining-may-get-offer.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "2000-06-15", "snippet": "Shares of Britain's biggest coal producer, RJB Mining PLC, surge after company says it is in talks that may lead to bid being made for the company (S)", "word_count": 47, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "RJB MINING MAY GET OFFER", "print_headline": "WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: EUROPE; RJB MINING MAY GET OFFER", "body_text": " **********The shares of Britain's biggest coal producer, RJB Mining P.L.C., surged yesterday after the company said it was in talks that might lead to a bid being made for the company.

J. Habibie, the sprightly enigma who, for a bewildering moment not long ago, found himself the most powerful person in the land. **********''You should understand my background,'' said Mr. Habibie, a tiny, animated man. ''I am not a politician; I am not even interested in politics. And suddenly I had to take over.'' **********That was in May 1998, when former President Suharto suddenly resigned and, without a single word to him, left Indonesia in the hands of his vice president, Mr. Habibie, an aircraft engineer who was one of the most spectacularly unprepared people ever to lead a nation. **********Over the next 17 months, Mr. Habibie rode the bucking bronco of power, challenged from all sides as Indonesia began to redefine itself. But he pursued a remarkably steady course toward democracy, dismantling the dictatorship that his predecessor and close friend had painstakingly put in place during 32 years in power. **********Mr. Habibie freed the press, the labor unions and the political parties, and began the slow process of pulling the military out of politics. **********Then, in what he calls one of his proudest achievements, he became the first Indonesian president ever to be voted out of office -- replaced last October by an equally eccentric leader, the voluble, half-blind Muslim cleric Abdurrahman Wahid. **********Now Mr. Habibie, 64, has less power than he has had since becoming Mr. Suharto's minister for science and technology more than 20 years ago -- time, he said, to stare at his face in the mirror and decide, yes, let's try a mustache. (''Do you like it? Do you?'') **********This week he opened the Habibie Center, a political research institute that he is mostly financing himself. But he has quickly become an irrelevance in Indonesia's political scene. **********Unlike Mr. Suharto, who has been the target of protests this week by rioters demanding that he be put on trial for wide-scale corruption, Mr. Habibie arouses few emotions. He serves mostly as a political science teaser: did he lead the nation into its emerging democracy or was he, like the rest of the men in power, simply buffeted by the prevailing typhoon of change? **********While many analysts say he had little choice but to allow the new freedoms that were being demanded on the streets, Mr. Habibie has insisted from the start that he was a heartfelt liberal who learned his democratic lessons during decades of residence in Germany. **********''I am a man who is never reactive,'' Mr. Habibie insisted. ''I'm proactive. I always work based on my beliefs and my convictions.'' **********This may be true, despite his closeness for decades to his autocratic mentor. Whether he led or followed, he was part of a nationwide passion for change that exploded to the surface the moment Mr. Suharto's grip was loosened. **********''It's going to take some time to assess Habibie,'' said Daniel S. Lev, a professor at the University of Washington at Seattle. ''But the best one can say and the worst one can say is that he did not make things as bad as they could have been.'' **********He did not block reforms, and he did not use the military to try to stay in power, Mr. Lev said. ''The point is, he didn't stand as a major obstruction, and those are all sort of backhanded compliments, but he deserves them, I think.'' **********Defense Minister Juwono Sudarsono, who was education minister under Mr. Habibie, was similarly equivocal. ''People say he was forced into those things, but you must give him credit for taking them on at an early stage,'' he said. ''I think he was basically being used by so many people who focused on their own personal gain. He was an O.K. guy, very charming, very witty, very bubbly.'' **********In the interview, Mr. Habibie described himself as a man who threw a stone into a pond and set off waves of turbulence. The process he set in motion, he said, was a shift from ''unipolar'' to ''multipolar'' power -- a difficult transition for a vastly diverse nation of many islands and more than 200 million people that had learned to submit to a single central leader. **********''I am convinced that the lows which exist today in our economy and our political life are because of this transition,'' he said. ''We should help the president today to shorten the time of this transition that is decreasing our efficiency and productivity. Because the president is O.K., I think; he is O.K.'' **********In his first week as president, Mr. Habibie said, he confounded his aides by paying a visit to Parliament in a gesture of respect to the legislative branch. ''Suddenly the situation happened where I have de-powered myself as president,'' he said. **********He then helped set the ground rules for Indonesia's first democratic election, and submitted gracefully to the result last fall, calling himself proudly, ''the first victim of democracy.'' **********But there has been one sad element in Mr. Habibie's presidency, the loss of a lifelong friendship with Mr. Suharto, a surrogate father who is 15 years his senior. **********Paradoxically, Mr. Habibie's moment of destiny began as a calculated insult. Mr. Suharto, the man he called his best friend, had appointed him vice president just two months earlier as a sort of slap at a growing chorus of critics. **********Mr. Habibie was widely seen as an eccentric and a lightweight, and when Mr. Suharto came under pressure to step down, one of the last cards he tried to play was to point to the clearly unqualified man who would take his place. **********Then, when he capitulated, he refused even to speak to Mr. Habibie, who said he was still stunned and bewildered as he took the oath of office two years ago, on May 21, 1998. **********Remarkably, he said, Mr. Suharto still refuses to see him. **********The only time they have spoken, he said, was on Mr. Suharto's birthday later that year, when he was allowed to place a telephone call to his former friend. **********''I called him and I told him, 'Happy birthday, I want to see you,' '' Mr. Habibie said. ''And he told me, 'No, you are not going to see me. It is not good for the country or for you or for me. You have to stop all of this. You cannot see me.' **********'' 'But you are just like my own father and my friend. Why should I not see you? I have the right to see you and to talk.' **********'' 'No. But you should try and contact me through spiritual -- through telepathy.' He told me like this, and then I forgave him,'' Mr. Habibie said. **********Since then, Mr. Suharto has suffered a third stroke, this one apparently so debilitating that he has trouble understanding and communicating. **********And so, as Mr. Habibie looks back at his unexpected moment in history, it appears that he will never learn why Mr. Suharto, his old friend, turned over to him the leadership of the nation without saying a word."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/11/business/world-business-briefing-asia-second-sogo-suicide.html": {"writer_name": "Miki Tanikawa", "pub_date": "2000-10-11", "snippet": "Yukio Nakazawa, former vice president of failed Sogo department store chain in Japan, hangs himself, becoming second executive at company to commit suicide (S)", "word_count": 97, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SECOND SOGO SUICIDE", "print_headline": "WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: ASIA; SECOND SOGO SUICIDE", "body_text": " **********A former vice president of the failed Sogo department store chain was found dead in his home after hanging himself, the police said.

The Internet as first conceived was just a way for government agencies, universities and libraries to share information, and what they shared was fairly mundane: catalog entries, data files, e-mail messages. Animation and movement didn't enter into it. **********By the mid-1990's, the Internet had become the World Wide Web, and word and image were mingling in everything from news to advertising to online video games. But computer users, raised on the high-speed kinetics of television and film, found the experience underwhelming at best, frustrating at worst. ''Animated'' Web sites tended to be slow to load, jumpy and awkward to view. **********Enter Flash, an animation and development tool that three years ago began breathing life into the Web and is now considered the industry standard for Internet design. Flash software, said John Caserta, a designer at Quokka.com, a site dedicated to sports, ''has really increased the palette that artists and Web designers work from.'' **********The program, developed by Future-Wave Software in 1995 as an illustration application and now owned by Macromedia Inc., allows designers to embed animated objects directly into their sties. In the past, this would have made Web sites too large and complex for most model connections, but Flash uses special graphics and compression tools that render the finished files remarkably small and easy to download. **********''Flash basically turned me over to the Internet,'' said David Well, a developer at Egomedia.com, a Web design firm based in New York. ''It brings an incredible amount of interactivity to what used to be the static world of Web coding.'' **********Some home users, however, may still long for those simpler days. Flash's very flexibility is tempting many designers to create lush, multi-megabyte files that can no longer be considered modem-friendly. The program also requires a plug-in, a special companion program that works with a Web browser; while most browsers now include the plugin, some users will inevitably be left with a blank space where the Internet's latest bells and whistles are supposed to be. **********Below, a look at how Flash works, and where to see it in action."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/31/business/dollar-makes-the-good-life-a-tourist-bargain-in-europe.html": {"writer_name": "Alessandra Stanley", "pub_date": "2000-10-31", "snippet": "Strong US economy, helped by dollar's surge against euro, has made Europe bargain for American travelers; Continent is attracting all kinds of tourists, not just high-end travelers; Britain, France and Germany remain favorite destinations; Spain e...", "word_count": 1733, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dollar Makes the Good Life A Tourist Bargain in Europe", "print_headline": "Dollar Makes the Good Life A Tourist Bargain in Europe", "body_text": " **********Like other European capitals, Rome is enjoying a record year for foreign tourism, with 24 percent more American visitors this year than last. Some may be religious pilgrims coming for the Jubilee, a Holy Year of the Roman Catholic Church. But most are not here to do penance. **********''Our Beluga caviar consumption has tripled, our oyster consumption has almost doubled, and our champagne consumption has quintupled this year,'' Nicola Rex, a manager of the five-star Hassler Hotel on top of the Spanish Steps, said. ''We ask ourselves, have all our clients become Arab sheiks?'' Mr. Rex discovered that actually, 90 percent of the requests came from American guests. **********About 12.4 million Americans are expected to visit Europe this year, according to forecasts by the Brussels-based European Travel Commission, a 6 percent increase over 1999, and the eighth consecutive year of record traffic to Europe. **********American tourists are taking barge trips through Burgundy, hiking in the glaciers of Iceland, horseback riding across Andalusia, and scooping up Hermes wallets and Baccarat crystal on the Faubourg-St.-Honore or Loro Piana cashmere scarves on the Via Borgognona in Rome. Some of the more wealthy tourists are picking up more lasting souvenirs -- buying pied-a-terre apartments in Paris and medieval farmhouses in Umbria or holding Renaissance theme weddings in Tuscany. **********The strong United States economy is driving the vast holiday migration to Europe, helped by the dollar's exchange rate against the euro, the  unified European currency that 11 countries joined in 1999, and which recently fell to a record low of 82.81 cents to the dollar. At the end of trading today, the euro had bounced back to 84.14 cents, but since its introduction at the beginning of 1999, it has lost more than one-quarter of its value against the dollar. **********The dollar's rise against the euro has shrunk the costs of shopping, accommodations and dining for traveling Americans. A modest dinner for three of pizza and salad at Tosca, a restaurant in central Rome, that cost about $40 last week would have come closer to $52 just a year before. **********The urge to do Europe this year is so strong that the seasons have blurred. ''All the early indications from airlines, hotels and tour operators suggest that the off-season is booming,'' said Einar Gustavsson, the United States chairman of the European Travel Commission, who is based in New York. Mr. Gustavsson, who is also the New York representative of the national tourism board of Iceland, a country where tourism is up 20 percent this year over last, noted that today's American tourist has new expectations. ''We are competing not so much for people's money as their time. Americans have money, but they don't have a lot of time, so they want quality. Culture. And the way you spell culture in America is Rembrandts, opera, food and, of course, the shopping.'' **********On Saturdays, customer service at the Louis Vuitton store on the Champs-Elysees in Paris begins on the sidewalk. The lines of shoppers, mostly Japanese and American, are long, wide and sometimes testy. Vuitton dispatches greeters who try to impose order by jotting down names, first-come, first-serve, on little leather notebooks. On Saturdays, shoppers eager to take advantage of the dollar-franc rate can wait for an hour. Or more. **********''It was absolutely terrible,'' Victor Sands, an orthodontist from Beverly Hills, Calif., recalled with a shudder. ''We had a list, and by the time we got to a salesgirl, nothing we wanted was left in stock.'' Cyrille Merienne, deputy store manager of the Vuitton shop on the Champs-Elysees, acknowledged that clients sometimes had to wait to be served. ''We try to accommodate the crowds, but our sales people have to spend quality time with each client,'' he said. ''We are not a supermarket. And we never will be.'' **********Dr. Sands tried to recover from the ordeal inside the plush, softly lit interiors of Hermes, where he and his friend Fred Kumetz, a lawyer from Beverly Hills, loitered in wait for their wives, who were wedged deep into the scarf counter, jostled by dozens of other tourists eager to buy silk and cashmere items that cost almost half what they would in New York. **********The two couples had planned long ago to visit Europe this year, but the strength of the dollar rerouted their itinerary. ''If the franc hadn't been so cheap, we wouldn't have been shopping so much,'' Mr. Sands explained wearily. ''We might actually have seen a museum.'' **********This loosening of American purse strings is prompted by the longest period of growth in the United States in a century, as well as the giddy sense that even the grand life on the Continent has never been quite so affordable. ''I have been coming to Paris regularly for 10 years, and this is the first time the dollar was really on my side,'' said Alan Helene, 44, a real estate developer from New York. **********Mr. Helene, who treated himself and his wife to a week at the Plaza Athenee, had just bought a watch at Bulgari that cost him 35 percent less than it was priced on Madison Avenue. ''There is nothing better than the feeling you are getting away with something,'' he chortled. **********Britain, France, Italy and Germany remain the favorite destinations for American tourists. But the British pound, which is not linked to the euro, is stronger against the dollar and the growth rate for tourism there is lower, with only a 2 percent increase expected this year over last. Ireland, which is part of the euro, is anticipating a 6 percent increase in visitors. **********Spain is expecting a 20 percent increase in American tourists this year. Waiting to enter the Prado Museum in Madrid, David Hogenkamp, a television executive from Buffalo, said the strong dollar was a definite factor in deciding to visit Spain, where the peseta is at 198 to the dollar, near the lowest it has been since the 1950's. ''We are planning to buy some clothes, maybe some leather goods and jewelry,'' said his companion, Maryanne Skiva, a C.P.A. from Buffalo. ''I'm even going to do some Christmas shopping.'' **********They marveled at the low prices. ''I've noticed that everything in general, food, hotels, etc. is generally cheaper than in the States. We're renting a car for 10 days to visit Barcelona and the southern coast and it only costs $167,'' Mr. Hogenkamp said. **********Europe is attracting all kinds of American tourists. ''The increase is all across the board -- it is not isolated to high-end tourism,'' Tom Souza, vice president of the European division of Far & Wide, a Miami-based consortium of 17 travel companies, said. ''It's not just the strong dollar, there is strong consumer confidence.'' **********Not all American tourists, moreover, are booking five-star hotels and eating in gourmet restaurants. Brett Wallace, 30, traveling with his friend, Jeff Gust, 34, both from Wisconsin, flew out of O'Hare, and were on a male-bonding trip, which included window shopping along Dublin's fashionable Temple Bar area. **********''We found a hot deal on Frommers.com,'' Mr. Wallace explained. He seemed most interested in finding good deals in pubs. A pint of Guinness in a Dublin pub costs $2.33, whereas a pint in London goes for $3.71. ''We are paying $:2.30 for a pint of Guinness,'' he said triumphantly. ''That's less than three bucks a pint. And, you don't have to tip.'' **********Mr. Wallace splurged on a pair of black leather shoes for 60 Irish pounds. **********Others are buying medieval stone farmhouses. ''A year ago, the dollar was worth about 1,800 lira, and now it is about 2,300, so, of course, Americans find it much more tempting to buy a dream house in Italy,'' according to Claudio Santi, a real estate agent at Tuder Immobilier, who helped arrange the sale. **********Marie-Helene Lundgreen, who works in the Belles Demeures department of Daniel Feau Conseil Immobilier, a Paris real estate firm, explained that not only was she getting many more American clients, but that the profile of the average American client had become younger and wealthier in the last few years. ''It used to be older couples getting ready to retire; now I have new-economy clients -- the 28-year-old trader who has a loft in TriBeCa and wants a two bedroom pied-a-terre in Paris and can spend more than $1 million to buy the perfect place.'' **********Perfection, in Paris, means a prestigious location, views of Notre Dame or the Eiffel Tower, large bathrooms, and exquisite furnishings. ''For Americans, Paris is a dream, but that dream is very specific,'' Mrs. Lundgreen said. She noted that she recently sold a 200-square-meter duplex penthouse apartment in St.-Germain-des-Pres for $2.5 million to an American who made up her mind in one weekend. **********Europe has always drawn honeymooners. Over the last few years, a growing number of Americans have held weddings overseas, exchanging vows and holding candle-lit receptions along the canals of Venice or in medieval castles in Tuscany. **********Christopher and Carey Worthy, 29, were married on Oct. 14 in a red, richly brocaded reception room in the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence, and both wore white -- he donned his naval reserve dress uniform, she wore a Renaissance wedding gown. ''The exchange rate kept falling in our favor -- we couldn't believe how inexpensive it turned out to be,'' Mr. Worthy said. **********Sandra Santoro, a Florence-based wedding planner, said, ''This year we have witnessed an absolute boom in American weddings.'' Her company, Getting Married in Italy by Atlantis, arranged more than 70 this year. ''Its become fashionable, and the American economy makes it affordable,'' she explained. **********Depending on size and extravagance, her firm's weddings cost anywhere from 3 million lire, or $1,301,  to 150 million. She cautioned that Italian bureaucracy sometimes punctured some of the more romantic American fantasies. ''I have clients who want to get married barefoot on the beach or in a gondola in Venice, and I have to explain that by law, they have to do it in a town hall,'' she said. **********American consumer confidence appears to have rubbed off on Europeans, who are continuing to visit the United States, even though the strong dollar makes everything from airline tickets to fast-food outlets more expensive. The Tourism Industries Office of the Department of Commerce has noted that 5.8 percent more Europeans are visiting the United States than last year. **********''I am one of those stupid Frenchmen who spend all their summer holidays in Florida,'' Francois Delahaye, general manager of the Plaza Athenee in Paris explained. ''I get poorer every time my children visit Orlando.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/07/world/world-briefing.html": {"writer_name": "Jeanne Moore", "pub_date": "2000-09-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 916, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "World Briefing", "print_headline": "World Briefing", "body_text": " **********EUROPE **********FRANCE: FUEL STALEMATE -- Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, left, ruled out any new concessions to trucking unions blockading fuel supplies that have caused gas stations around the country to run dry and disrupted air traffic.

Just as Internet job-search sites and articles in new-economy magazines encourage people to do, Mr. Taylor had decided to quit his job. In this high-desert city of low unemployment and fast growth, Mr. Taylor, a glass installer, thought he could find something much better. **********Within six weeks of casting about, Mr. Taylor had an offer from a utility company to work on one of its growing number of temporary projects. And local technology companies had dozens of open jobs. But there seemed to be a problem with every prospect. Either it did not pay enough to support his wife and three children, he said, or it lacked the health-care benefits to cover them. **********In the end, he stayed in his current line of work, though he found a higher paying job. His wife, meanwhile, went to work part-time as a secretary and insurance sales representative. ''There are jobs out there,'' Mr. Taylor said, ''but I found the wages were not high enough for me to switch industries and support a family. At 41 years of age, it's very difficult to step into a new field even in a booming economy.'' **********Mr. Taylor represents the new face of the still-anxious American worker. Economists say few people fret over whether they can find jobs in the 10th year of the nation's longest stretch of uninterrupted economic growth. But many employees say they are concerned about whether they can keep up with technological change and take advantage of opportunities in the sort of new-economy companies that are transforming places like Boise. And many either fear what will happen to their current job or -- like Mr. Taylor -- have looked but did not find another employment opportunity good enough to persuade them to jump. **********This new-style job anxiety does not cut as deeply as the pain felt all across what was called the Rust Belt in the 1980's, when waves of blue-collar workers lost jobs as one American industry after another retooled to face heightened foreign competition. And it does not carry the pathos of the early 1990's, when many white-collar employees faced downsizing during and after a recession that led to another round of efficiency-driven cutbacks. **********Indeed, the constant turnover in today's job market is exciting for many young, well-educated workers. **********But economists say that the lingering uncertainties within the nation's 140-million-strong work force help to explain why wage pressures, while on the upswing, remain more modest than they were in the milder and shorter economic booms of the recent past. **********''The evident insecurity felt by workers,'' Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said recently, echoing similar comments he has made on several occasions, is probably a result of ''a fear of job skill obsolescence.'' **********This seems like a strange time for the issue to raise its head. The contradictions of the early years of the 1990's, when consumer spending, corporate profits and share prices all rose rapidly but the median wage was falling, have largely ended. A record percentage of Americans now say they think that jobs are plentiful, and the number of people with the confidence to quit voluntarily has steadily grown since 1996. **********But if concerns over the availability of work have receded, worries over the quality of those jobs remain a signature part of the economy for many people. And while Americans acknowledge an abundance of jobs, a surprising number still report that they fear being laid off in the near future. Even in boomtowns like Boise -- with thriving high-technology companies and an unemployment rate of about 3.5 percent compared with the nationwide average of 4 percent -- corporate mergers and constant efforts to increase productivity have left many people uneasy. **********All this stands in contrast to the previous record-long expansion in the 1960's. Back then, said Richard Curtin, the director of consumer surveys at the University of Michigan, ''the only issue with living standards was how fast they would improve.'' **********The current tension between prosperity and insecurity is also playing a role in the presidential campaign, analysts said, as Vice President Al Gore has tried both to claim credit for the economy's strong performance and to soothe traditional Democratic Party constituencies who may not be keeping up with pledges to improve education and health care. George W. Bush, the Republican candidate, faces a similar tension in pushing a broad-based tax cut that is supposed to offer financial relief to the middle class, but that has been attacked as too generous to the wealthy and as an excessive drain on future budget surpluses. **********''These times are generally very scary,'' said Marcia Craig, an executive assistant at Boise Cascade, who had to change jobs last year when her previous employer, Ore-Ida Foods, moved to Pittsburgh. ''It seems that no matter what you've done, no matter how long you've done it, there are kids coming out of school that are going to knock your socks off,'' said Ms. Craig, who is raising two teenage boys. **********In fact, a generation gap has emerged at work. Younger employees, particularly those with a strong educational background, often view today's job market as a giant bazaar where their skills are handsomely rewarded. **********''My grandmother gets nervous every time I take a new job,'' said Jill Feeler, 30, who since 1996 has worked for a bank, a hospital and now for Hewlett-Packard, in the marketing department here. ''She says, 'What about your pension?' I'm like, 'Pension, shmension. It's 401(k)'s, grandma.' '' **********Workers like Ms. Feeler, who has both a bachelor's degree and an M.B.A. from Boise State University, say it does not bother them that the bonds between companies and employees have loosened over the last decade. They have a hard time imaging spending 20 years with one employer anyway. **********And they are grateful for all the pay raises and job offers many have received. Debra Bell, a recent engineering graduate of Brigham Young University, for instance, moved to Boise this summer with her sister and two friends. All quickly received full-time job offers, Ms. Bell, an engineer at Micron Technology, said, including the two who had not yet graduated from college and were coming to Idaho just for the summer. **********For most older workers -- be they carpenters and government employees here who have received scant raises in recent years or bank managers watching their companies merge -- the changes are more unsettling. The message from companies, said Jerry Bresina, an employee of Idaho Power for the last 27 years, is: What you did yesterday is not good enough today. **********''That's a tough pill to take,'' Mr. Bresina said, noting that Idaho Power has sent him to more classes in the last five years than in the previous 20 years altogether. **********Mr. Taylor, the glazier, added, ''I don't think we're humanly engineered for the stress level.'' With his wife planning to become a full-time worker this fall, their children can look forward to more ''fish-stick and macaroni-and-cheese dinners,'' he said. **********Aggravating the uncertainty, many workers say, are a number of trends that the low unemployment rate does not capture. People are working harder -- per family, three more hours a week than a decade ago, according to the Economic Policy Institute -- complicating other areas of life. And household debt is up while health insurance coverage is down, raising the stakes for people who do leave their jobs. **********Boise, Idaho's capital, is a particularly poignant example of the contradictions. An old gold-mining town, Boise has evolved from a city filled with headquarters of manufacturing and food companies to one that boasts Micron, a semiconductor maker, as its largest employer and a Hewlett-Packard office of 4,000 workers. **********The city ''has transformed itself from a prototypical old-economy area to a new-economy area,'' said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Economy.com, a consulting firm in West Chester, Pa., which tracks regional statistics. **********Help-wanted signs are common, despite an influx of new workers. The local economy, covering a metropolitan area of about 450,000 people, is growing more quickly than the rest of the nation, according to Economy.com. And compared with the rest of Idaho, where agriculture and heavy industry dominate, the city is wealthy and becoming more so. **********But there is also churn in Boise. The most telling example may be Ore-Ida, a company that sells potatoes, the region's signature product, to the world and even has Idaho as part of its corporate name. Travelers who step off planes into the small airport here are still greeted by an advertisement for the company. ''Welcome to Boise,'' it says. ''A city we've been proud to call home for over a quarter-century!'' **********In reality, all that is left of Ore-Ida in Idaho -- besides the ad -- are four employees closing up shop in an office just east of downtown. H. J. Heinz, which owns Ore-Ida, has moved it to Pittsburgh over the last two years to combine it with its Weight Watchers frozen-food line to save money. Boise lost some 300 jobs in the process. **********It is hardly the only turmoil here. West One Bancorp was bought by U.S. Bancorp in 1995, and First Security is disappearing into Wells Fargo. Hewlett-Packard has shed many of its production jobs but is adding white-collar workers. Albertson's, a fast-growing supermarket company based in Boise, has been trying to integrate its operation with the American Stores Company, which it bought last year. **********Across the country, mergers have more than quadrupled in the last decade to about 8,000 a year, according to Mergerstat, leaving jobs in jeopardy in nearly every instance. And corporate relocations have roughly doubled in the last four years, according to Site Selection Magazine in Atlanta. **********But to judge from Ore-Ida, losing a job today does not mean what it did a few years ago. Nearly all of the company's former employees seem to have received job offers elsewhere. A surprising number are earning a salary close to their old one, say both the workers and Bae Emilson, a consultant with the outplacement firm Drake Beam Morin that Heinz is paying to help the employees with their job search. **********While they say they miss their old colleagues, some even consider Ore-Ida's departure to be a good development. ''Almost every single person I know says this is the best thing that has happened to them,'' Ms. Craig said. Her salary at Boise Cascade is slightly lower than what Ore-Ida was paying her, and her new job as an executive assistant is a notch lower. But she finds the work more creative -- a discovery she suspects she never would have made had she not been laid off. **********At the same time, the Ore-Ida alumni agree that few of them will ever feel as secure in their jobs as they once did. That view is common in Boise, not just among those who have had to change jobs but also with those who have only heard about dislocation through friends or the local newspaper. **********Ms. Craig said she now keeps her resume updated, especially after Boise Cascade considered eliminating her department only weeks after she arrived. ''I have a different attitude,'' she said. **********Miren Lolley, who ran Ore-Ida's information technology department, has decided to use her severance pay to take about a year off after working for the company for 21 years. Then she hopes to become a consultant so she can control her own schedule, leaving time to eat lunch and dinner with her friends and two sons, as she has been able to do since Ore-Ida left. **********In the future, Ms. Lolley said, she wants to avoid working long hours for a company without knowing whether her job is secure. ''Nobody,'' she said, ''trained us for that.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/26/world/synagogue-in-jerusalem-set-afire-barak-condemns-awful-act.html": {"writer_name": "Deborah Sontag", "pub_date": "2000-06-26", "snippet": "Conservative synagogue in Jeruselam is set ablaze in crime denounced by Prime Min Ehud Barak as 'awful act;' synagogue leaders suspect youths on fringe of highly observant Orthodox Jewish groups (M)", "word_count": 616, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Synagogue in Jerusalem Set Afire; Barak Condemns 'Awful Act'", "print_headline": "Synagogue in Jerusalem Set Afire; Barak Condemns 'Awful Act'", "body_text": " **********After a Conservative synagogue in Jerusalem was set on fire Saturday night, Prime Minister Ehud Barak condemned the crime today as ''an awful act that causes every Jew to shudder.'' **********Rabbi David Bateman, who leads the Kehilat Ya'ar Ramot synagogue, said his congregation of about 150 families was trying to digest what had happened as arson investigators dug through the rubble of burned prayer books and furniture today. The fire came within yards of the ark, but the synagogue's three Torah scrolls emerged unharmed. **********''We are in shock,'' said Rabbi Bateman, who moved here two years ago from Randolph, N.J. ''Many of us are new immigrants or immigrants, at any rate. **********''For us, this was the promised land. We understood this sort of thing happened in the diaspora, where there were anti-Semites. But we never thought it could happen here.'' **********An investigation is under way. But synagogue leaders say they suspect  youths on the fringe of highly observant Orthodox Jewish groups, judging from previous incidents and a ''calling card'' left at the scene. **********Yonatan Liebowitz, a spokesman for the Conservative movement, said witnesses reported seeing apparently religious men, wearing black velvet skullcaps and white shirts, fleeing as the flames raged. But Rabbi Bateman said it was unclear whether the men were connected to the attack, and he cautioned against reading the violence as an expression of ''the ultra-Orthodox'' as opposed to ''some kind of a lunatic fringe.'' **********Strictly Orthodox Jews see Reform and Conservative Judaism as watered-down and inauthentic versions of a religion whose God-given rules are inviolable. Some do not see them as Judaism at all, although they are the dominant streams outside Israel. In a series of court cases that have ignited tensions here, the liberal movements have been fighting for recognition and equal status in a country that gives all the religious authority to the strictly Orthodox. **********Progressive Jews here took the fire as a sad sign that the battle between strictly Orthodox and liberal streams of Judaism had plummeted to a new low. **********''In the States,'' Rabbi Bateman said, ''we saw the occasional synagogues defaced with a swastika but we never saw one burned. And there, maybe it was neo-Nazis or skinheads. Not our own.'' **********In a statement issued tonight, Mr. Barak called such an attack on a synagogue ''seven times more shocking'' when it takes place in Jerusalem. He called on ''all Israelis to show mutual respect, tolerance and brotherly love even when we hold different opinions.'' **********A neighbor of the synagogue, which is in a mixed area of the secular, religious and very religious, reported the fire to the police on Saturday night. The police said that the sanctuary's large windows had been smashed with rocks, and that several burning rags had been thrown inside. A conservative rabbi who lived nearby ran into the smoke-filled sanctuary and crawled on his belly to see if the Torahs were endangered. **********Three weeks ago, the synagogue's door was singed in another attack, which the police presumed to be attempted arson. Rabbi Bateman said that his Conservative synagogue, one of the most established in the country, had come to the attention of the strictly religious community during a controversy over a strictly Orthodox man who attended services there. **********The synagogue was defaced with graffiti that labeled it a place unworthy of worship, and said that a yeshiva-trained Jew should not be there. Several anonymous callers threatened to burn the building, the rabbi said. **********Today, a Jewish Agency committee on solving problems between Jewish movements held its meeting at the burned Conservative synagogue. And the congregation is calling on Orthodox neighbors to join them Monday night under banners reading, ''Let's put out the flames.''

Perhaps next week, on the editorial page.) **********For the 2001 model year, which formally begins Oct. 1, automakers will eagerly try to gain attention in an American market more cluttered than ever, their efforts complicated by uncertainties ranging from gasoline prices to interest rates. **********''It's incredibly difficult'' to stand out, said Adrian Barrow, account planning director at Team One Advertising in El Segundo, Calif., a unit of the Publicis Groupe S.A. that will introduce tonight a campaign for the 2001 models of the Lexus LS 430 imported luxury sedan. **********''If I see another silver car driving down a twisty road,'' he added, laughing, 'I'm going to gag.'' **********To keep consumers from doing just that, agencies like Team One are scrambling to find compelling ways to sell vehicles. **********''Good advertising is all about nuances,'' said Mark-Hans Richer, director of advertising and sales promotion for the GMC line of trucks and sport utility vehicles made by General Motors. **********''GMC is a strong brand for some people,'' he added. ''We needed it to be stronger for more people.'' **********So in a $30 million campaign scheduled to begin on Sept. 22 by the New York office of Lowe Lintas & Partners Worldwide, a description of GMC products as ''professional grade'' -- appearing in some ads since 1998 -- is being broadened to include all models, from the Sierra and Yukon to the Envoy. ''We are professional grade'' is the theme of the campaign, which features GMC engineers involved in the creation and production of the '01 models. **********''Everyone can appreciate a well-engineered vehicle, whether you're pulling a horse trailer or taking landscaping home from Home Depot,'' said Susan Cantor, executive vice president and managing director at Lowe Lintas, part of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies. **********''In research, we discovered all consumers shared one mind-set: 'I'm smart, I'm in the know. And I want to do business with a company equally in the know,' '' she added. ''So we're going to give them the salient product points they need to buy a truck or S.U.V.'' **********Contrasted to that practical, detailed approach is the more ethereal tack taken by the estimated $25 million campaign by Team One for the LS 430, formerly known as the LS 400. Its ads carry the theme ''Imagine how you'll feel driving,'' which is dramatized with exuberant images ranging from a Roman piazza filled with dancing couples to a Tuscan countryside populated by singers warbling along with the Dinah Shore pop tune ''Shoo Fly Pie and Apple Pan Dowdy.'' **********''It's a romantic exaggeration, so to speak, an illustration of the emotional experience of driving the car, the third generation of our flagship model,'' said Greg Kitzens, corporate marketing manager for the Lexus division of Toyota Motor Sales USA in Torrance, Calif. **********''We have been known more for the rational features of our cars,'' he added. ''As we're introducing more stylish vehicles with more luxury and more performance, we're seeking a little more passion, a little more emotion, for our brand.'' **********To underscore that goal, the LS 430 campaign also begins a revised  theme for the Lexus division. ''The passionate pursuit of perfection'' will replace ''The relentless pursuit of perfection.'' **********As for Dinah Shore's fame for years of singing the ''See the U.S.A. in Your Chevrolet'' jingle, Mr. Kitzens said with a chuckle, ''We hope 'Shoo Fly Pie' will be as catchy.'' **********Catchy also describes a campaign with a budget of more than $20 million that is to begin tomorrow for the redesigned C-Class line of cars sold by the Mercedes-Benz unit of DaimlerChrysler. The campaign, focused on catching drivers in their 30's and 40's rather than the more typical C-Class buyers in their 50's and 60's, carries this theme: ''The new C. Live. A lot.'' **********The television, print, Internet and promotional campaign continues the more playful tone that has typified Mercedes-Benz advertising since 1995. In one TV spot, stylishly dressed people produce cartoon-style exaggerated responses when a C-Class car passes. Their eyes bulge out of their heads, steam pours from their ears and they float above the pavement in vignettes that seem to have been a result of the unlikely collaboration of Richard Avedon and Tex Avery. **********''We want to reach and connect with'' younger consumers who ''we acknowledge live life a little differently,'' said Alex Gellert, partner at the Mercedes agency, Merkley Newman Harty in New York, part of the Omnicom Group.

But Mr. Kay, who said his company would revise its current forecasts of revenue gains downward next week, was skeptical. ''He's lowering expectations as low as he can get them,'' he said. **********Gateway's announcement was the bleakest yet from a major computer company on the state of the consumer sector of the $120 billion personal computer business. Still, it fit with trends previously reported by other vendors, retailers and analysts. **********Optimists say the reports reflect a predictable slowing in the sector's growth after two torrid years. Besides, they say, stronger business sales and growth in overseas markets should allow unit sales of personal computers to grow at least 10 percent next year. And, while price cuts will reduce the average selling price, the more successful brand-name manufacturers should be able to post at least small revenue gains, according to most analysts. **********The darker view is that the abruptness and size of the decline that Gateway encountered are particularly vivid portents among many others of an approaching economic downturn. It may also reflect a growing resistance among consumers to upgrading personal computers, a trend that could make life tougher for everyone in the industry now that more than half of American homes have at least one such device. **********The initial verdict of investors yesterday seemed to be that the best course was to keep selling the already battered computer stocks even though many analysts said they had probably fallen to safe levels. **********Gateway began Wednesday at $31 on the Nasdaq, sold at $29.50 before the company's warning and fell below $20 in after-hours trading. It tumbled further yesterday. Shares dipped below $17.50 before ending the day at $19. **********Apple Computer, judged by many analysts to be even more exposed to the consumer sector, slipped $1.06, to $16.50, even though shares were already down 73 percent from their peak of more than $63 in September. **********Compaq Computer, Dell Computer and Hewlett-Packard all hit new 52-week lows as well. In an effort to calm investors, Carleton S. Fiorina, chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, issued a statement stressing that consumer sales of computers accounted for just 10 percent of its business. Although Hewlett-Packard had unexpectedly weak holiday computer sales, that weakness should not affect the company's ability to achieve its earnings and sales projections in 2001, the statement said. **********The damage extended to related stocks as well, including Microsoft, the leading producer of personal computer software; Intel, the leading manufacturer of microprocessors for personal computers; and Lexmark International, a major manufacturer of printers that are often bundled with personal computers purchased by consumers. **********Analysts say a wide range of forces is undermining holiday computer sales to the consumer market: *********** Consumer debt levels are high and there are numerous signs that the economy is slowing, exactly the conditions to make consumers and small-business owners think twice about purchases of costly items like cars, appliances and computers. *********** Many personal computer users bought new hardware in 1999 to get on the Internet or replaced equipment to minimize Year 2000 risks. *********** Few current computer owners have any pressing need for Windows 2000 or other new software programs that are expected to eventually stimulate replacement computer sales. *********** Consumers have a much wider variety of other electronic devices competing for their holiday spending dollars than in the past, including the first generation of so-called Internet appliances, devices meant to provide basic online services without the complexity of a full-scale computer. **********Analysts say Apple and Gateway are the most vulnerable of all the companies to such pressures because they are the most dependent on the consumer market. **********Gateway's long-term strategy is to move beyond computers, which analysts say are on the way to becoming commodities. The company has been  rolling out a broad range of training packages, services and electronic devices that can be linked to the Internet or networked in a home. **********''I agree with Jeff Weitzen's view of the digital networked home of the future,'' said Steven Fortuna, who follows the industry for Merrill Lynch.

Many young Muslim men were stopped at the Old City gates, where chanting, stone-throwing protesters battled police on horseback. Israeli sharpshooters crouched at the ready behind the crenelated parapets of the city's 14th century walls. **********Inside, many Old City residents were also turned away from the inner gates to the mosque sanctum by knots of helmeted, flak-jacketed Israeli border guards. Women and older men were ushered in. But with the Israeli army, on high alert since Thursday, blocking roads out of the West Bank, few Muslims from outside East Jerusalem were able to even approach the Old City today. **********Sheik Ikrima Sabri, the Grand Mufti of the al-Aqsa and Dome of the Rock mosque complex, gave an angry sermon decrying the \"Israeli occupation of our holy site\" before some 3,000 worshippers, about a fifth the size of a normal Friday congregation. **********\"We have never seen the mosque so empty for Friday prayer services,\" he said in an interview later. \"This is unjust. Israel is preventing people from practicing their faith, a crime that the whole world should condemn.\" **********Israeli police officials, however, said they were pleased that they had averted a third consecutive Friday of riots at the sacred plaza, known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary. The regionally televised images of pitched battles with police at the site two weeks ago, battles that left six Palestinians dead, ignited further bloody clashes throughout the Palestinian territories and Israel itself. **********\"We did what we did in order to prevent more violent outbreaks, and as a result the day went by without any extraordinary incidents,\" an Israeli police official said. **********But it remained a day of acute tension throughout Israel and the Palestinian territories, still shaken by the politically devastating sequence Thursday of the mob murder of two Israeli soldiers and retaliatory air strikes by Israeli helicopters. **********Despite reports of an imminent peace summit, neither side seemed ready to heed international calls for restraint and reconciliation. Israelis across the political spectrum demanded a strong show of military force in the streets today, while Palestinians in protest marches across the West Bank and the Gaza Strip vowed to confront Israeli troops with rocks and rifles until the Israelis are forced to pull out. **********\"The uprising and the confrontations will continue,\" Marwan Barghouti, a top lieutenant of the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, and the leader of the West Bank's biggest paramilitary force, told a crowd of thousands in Ramallah. A short while later, elements of that crowd were engaged in a brief but fierce gun battle with four Israeli tanks hunkered down on Ramallah's outskirts. **********In Hebron, at least one Palestinian, 22-year-old Mansur Sayed Ammad, was killed in clashes with Israeli troops, which escalated from rock-throwing to sniper exchanges and left a dozen people wounded, Palestinian sources said. Mr. Ammad's death is the 98th confirmed fatality from the street fighting of the last 16 days. The rioters were repelled from attacking a small Jewish enclave in the heart of the otherwise Palestinian-controlled city, according to the Israeli military. **********Earlier in the day, Jewish settlers in Hebron accused the Israeli army of exercising excessive restraint in its battles with Palestinian gunmen there. A settlers group met this morning with Gen. Benny Ganz, the commander of Israel's forces in the West Bank, and demanded that Israel use helicopters and other heavy weaponry \"not only to scare the terrorist attackers, but also to shoot at them,\" they said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/30/world/south-africa-to-ask-for-international-gem-certification.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "2000-11-30", "snippet": "South Africa will introduce resolution in UN General Assembly for international certification system for gems, amid concern that diamonds may not only be fueling civil wars among other Africans but also adverse publicity and calls for boycotts tha...", "word_count": 671, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "South Africa to Ask for International Gem Certification", "print_headline": "South Africa to Ask for International Gem Certification", "body_text": " **********South Africa plans to ask all nations on Friday to back an international certification system for gems, saying it is concerned not only that diamonds are fueling civil wars among other Africans but also that adverse publicity and calls for boycotts will hurt its own diamond-mining industry. **********Ambassador Dumisana Kumalo of South Africa, who will introduce a resolution in the 189-member General Assembly, said in an interview today that piecemeal attempts to control diamond exports, which finance rebel organizations like the Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone and Unita in Angola, are not enough. **********In two weeks, publication is expected of an expert panel's report to the Security Council on the illegal trade in what are called ''conflict diamonds.'' **********''One thing that they will show in their report is that the same characters who are involved in trading in Angola are the ones who pop up in the Congo, the ones in Sierra Leone,'' Mr. Kumalo said. ''So there is a very small network wherever these conflict diamonds are.''  He said that without concerted action worldwide, there can be no hope of stopping the trade. **********Botswana and Namibia have joined South Africa in offering to set up a technical process for certifying diamonds, based on standards already established by various nations. The United States, Britain, Israel and Belgium, among other countries where gemstones are worked and sold in significant quantities, are backing the South African General Assembly resolution. **********''There has to be a way in which those who buy diamonds can be able to tell that these are the good diamonds and these are the not-so-good diamonds,'' Mr. Kumalo said. ''You can't tell the origin of a diamond even it you are Tiffany's, so we want to protect people like that, too.'' **********The fallout from lost sales would be most acute in southern Africa, the world's largest source of rough diamonds, Mr. Kumalo said. ''The livelihoods of thousands of South African families depend on mining. Botswana, Namibia, ourselves -- without diamonds the three of us would face really serious economic consequences.'' All three have internationally recognized regulations for certifying stones. **********''Only 4 percent of the world's diamonds are the conflict diamonds, and 96 percent are prosperity diamonds, as they call them in Botswana,'' he said. ''To an overwhelming extent the industry is fine and the companies are doing what companies are supposed to do.'' He said that only a few rebel leaders, aided by some corrupt government officials and a ring of ''kingpins'' running the trade, are the problem. They have been able to defy or circumvent Security Council resolutions, though with greater difficulty since the Security Council, under the leadership of Canada, took up the issue early this year, Mr. Kumalo said. **********''Sadly, this resolution is too late for the young children in Sierra Leone who lost their arms in these crazed attacks funded by these diamonds,'' he said. ''Or for the people of Angola -- millions of whom have been uprooted from their homes. But we have to start somewhere.'' **********Although the South African resolution is expected to pass, Mr. Kumalo's campaign for international standards met resistance. ''We've had an interesting fight because the Russians and the Indians, for instance, were not very happy about international standards and mechanisms because they were saying that this is not a problem in their part of the world and why should they be subjected to these international standards,'' he said. **********''This is beginning to happen on a lot of issues at the U.N.: we have to keep on coming back to saying that the U.N. is a global institution and the problems with conflict diamonds are global problems; they're not just African problems,'' he said. **********Mr. Kumalo said he took his resolution to the General Assembly rather than the Security Council to get as close to universal approval as possible. ''This is the kind of resolution that the co-sponsors should be all 189 countries, to really send a message throughout the world that we cannot accept the tainting of this industry by a few people,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/07/world/zambian-criticizes-leadership-of-sierra-leone-peacekeepers.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "2000-05-07", "snippet": "Zambian Pres Frederick Chiluba says that 200 Zambian peacekeepers taken hostage in Sierra Leone were deployed too quickly into unknown territory, with out-of-date maps and shortage of vital equipment; map (S)", "word_count": 584, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Zambian Criticizes Leadership of Sierra Leone Peacekeepers", "print_headline": "Zambian Criticizes Leadership of Sierra Leone Peacekeepers", "body_text": " **********The president of Zambia said today that the 200 Zambian peacekeepers taken hostage in Sierra Leone on Thursday had been deployed too quickly into unknown territory with out-of-date maps and a shortage of other vital equipment. **********The Zambian troops form the majority of the approximately 300 soldiers taken hostage this week in the West African country, where the United Nations is striving to keep peace after eight years of civil war. **********President Frederick Chiluba, speaking to reporters after meeting with members of the United Nations Security Council on a peace mission in Africa, criticized obliquely the commander of the peacekeeping force in Sierra Leone, Maj.

''It's a big blow for peacekeeping in Africa.'' **********He said that the Security Council would have to look at how to deal with Foday Sankoh, whose troops from the Revolutionary United Front rebel movement have created havoc in Sierra Leone a year after signing a peace pact in return for concessions that other nations were reluctant to approve -- but finally had no alternative but to accept. One gave Mr. Sankoh a ministry in the government of Sierra Leone's elected president, Ahmed Tejan Kabbah. **********''There isn't a court, as in Yugoslavia or Rwanda,'' said Sir Jeremy, who has taken the lead in the Security Council on Sierra Leone, a former British colony.

''We are 100 percent confident that they did not gain access to any of our customers' data.'' Ms. Taylor did not want to comment further, although the company issued a brief statement about the arrests. **********In criminal complaints filed in United States District Court in Manhattan, federal agents described how they used computers to track the person calling himself Alex.

''But I can't give up my principles and in any case will get my money for done job.'' **********The e-mail goes on to suggest that Bloomberg deposit $200,000 in an off-shore bank account. If the money was received, Alex wrote, the information on the company would be destroyed. **********''In case of non-payment, I'll send the report to your clients,'' the e-mail said. **********According to the complaint, Bloomberg opened an account at a Deutsche Bank office in London and deposited $200,000. The account was set up so that Alex could confirm the money was present, but could not transfer or withdraw the funds. A few days later, Alex requested ''total control'' of the account and asked that Bloomberg release $7,500 for travel expenses for the proposed meeting in London. **********The F.B.I. learned that the $7,500 was electronically transferred to a bank in Riga, Latvia. On July 25, Alex sent an e-mail message to Mr. Bloomberg agreeing to meet in London. **********''Today is my birthday, 27 years old,'' the e-mail said.

Putin on Monday, followed by presentations today by a senior military commander and a top foreign ministry official, the Russian leadership chose this week of electoral chaos in the United States to make its case. **********No matter who wins the election, the Russians said, Moscow is eager to move swiftly to eliminate the cost of maintaining large strategic nuclear forces a decade after the end of the cold war. **********''What counts most now is that Russia and the United States start moving jointly or along parallel courses toward radically lowered ceilings on nuclear warheads without any holdups,'' Mr. Putin said before leaving for Mongolia and then Brunei for a summit meeting of Asian and Pacific leaders. **********While in Brunei, Mr. Putin and President Clinton will meet for the last scheduled time before Mr. Clinton leaves office. **********Russian officials hinted that Moscow might be ready to negotiate amendments to a treaty banning missile defenses, something Washington wants, if cuts in offensive weapons are deep enough. **********The commander of Russia's strategic rocket forces, Gen. Vladimir N. Yakolev, warned Monday that Russia would find it ''very difficult'' to stop the political momentum in the United States for building a national missile shield to defend against attacks by rogue states and accidental launchings. Therefore, he said, Russia should make a new deal with Washington: trading any American buildup in missile defenses for deeper cuts -- perhaps deeper than Russia's cuts -- in offensive weapons. **********The reason for the pressing Russian initiative, say analysts here and in the United States, has more to do with Moscow's domestic economic and security concerns than with American politics. **********Saddled with an unfinished military campaign in Chechnya and a general deterioration of Russian conventional forces that may have contributed to the disaster that sank the nuclear submarine Kursk in August, Mr. Putin is pressing his military commanders to slash the still bloated Russian armed forces by a third or more. His goal is to build a smaller and more capable fighting force to defend Russia against threats of Islamic extremism in Central Asia and ethnic tensions loosed by the collapse of the Soviet Union. **********To finance the modernization of Russia's conventional armed forces, Mr. Putin would like to avoid the large expenditures necessary to maintain several thousand strategic nuclear weapons and their delivery systems. **********''Certainly we would like to save money on weapons that are never supposed to be used,'' said Aleksei G. Arbatov, a member of the defense committee of the Russian Parliament. **********''Nuclear weapons are virtual weapons, designed and deployed never to be used,'' he said in an interview, ''and this is the best area to seek economy while using our available resources for peacekeeping, or for countering ethnic or religious extremists and the destabilization which follows them.'' **********In his statement on Monday, Mr. Putin said Russia was prepared ''to consider even lower levels'' than the 1,500 warheads presented by its negotiators in Geneva earlier this year at the outset of negotiations for a Start III agreement. Some officials said Mr. Putin would like to cut strategic arsenals to 1,000 weapons each. **********Such a cut would require the incoming American president to issue a new directive to the Joint Chiefs of Staff to further reduce the list of targets in the highly classified plans for defending the United States in a nuclear conflict. Those war plans set a floor of 2,500 nuclear weapons necessary to cover all targets in current war plans. **********Both presidential contenders have given Russia some hope that a compromise can be reached. **********In May, Gov. George W. Bush declared that Russia ''is no longer our enemy'' and said that if elected he would order the Pentagon to conduct a new assessment ''of our nuclear force posture'' with a goal of significant further reductions, while also moving forward with a national missile shield even if Russia refused to amend the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972, which prohibits the deployment of nationwide missile defenses. **********If elected, Vice President Al Gore has said he would seek to negotiate with Russia on amendments to the antimissile treaty to allow deployment of missile defenses, while also seeking further reductions in offensive weapons. **********Ivo H. Daalder, an arms control expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said Mr. Bush's declaration demonstrated to the Russians that both candidates held out the promise of supporting much deeper cuts in the nuclear arsenals. Mr. Bush would support deep cuts while ignoring Russian concerns about missile defenses, thus freeing the Russians to take other steps to counter American defenses. But the net result would be fewer offensive weapons. **********''The fact that the Republicans were the ones to break through the wall when it comes to going lower than 2,500 weapons provides the underpinnings'' for a bipartisan American consensus to reduce offensive weapons, Mr. Daalder said. **********Russia and the United States signed the Start II agreement in 1993, calling for cutting the superpower nuclear arensals in half -- to 3,000 to 3,500 weapons each -- and eliminating Russia's force of large multiple-warhead missiles. **********But the struggle to win full approval for the treaty has carried over to this year. The Senate approved the treaty in 1996, but the Russian Parliament, dominated by Communist members, objected to its terms until April. It was approved after the election of a non-Communist majority."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/01/business/company-briefs-616958.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-02-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 130, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********STANDARD PACIFIC INC., Costa Mesa, Calif., a large home builder, agreed to buy the construction company Writer Corp., Englewood, Colo., for about $54.4 million in cash, stock and assumed debt. **********HON INDUSTRIES INC., Muscatine, Iowa, the largest U.S. fireplace maker, agreed to buy Allied Group and American Fireplace Co., fireplace distributors.

The draw gave the challenger, Vladimir Kramnik, 25, the half point that he needed to gain 8.5 points to Mr. Kasparov's 6.5, and to win a contest that he had clearly controlled from the beginning. **********Despite the disputes that have split the chess world in recent years, with different organizations sponsoring rival matches, there was no doubt in the minds of anyone watching today that an era had ended. **********As Mr. Kasparov pushed the button to signal that he was offering a draw -- and the match -- to Mr. Kramnik, a collective sigh, part excitement and part wistfulness at the falling of a champion, swept through the crowd. **********''Kasparov is a great player and a great champion,'' said Ricardo Calvo, an international chess master from Madrid, one of many players who descended on the Riverside Studios in Hammersmith to watch the match, sponsored by the Brain Games Network. ''He's brilliant, of course. But 15 years is a long time, especially in chess, and it's time for him to make way for other players.'' **********Mr. Kasparov played sluggishly and tentatively throughout the monthlong competition, often seeming not to know how to respond to Mr. Kramnik's aggressive maneuvers and implacable defenses. **********Although he had earlier hinted that unspecified ''personal problems'' were disrupting his concentration, today he took care to quash the rampant rumors that he had lost his fighting spirit and his will to win. **********''Obviously this match was dominated by Vladimir's outstanding preparation,'' Mr. Kasparov said, conceding defeat with a graciousness unusual in someone known for his volatile temper. **********But he added: ''I feel my chess strengths are still here. I still believe my performance can be dramatically improved and I intend to show that by playing in tournaments.'' **********The two will still have to play the 16th and final game of the match on Saturday, even though it will not affect the outcome. **********There is a symmetry in the histories of the two players. **********When Mr. Kasparov beat Anatoly Karpov to take the title in 1985, he was 22, the youngest world champion ever. Taught chess by his Armenian mother and Jewish father in Baku, Azerbaijan, Mr. Kasparov began to play seriously at 6. **********When his father died the next year, he changed his last name from Weinshtein to a variation of his mother's maiden name. His mother, Clara, took charge of his career, and still travels with him and is deeply involved in his everyday life. **********Mr. Kramnik was also a prodigy. Born in Tuapse, a Black Sea resort, he learned to play chess at 4 and was winning games against his family within months. By the time he was 10, he had beaten two grandmasters and at 16 he became the world junior champion. When he was 11, Mr. Kasparov took him on as a student at his elite chess school in Moscow. **********Mr. Kramnik learned his lessons well. He was Mr. Kasparov's second, or senior adviser, when Mr. Kasparov defeated the Indian grandmaster Viswanathan Anand in 1995, a role that gave Mr. Kramnik important access to Mr. Kasparov's thinking and style of play and, perhaps, a slight edge in this match. **********''Chess has everything to do with the human mind, and Garry Kasparov has one of the most complex minds on the planet,'' Jonathan Levitt, an English grandmaster who works for Mr. Kasparov's on-line chess company, said in seeking an explanation for his lackluster play. **********Asked whether his relationship with Kramnik had anything to do with it, Mr. Levitt said, ''Maybe in his deep subconscious he's been saying things like, 'I wish I hadn't shown him this variation five years ago.' '' **********Mr. Kasparov, who tends to be dismissive of opponents to the point of rudeness, has long acknowledged Mr. Kramnik's talent. ''There are many players, but they don't play chess -- they move pieces,'' Mr. Kasparov said after seeing his student play in Germany eight years ago. ''Kramnik plays chess.'' **********After the game today, Mr. Kasparov said Mr. Kramnik's attacking strategy had knocked him off balance. ''Ninety-eight percent of my preparation was for nothing,'' Mr. Kasparov said, adding that he had grown exhausted and dispirited from preparing 10 hours a day just to catch up during the match. **********Mr. Kramnik -- whose victory brings him $1.33 million in prize money, while Mr. Kasparov gets $667,000 -- seems to be cut from a different cloth than that of his mentor. While Mr. Kasparov is temperamental, sharp-tongued and irascible, Mr. Kramnik is quiet, polite and apparently unflappable. **********Confronted by a succession of agonized facial expressions and unhappy body language from his opponent, Mr. Kramnik remained cool, impassive and focused. The only real emotion that he showed occurred when he won, when he thrust both arms over his head and broke into what for him seemed the rarest of expressions, a smile. **********''He's a nice person, and a very serious one,'' said Miguel Illescas, a Spanish grandmaster who was an adviser on Mr. Kramnik's backup team. ''He's been completely concentrating on the match. He only does five things during a match: play, study, eat, drink and sleep.'' **********Mr. Kramnik, who lost weight and quit smoking to prepare for the match, has said as much himself. ''Daily life does not interest me,'' he once told a Russian newspaper. ''Everything is subordinated to chess, to that one goal.'' **********Perhaps the Kasparov era has truly given way to the Kramnik era. But many players at the match today were not ready to see it go so easily. **********''We have entered a new millennium, and we have a new world champion,'' Mr. Levitt said. ''But Garry Kasparov is still the best player of all time, and I don't think this is the end of him.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/20/business/technology-in-a-nod-to-slower-economy-sbc-cuts-earnings-forecast.html": {"writer_name": "Simon Romero", "pub_date": "2000-12-20", "snippet": "SBC Communications, nation's second-largest provider of local telephone service, lowers its forecasts for sales and earnings next year in sign of how slowing economy is beginning to affect large telecommunications companies (M)", "word_count": 820, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "In a Nod to Slower Economy, SBC Cuts Earnings Forecast", "print_headline": "TECHNOLOGY; In a Nod to Slower Economy, SBC Cuts Earnings Forecast", "body_text": " **********SBC Communications, the nation's second-largest provider of local telephone service, lowered its forecasts yesterday for sales and earnings next year in a sign of how the slowing economy is beginning to affect large telecommunications companies. **********SBC said its problems were caused in part by regulatory hurdles it faces in introducing long-distance service in states like California and also by high-speed digital subscriber line problems at Ameritech, the company with operations in Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, Indiana and Wisconsin that SBC bought in 1999. **********But gloomier prospects for the American economy also contributed to SBC's decision to lower forecasts. This is a contrast to previous years, when large telecommunications providers were generally thought to be shielded from an economic downturn because demand for their basic products like local and long-distance service remained strong. **********''The telecom industry of today is dramatically different from that of 10 years ago,'' said Simon Flannery, a telecommunications analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ''There's an Achilles' heel to introducing so many new products if sales of these services are shown to decline when demand slumps.'' **********Instead of percentage growth in earnings per share in the midteens, SBC now expects per-share earnings to increase 11 percent to 14 percent next year. And sales, instead of climbing 10 percent, are expected to rise 8 percent to 9 percent, said Edward E. Whitacre, SBC's chairman and chief executive. **********Analysts were quick to react after SBC's announcement. Adam Quinton of Merrill Lynch downgraded the stock to accumulate from buy, and lowered his firm's target price to $60 from $65. And Dan Reingold of Credit Suisse First Boston also lowered the target price to $64 from $66 but refrained from recommending to investors that they trim their SBC holdings. **********Shares in SBC, which until yesterday had mostly been spared the recent turmoil at other large telecommunications companies like AT&T and WorldCom, fell $6.75, to $46.56. Until yesterday SBC stock had climbed 9.4 percent in 2000. Now the stock is down 4.5 percent for the year. **********While analysts, for the most part, remained cautiously optimistic, investors showed concern that difficulties at SBC could signal similar problems at other large providers of local telephone service. Shares in BellSouth declined $2.63, to $41.25, and shares in Verizon Communications fell $3.94, to $51.88. **********''Everyone is wondering whether this will have a contagious effect on the industry,'' said Tim Ghriskey, a senior portfolio manager at the Dreyfus Corporation. ''Could it be that demand for high-capacity data services are slowing at a time when competitive pressure in areas like D.S.L. is growing? Questions like these are all of a sudden on everyone's mind.'' **********Verizon sought to play down these concerns by reaffirming its financial projections for 2001 and 2002. And the company added that it was adding 3,500 D.S.L. lines a day, having already exceeded its year-end target of 500,000 D.S.L subscribers. **********''Our problem is that we're trying to keep up with the orders in areas like D.S.L. that are hard to fill quickly,'' said Eric Rabe, a spokesman for Verizon, which was formed by Bell Atlantic's acquisition of the GTE Corporation. ''It's certainly not affecting our bottom line.'' **********To be sure, SBC's problems are largely of a similar nature. But in the states where its Ameritech unit operates, SBC acknowledged that ''recent service issues'' have prevented the rollout of D.S.L. service as smoothly as the company had hoped. To deal with the problems, SBC has dispatched technicians from other areas to the Ameritech region. **********The growing popularity of D.S.L. service, which allows users to gain access to the Internet over regular telephone lines at speeds far faster than a regular dial-up connection, has emerged as a flashpoint for much of the turmoil in the telecommunications industry. **********The technical complexity of adapting copper telephone lines for high-speed data delivery have made the business complicated when it comes to installations and repairs. Those problems are compounded by the confusion generated by the large number of relatively small service providers and wholesalers that need access to local phone networks to get D.S.L. to the consumer. **********Companies like SBC are continuing to expand into sophisticated services like D.S.L. and add-ons like call-waiting and caller I.D. as they seek to use a large customer base to cross-sell products. But judging from SBC's warning yesterday, these new services also appear to make local telephone companies vulnerable when the economy slows. **********''The old predictability of the local phone company is out the window,'' said Jeffrey Kagan, an independent telecommunications analyst. ''It looks like the rewards of riding an unprecedented wave of demand during the last few years for new telecommunications products also presents its fair share of risks.''                     -------------------- **********BellSouth Takes a Charge **********Reuters **********ATLANTA, Dec. 19 -- The BellSouth Corporation said it would take after-tax charges of $350 million to $375 million related to a restructuring of its video entertainment service.

Augusto Pinochet of his senatorial immunity, removing a giant legal hurdle to charging the former dictator with involvement in the kidnapping, torture and murder of thousands of people during his 17-year rule. **********The announcement, which was widely expected, was greeted here with the uncorking of bottles of Champagne by hundreds of cheering demonstrators, who waved black-and-white photographs of their dead or missing loved ones. It also provoked some thinly veiled sniping between President Ricardo Lagos -- the first Socialist to govern Chile since the Pinochet coup overthrew President Salvador Allende in 1973 -- and the army commander, who strongly defended the former dictator's place in history. **********General Pinochet is still a long way from serving time in prison, or even being tried. Conservative lawmakers said they would introduce legislation exempting him from facing a trial because of his health. He has diabetes and circulatory problems and has had three strokes. **********His family also takes the position he should not stand trial because of the illnesses. The family said today that it would fight a legal battle to prevent General Pinochet, 84, from being examined to determine if he is mentally fit to stand trial, which the family considers humiliating. **********Because of his status as a retired general, General Pinochet has the right to choose the location of his interrogation by prosecutors. That privilege could allow him to specify that his questioning take place within a military building in an attempt to pit the armed forces against the government. **********Nevertheless, the decision today was more than symbolic in importance because it will likely lead to the prosecution of dozens of other retired military and police officers for the executions and disappearances of more than 3,000 people. **********The decision not only stripped General Pinochet of his immunity, but it also ratified a legal doctrine that considers anyone who disappeared during the dictatorship and has not been found to be a kidnapping victim. Since the kidnapping would be considered still in progress, it could not be covered by an amnesty decreed while General Pinochet was in power. The amnesty granted immunity for political crimes committed during the early years of his government. **********Judge Juan Guzman, who is serving as the prosecutor, has based his case against General Pinochet on the workings of a death squad led by aides close to him in the first months after the 1973 coup. The death squad has been held responsible for the disappearance of scores of people, 19 of whom are still missing and therefore are considered kidnapping victims. **********Today's decision provoked a bitter polemic between President Lagos and Gen. Ricardo Izurieta. Since he replaced General Pinochet as commander in chief of the army in early 1998, General Izurieta has attempted  both to coexist with two civilian presidents and to keep right-wing elements at bay. **********He made a provocative visit to General Pinochet at his home today, saying, ''The Chilean Army wanted to express its support at this difficult time.'' When asked by reporters if his visit had the government's approval, he shot back, ''As commander in chief, I do what I have to do.'' **********Without mentioning General Izurieta by name or criticizing his visit, President Lagos clearly responded to the general's remarks, saying, ''The command of our country rests on what I decide.'' He added, ''Today our obligation is to respect the judges and guard our own conduct as the world is watching us.'' **********In recent days top military commanders have warned that a ruling against General Pinochet could inhibit military officials from coming forward with information about those who had disappeared -- something the military pledged earlier this year that it would do. But today General Izurieta said the armed forces would comply with its promise. **********General Pinochet's lawyers and other supporters contended that the court decision was totally political because, they said, everyone knew that the people who had disappeared were dead and that many could never be found because their bodies had been dumped into the ocean. **********''It's an absurd decision based on a falsehood,'' said Senator Jorge Martinez Bush, a conservative ally of the former dictator. ''This is a judicial fiction that will freeze the relationship between the civilian leadership and the military.'' **********The 14-to-6 Supreme Court vote upholding a lower court ruling was more one-sided than the tally was reported to be a week ago, when the outcome of the secret deliberations was reported in some detail in the local press. **********''This is an important precedent for the entire world that human rights is a basic foundation of democracy,'' said Juan Bustos, one of the lawyers who argued before the court in favor of stripping the immunity that General Pinochet was granted when he became a senator for life in 1998, under a provision in the Constitution written during his rule. **********Judge Guzman will now lead a formal criminal investigation against the former dictator. The prosecutor has not made clear how he will proceed, but he is expected to order that General Pinochet undergo medical tests to assess his mental fitness to face trial. Then he will probably demand that the retired general answer a series of questions. **********There have been 157 criminal claims filed against General Pinochet by human rights groups, families of those who disappeared and torture victims. But the case against him picked up momentum only after he was arrested in London two years ago on a Spanish warrant. He has faced legal troubles ever since he was released by the British authorities for health reasons, and allowed to return home in March."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/12/business/media-business-advertising-subject-divorce-becoming-more-common-another-backdrop.html": {"writer_name": "Patricia Lauro", "pub_date": "2000-10-12", "snippet": "John Hancock Financial Services joins ranks of companies using subject of divorce as backdrop in their advertising campaigns, and its campaign, developed by Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos, bluntly spotlights the negative side of divorce; Volv...", "word_count": 996, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The subject of divorce is becoming more common as another backdrop in campaigns.", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; The subject of divorce is becoming more common as another backdrop in campaigns.", "body_text": " **********DIVORCE is the kind of unhappy topic advertisers typically like to avoid. **********Yet in recent years, divorce has become just another backdrop in advertising as marketers recognize that millions of ''typical'' American couples have dissolved their marriages. Advertisers like Volvo, Nissan Motor, Ingka Holdings' Ikea, Volkswagen, and even Hallmark Cards have all used divorce in one way or another and usually with some poignancy. **********The newest television commercial to deal with the subject is from John Hancock Financial Services, and it is different because it bluntly spotlights the negative side of divorce. The spot is set in a kitchen as an obviously tired mother is told by her ex-husband, only moments after imploring him to ''do more'' for their son, that his girlfriend wants him to move to California. ''You tell Joey that, you tell him,'' the woman says. The campaign's theme is ''Insurance for the unexpected. Investments for the opportunities.'' **********That advertisers are including divorced families in commercials says that American society accepts it as a fact of life, said Jack Trout, a Greenwich, Conn., marketing consultant and author of marketing books. Hancock declined an interview about its advertising, as did its agency, Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos in Boston, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies. **********''The stigma has been off for a long time, and we as a society are more accepting of divorce,'' Mr. Trout said. ''But I do think you have to approach the subject with a high degree of delicacy, and it's probably better to give it a positive twist.'' **********But given the sensitivities of divorce, why even take on such a risky issue in advertising? Can divorce sell products? **********Volvo, a subsidiary of the Ford Motor Company, ran an ad called Custody last year as a way to be contemporary and relevant to its customers, many of whom are families. Indeed, to always avoid divorce in advertising as if it did not exist would be deceitful and ''insulting'' to consumers, said Michael Lee, managing partner at the Volvo agency, Messner Vetere Berger McNamee Schmetterer/Euro RSCG in New York, part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide unit of Havas Advertising. **********Messner Vetere created the Volvo spot last year. It showed a father handing over the keys to the Volvo after returning from a weekend with his daughters. The idea is that wherever the children go, so goes the Volvo, which is known for its safety, Mr. Lee said. Messner Vetere, he noted, created its first national spot touching on divorce in 1991 for MCI Communications' personal card. **********''Volvo is very much about connecting with families and without being preachy in any way; the contemporary family today is about the people you love,'' Mr. Lee said. ''It's not just Mom, Dad, two kids and a dog.'' **********Mr. Lee said Hancock's heart-wrenching approach was probably part of its strategy to reach a specific audience, namely single mothers in need of financial advice. Volvo's objective was to reach a broad audience by ''reflecting real life and real situations,'' he said. **********Several ad critics found the Hancock ad depressing. But Barbara Lippert, an ad critic for the trade publication Adweek, applauded its realism, and also liked a second Hancock spot of a single mother who turns down her lover's marriage proposal to take care of her, saying, ''We can take care of ourselves.'' **********''I especially liked that horribly tense feeling in the kitchen; I appreciated the reality,'' Ms. Lippert said. **********Indeed, Hancock's spot reflects the now accepted view that divorce, though needed, is not easy and has consequences, said Judith Langer of Langer Associates, a research and trend consulting company in New York. Hancock might also have picked up on some general anxiety of women about divorce. Research shows that women -- even women married for years -- view marriage as a precarious state, she said. **********''There is a lot of anxiety out there,'' she said. **********For Volkswagen, the idea was to get across a feeling of ''new beginnings'' in its 1997 TV spot to introduce the Passat, said Tony Fouladpour, a Volkswagen spokesman. The commercial from Arnold Worldwide in Boston, part of the Arnold Worldwide Partners unit of Havas, captured the role reversal of a teenager helping her mother nervously get dressed for a ''first'' date. Mr. Fouladpour said Passat was portrayed as a car for adults with a bit of attitude and an adventurous spirit. **********''We didn't get any real negative reaction, and we did get some positive reactions from women who liked the fact that we had a realistic view,'' Mr. Fouladpour said. **********Still, it is a sensitive topic no matter how you broach it. Ms. Langer said that despite Hancock's realism, the approach was risky and could make people feel uncomfortable. Ms. Lippert, meanwhile, criticized Hallmark's spot for being, perhaps, a bit too happy. Created last year by Leo Burnett USA in Chicago, part of the Leo Burnett Worldwide unit of the Bcom3 Group, the spot showed a separated or divorced mother -- it was never stated -- dropping off her son with his father when the son gives his Dad a card telling him he is still his hero. The commercial ends with the estranged parents sharing a cup of coffee. **********Ms. Lippert said she believed the ending indicated the parents might get back together, which she said is a false image to project for children since most parents do not get back together. But a Hallmark spokeswoman, Rachel Bolton, said the intent of the spot was simply to show that greeting cards help people communicate. **********''The underlying sentiment is that sending supportive cards can have a huge impact on people's lives, and that it's a comfortable way to approach situations or subjects that might otherwise be more difficult,'' she said. ''It opens the door to communication.'' **********Ms. Bolton said tests showed the commercial worked, and she noted that divorce cards do sell now -- unlike Hallmark's first failed effort at a divorce card in 1958. Just to indicate how accepting society has become, she said, Hallmark introduced a line of cards this year for stepfamilies and so-called blended families."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/07/business/world-business-briefing-asia-creditors-will-divide-daewoo-motor.html": {"writer_name": "Samuel Len", "pub_date": "2000-10-07", "snippet": "Daewoo Motor Co's creditors, in attempt to sell off ailing carmaker, will break up company and sell off separate units to different buyers (S)", "word_count": 47, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CREDITORS WILL DIVIDE DAEWOO MOTOR", "print_headline": "WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: ASIA; CREDITORS WILL DIVIDE DAEWOO MOTOR", "body_text": " **********In an attempt to sell off ailing Daewoo Motor by a self-imposed Oct. 20 deadline, creditors of the company, South Korea's second-largest carmaker, said that they would break up the company and sell off the separate units to different buyers. **********Samuel Len (NYT) **********Beyond Business: World Briefing, Page A8."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/26/world/yugoslavia-turning-a-page-is-expected-to-rejoin-united-nations.html": {"writer_name": "Carlotta Gall", "pub_date": "2000-10-26", "snippet": "American ambassador to United Nations, Richard Holbrooke, says Yugoslavia will soon apply to join UN, indicating clear change in policy under its new president, Vojislav Kostunica; Holbrooke is first prominent member of Clinton cabinet to meet wit...", "word_count": 473, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Yugoslavia, Turning a Page, Is Expected to Rejoin United Nations", "print_headline": "Yugoslavia, Turning a Page, Is Expected to Rejoin United Nations", "body_text": " **********Yugoslavia will soon apply to join the United Nations, indicating a clear change in policy under its new president, Vojislav Kostunica, the American ambassador to the United Nations, Richard Holbrooke, said today after meeting with Balkan leaders. **********''It is clear that Yugoslavia will join the United Nations in a very short time,'' Mr. Holbrooke said.

Fujimori of Peru implored senior Clinton administration officials today to give him the backing necessary to put Peru on a track toward full democracy, officials said. **********Mr. Fujimori, who jumped on a plane to Washington this week after making a sudden request to confer with administration officials and the secretary general of the Organization of American States, told officials that he now wants to restore the very democratic institutions he is seen as having undermined during his decade in office. **********Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright appeared to oblige Mr. Fujimori after meeting him, if only by voicing moral support. Her spokesman said she had told Mr. Fujimori he had ''done the right thing'' in announcing plans on Sept. 16 to hold new elections in which he would not be a candidate, and to abolish the National Intelligence Service headed by his disgraced adviser, Vladimiro Montesinos. **********''He really seems determined that this will be his legacy: the return to full democracy in Peru,'' said one American official who met with Mr. Fujimori. ''He knows he's finished, and now the question is, how does he go out?'' **********American officials said they were encouraged by the results of a dialogue between government and opposition leaders in Peru. With an official of the Organization of American States standing as mediator, both sides agreed to set a date in October for legislative and presidential elections next year, and to establish a multiparty commission to investigate how public money is spent in political campaigns. **********The panorama has brightened further for Mr. Fujimori this week because Alejandro Toledo, who was the leading opposition candidate for president until this spring, appeared on Thursday to drop his demands that Mr. Fujimori resign immediately and make way for a transitional government until elections can be held. **********''We shouldn't distract from the progress made in the dialogue,'' said Mr. Toledo, who dropped out of the presidential race after a first round, in which he polled about 40 percent of the vote, compared with nearly 50 percent for Mr. Fujimori. Mr. Toledo, who is the best-known opposition leader, has not yet said whether he will run in the new elections. **********But officials at the Organization of American States warned that conditions in Peru remain unstable, particularly because Mr. Montesinos's status remains unresolved. He fled to Panama last week after the broadcast of a videotape that apparently showed him trying to pay a $15,000 bribe to an opposition lawmaker. **********Military leaders loyal to Mr. Montesinos have repeatedly warned of a coup if he is not granted political asylum in Panama, the officials said. Panamanian authorities are studying his request, but so far have granted him only a 30-day tourist visa. **********Mr. Fujimori's government has asked for help in keeping Mr. Montesinos out of Peru, said O.A.S. officials, who warned that the spy chief must be made to feel secure in Panama. **********Cesar Gaviria, the O.A.S. secretary general and a former president of Colombia, defended his efforts to find a haven for Mr. Montesinos, who is widely unpopular among Peruvians and notorious among human rights advocates. **********Last week, the senior army officers who support Mr. Montesinos sounded out Mr. Fujimori's vice presidents as to whether they would lead a post-coup government, and used invitations to an armed forces day ceremony to keep the civilian government off balance until Mr. Montesinos had fled over the weekend, officials said. **********Mr. Fujimori's invitation to the ceremony was at first withdrawn, which was taken as a threat to his government. The invitation was later reinstated. **********''Mr. Montesinos was a major hurdle for the democratic agenda,'' Mr. Gaviria said. ''This is something nobody can deny in Peru. We believe it's very important to go ahead with this process.'' **********American officials, who acknowledge an informal intelligence-sharing relationship with Mr. Montesinos, are ''strongly supportive of the Panamanian government'' for accepting him, according to the State Department spokesman, Richard A.

It consists of about 15 houses and a mosque. It is for Israelis only. **********The village is a simulation, a three-dimensional stage set that the Israeli Army uses to train its troops in occupation techniques, riot control and all-out battle. It is populated by soldiers playing the roles of what an army official called ''the enemy'': Palestinian stone throwers and police officers, even journalists and homemakers. In the year-old mock village, the army experiments with techniques for controlling and reacting to violence in a way that is meant to minimize the risk to Palestinian civilians. **********For the Israeli soldiers trained there, the experience can be dizzying. On the one hand, they are engaged in active relationship with Palestinian troops in the West Bank, riding together on patrols and sitting together in offices, sharing data, coordinating arrests, jointly calming tensions. On the other, they are readying themselves for a defensive battle against them and their people. **********''It is exactly the double mission we deal with,'' a senior army official said. ''On one channel, we really know the Palestinian officers on a personal level. On the other, we prepare for events like those that took place in May.'' That was when Israeli and Palestinian soldiers engaged in extended gunfire exchanges in the West Bank. **********''We wear two heads,'' he added, ''and educate the soldiers to think two ways at once.'' **********In a way that has alarmed Palestinian leaders, the Israeli Army has been putting out the word that it is gearing up for riots and more as the negotiations advance and a September deadline for a final agreement approaches. While the Israeli government is talking peace with the Palestinians, the Israeli Army is busy preparing for violent conflict. **********Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, the Israeli Army chief, warned last week that his forces would use helicopters and tanks to quash riots, if need be. ''Anyone who hurts Israeli soldiers will be hurt,'' he said. ''And if we need tanks, tanks will come. And if need combat helicopters, combat helicopters will come.'' **********This week, the army said it would start equipping West Bank settlements with riot control gear, including tear gas and rubber bullets. This horrified the Palestinians, although the settlements are already armed with government-provided weapons and live ammunition, and the army has trained an emergency squad of reserve officers and soldiers who live in each settlement. All settlers trained and armed are cleared by the security services. **********The reigning assessment of Israeli military experts is that the Palestinians want their future state to be born through struggle. They do not want ''their state to be handed to them on a silver platter,'' a senior army official said. ''They want not an independence war, but maybe an independence struggle.'' **********Palestinian officials are labeling this kind of talk a ''bad faith'' approach to the peace effort, which sours the mood on the ground in the West Bank and adversely affects the negotiations themselves. Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, speaking on Thursday in Ramallah, said he had immediately alerted the international authorities that the Israelis' bellicose talk was irresponsible. **********''We informed the United Nations, the European Union, the American administration, Russia, the nonaligned countries, China and Japan,'' he said. ''We explained to them that this is wrong, not only for the Palestinian track. It endangers peace in the Middle East.'' **********In a letter to Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general, a Palestinian representative warned that the Israeli Army could set off violence with its threatening statements. ''Such threats of extreme force cannot be taken lightly as the fragile and tense situation in the area could quickly destabilize and words could be quickly translated into action,'' wrote Somaia Barghouti, a member of the Palestinians' observer mission at the United Nations. **********The Israeli Army says that it does not want to raise tensions, but that it does want to be prepared. Military officials point to the riots in May, which left 6 Palestinians dead as well as almost 1,000 Palestinians and 60 Israelis wounded. **********Israeli and Palestinian experts alike agree that those riots demonstrated that Mr. Arafat will permit or even encourage violent eruptions in the West Bank and Gaza. Israelis say he has used and is expected again to use violence to put pressure on Israel during the mood swings of the negotiations. And they note that, as May demonstrated, street riots can get out of hand and end in full-fledged gun battles. **********Palestinian opposition leaders have pointed to the Israeli troop withdrawal from Lebanon in May as evidence that armed struggle might accomplish more than talk. Palestinian officials still firmly advocate negotiation as the road to achievement, but they warn Israelis not to test their reaction to military threats. **********Jabril Rajoub, the security chief in the West Bank, said General Mofaz's words were ''a declaration of war.'' **********''If he thinks his tanks and helicopters will be met by the white flag of surrender, he is mistaken,'' he said. **********After initially inviting a reporter to visit the mock Palestinian village in Bet Guvrin, Israeli Army officials later decided that the moment was ''too sensitive.'' **********Many professional armies and police forces train in simulated settings. But the idea of Israel re-creating a Palestinian village to be used for military drills is a potentially explosive one against the backdrop of this week's back and forth between Israeli and Palestinian officials. **********Although the village opened about a year ago, its existence is not widely known. ''You can simulate one to one what happens in the territories,'' an army official said, ''how to use force, and if need be, helicopters; techniques for dealing with riots, arrests.'' **********''It is standard for us to provide training for warfare in a developed area,'' he said. ''But we've never had such a realistic setting before.'' **********The village is just one part of the army's regrouping after the deadly skirmishes between Israelis and Palestinians following Israel's opening of an entrance to the Western Wall tunnel in September 1996. During the tunnel riots, the stone-throwing and rubber bullet-shooting that typified the Palestinian-Israeli confrontations during the uprising of 1988-93 gave way to exchanges of live ammunition. **********The army established a project called ''low intensity conflict.'' It is based on preparations to respond to more sophisticated violence, involving not only automatic weapons but also what Israeli intelligence analysts say may be a cache of hand-held antiaircraft and antitank missiles. **********Most Israeli officers in the West Bank are now elite former paratroopers. The jeeps and other vehicles are now armored. Tanks have been positioned through the zones of conflict. Soldiers are trained in how to be snipers and to protect themselves from snipers. **********And the Israeli Army keeps a live map of points of friction in the West Bank that could ignite a conflagration, including the village of Sulfit adjacent to the settlement of Ariel. The goal, Israeli officials stress, is to anticipate and avert conflict. But, they added, they have to be prepared for worst-case scenarios, even as peace talks are supposedly aiming to end the conflict entirely. **********''We don't think the Palestinians can conquer a settlement,'' an army official said, ''but they can come to the fence and shoot. That's why we have trained and equipped the settlers. We don't want them to take on their own security unless there's an emergency. But there might be an emergency.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/18/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-mall-developer-sells-naming-rights.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "2000-02-18", "snippet": "Mills Corp, major developer of shopping center", "word_count": 129, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mall Developer Sells Naming Rights", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Mall Developer Sells Naming Rights", "body_text": " **********Those dismayed at the proliferation of commercial names for sports stadiums will soon have another reason to complain: In what is being described as a first, a shopping center in Georgia to be opened in fall 2001 has sold naming rights. **********For an estimated $10 million, the Mills Corporation, a major developer of shopping centers, has sold the naming rights to a mall in Gwinnett County, north of Atlanta, to Discover Financial Services, part of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company.

Will cyberspace be mainly a source of information and entertainment, or an interactive communications medium? Will the crucial asset be a subscriber base, a broadband electronic pipeline or a server full of movies, music and news? Will the primary entrance point be a computer, a television a cellular phone or perhaps a Webcam? **********Verne G. Kopytoff and Julie Flaherty were assigned by Money & Business to ask Internet seers in business and academia how they saw the online experience evolving over the next five years, and whether last week's announced merger of tree-snapping behemoths advances, retards or misreads those trends. Here are their replies. **********WILLIAM H. DUTTON -- Professor of communications at the University of Southern California and author of ''Society on the Line'' (Oxford University Press). **********Internet providers don't want to be limited to people who have computers. But to date, efforts to introduce interactive television and other interactive services like video text and video services have all failed. **********You have to be skeptical about to how well the Internet model translates to the television set. They're totally different. People who watch television generally are passive and don't interact with it and don't want to.  So changing their viewing habits is going to be difficult. **********Clearly the Web has been a trigger service that has caused more people to get computers and get online. But there are also other trigger services, like word processing and spreadsheets. **********People who see big synergies in the AOL-Time Warner merger are ignoring the fact that electronic mail and communicating with others is why most people use the Internet. Access to information, including entertainment, is not the major reason why people go online. **********People will still watch television on television, which will be much like it is today, though in a few years it will have many more links and ties and references to the Internet. **********GORDON M. TUCKER -- Chief executive of Egreetings Network, an online digital greeting and gift company based in San Francisco. **********I believe that the desktop computer will remain the anchor point for people going online. I don't believe that people who are information-centric organize their lives around television. **********Television doesn't handle the variety of needs. You want to reduce the number of communications options you are forced to deal with. The problem is that more and more people are getting frustrated with the number of devices they have to manage. Wireless phones and laptops will be there, but as a supplement to computers. **********It's all about making it easier and easier for people, and faster and faster. Obviously people today want instant gratification, and mergers like AOL and Time Warner are just going to accelerate the achievement of that goal. In a few years the Internet will be a lot more dynamic, and you'll have the ability to personalize a Web site you visit: it will be possible to present a fundamentally different Web site for you versus everyone else. **********In online retailing, global commercial access transforms companies and the way they sell products. Right now it is difficult to sell products internationally, but as the barriers to international trade come down and Web sites address the need of international consumers, you'll have access to anyone in the world. **********MARIO GERLA -- Professor of computer science at U.C.L.A., now working on developing Internet 2, a high-speed successor to today's Internet. **********I see a lot of changes happening. One is wireless access to the Internet. Nowadays, we connect mainly from the home or the office, but we already see a trend of access to the Web from cell phones. Soon a commuter riding to work in a van will be able to video-conference or take a class on a laptop. We will be able to stand in the aisle of one store and see what others are charging. There is definitely the need to access the Internet from anywhere. **********All of this raises the question of cost. You may pay a provider for access, but no one is charged for actually using the network, regardless of the traffic. That's all right for now when there isn't that much traffic. But in the future, if everyone is building bigger conferencing and video on demand, you'll just exceed the bandwidth available. That will be resolved by charging people, or by giving free access but having advertising subsidizing the network as an indirect charge. **********This is especially true for wireless access. If I'm in the middle of Central Park, I'm sharing the spectrum with a large number of people, so pricing will be the controlling factor. **********The other complementary act is that we will have the so-called smart office, and the smart network to appliances in the home, and video cameras in every room that can be accessed from the Internet. You will be able to see what your kids are doing -- that's an extension to the concept of the Web. **********As for the AOL-Time Warner merger and the proliferation of entertainment on the Internet, there is a limit to what you can sell. We are already flooded. I don't have any time for that; maybe kids do. **********MICHAEL L. DERTOUZOS -- Director of the Laboratory for Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and author of ''What Will Be'' (HarperBusiness). **********I am not surprised by the merger, for it confirms the industrial world's progress toward a powerful information marketplace. **********I am surprised, however, by the hyperventilation over ''content.'' Even with interactivity, such uses will only be roughly as big a part of the overall economy as entertainment and news are today -- less than 5 percent. But office work, at 50 percent of the industrial economy, could reach $4 trillion a year online worldwide. **********Within five years, 50 million Indians, who read and write English and have office skills, will be ready to sell their information work to us at bargain prices. Interconnected computers will further automate many of the things we now do with our eyes and brains. People will collaborate over time and space wherever they may be. They will be able to retrieve the information they want, rather than infojunk; control their physical environment; and customize goods and services to individual needs. **********And, we hope, more people than the privileged 2 percent of the world who are interconnected today will join in. Much more than interactive ''content'' lies ahead. **********BOB METCALFE -- Founder of the 3Com Corporation; now a commentator on technology and vice president of the International Data Group, a large publisher of computer-related books, newspapers and magazines, in Boston. **********In five years, most Americans will be enjoying broadband Internet from home, maybe 100 times as fast as dial-up modems and always on -- no more waiting for personal computers to power on, boot up, launch browsers, accept dial tone and then dial their screeching modems only to get busy signals from, well, America Offline. **********What we'll attach to the always-on, high-speed Internet will be mostly devices other than personal computers. What comes and goes over the broadband Internet will be much less like clicking a computer than like talking on the telephone. And it will be less like talking on the telephone than like watching CNN, reading Time magazine, laughing through Looney Tunes at the movies, hip-hopping with Rampage on Elektra records and exercising with Jane Fonda. **********All we have to worry about on the broadband Internet is preserving freedom of choice among competing alternatives. Worry about Big Business taking over the Internet if you want -- AOL Time Warner, Microsoft and the telephone monopolies, for example -- but be sure to keep an eye on Big Government."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/24/news/to-germans-surprise-koreans-look-to-them-as-role-model-revisiting.html": {"writer_name": "John Schmid", "pub_date": "2000-11-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1592, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "To Germans' Surprise, Koreans Look to Them as 'Role Model' : Revisiting Lessons of Reunification", "print_headline": "To Germans' Surprise, Koreans Look to Them as 'Role Model' : Revisiting Lessons of Reunification", "body_text": " **********DRESDEN\u2014                     For all its lingering flaws and costs, Germany's shotgun reunification 10 years ago has found fervent admirers on the other side of the globe. **********To its surprise, Berlin serves these days as a showcase to scores of diplomats from the Korean Peninsula \u2014 a prototype of political reunification for Seoul and Pyongyang as the two countries move toward rapprochement. **********\"You are our role model,\" said President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea during a visit to Berlin this year. His visit was one of many North and South Korean consultations, on just about every level of the diplomatic ladder, that Berlin's Foreign Ministry has hosted throughout the year. **********Germans can only chuckle to think that their model of reunification, so fraught with bitter feelings, could inspire anyone. Ever since Oct. 3 became a national holiday to commemorate the 1990 union, revelry has been rare. This year's 10th anniversary, held here in the Eastern city of Dresden, was mainly a pensive affair. **********Dispirited Germans often forget that their peaceful reunification laid the cornerstone for a more hopeful world order. Instead, politicians remain locked in perennial East-West feuds over Western taxpayer aid to the East, subsidies that have weakened Europe's erstwhile economic locomotive. According to a consensus in Eastern Germany, 20 more years of subsidies are needed to approximate West European living standards. **********Equally disheartening, opinion polls and demographic profiles show Germany as one nation with two societies, divided by clashing cultures, psychologies, birth rates, political views and different consumer habits. Despite a rush of books that try to explain the two cultures to each other, stereotypes and mutual suspicions linger. The crudest in the West portrays Ossies in the East as ungrateful and idle, while the Wessies in the West get labeled as arrogant control freaks. **********And so the Korean de\u0301tente came just in time to give Germans a fresh view of themselves. Stepping back from their 10th anniversary angst, Germans can now offer themselves as a hopeful benchmark for others. **********According to Berlin's Foreign Ministry, the Koreans chose Berlin in part as a hopeful backdrop to their own talks, which began discreetly but have since made several breakthroughs. **********The Korean guests \u2014 who, it turns out, have conferred with German reunification experts throughout the past decade \u2014 have witnessed the emergence of a transitional generation of young Germans who move freely over the old East-West divide and of a class of artists, intellectuals, hustlers, politicians and entrepreneurs who increasingly thrive amid the East-West tension. **********The hybrid Germans avoid the old slang of reunification that pigeonholed them as Wessies or Ossies. They simply call themselves Wossies. **********Seeking a balance between realism and optimism, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has declared that reunification is roughly halfway complete. \"We need to recognize that we have reached the halfway point,\" was his motto during a two-week tour of Eastern Germany last summer. \"Anyone who believes or promises that this can go faster is lying or does not understand,\" he told Eastern Germans. **********In a speech at Berlin's Free University in March, Mr. Kim said, \"I learned tremendously from West German policies toward East Germany and from the developments there since German unification. Korea and Germany have suffered the same kind of pain \u2014 the division of land.\" **********But the Germans, who pushed through reunification in less than a year, have shown the Koreans that not everything about their big-bang, clean-up-the-mess-later approach is worthy of emulation. Envoys from South Korea say they ideally would stretch their nuptials over several decades and then only after a tightly controlled process of \"reconciliation, cooperation, co-existence and co-prosperity.\" **********Mr. Kim also did a double take when he saw the costs of Germany reunification. \"The unified German government ended up spending 10 times more than the 200 billion marks originally set aside for that purpose,\" he said. **********Whether or not the Koreans will have the luxury of time, they clearly want to avoid the depths of disappointment that the Germans have endured. One of the greatest risks, the Germans showed, is to lift expectations too high. Much of the grumpiness in Germany stems from years of sobering disillusionment that followed an early binge of punch-drunk euphoria. **********Ten years ago, former Chancellor Helmut Kohl uttered his famous promise that the introduction of a strong Deutsche mark into East Germany would create a second economic miracle like West Germany's Wirtschaftswunder. But hurrying to swap the old \"tin-chip\" Ostmark, a nonconvertible Soviet-zone currency, for one of the world's hardest currencies catapulted the East overnight onto the same advanced plane of economic competition as the West, bankrupting most of the indigenous flagship industries. **********The head of the respected Ifo economic research group used the run-up to the Oct. 3 anniversary to declare that reunification was \"an economic failure.\" **********Yet there is another side of Germany that the Koreans' interest highlights. Berlin feels it can display greater self-confidence in its nationhood precisely because it has begun to heal its divisions and find some degree of closure with its history, however incomplete.

It is the only school district running such a model in the nation, though Basehor-Linwood school officials are helping educators in three other Kansas communities to establish similar programs. **********Charter schools are independent public schools operated by educators, parents, consumers and non-profit companies. While state laws vary, most charter schools operate under the general auspices of state or local education officials but remain free of some education regulations. In the case of the Basehor-Linwood initiative, the district operates the virtual school. **********The virtual school is designed to appeal to a broad array of students and families, most of whom Pendleton said have opted to learn at home for similar reasons. **********\"It wasn't religion.

If the state ever did swoop in and mandate everything we teach, all I have to do is un-enroll. To me, there is no downside, and trust me, I've looked.\" **********Jeanne Allen, president of the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Education Reform - which advocates for charter schools - said that while virtual charter schools are growing in popularity in some areas, there is little reason to expect they will supplant more traditional education models. **********\"Parents still want, for the most part, a school with a class, or the same type of structure they are used to,\" she said. \"I don't think it's a trend or the world to come, but charter schools will be suited to meet students' needs.\" **********The Virtual Charter School serves students in kindergarten through 12th grade via an online independent study program guided by full-time school district teachers. Parents pay a one-time $20 deposit for an iMac and a $40 annual textbook fee. Dearing paid nearly $3,000 in textbooks and supplies the first year she taught her son at home before signing up with the charter school. Families are responsible for finding an Internet service provider and paying those fees. **********Students are expected to complete coursework within the school year at their own pace and are required to take state standardized tests. Students \"go online and get their assignments, then they get offline and pull out their textbooks and study,\" said Brenda DeGroot, director of the virtual school. \"At the elementary level, you may be a 10th grade reader, but in a regular classroom it's hard to meet those needs.\" **********There is one teacher assigned to each grade level for elementary students and a teacher assigned to each subject area for middle and high school students. There are about 150 elementary students, 50 middle school students and 150 high school students in the virtual school, DeGroot said. Parents are responsible for teaching the younger students with online assistance, while high school students are often able to guide their own studies. **********\"You're at your own discretion of how you pursue your coursework,\" DeGroot said. \"Our support staff will e-mail families about once a week.\" **********Randy Gaschler, president of the Placerville, Ca.-based Innovative Education Management , said the mixed model meets the independent study and socialization needs of K-12 students. **********\"We have the ability to absolutely individualize each student's learning plan,\" he said. \"It's not easy to accommodate in a regular classroom. We can have a student working on first grade math, third grade English and fifth grade social studies.\" **********While the six Innovative Education Management schools are public charter schools, they do not have the Kansas virtual school's funding flexibility because they are not affiliated with a California public school district. **********When a home school student enrolls in Kansas, the enrollment is treated and funded as if the student enrolled in his local elementary school and the virtual school can take advantage of the school district's purchasing power. The California school is allotted standard state funding for each student to fund its services. **********When Gaschler opened Horizon Instructional Systems in 1993, his first charter school, he invested in computer equipment that allows the school to be its own Internet service provider so it can offer low-cost connections to its online students. **********\"We have more bandwidth than most counties have,\" he said. \"Right now we can put a DSL connection in a student's home for less than $400 a year.\" **********If a student needs a computer, the cost comes out of his or her instructional fund, Gaschler said. **********While virtual schools are likely to appeal to a relatively small group of parents and students, Allen said the initiatives in California and Kansas have shown they can provide an important alternative. **********\"Kansas is rural and has a hard time keeping kids in school,\" she said. \"And California is huge; its size helps it make sense."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/04/business/investing-funds-watch-for-low-turnover-management-steer-clear-of-connecticut.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Teitelbaum", "pub_date": "2000-06-04", "snippet": "Unusual survey by Thomson Financial Investor Relations studies money managers in 61 metropolitan areas to determine their average portfolio turnover ratio for 1999; finds managers in Hartford and southern Connecticut region by far reported highest...", "word_count": 204, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "For Low-Turnover Management, Steer Clear of Connecticut", "print_headline": "INVESTING: FUNDS WATCH; For Low-Turnover Management, Steer Clear of Connecticut", "body_text": " **********Fund investors worried about the government's tax bite may just want to steer their money to a portfolio manager who is based in Houston.

In the end, and for all the huge differences between Britain and Denmark, what counted was the politics. Danes, skeptics here say, simply saw the euro as the stalking horse of a European superstate that would submerge their sovereignty. The government's fear is that Britons, given half the chance, would do the same. **********''The Danes saw what Tony Blair denies, that the euro is a political project whose final goal is a European state,'' Lord Lamont, a euro opponent, said. ''I have no doubt that the British people will show the same courage as the Danes.'' **********Trevor Greetham, a stock market strategist with Merrill Lynch here, said the Danish outcome, 53.1 percent against the euro to 46.9, ''makes it much less likely'' that Britain and Sweden, another holdout, will even join the single currency. **********Since the euro was conjured into existence 20 months ago, Britain has been the principal heretic to challenge a Franco-German orthodoxy, insisting that Europe's future lay in ever closer monetary and political union. When 11 nations formed the currency, Britain remained aloof, along with Denmark, Sweden and Greece, which has now qualified to join the currency. Since then, with the euro's plummeting against the pound and the dollar, the number of Britons opposed to the euro has, at least in public opinion, risen to 75 percent. **********Throughout that period, though, the supporters, including Mr. Blair and some cabinet ministers, notably Foreign Minister Robin Cook, have seemed to imply that euro membership was somehow inevitable if Britain was to avoid a perilous isolation from European decision making. **********The vote among the Danes, thus, came to be seen as an oracle of Britain's destiny, a perception that spilled over into front-page headlines from the overwhelmingly skeptical press. ''There ain't nothin' like a Dane,'' The Sun proclaimed. **********Others drew broader conclusions. **********''We are not now isolated,'' said Michael Portillo, a leading financial spokesman for the opposition Conservatives, who want no talk of a referendum for at least five or six years. ''Other people in Europe have taken the same view.'' **********As government officials and others point out, many differences, political and economic, separate Britain and Denmark. In Denmark, the press, business and political powers all favored a yes vote. In Britain, business leaders and politicians are deeply divided, and the mass readership newspapers oppose the euro. **********Denmark's small economy, moreover, has been a de facto extension of the euro zone, and its predecessor, the Deutsche mark zone, for years. By contrast, most British economic indicators, from interest rates to unemployment, show a marked divergence from continental Europe, and there are much broader economic implications for Britain's economy than there were in Denmark's case. **********Britain's ability to persuade foreign companies to invest here as a springboard for continental Europe, the government argues, is closely linked to its prospects of joining the euro. And well over half of Britain's trade is with the European Union. **********''Those are critical, crucial questions that will weigh with the British people, who will make the decision what is right for Britain, not what is right for Denmark,'' Mr. Cook said. **********But the lesson from Copenhagen was that those will not be the most telling arguments, said people like Mark Miller, an economist with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ''Britain might do well to learn from the Danish experience and leave economics, or at least detailed economics, out of the debate,'' Mr. Miller said. **********Rather, some people say, the issue will be decided on questions of sovereignty and national interest. The Danish vote, Mr. Greetham said, ''was a pure test of the political will to become part of the Franco-German vision of a large superstate.'' **********For Mr. Blair, Denmark's rejection adds one more woe after bruising protests against high fuel prices and other setbacks that have stripped his aura of invincibility. **********Mr. Blair insists that Britain's membership of the euro will be determined in a two-phase approach. First, the government will decide whether the euro's performance meets various economic criteria beneficial to Britain. If it does, a referendum will be held four months later to put the same question to Britons that the Danes answered on Thursday. **********The government has long insisted that the entire process will not begin until after a general election that is widely forecast for May, resisting Conservative efforts to make the euro the central issue of a populist campaign that plays on hostility to the euro. **********The Danish vote has, however, confronted the government with a new problem. If the government seeks to swing opinion toward the euro with a high-profile campaign, it could allow the Conservatives to turn the election into a perilous referendum on the euro. Yet, if Mr. Blair remains low key on the euro, hostility, particularly after the Danish vote, could deepen. ''Britain should be in,'' a Financial Times editorial said today. ''But the Danish 'no' vote suggests that without a vigorous and imaginative campaign, the euroskeptics may win by default. Mr. Blair cannot afford to dally.'' **********An upshot of those factors is that Britain's referendum is quite likely to be further delayed, as the government awaits as the moment to pronounce whether the single currency has met its criteria for British membership. In practical terms, Britain might take only the first definitive step toward joining the euro in 2004, at the earliest, Mr. Miller said. ''And the likely time horizon is even further out than that.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/19/business/management-mondavi-s-battle-royal.html": {"writer_name": "Vivienne Walt", "pub_date": "2000-07-19", "snippet": "David Pearson, top executive in France for Robert Mondavi Corp of California, is facing most adventuresome mangement hurdle of his career by trying to win over opponents of plan to buy forested hillside above village of Aniane France, and start a ...", "word_count": 1558, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mondavi's Battle Royal", "print_headline": "MANAGEMENT; Mondavi's Battle Royal", "body_text": " **********The United States is famous for its corporate marketing. Think Coke and McDonald's. France is famous for its fine wines. Think Chateau Lafite and Chateau Latour. **********Imagine, then, an American juggernaut like the Robert Mondavi Corporation wandering into a French village like this one that prides itself on its centuries-old vineyards. Mondavi, the big wine company from Napa Valley, Calif., announces its plans to rip down a swath of publicly owned forest to create its own top-of-the-line vines, thereby adding panache to its well-known brand name. **********In an area where distrust of pervasive American culture has been on the boil of late, the intrusion was bound to light a fire among some locals. In fact, it has brought on the most adventuresome management hurdle yet in the career of David Pearson, Mondavi's top executive in France. **********Mr. Pearson, 38, an oenologist from San Diego who is fluent in French, spent a year in the mid-1980's working with traditional winemakers in France. So, he could be forgiven for thinking his task would be straightforward when he was dispatched from Mondavi's California headquarters in early 1998 with the task of finding a good location, acquiring it and starting a new vineyard. **********The search for the right spot took two years. That, as it turned out, was the easy part. **********In May, Mr. Pearson announced to local reporters that Mondavi wanted to lease a forested hillside above this village 15 miles northeast of the Mediterranean city of Montpellier and create France's first foreign-owned vin de terroire, the designation for a wine unique to a French region. **********He expected Aniane's 2,120 inhabitants to cheer. After all, Mondavi would be pumping $8 million into the local economy the next 10 years. **********Instead, some squawked -- loudly. They protested the destruction of acres of their forest, where they have hunted wild boar for hundreds of years. More than that, they feared that the arrival of a multinational operation would lead to a lowering of standards. **********Mr. Pearson, the chief executive of Vichon S.A.R.L., Mondavi's French unit, repeatedly assured the villagers that the company would cherish the region's old growing methods. He noted that Mondavi would be selling the wine it produced there in the United States, not France. He inundated the town with documents and statistics. **********Even so, after three months of negotiations with local officials, he has yet to sign a deal. **********''I've said to myself, this could turn out to be a kind of Elian Gonzalez -- the bigger political issues around the project could complicate a pretty simple matter,'' Mr. Pearson said. ''There are raw nerves out there that our opponents have used.'' **********One of the most outspoken of those foes is Aime Guibert, 75, the owner of the Daumas Gassac vineyard that produces one of the finest wines in Languedoc, the region in which Aniane sits. Mr. Guibert is not one to hide his emotions. When the hugely popular farm leader Jose Bove went on trial in June for attacking a half-built McDonald's restaurant north of here, Mr. Guibert showed up to speak at a mass rally in support of Mr. Bove. Unfortunately for Mr. Pearson, Mr. Guibert's property abuts the forests Mondavi wants to buy, and he is in no mood to welcome new neighbors. **********''Mondavi will never have a minute's rest and peace if he destroys the forest,'' Mr. Guibert said, sweeping his arm in the direction of the hills outside his old stone farmhouse. ''Robert Mondavi comes from an industrial wine civilization, not a traditional civilization. I wrote to him and said, 'Robert, don't be mad, don't do something against the village!' '' **********Allied with Mr. Guibert is Marcel Pouget, a metal-factory owner, who runs Aniane's hunting association and has spent his free time tacking posters to the village street poles, reading: ''Non a Mondavi.'' Mr. Pouget, who hunts boar in the hills that Mondavi covets, formed a committee in May to block the company's venture and vowed to take the case to court if necessary. **********''If Mondavi wins, it will be the death of wines in Aniane,'' Mr. Pouget fumed over a morning glass of pastis in his garden in Aniane. ''We have little chateaux here. Within a few years, Mondavi will be buying up land in other parts.'' **********Mondavi's critics also fear that the company will use the Aniane vineyard to start a far bigger onslaught on the region's wine industry. ''They are coming in saying they're making a high-class wine,'' said Mark Lintott, a British book editor who lives in Octon, near Aniane. He questions the $8 million Mondavi is prepared to spend. ''The figure sounds like a big industrial winery,'' Mr. Lintott said. ''The figure is hiding something. It's out of all proportion.'' **********Mr. Lintott is active in a local environmental group that has spoken out against Mondavi and that is also fighting a bid by another American concern, the Panoz Auto Development Company in Hoschton, Ga., to take over a section of protected public land around a lake north of Aniane to build a resort hotel complete with golf course and auto race track. **********France has long resisted economic and cultural incursions by foreigners, particularly Americans. But in the global economy, the quest for national purity is becoming an uphill battle. After all, French interests own several vineyards in Northern California. Taittinger has its own little piece of heaven smack in the middle of Napa Valley. **********For many people here, though, Mondavi's plans seem to threaten a precious tradition: the age-old cultivation of small-scale wines, ''one of the crown jewels of France,'' as Mr. Pearson calls them. **********Mondavi is not about to halt its plans to please the traditionalists of Aniane, however. Having gone public in 1993, it has grown into an international player with more than $370 million in revenue last year. It has vineyards in Italy and Chile and sells its wines in more than 80 countries. In June, with a black-tie dinner in California for hundreds of clients and a charity auction in Manhattan, it celebrated the 20th anniversary of Opus One, its joint California operation with Baron Philippe de Rothschild, who died in 1988. **********Besides, Mondavi is arguably the most skillful global marketer in the business. And what would an adroit global wine company be without a vineyard in France? **********Mr. Pearson says the company was driven to start a vineyard in Languedoc in part because the area's winemakers are moving away from mass-produced, low-quality wine to classy labels created on small farms. Unlike the fine old wine areas of Burgundy and Bordeaux, the area seems almost up for grabs. ''The whole issue of developing a region in France is a huge attraction of itself for the Mondavi family,'' he said. ''It's not based on short-term returns. It's a passion for winemaking. It tends to be contagious.'' **********When he arrived in France two years ago, Mr. Pearson began discreetly driving around Languedoc, scouting for land. His dream was to start a classic domaine, a farm that would produce a small quantity of top-end wine. **********Since Languedoc winemakers were producing their best wine in many decades, however, no high-quality vineyards were for sale. Then, in May 1999, Mr. Pearson turned off the national highway and drove into the hills outside Aniane. ''I knew immediately this was the spot,'' he said. **********He still believes the project will pan out. The town council is planning to vote on the project on July 25. Meanwhile, Mr. Pearson brushes aside the main objection of opponents, that the project will destroy 500 acres of woods, saying the Aniane authorities will ultimately permit the creation of only about 125 acres of vineyards. Mr. Pearson expects to produce about 240,000 bottles of wine by 2010 to sell in American stores for about $60 a bottle. **********He drives his visitor up into the middle of the forest and climbs atop a water tank to soak in the panoramic view. From this perch, he sketches in the air the 10 ''islands'' of vines, each of which will cover about 12 acres. The rest of the land, he insists, will be left undisturbed. ''This place is wild country, that's its magic,'' he declares. ''Why would we want to change it?'' **********Mr. Pearson even hired local ecologists to do an environmental impact study, which concluded that the company's vines might improve the forest's biodiversity. **********In any case, Mr. Pearson says, his detractors are a bothersome minority. Indeed, he has powerful backers, including Andre Ruiz, the mayor of Aniane, who believes Mondavi's presence will bring the village winemakers the kind of international recognition they could sorely use. **********''They know very well it will be easier to sell Aniane wines in the global markets,'' Mr. Ruiz said. Since the forest is public land, he notes, Mondavi will not actually own it but will take a 99-year lease on it. **********Even if Mr. Pearson can cut a deal with the town fathers, though, his ordeal will not be over. Next, Mondavi will have to gain ''planting rights,'' a process akin to getting one's hands on a New York City taxi medallion. Under European laws that restrict wine production, planting new vines requires buying an equal number of someone else's vines -- perhaps disused ones -- and ripping them out of the ground, freeing up those planting rights. **********''Two years ago, I didn't understand the complexities of what was going on,'' Mr. Pearson said of all the hurdles he had faced. ''Now I understand that this is all very, very complicated.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/02/world/at-a-crucial-juncture-iraqi-officials-cut-off-oil-exports.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara With", "pub_date": "2000-12-02", "snippet": "Iraq abruptly stops exporting oil to protest United Nations sanctions; Iraq provides 4 percent of world consumption, but oil markets are calm in response to shutdown; some market experts say Saddam Hussein might achieve significant effects; Iraqis...", "word_count": 1203, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "At a Crucial Juncture, Iraqi Officials Cut Off Oil Exports", "print_headline": "At a Crucial Juncture, Iraqi Officials Cut Off Oil Exports", "body_text": " **********Picking an opportune moment, Iraq has abruptly stopped exporting oil, officials here said today. **********It is not the first time this year that Iraq has disrupted its oil supply, which provides 4 percent of world consumption, to protest United Nations sanctions. Oil markets were calm in response to the shutdown, which took place late Thursday; the price of crude oil fell $1.80 a barrel in New York, to $32.02. **********Still, some market experts said Saddam Hussein might achieve significant effects. ''Whatever leverage he has is maximized now,'' said Lawrence J. Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York. ''Saddam Hussein has been pushing, and the world has been giving way on sanctions.'' **********The Iraqis are testing the resolve of the United States and the Security Council just before an important series of debates on Iraq begins next week, diplomats said, and soon after failing to divert some oil revenues to accounts not controlled by the United Nations. **********Baghdad is acting while Americans are preoccupied by the dispute over the presidential election. Some American diplomats said Iraq would make a mistake if it tried to take advantage of the situation. **********''If anybody has the impression that the administration isn't paying attention or is losing interest in this complex of issues, they're quite wrong,'' said James B. Cunningham, deputy American representative at the United Nations, who works on Iraq in the Security Council. **********Iraq is pressing ahead to loosen the straitjacket that it has been in for the 10 years since it invaded Kuwait. A resurfacing of divisions among Security Council members and the high oil prices are giving Mr. Hussein an opportunity he has seized. **********Iraq has more or less succeeded in opening the skies over Baghdad to renewed air traffic after a disputed but nonetheless observed 10-year ban, and after weeks of discussion, Council members cannot agree how to regulate flights. On Thursday, a plane carrying paying passengers flew from Jordan to Baghdad. **********Baghdad also prevailed in its drive to cut the percentage of oil profits, to 25 from 30, that is paid to a fund to compensate victims of the Kuwait invasion, though there is a dispute over how to spend the savings. **********Iraq has been cultivating friends around the Middle East and among developing nations, prominently offering help to Palestinians involved in the new violence in Israel. Iraq has been signing trade agreements, entertaining heads of state like President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and sending high-level officials abroad. **********Council members most sympathetic to Iraq, particularly China, France and Russia, are renewing efforts to reopen a discussion on a new system to inspect arms put forward a year ago that the Iraqis have repeatedly rejected. **********The Council resolution to set up the system considerably broadened the range of purchases Iraq could make without Security Council approval and held out the hope of a suspension of sanctions if the Iraqis cooperated. But Iraq insists that the sanctions end before it lets inspectors return. **********Backed by France and Russia, Iraq wants to know exactly at what point sanctions would be suspended if it decided to accept the new plan. Baghdad also wants less United Nations control over money, the issue that led to stopping the oil exports. **********Efforts to adapt the inspection plan in ways that could hasten Iraqi cooperation may run into problems with the man in charge of running the inspections. Hans Blix, the Swedish lawyer and arms control expert who is executive chairman of the new inspection body, has repeatedly said that he cannot talk about timetables and lists of important Iraqi tasks until he can put inspectors back on the ground to study what has changed in the two years since the last United Nations inspections. Independent arms experts say Iraq should be given a list of what is required, because that would let them do the minimal accounting of biological, chemical, nuclear and missile programs. **********Dr. Blix met his commissioners this week and reported to the Council today that he had 72 inspectors and other experts ready to work in Iraq. **********Russia, the nation closest to Iraq, will hold the Council presidency this month, and diplomats said that gave the Russians advantages in setting the agenda. **********Iraq also appears to be trying to rekindle interest in Secretary General Kofi Annan's office for more direct contacts between Mr. Annan and Mr. Hussein or his closest aides. **********This week in Moscow, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz repeated Iraq's public rejection of the new system. But he pointedly added that an Iraqi delegation due to visit New York in January would hold talks with the secretary general on how to improve ties with the United Nations.  That revives an Iraqi tactic of trying to circumvent the Security Council by dealing directly with Mr. Annan. **********Two previous chief arms inspectors, Rolf Ekeus and his successor, Richard Butler, warn against letting the Iraqis bypass inspectors and the Council in the hope of obtaining a better deal from Secretariat officials. It has been two years since any arms inspections in Iraq, except for a routine check by the International Atomic Energy Agency. **********In recent weeks, Iraq has been focused most intently on oil sales and how to turn the market to its advantage. The Iraqis have said they will open a pipeline to Syria and have not asked for permission to do so. Two export points are allowed now, in Turkey and at the Persian Gulf. Oil leaves Iraq unsupervised over land to Jordan and Turkey. The Security Council has not tried to stop that flow. **********Last month, Iraq was given the right to deal in euros, not dollars, when it sells oil. Baghdad moved to add the equivalent of a 50-cent surcharge to its price, to be deposited in bank accounts not controlled by the United Nations. Oil buyers have refused, and the United Nations has objected to a price cut that could hide the special payment. With the standoff, United Nations officials said, the pipelines dried up on Thursday night. **********Today, Mr. Annan sent a report to the Security Council that showed significant advances in the health and living conditions of Iraqis, who are supposed to benefit from the oil sales, though the report found much suffering. **********Several times in recent months, Iraq has slashed its exports for short periods, willing to give up some income in a strong market. ''We've been down this road before,'' said John Kilduff, senior vice president at Fimat, the commodities trading arm of Societe Generale. **********In the oil marketplace, prices remain strong. Inventories of heating oil are tight ahead of the winter. And few exporting nations have much capacity to replace the Iraqi oil. If Iraq continues to shut down its output, that could affect prices. ''The window of opportunity for him is 60 to 90 days,'' Mr. Goldstein said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/16/business/world-business-briefing-europe-british-stores-to-close.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "2000-06-16", "snippet": "C&A, privately held Dutch clothing retailer, is pulling out of Britain after 78 years, closing all 113 stores and cutting 4,800 jobs because of slumping profit and sales; its British business posted total losses of 250 million pounds ($377 million...", "word_count": 62, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRITISH STORES TO CLOSE", "print_headline": "WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: EUROPE; BRITISH STORES TO CLOSE", "body_text": " **********A privately held Dutch clothing retailer, C&A, said it was pulling out of Britain after 78 years, closing all 113 stores and cutting 4,800 jobs because of slumping profit and sales.

Having reached an agreement to acquire two wireless carriers in the United States and having spent billions to acquire licenses for ''third generation'' wireless networks in Germany and Britain, Mr. Sommer said that building a pan-European wireless network ranked only fourth on his list of priorities. **********The shift in emphasis appears to reflect the widespread anxiety among investors that European phone companies are spending too much to build advanced mobile and data networks. Shares of Deutsche Telekom have lost nearly two-thirds of their value in the last seven months. **********Much of that decline stems from concern about the steep prices that Deutsche Telekom and other European companies are paying for new wireless licenses and about the billions more they will have to invest in building networks. Now the pendulum is reversing, with companies pulling out of auctions for licenses in Italy, France and Switzerland. **********Earlier this month, Deutsche Telekom surprised its European rivals by abruptly dropping out of the race to acquire a new wireless license in France. That followed a decision last summer to drop out of the auction for similar licenses in Italy, one of Europe's biggest and fastest-growing mobile markets. When the Italian auction took place in October, the total bidding stopped at $10.5 billion, less than half what the Italian government had expected. **********In outlining his priorities today, Mr. Sommer pointedly played down his interest in expanding across Western Europe. His top priority ''by far,'' he told analysts in the conference call, is to complete the $50.7 billion acquisition of Voicestream Communications and the related $5.8 billion purchase of Powertel, two American wireless companies. Though the companies have reached an agreement, Deutsche Telekom must overcome political objections in the United States, where opponents of the deal in Congress complain about the German government's still being Telekom's controlling shareholder. **********Mr. Sommer said another top priority was to expand the home market, Germany, where the number of mobile customers has soared. In the last year, the percentage of German households with a mobile phone has jumped from 29 percent to nearly 60 percent. Mr. Sommer said his third priority was building up operations in Central Europe, where Telekom has already acquired companies in most countries. **********It was only after those priorities that Mr. Sommer listed his interest in being a broader player in Western Europe. He justified his refusal to seek licenses in either Italy or France by saying the company would have overpaid for access to countries in which it had no existing customer base and would have been weaker than its rivals. **********Deutsche Telekom reported today that its net income for the first nine months surged to 8.4 billion ($7.2 billion) from 1.25 billion euros, while sales climbed 15 percent, to 29.3 billion euros ($25.14 billion). **********But almost all of the profit came from one-time gains from the sale of asset stakes in its German cable networks; its stake in Global One, which provides worldwide networking services for corporate customers; its stake in Wind, an Italian wireless carrier; and its flotation of shares in T-Online, its Internet subsidiary, in April. **********And even though Telekom's mobile business has soared, it actually lost 1.3 billion euros in the first nine months and warned that margins would probably be pinched in the last quarter as a result of a surge in new holiday-season customers. New customers put a strain on profit margins, because when they sign up for service, they usually buy telephones at heavily subsidized prices. **********Several analysts said they were not fundamentally concerned by Telekom's warning, arguing that margins will expand again next year. In terms of cash flow, or earnings before taxes, interest and depreciation, the mobile business generated a reasonably healthy margin of 22 percent. **********Several analysts said Telekom's results were slightly better than they had expected. But investors, who have turned extremely sour on the telecommunications market, were less impressed. Deutsche Telekom shares dropped about 4 percent today, to 36.8 euros ($31.59)."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/29/technology/nyt-article.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-07-29", "snippet": "Hong Kong Internet Portal Tom.com Lays Off 80", "word_count": 606, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NYT Article", "print_headline": "NYT Article", "body_text": " **********Hong Kong Internet Portal Tom.com Lays Off 80 **********July 29, 2000 **********Hong Kong Internet Portal Tom.com Lays Off 80 By REUTERS ONG KONG, July 28 -- Tom.com Ltd, an Internet portal firm whose initial public offering generated such excitement in February it nearly triggered riots, on Friday confirmed it fired 80 Hong Kong-based employees to boost the company's competitiveness. **********The move was the latest of a string of lay-offs made by local Internet firms after the sector's aggressive expansion earlier, and came hot on the heels of City Telecom (HK) Ltd's Thursday decision to cut 200 jobs at its broadband Internet arm. **********Sing Wang, Tom.com's new chief executive officer, told a news conference the layoff was part of a decision to refocus the company's resources from Hong Kong to mainland China, a much bigger market with significantly lower costs. **********\"Tom.com believes this will position the company as the most competitive in the industry,\" Wang said. **********The company had a total of about 500 staff in Hong Kong and China before the layoff, with 60 percent in the former British colony.

MORE LIKELY TO AUDIT THE POOR AND NOT THE RICH", "body_text": " **********Last year, for the first time, the poor were more likely than the rich to have their tax returns audited, new Internal Revenue Service data compiled by Syracuse University researchers shows. **********The I.R.S. audited 1.36 percent of all tax returns filed by people making less than $25,000 last year, compared with 1.15 percent of returns filed by those making $100,000 or more. Since 1988, audit rates for the poor have increased by a third, from 1.03 percent, while falling 90 percent for the wealthiest Americans, from 11.4 percent. **********The need to audit the highest income taxpayers is somewhat less today than in 1988, I.R.S. officials say, because more of these individuals are wage earners whose pay is fully reported by employers and because Congress has eliminated some of the deductions most likely to be abused. **********But there has been no reason to reduce audits of corporations and the self-employed, which fell to record low levels last year because Congress did not authorize funds to keep up with the increased number of such taxpayers. These taxpayers received less scrutiny even though the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, said in 1997 that they are more likely than the working poor to pay less in taxes than they owe. **********The focus of I.R.S. audits on the bottom of the income ladder extended to businesses as well. **********In 1999, unincorporated businesses with less than $25,000 in sales, classified by the I.R.S. as Schedule C enterprises, were more likely to be audited than larger unincorporated businesses. The I.R.S. audited 2.7 percent of the tiny ventures, more than double the 1.3 percent rate for those with $25,000 to $100,000 in sales and more than the 2.4 percent rate for those with more than $100,000 in sales. **********The intensified focus on low-income taxpayers resulted from pressure on the I.R.S. beginning in 1995. Newt Gingrich, who was then House speaker, and other Republican Congressional leaders were concerned about misuse of the earned income tax credit, a program that allows the working poor, especially those with children, to receive money from the government through a form of negative income tax. They proposed to sharply reduce the credit, prompting President Clinton to counter with a plan to bolster audits to reduce fraud and mistakes. **********The I.R.S. was also far less likely to take action last year against those who did not pay their income taxes, the new data shows. Levies on paychecks and bank accounts were down 85 percent from 1997, and liens to secure the government's interest were down 69 percent. **********Seizures of property to pay back taxes, the most severe enforcement action, were down 98 percent, to 161, from about 10,000 annually the previous 10 years. Auditors recommended $4.5 billion in taxes and penalties last year, down from $6.3 billion in 1993. **********Much of the decline in enforcement is because of shrinking staff and complex new rules enacted by Congress in the I.R.S. Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998. Seizing property, for example, now requires a 54-step process that more than two dozen revenue officers have described as virtually impossible to navigate. And the permanent I.R.S. staff is the same size now as in 1983, even though the total number of tax returns has increased one-third and the number of complex returns by high-income individuals has grown even more. **********Over all, one of every 66 corporations of all sizes was audited, a level of scrutiny significantly lower than the one in 37 audit rate for Schedule C businesses with less than $25,000 of revenue. Among the largest corporations, those with more than $250 million of assets, the audit rate was 34.5 percent last year, down from 54.6 percent in 1992. **********These findings emerge from an exhaustive compilation of tax data posted on the Internet by the Syracuse researchers. The data, covering I.R.S. audit and enforcement actions through last Sept. 30, the end of the government's 1999 fiscal year, was provided to the university's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse by the I.R.S. **********Charles O. Rossotti, the commissioner of internal revenue, said that overall audit rates had fallen so far that he feared the tax system could not bear any more cuts. **********Last week, asking a House subcommittee to support a 9 percent increase in his budget, Mr. Rossotti said that ''we're really risking the entire tax system'' by continually slashing audit rates. **********In an interview, Mr. Rossotti said: ''I am not going to make the claim that at this moment the system is threatened because I don't know at what point it is threatened by falling audit rates. But longer term, the threat is there if a belief begins to develop that, 'Hey, I am paying my taxes but the guy next door or the business across the street isn't, and the I.R.S. is not, or cannot, do anything about it.' '' **********Mr. Rossotti said that the only reason audit rates for the working poor had risen while the rates for wealthier taxpayers had declined was a mandate from the White House and Congress for close monitoring of the earned income credit. **********A couple without children can use the credit to eliminate all income tax liability and get back an additional $347, but working parents can wipe out their liability and collect as much as $3,816 more. Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who heads the House Ways and Means Committee, said studies had showed that more than 20 percent of returns claiming the credit had misused it. **********But John Karl Scholz, a University of Wisconsin economist who studied the earned income credit in 1995 when he was a Clinton administration tax policy adviser, said that while fraud was a continuing problem, most of the issues uncovered in audits tended to be disputes over who got the credit when a couple with children had separated or divorced. Mr. Rossotti expressed the same view in an interview. **********Mr. Scholz said that ''if you consider the amount of noncompliant behavior uncovered for a dollar of I.R.S. enforcement resources, the amount of attention being given to the earned income tax credit is much too large.'' **********Excluding the special audits of the working poor and people who fail to file a tax return, the audit rate for those making less than $25,000 would fall from 1 in 74 to 1 in 300. For businesses with sales under $25,000 the rate would fall from one in 37 to one in 588. **********Mr. Rossotti said, ''The issue of whether you are more likely to be audited if you make less than $25,000 than if you make more than $100,000 is totally distorted by the presence of the special earned income tax credit program.'' **********Senator William V. Roth Jr., the Delaware Republican who heads the Senate Finance Committee and who was the sponsor of the restructuring act, said he was troubled by many of these statistics. ''The tax laws must be applied with integrity and fairness,'' he said, adding that ''I am hopeful that with adequate resources, better training, the leadership of Charles Rossotti and continuous modernization of the agency, the I.R.S. will improve.'' **********Mr. Archer, the chief tax writer in the House, said he had found no flaw in the I.R.S. audit priorities and criticized the Syracuse researchers. **********''This entire analysis is terribly misleading and cynical,'' Mr. Archer said in a statement. ''Ninety-seven percent of all the so-called 'audits' relating to the earned income credit are correspondence audits, which is a relatively simple matter of mailing additional information to the I.R.S.'' **********For now, though, the I.R.S. is scrutinizing the earned income credit with such wariness that it is sometimes denying the credit to people who are legitimately owed it on nothing more than suspicion, according to several low-income taxpayer clinics run by law schools. **********Last week in Los Angeles, a tax court judge heard the case of Maritza Reyes, a cleaning woman who earns $7,000 annually and who was denied the credit after an audit. She had separated from her husband, and each had taken one child and applied for the earned income tax credit. The I.R.S. rejected Ms. Reyes's application for the credit but at trial produced no evidence to support its position that she and her husband had not actually separated. A ruling is expected in three months. **********Professor Frank J. Doti of the Chapman University law school in Orange, Calif., who with Pallavi Shah, a law student, represented Ms. Reyes, said that many low-income people audited by the I.R.S. wound up in worse straits than did Ms. Reyes. Few have access to low-income legal clinics, and they give up when they are wrongly denied the credit. Then their cases are added to the statistics on fraud and errors on which Congress relied when it financed the increased audits of the working poor. **********''There is fraud in this program, but the handling of this case is bizarre,'' Professor Doti said, adding that the situation was not unique. The I.R.S. declined to comment on the Reyes case, as it does in all cases involving individual taxpayers. ''Our policy is to rely on the facts and the law in determining eligibility,'' said Frank Keith, an I.R.S. spokesman. **********To identify tax cheating by high-income taxpayers and those with complex returns the I.R.S. relies on face-to-face audits by highly trained revenue agents. The number of such audits fell sharply again last year. **********In 1981, the earliest year for which data is available, one in 63 tax returns received such an audit, but last year only one in 322 did, down from one in 217 in 1998. This decline partly reflects the shrunken I.R.S. audit staff, which has less time to examine complex returns. **********But a second factor, perhaps more significant, is also at work, said David B. Burnham, who with Professor Susan Long is co-director of the Syracuse research organization. The I.R.S. relies on data at least 11 years old to select returns for audits based on patterns of income and deductions, Mr. Burnham said. **********Changes in the economy, including companies offering more stock options in lieu of cash compensation and taxpayers deducting interest on home equity loans and margin debt, make much of this data useless for identifying cheating. **********But since 1995 Congress has barred new studies to measure taxpayer compliance by the I.R.S. **********The Syracuse University Web site, trac.syr.edu, also lists data from the Administrative Office of the United States Courts that shows that criminal prosecutions for tax crimes, long a minor government activity, continue to decline. Last year, there were just 722 such prosecutions in the nation, half the figure in 1981, when there were one-third fewer taxpayers. **********The I.R.S. data also showed an area of increased activity that may foreshadow the government's ability to collect taxes in the years ahead.  The number of cases opened on people who have stopped filing returns has soared. In 1997, the I.R.S. initiated 822,898 taxpayer delinquency investigations.

Then the dancers in psychedelic body paint, the New Age pianist, the opera singer in a white fur stole who descended on a construction crane and three men in gas masks who banged on garbage cans to disco music. White smoke billowed. Finally, the lights went up to reveal the Boys Choir of Harlem, singing spirituals. **********This sumptuous show last fall at the Hammerstein Ballroom in Manhattan represented the avant-garde not of theater but of Internet hype. It introduced a new home page and ad campaign by AltaVista, the search engine, to about 100 journalists and Wall Street analysts, and laid the groundwork for an initial public offering. AltaVista -- prompted by its new owner, CMGI, one of the most successful incubators of Internet companies -- promised to take on Yahoo with ''a portal as powerful and immediate as life itself.'' **********To do so, it would spend $120 million on a new slogan, ''Smart is beautiful.'' **********These days, that strategy does not look very smart, and the prospects for the CMGI empire are not very beautiful. **********Hopes for AltaVista's offering were dashed by the tumble in Internet stocks last spring. CMGI is closing other units, laying off employees and facing tough questions about the viability of the business behind the flashing lights and new-economy rhetoric. **********In recent weeks, an increasing number of investors, analysts and even CMGI executives have wondered aloud whether David S. Wetherell, CMGI's chairman, founder and driving force, was too emboldened by his early success -- largely investments in some pioneering Internet companies that earned stratospheric returns. Now that the market will not let him profit by taking companies public, these skeptics are asking whether CMGI has the vision, strategy and management skill to make its sprawling portfolio worth even the sum of its parts. **********''CMGI was the ultimate bull market creation,'' said Gene DeRose, president of Jupiter Media Metrix, the research company. CMGI, he said, claimed credit for what was just extraordinary good luck. ''It epitomizes strategy in hindsight,'' he added, ''rather than a disciplined process for incubating and managing companies.'' **********Mr. Wetherell, 46, says the company is taking the steps that are needed to thrive in tough times. ''Our foundation is solid and mission is clear,'' he wrote by e-mail. ''After five years of hypergrowth, we, like the market over all, are taking a step back -- planning the coming steps and phases that can and will maximize growth and enhance investor support.'' **********A year ago, CMGI was the model incubator, a new corporate creature somewhere between a conglomerate and a venture capital fund. It started some companies, invested in others and kept operating control of many, hoping to take all of them public. Mr. Wetherell was hailed as the ''Warren Buffett of the Web,'' by The Daily News of New York, and CMGI ended 1999 with a market value of $41 billion. It was the best-performing United States stock of the preceding five years, returning 4,921 percent. **********In its fiscal year ended July 2000, CMGI lost $1.4 billion on revenue of $898 million. **********Today, CMGI's main companies, like Alta Vista and Engage Technologies, an Internet advertising business, are scaling back. The chief executives of both of those companies resigned recently. Smaller companies are being sold or merged. And CMGI's shares are off 91 percent this year, to a value of about $3.8 billion, closing on Friday at $11.94. **********''A year and a half ago, people were saying this was the best business model ever,'' said Vik Mehta, an analyst at Goldman Sachs. ''Now the financial markets are telling them they will go out of business.'' **********Mr. Wetherell, whose 11.2 percent stake in CMGI is now worth just $430 million, still has defenders. They say he is a tough executive with an eye for financial detail, but he also understood that the early days of the Internet demanded growth, not profits. **********''Most people thought he came by all this by accident, but he is a guy who has been very thoughtful and very strategic early on,'' said David Bohnett, co-founder and former chairman of Geocities, the online community that was one of CMGI's greatest successes. ''You can't blame him for taking advantage of the opportunities in a bull market.'' **********Mr. Wetherell declined to be interviewed for this article, choosing instead to answer some questions by e-mail. And he ordered many CMGI directors and executives not to respond to interview requests. But more than 20 current or former directors and executives, all of whom insisted on anonymity, were willing to discuss CMGI and Mr. Wetherell. Several former employees also took the risk of speaking, despite the confidentiality provisions that CMGI regularly writes into its severance agreements; they, too, requested anonymity. **********From those interviews, a new picture emerges -- not so much of a company working from a visionary blueprint but of one in which decisions on everything from hiring to strategy are made on the spur of the moment -- and reversed just as fast. Many moves were made largely to generate optimistic news releases, helping the stock to surge, the executives said. **********Some companies were started on a whim, and when they failed to fulfill Mr. Wetherell's grand hopes, they were transformed, renamed or merged. Of CMGI's 15 majority-owned companies at the beginning of the year, four were merged into other CMGI entities and two were closed. Of 40 companies in its venture capital portfolio, five were closed and four were sold. **********Indeed, even as incubators have been promoted as a way to merge small-company entrepreneurialism with big-company resources, it is not clear that having CMGI as a parent is worth the trouble. The effort to encourage intra-company deals results as often in unpleasant compromises as it does in powerful synergy, executives said. And the oversight from CMGI headquarters in Andover, Mass., has limited value, they added, because Mr. Wetherell seldom hires experienced managers. Most of the few large-company veterans who signed on, like Neil Braun, the former president of NBC Television, and Jeff Cunningham, the former publisher of Forbes, left within months. **********''CMGI is one of those great transitional companies that is not meant to last,'' one former top CMGI executive said. ''They were meant to aggregate all the buzz of the new economy. They are not a General Motors but a Tucker'' -- a reference to the failed upstart auto company memorialized in Francis Ford Coppola's 1988 film. **********Mr. Wetherell contends that CMGI is far more than a dream. **********''I try to use technology to solve tough problems that have broad market appeal,'' he wrote. ''This provides high barriers to entry, providing there is a first-mover advantage and proper leverage from other CMGI companies. When all of these elements exist, we have a formula for success.'' **********The Beginnings **********From Mailing Lists To the Internet **********In its short history, CMGI achieved astounding returns by staying one step ahead of the Internet explosion. **********In 1994, CMG Information Services was a tiny company that sold mailing lists of college professors to textbook publishers. Mr. Wetherell, who started out in computer programming, acquired the company in a leveraged buyout in 1986. In trying to sell books online in 1993, it developed what became one of the first Web browsers, Booklink, which it sold a year later to  America Online for stock it later sold for $70 million. **********With that windfall, Mr. Wetherell began investing in other Internet companies. In its most significant move, Dan Nova, the only CMGI employee with venture capital experience, bought a search technology from Carnegie Mellon University for CMGI that became the basis for Lycos, now the Web's fourth-biggest site. **********Mr. Wetherell also invested in Geocities, which enabled people to build home pages about their interests. He sold it to Yahoo in 1999 for $3.6 billion. But early on, he wanted to be more than an investor. So he started a series of companies that CMGI incubated, most based on the premise that the Web created the ideal environment to merge advertising and direct marketing. Engage, for example, was started in 1995 as a network of sites that would keep track of the topics that interested users, though not of who they were. A Web-surfing soccer mom would then see banner ads for minivans, while an aging stockbroker would see sports-car pitches. **********As his investments expanded, the potential grew for CMGI's companies to cooperate with one another. **********But it was just as likely for them to compete, and conflicts arose quickly. Mr. Wetherell announced, for example, that Geocities would contribute information about its users to Engage's data base, but Geocities spurned his pressure to do so. And he started Planet Direct, which offered a comprehensive Web portal -- seemingly a direct rival of both Lycos and Geocities, though it sought partnerships with each. Many executives at CMGI's Web site service companies complain that they were subjected to extraordinary pressure to do unattractive deals with corporate cousins. **********Mr. Wetherell wrote that CMGI's policy was that companies deal with one another at arm's length. **********The conflicts rose to a grand scale in January 1999, when Yahoo made an unsolicited bid for Geocities. Mr. Wetherell tried to orchestrate a combination with Lycos instead, but when he could not reach an accord with Robert Davis, Lycos's strong-willed chief executive, he backed the Yahoo bid. **********''It was like a food fight,'' one bemused Geocities board member said. ''Bob wanted to do what was good for Lycos, and Dave wanted to do what was good for CMGI.'' **********Indeed, several Geocities directors said Mr. Wetherell notably did not recuse himself from voting on the merger transactions, despite the seeming conflict of his serving on Lycos's board. **********Mr. Wetherell says he offered to recuse himself but the board did not ask him to; his pressure, he added, encouraged Geocities management to conclude the deal with Yahoo rather than accept a lower bid from another company. **********These issues burst into public view the next month, when Lycos agreed to merge with the Home Shopping Network and other properties controlled by USA Networks. At a board meeting, one member recalled, Mr. Wetherell not only voted for the USA deal, but also stood up and applauded when it was approved. **********Two days later, after Lycos's shares plunged 31 percent, Mr. Wetherell voiced public doubts about the merger; he soon resigned from Lycos's board and fought successfully to have the deal aborted. **********To the public, it was a curious display of indecision, but to those who knew Mr. Wetherell, it was a reflection of impulsiveness. ''Dave was a big believer in riding the wave,'' said a former chief executive of a CMGI company. ''If auctions became hot, he would demand that auctions be front and center. Now.'' **********Mr. Nova, the venture capitalist who worked at CMGI early on, said the market rewarded Mr. Wetherell's instincts. ''The rising tide covered up any mistakes we may have made,'' he said. ''Every spreadsheet we ran at the time was off by a magnitude of five or six times. No one expected Lycos and Geocities to be worth billions.'' **********And Mr. Wetherell, an eye on the market, was convinced that speed and growth were paramount. Inside CMGI, employees summarized the strategy with the initials G.B.F., for Get Big Fast. ''At our management meetings,'' one former executive said, ''any time Dave heard of a deal or other good news, he would say, 'Sounds like a press release to me.' '' **********To maintain momentum, Mr. Wetherell needed Wall Street. ''The currency he did deals with was his stock,'' one former executive said. ''Keeping the stock going was a theme that went through a lot of our conversations.'' **********The Upswing **********Expansion Binge Brings Strains **********Mr. Wetherell's success at killing the Lycos-USA merger, and the resulting publicity, appeared to embolden him, former executives said. The company's surging stock price, along with the cash it made from selling Yahoo stock it received for Geocities and from other investments, allowed him to embark on an expansion binge. CMGI bought 18 companies in 1999 and 5 more this year. **********The expansion was a strain. CMGI hired a head of human resources and created strategy and business development units, but Mr. Wetherell continued to make the key decisions. **********''When I got inside, it was clear they weren't really an operating company,'' one former senior executive said. ''They didn't have guys who could sit across the table and say, 'I have seen this before.' '' **********Another former executive described CMGI headquarters as a ''giant chicken with its head cut off.'' **********''They were working crazy hours, but it would take a long time to get things done,'' he added. **********Mr. Wetherell wrote that CMGI is shifting the sort of executives it hires from ''entrepreneurial types'' to those with broader experience. But some of those hired from big companies did not work out because they  found the Internet to be ''foreign territory.'' **********All last year, Mr. Wetherell kept pressing companies for growth and talked often of taking on America Online, Yahoo and DoubleClick. But there were signs that the slingshots of CMGI's giant-killers were empty. **********Consider the effort to best AOL through Planet Direct. It was meant to provide content and services in partnership with providers of Internet access, like telephone companies. But the company attracted few service providers. **********As the business languished, Mr. Wetherell pressed management last year to spend $100 million to buy another company that would transform Planet Direct, renamed My Way, into something else. Earlier this year, My Way bought Zip2, which operates Web sites for newspapers, from AltaVista, by then also owned by CMGI. **********Engage, Mr. Wetherell's pet project in targeted advertising, was also in trouble. The few advertisers who tried the system found only modest benefits. Mr. Wetherell bought eight Internet advertising companies and merged them into Engage, broadening its scope and giving it a new lease on life -- for a while. **********Icast was another company that transformed itself several times. In February 1999, Mr. Wetherell hired Mr. Braun, formerly of NBC, to spend $100 million to develop a company that would use sound and video over the Internet. (Yahoo had just bought Broadcast.com, a similar company.) **********There was little agreement, however, about what Icast should actually do. Mr. Braun wanted to focus on live events and celebrity Web sites. He bought Signatures, which sells celebrity-endorsed merchandise, from Sony. But Mr. Wetherell saw Icast as the multimedia equivalent of Geocities, where users could post their own sound and video. He soon merged Icast into another of his struggling companies, zinezone, a knockoff of About.com, which features hobby and other topical sites. **********Nine months later, Mr. Braun was dismissed. In a federal lawsuit filed last December, he contends that Mr. Wetherell did not honor his contract, which he says was worth $30 million to $50 million because of the run-up in CMGI's stock. CMGI denies the accusation. **********Far and away Mr. Wetherell's biggest bet was in July 1999, when he bought 85 percent of AltaVista from Compaq Computer for CMGI shares worth $2.3 billion. It was a curious deal: AltaVista was a big rival of Lycos, in which CMGI still held a major stake. **********But CMGI was under pressure from the Securities and Exchange Commission to expand its operating businesses, lest it be categorized as a mutual fund and subject to strict regulations. Moreover, relations with Lycos were strained, and Mr. Wetherell figured that he needed a general-purpose portal to tie together all his other companies. **********The strategy turned out to be flawed. Despite its reputation as a very good search engine, AltaVista has never established itself as a provider of a broader range of information, former executives said. It did not attract enough traffic to help other CMGI companies, and they did not have enough to help AltaVista. **********Still, as the Nasdaq was cresting, CMGI's stock reached a record high, $163.50, on Jan. 3. **********The Downturn **********A Stock Tumble, And Cutbacks **********As the Nasdaq index began sinking in April, so did CMGI stock. But even as that slide turned into a free fall through the spring and summer, the company continued its expansion. It started a company jointly with Compaq to provide employee benefit information on the Web. And it agreed to spend $7.5 million a year to put the name CMGI Field on a football stadium being built for the New England Patriots. Former employees say that move was made largely to drive up the stock price, because none of the company's consumer businesses use the CMGI name. **********As the year wore on, operating problems increased, especially as the market weakened for Internet advertising. **********Engage was hit especially hard, although CMGI did what it could to shore up the problems with deals from its affiliates. In the quarter ended in July, it met analysts' forecasts for $67 million in revenue -- but only because Compaq bought $13 million worth of advertising software and two other CMGI affiliates spent $7 million. **********By the next quarter, Engage had to face reality. It laid off 175 people in September. In the quarter ended in October, Engage said it would post revenue of less than $42 million, and Paul L. Schaut, its chief executive, resigned. **********The online retailers in CMGI's venture capital portfolio faced more bitter medicine. Unable to raise more money from outside venture funds, and unwilling to use more of its own cash, CMGI let Furniture.com, Mothernature.com and Productopia.com simply die off. **********In September, CMGI announced a restructuring, saying it would focus on five business lines and on venture capital. It would chop the number of companies it operated from 17 to less than 10 through mergers or sales. The new goal would be profitability at all of its units. **********That set in motion a huge shuffling of the portfolio. **********My Way, based in Andover, was simply merged with Zip2's operations in Mountain View, Calif. In reality, My Way's original advertising-supported business closed entirely. **********AltaVista abandoned its effort to be a vast consumer portal and focused on selling its search software to corporations to use on their own sites. It laid off 225 people. Rodney W. Schrock, its chief executive, quit in October. **********Mr. Wetherell said the moves were not meant to abandon either AltaVista or My Way, but to focus more on revenue from licensing software, which is more dependable than that from advertising. **********''We are concentrating on what works in both today's and tomorrow's Internet,'' Mr. Wetherell wrote. ''Advertising will continue to be a major force for the Web, but it will be slower to develop than other revenue sources. When it does take off more strongly, we are well positioned to benefit.'' **********Curiously, even through the fall, Icast, which depended largely on advertising, continued to hire senior executives and proceeded with its expansive plan to build an entertainment site. But in mid-October, CMGI suddenly decided to stop financing Icast and gave its management a few weeks to find a buyer. After fruitless discussions with prospects like the News Corporation, Icast closed. ''It was very abrupt,'' one former Icast executive said. ''It wasn't thought out. They were in panic mode.'' **********The bad news was not over. Last month, the company warned analysts that revenue in the quarter ended in October would actually decline, a mark of dishonor for a growth-driven Internet company. It promised to reduce its burn rate from $225 million a quarter last July to $45 million next July. (It will announce its complete results this Thursday.) **********Cutbacks, meanwhile, continued. CMGI closed 1stUp, its advertising-supported Internet service offered free to consumers, and it hired investment bankers to sell Raging Bull, a series of chat boards about stocks, which has been a personal favorite of Mr. Wetherell. **********One director said the board's main priority was to encourage Mr. Wetherell to make sure he had enough cash on hand to stay solvent. Mr. Wetherell did not raise as much money when the stock was at its peak as the board had hoped, this person said, though CMGI's $1.1 billion in cash and marketable securities does provide a buffer. **********The mood in Andover is grim. ''It's a changed and beaten company,'' said one executive who left this year. ''It has none of the bravado and world-domination schemes that had been there a year earlier.'' **********One current top executive said CMGI's low stock price was prompting employees to abandon worthless options and seek their fortunes elsewhere. **********Mr. Wetherell, moreover, wrote that he began looking for a chief operating officer last month because ''we are getting to critical mass in size.'' **********But even analysts are asking what that critical mass has become now that the quick I.P.O. profits are gone. CMGI says it will be a confederation of operating companies, perhaps a new-economy General Electric. But CMGI is missing at least one key piece of the G.E. formula: None of CMGI's businesses are No. 1 in their categories, and few are even No. 2. **********''The market had evaluated Wetherell on his ability to identify great new concepts,'' said Lowell Singer, an analyst at Robertson Stephens. ''Now the rules have changed. He is being graded on his ability to run them as businesses.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/11/business/technology-dell-computer-s-second-quarter-earnings-beat-expectations.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-08-11", "snippet": "Dell Computer Corp reports record second-quarter earnings and revenues, beating analysts' estimates; reports net of $603 million for quarter, compared with $507 million in year-earlier period (M)", "word_count": 465, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dell Computer's Second-Quarter Earnings Beat Expectations", "print_headline": "TECHNOLOGY; Dell Computer's Second-Quarter Earnings Beat Expectations", "body_text": " **********The Dell Computer Corporation reported record revenues and earnings yesterday, beating analysts' estimates for its second fiscal quarter by a penny.

The model allows Dell to keep inventory costs far below the costs of its competitors, and to incorporate new components in its designs more rapidly, which tends to keep average selling prices higher. But competitors like I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard and Compaq have narrowed the gap, and can all say they offer broader lines for corporate customers. **********Dell said unit sales growth in the second quarter was 22 percent over all, and faster in enterprise servers, storage products and notebook computers, which it considers strategically important categories.

In the deadliest attack, three people were killed in an August 1998 blast at the Planet Hollywood restaurant. **********This week's assassination was by far the boldest attack since that Magistrate Theron was arriving home in the Plumstead suburb late Thursday afternoon when he was ambushed by a passing car.

''We will do the same with everyone who breaks the law.

In Mexico, where ministers have long enjoyed legal immunity and acted with political impunity, the prospect of the public trial of a powerful official has given rise to some fear and trembling. **********Mr. Espinosa, who was jailed in Nicaragua on Tuesday at the request of Mr. Fox's Foreign Ministry, had sought political asylum -- a request privately supported by the former president, Ernesto Zedillo, who left office on Dec. 1 -- but the Nicaraguan government spurned him. **********Mr. Espinosa faces a long interrogation in Mexico over his political and personal history, including his work as Mr. Zedillo's campaign finance manager in 1994. **********Mr. Espinosa, 47, was a lion of the Institutional Revolutionary Party. After he raised millions for Mr. Zedillo's presidential campaign, he was appointed to be mayor of Mexico City from 1994 to 1997, the last unelected leader of the Western Hemisphere's biggest metropolis with nearly 20 million people. **********But when the first mayoral election was held in 1997, the party lost power over the city.

The fate of that money remains unclear. Some, if not all of it, came from a government account for communications -- press releases, publicity and the like. The investigators suspect that some of the money went to buy favorable coverage from corrupt reporters. **********Mr. Espinosa says no money was stolen and that audits suggesting otherwise were the product of sloppy paperwork.

CHIEF FAULTS RELUCTANCE OF U.S. TO HELP IN AFRICA", "body_text": " **********Faced with wars on several fronts in Africa, Secretary General Kofi Annan said today that the United Nations' peacekeeping efforts needed the kind of military help that the United States was now unwilling to provide. **********Instead, the United States is offering only to transport troops from other countries to confront the most immediate crisis in Sierra Leone, he said, but the United Nations is turning down those offers because the cost of using American planes is more than the organization can afford. **********Given the reluctance of the Clinton administration to put American troops on the ground abroad, Mr. Annan suggested that there was little room for the United States in what he describes as a new style of peacekeeping for a different age. America's reluctance to take on any more than a limited role has become evident since the Sierra Leone crisis began two weeks ago. **********''Washington will not put an American officer on the ground,'' he said. **********Mr. Annan would like to send in sophisticated and experienced military teams to assess problems or set up missions. But the United States prefers to see missions in Sierra Leone carried out by other countries, many of them with poorly equipped, lesser trained troops. **********In an interview today that ranged over the multiplying crises in Africa, where heavy fighting erupted today between Ethiopia and Eritrea, Mr. Annan said it was ''disheartening'' to confront a continent with calamities from end to end, and consider what this says about African leadership. **********Only a few years ago, a new generation of leaders -- among them Isaias Afwerki in Eritrea, Meles Zenawi in Ethiopia, Yoweri Museveni in Uganda and Paul Kagame in Rwanda -- seemed to offer hope of a turnaround in African politics and an end to constant civil conflict. **********''When everyone started talking about the African renaissance, President Clinton used to cite these four,'' he said. All four are now embroiled in war, the Eritreans and Ethiopians on the Horn of Africa, and Rwanda and Uganda in Congo. **********In southern Africa, President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe risks civil strife to bolster his one-party state by igniting racial tensions, threatening the economic health of all of Southern Africa. **********Mr. Annan, a Ghanaian, rejects the view that someone who makes himself president for life reflects traditional African tribal culture, where democracy can flourish within an essentially closed system. **********''That's not true,'' he said. ''Take my own society. In West Africa, we have the Ashanti kings. But the king can be removed for wrongdoing, incompetence or lack of leadership. It's not as if they are anointed by God and can stay there forever.'' **********His prescription for Africa is stronger nongovernmental institutions to curb the excesses of leaders who stay too long, and a market economy to reduce corruption that follows from government control of essential goods and services. **********''Corruption is built on everything being in the hands of the government,'' he said. ''So for everything you want, you need a permit. The person who gives you the permit wants a bribe. The person who's going to make the appointment for you wants a bribe. And so on.'' **********Senseless wars take terrible tolls, he said, adding that he recently told the leaders of Eritrea and Ethiopia that they would pay a price in international assistance. ''I had to tell them that as someone who was raising money for the famine, I was having difficulties,'' he said, ''and donors were asking: How do you expect us to put up money when they are using their money for war?'' **********Given the disaster facing the United Nations in Sierra Leone, Mr. Annan focused most of his remarks today on that country, where hundreds of United Nations peacekeepers are being held hostage. **********He spoke of the lessons the organization is learning there about how to be better prepared for an era of messier wars and freelance warlords impervious to the international pressures that once helped rein in renegade governments. **********''The nature of wars has changed and the dangers are also higher,'' said Mr. Annan, who was head of peacekeeping at the United Nations before becoming secretary general. ''In the past one was dealing with international wars and established states with government leaders who understood international pressures -- to whom you can say, 'If you don't do this, we will cut off your weapons, we won't trade with you, nobody will recognize you.' **********''What does this mean to Sankoh?'' he continued, referring to the rebel leader in Sierra Leone, Foday Sankoh. ''What does it mean to these warlords? Some may not even be warlords but national leaders who are so insular, whose vision is so narrow, that in their concerns about their own power and survival, the interests of their people don't count.'' **********To confront such conflicts, Mr. Annan said, the United Nations will need a bank of rapid-reaction contingents on call from countries with well-trained and well-equipped troops, ready to move fast to pave the way for peacekeeping forces. The Security Council will have to give those forces stronger combat authority and better equipment ''because you never know what's going to happen on the ground.'' **********The organization will also need better intelligence and more intelligence sharing, he said. ''We were completely sleeping on the issue of intelligence,'' he said, referring to Sierra Leone and its rebels. **********The world also needs an international criminal court for dealing with leaders like Mr. Sankoh, whose rebel force is known for hacking off civilians' limbs to keep people intimidated and who has disrupted peacekeeping in Sierra Leone, he said. **********''It is a real missing link in all our efforts to contain these criminals who act with impunity in our world today,'' he said of such a court, now being created. The United States, almost alone in the industrial world, opposes it because Washington cannot extract ironclad guarantees from other nations that no American will ever face trial there. **********When Washington offers support equipment, like planes to fly in other countries' troops, ''the U.S. offers are usually three times the commercial rate,'' he said. Last week, the Clinton administration said it would provide transportation, but only for a fee, and that has proved too high for the United Nations budget. **********Mr. Annan said, for instance, that the United Nations would have had to spend as much as $17 million to $21 million for an American military airlift of Bangladeshi soldiers to Sierra Leone. The organization has now chartered a commercial airliner for $6 million to do the same job. **********Although an American transport plane carried ammunition from Jordan to Sierra Leone today, the 300 Jordanian paratroopers who also arrived there today flew on a commercial charter, a Russian plane. Indian troops will be transported free on a Canadian government Airbus. **********American officials acknowledged today that to date their assistance had been limited to flying in one load of Jordanian ammunition, but the State Department spokesman, Richard Boucher, said the United States was still discussing other ways to help. He mentioned American discussions with Nigeria over the equipping and transporting of its soldiers. **********Mr. Annan stressed the importance of having well-trained and skillful commanders of peacekeeping operations and acknowledged that the situation in Sierra Leone has not been perfect. A commander has to coordinate disparate units from several countries, and diplomacy is needed, he said. **********The commander in Sierra Leone, Maj. Gen. Vijay Kumar Jetley of India, has come under criticism from Zambia, whose troops have been taken hostage in large numbers, and from other contingents. **********''There's tension in the command,'' Mr. Annan said. ''Everybody who's met Jetley say that he's a very good officer. But some of the commanders complain that he just gives orders, implying that there is no consultation.'' **********In Sierra Leone, as in other conflicts in Africa, diamonds and other lucrative resources not only supply warlords but also have the potential to corrupt the peacekeeping operation, particularly when poor soldiers see the chance of sudden wealth. **********''I have to make sure that my own peacekeepers down the line don't get caught in this situation,'' he said. ''So when a whole Guinean battalion on its way to Sierra Leone -- 900 men with A.P.C.'s -- said they were disarmed, you wonder,'' he said referring to armored personnel carriers. ''Did they sell them?'' **********-------------------- **********Clinton Notifies Congress **********By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS **********WASHINGTON, May 12 **********President Clinton notified Congressional leaders tonight that a small number of American military personnel could run the risk of becoming embroiled in hostilities in Sierra Leone, Congressional and other government officials said. **********The notice referred to a group of 7 to 10 Americans who are aboard British naval vessels moving into position off Freetown, the officials said. The Americans, believed to be fighter pilots, have been taking part in an exchange program with the British Navy. It has sent several ships to Sierra Leone to reinforce United Nations peacekeepers and calm a confused situation, the officials said. **********In addition, American military personnel were flying a C-17 plane loaded with ammunition into Sierra Leone to assist Jordanian peacekeepers, Mr. Boucher, the State Department spokesman, said today. **********Earlier today, Mr. Boucher said there had been no discussion in the administration of deploying combat troops to the West African nation. **********Officials said the notification referred to the War Powers Act. Mr. Clinton stopped short of invoking the act, which would require him to bring home troops within 90 days unless Congress authorized their continued role overseas. **********''They're being very, very careful,'' said a senior House Republican aide.

The government will award four licenses through a \"beauty contest,\" where companies compete on service and technology grounds and the winners will pay a flat fee of \u20ac130 million ($134.4 million) **********The number and quality of the British entrants \u2014 which include North American powerhouses like MCI WorldCom Inc. and Global Crossing Ltd. as well as existing British mobile operators like Vodafone and British Telecommunications PLC \u2014 suggested that the bidding will be fierce when the auction for the five licenses opens in two months. **********\"It's going to be exciting,\" said Will Whitehorn, a director of Virgin Group, the private British company led by Richard Branson that made one of the applications. **********The result will be watched closely by the industry and other European governments, which will award their own third-generation licenses this year and next. **********At stake is a slice of the most dynamic mobile telephone market in the world. **********In the past year, the penetration of mobile handsets has grown to more than 60 percent of the population in Finland, 50 percent in Italy and 40 percent in Britain. Industry executives believe many of those consumers will use mobile handsets for everything from e-mail and text messaging to booking concert or plane tickets to downloading games or music from the Internet. Forrester Research has forecast that one-third of all Europeans will have access to the Internet via mobile telephones by 2004. **********\"Everyone's interested because nobody wants to be left behind,\" said Mark Zohar, an analyst at Forrester. **********In Britain, the government announced that the country's four existing mobile operators \u2014 Vodafone, BT, Deutsche Telekom AG's One2One subsidiary and Mannesmann's Orange subsidiary \u2014 had applied to bid for licenses, as expected. **********In addition to MCI WorldCom and Global Crossing, other applicants included Telefonica SA of Spain; a joint venture of the U.S.-British cable operator NTL Inc. and France Telecom; and One.Tel Ltd. of Australia, which is 25 percent owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. and whose plans include financing from Lucent Technologies Inc. **********The consortium led by Virgin underscored the depth and variety of interest. The consortium, called Spectrum Co., includes the British supermarket company Tesco PLC, the music company EMI, the Finnish mobile operator Sonera Oyj, the U.S. mobile company Nextel Communications Inc., a venture capital fund of George Soros and another of Paul Allen, the Microsoft Corp. co-founder. **********\"We intend to win,\" Mr. Whitehorn said. \"This will really be the test bed for a major market.\" The intense interest was expected to drive the cost of licenses to \u00a3500 million ($823.9 million) or more each, well above the government's \u00a3150 million minimum. \"The costs of a license is going to be huge,\" said Nick Lyall, an analyst at SG Securities. **********And that's only for starters. The winners will have to spend as much as \u00a33 billion to build a British network. For anyone with pan-European ambitions, costs will multiply quickly. **********Incumbent operators hope to lower costs by piggybacking new technology on their existing networks. But they already are investing heavily to upgrade current networks for Internet access, and they have no guarantee of winning a license. **********The big question is whether Internet services will generate the income to pay back those investments. Vodafone AirTouch estimated this week that data services would lift revenue per subscriber by 25 percent by 2004, but some analysts say they believe the small size of handsets will limit Internet applications and that consumers will be reluctant to pay a premium for the services. **********\"Fundamentally, nobody knows what the market's going to be for 3G services,\" Mr. Zohar said. \"It's a significant gamble.\" The British bidders must pass an initial qualification test by the government's Radiocommunications Agency.

Michael Armstrong, the chairman, was stirring the corporate waters. **********For Dolores Grady, a secretary for the last 36 years, the announcement that the telecommunications giant would once again try to remake itself, this time by splitting into four different companies, was just another sign of the company's ''unstable'' nature in the last decade or so. She confessed some nostalgia for relics like teletypes and telegraph, once the company's core business, and some despair at what would happen to ''this fabulous staff'' at the headquarters. **********''I can personally retire, and so I'm not in a bind,'' she said. ''A lot of us are just fed up with AT&T being so unstable.'' **********But for others, like Keith Black and Timothy Venkersammy, both  information technology specialists, the changes were welcome. The two work for Concert, a wholly owned subsidiary of AT&T and British Telecommunications, which designs and markets broadband communications systems aimed at businesses. **********''This means that AT&T is focused on the future business and revenue base and not on the past business,'' Mr. Black said as he and his co-worker left the Thirsty Turtle Restaurant in nearby Bernardsville after lunch. ''Consumer long distance was its old business and its cash cow. This announcement is a statement that the company's future is in broadband technology, wireless communication and information telephony.'' **********The hardware of wires and switching equipment that so comforted Ms. Grady seemed ''anachronistic'' to Mr. Black, who joined the company 15 years ago and has known little but change since. **********''It was in a constant state of change when I got here,'' said Mr. Black, a British native who now lives in Atlanta and frequently travels to the headquarters here. ''We're used to change. We relish the change. It is the nature of our business.'' **********Wrenching change has been a way of life at the company for at least 10 years, said Jeffrey Keefe, an associate professor in the school of management and labor relations at Rutgers University, in New Brunswick, who has studied the effects of the company's downsizing on its work force. Today's announcement represents the third major change at AT&T since divestiture in 1984. **********''It makes life tenuous for many,'' he said. ''But there is a core group that continues because the company provides some of the best benefits, working conditions, pay and bonuses of any company. But the culture has changed as they moved from being a regulated monopoly to competing in the workplace, from shedding the Baby Bells and now competing with them and from merging two years ago with TCI. A lot are so used to these changes that they just want to end up working for a viable business and are not concerned about the larger machinations.'' **********News of the breakup was communicated to employees here at the same time that it was announced at a noon press conference. In break rooms, cafeterias and auditoriums, there were video viewing stations where employees could hear the formal announcement. Worldwide, said Dennis Lawler, an AT&T spokesman, there were nearly 400 viewing stations where employees could gather and watch. **********In addition, he said, Mr. Armstrong would be available to employees on a closed-circuit video-and-telephone link on Thursday to answer questions and give them details on what they may face in the future. There would also be 4,000 telephone ports that will allow employees to call in any questions they have for him. **********As the press conference unfolded, many at headquarters described the reactions as ''calm,'' ''business as usual,'' and ''reflective.'' One woman walking about the wooded, campus-like setting said the announcement had given her closure in the midst of months of speculation. Insisting on anonymity, she said the branching of company functions seemed self-explanatory and gave many a clear idea of where their background and talents could take them in the future. **********She recalled the announcement two years ago by Mr. Armstrong, newly appointed as chairman, that cost cuts would lead to 14,000 to 18,000 layoffs. ''Now that was ominous,'' she said, noting that there were generous severance packages and a roaring economy that could absorb most of those who left. ''But this is restructuring.'' **********Susan J. Friedman, a clinical social worker and consultant to the company, was just ending a morning-long seminar on juggling work and family when the announcement was made. ''It was fascinating to watch,'' said Ms. Friedman, who had been working with 20 people in person and 20 more by teleconference in Florida, as she lingered a bit to watch the news settle in. ''It was quiet, very reflective,'' she said. ''Some were frightened but not terrified. They just didn't know how it would play out.'' **********Back at the Thirsty Turtle, Mr. Black and Mr. Venkersammy said that in many ways their jobs with Concert, with its high-tech focus and marketing to businesses in competition with other communications companies, were very similar to what the future would look like for many AT&T employees. They flashed plastic wallet inserts that on one side carried Concert identification cards and, on the other, AT&T employee cards. **********Already, in anticipation of the breakup, they both said, co-workers at the mother company had called them to ask what it was like to have one foot in the company's future and one foot in its past. ''I tell them it is exciting,'' Mr. Black said. ''Very exciting and very global.'' Still, Ms. Grady seemed unconvinced as she reviewed Mr. Armstrong's presentation. ''Hogwash,'' she called it, and then angrily labeled it ''mumbo jumbo,'' which still left the future as murky as the goose-stirred lake out front. ''Some of us who are low on the totem pole,'' she said, ''still don't know where we stand.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/23/world/everybody-s-a-homebody-in-turk-tally.html": {"writer_name": "Douglas Frantz", "pub_date": "2000-10-23", "snippet": "Turkey's estimated 65 million people remain at home by government decree between hours of 5 am and 7 am on Oct 22 so that national census can be conducted; Istanbul, one of world's largest and most cosmpolitan cities, becomes virtual ghost town (S...", "word_count": 420, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Everybody's a Homebody in Turk Tally", "print_headline": "Everybody's a Homebody in Turk Tally", "body_text": " **********It wasn't exactly the day the earth stood still, but one of the world's largest and most cosmopolitan cities was a virtual ghost town today as Turks were confined to their homes for a national census. **********From 5 a.m. to 7 p.m., Turkey's estimated 65 million people were required to stay in their homes as 950,000 census-takers went door-to-door to fill out questionnaires.

Albright to the Middle East next week in an effort to ''work with both leaders on narrowing the gaps'' between them. And he said that he would meet soon with the Palestinians' leader, Yasir Arafat, in Washington. **********Mr. Clinton is also prepared to convene a three-way Camp David-style summit meeting in Washington with Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat, a senior administration official briefing reporters afterward said. But before that could happen, both sides would have to make substantial progress, the official said. **********''Both leaders know from me and they know from their own experience that they now have to be prepared to make an intense effort and to do things that they have not done in the past with real courage and vision if we're actually going to get a framework agreement that deals with the outstanding issues,'' said Mr. Clinton, who met with Mr. Barak before heading to Berlin for the second leg of a weeklong trip that is to be his last visit to Europe as president. **********The president's remarks underscored his frustration that the Israelis and Palestinians have not made more progress toward completing a final peace accord by their self-imposed deadline of Sept. 13. Negotiations in Stockholm aimed at drafting an outline for a final settlement were suspended last week after violent protests in Gaza and the West Bank. **********That agreement is supposed to settle issues that have been unresolvable for decades: the size and shape of a Palestinian state, the future of Jerusalem and the fate of Palestinian refugees. **********Before the meeting today, Mr. Barak showed just how tense the atmosphere between the Israelis and Palestinians is when he accused Mr. Arafat of stalling in the negotiations. **********''In recent weeks, we have seen some dragging of feet in regard to the running of negotiations,'' Mr. Barak told reporters. He added, ''We are trying to initiate a major move forward.'' **********Mr. Arafat responded, saying it was Israel that was stalling the talks, not the Palestinians. ''They are the side that is wasting time and not moving toward peace,'' Mr. Arafat said today in Gaza. **********The strong language was a significant change in tone for Mr. Barak, who almost never engages in public criticism of any of his adversaries, even his political opponents at home. His comments today could have simply reflected that he is actually upset with the Palestinians and the lack of progress. Or his statement could have been part of the routine back-and-forth of public diplomacy that Mr. Barak is known to loathe, and seldom use. **********But his uncharacteristically strong words may have been timed to appear resolute before the Israelis just as he is apparently ready, according to leaks in the press, to make long-delayed concessions in the negotiations, which are expected to resume this weekend or sooner, though it is not yet clear where. **********It has also been evident from Mr. Clinton's tone during this trip just how much he wants to conclude a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians in the final months of his presidency, and that he is prepared to invest the time it would take to do so. On some issues, like Kosovo, European security and trade, Mr. Clinton has sounded at times as if business is over. For instance, his discussion of a proposal on a limited missile defense system lacks the passion that he brings to his discussion of peace between Israelis and Palestinians. **********''The United States will do everything we can to help them pass this milestone,'' he said in remarks made to the staff at the American Embassy in Lisbon. ''This is tough work. If it were easy somebody would have done it a long time ago. But actually, it is within view now.'' **********Mr. Clinton and his top aides on the Middle East believe that Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon a week ago has transformed the political landscape in the region and created a new opening for a breakthrough. **********Several times in briefing reporters, the senior administration official referred to ''the new reality'' on the ground and the ''moment'' that will not last forever. **********Mr. Clinton made that clear at a news conference on Wednesday when he called the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon ''daring,'' adding that it ''imposes a much greater sense of urgency'' on all the parties to make peace. **********The flurry of activity by Mr. Clinton as his presidency nears its end is reminiscent of the push for an Arab-Israeli peace by the Reagan administration in 1988. Back then, the ''moment'' to be seized was the Palestinian uprising known as the intifadeh, which prompted a new peace initiative by Secretary of State George P. Shultz. **********Both Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat have said their goal is to reach agreement by mid-September. If they do not, Mr. Arafat has threatened to unilaterally declare a Palestinian state. **********But ''moments'' and deadlines for Middle East peace agreements come and go. After two days of meetings with Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat in Norway last November, for example, Mr. Clinton said he was beginning a ''last sprint'' for a peace settlement. At the time, the goal was to forge a ''framework'' agreement by February 2000 that would serve as a blueprint for a final peace accord. **********Then the deadline slipped to May. But the two sides were too far apart to do even that, and now the focus has shifted to the September deadline. **********As usual, administration officials were unwilling to discuss the details of the meeting between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Barak, but one senior administration official said that Mr. Clinton tried to draw out Mr. Barak on each of the outstanding issues: borders, refugees, Jerusalem and security arrangements. **********So far, Israel has handed over 42.9 percent of the disputed West Bank to the Palestinians. And it has agreed to turn over three Arab villages near Jerusalem to the Palestinian Authority, though that hand-over has not been completed. The most difficult issues continue to be worked out through several secret channels between the Israelis and Palestinians, with only unsubstantiated details coming through leaks to the press. **********For instance, one report by a Barak critic said that for a final deal to be reached, Israel will have to give up 95 percent of the West Bank, not 60 to 75 percent, which has always been the working assumption. But none of the actual details of the negotiations are being released. **********Dr. Albright will travel to the Middle East directly from Kiev next Monday, where Mr. Clinton will meet Ukrainian leaders on the final stop of his trip, the senior administration official said. The official added that the differences are still so great that Dr. Albright would have to make another trip before there could be a three-way summit meeting in Washington. **********The summit meeting, if it occurs, would be modeled on the one that President Carter held at the Camp David presidential retreat in 1978 that pushed Israel and Egypt to make peace. **********The challenges facing Dr. Albright are not new, plus she had plenty of problems on her earlier trips to the Middle East. On her first trip there in September after Mr. Barak came to power, Dr. Albright encountered a typical snag when the Israelis and the Palestinians failed to deliver an agreement for a signing ceremony in Egypt that she had hoped to preside over. **********And in 1997, just two weeks after her first official visit to the Middle East, in which she urged the Israelis to take ''time out'' from expanding settlements on the West Bank, former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced plans for building more housing there. **********The senior administration official also confirmed that the United States has agreed, at Israel's request, to earmark $50 million of Israel's $1.8 billion in United States military aid to shore up Israel's border with Lebanon. Israel estimates that a new defense line will cost between $300 million to $400 million. The withdrawal of Israel's Army from southern Lebanon last week after 18 years eliminated a buffer zone that had shielded northern Israel from attacks from Lebanese territory. **********Dr. Albright will not stop in Syria during her trip to the Middle East, the official said. Talks between Israel and Syria collapsed in January and have not resumed despite direct talks between Mr. Clinton and President Hafez al-Assad of Syria. **********On Wednesday, Mr. Clinton spoke by telephone with Mr. Arafat, who recently described the talks with Israel as deadlocked and was said to be unhappy with ideas proposed by Israel in recent talks in Sweden. Mr. Arafat ''informed President Clinton about the current situation of the peace process, especially the current stalemate and the deadlock it has reached,'' Nabil Abu Radineh, a senior aide to Arafat, told Reuters in Jerusalem."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/21/business/world-business-briefing-asia-goldman-may-be-barred.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "2000-04-21", "snippet": "Japanese Finance Ministry says Goldman Sachs Group may be disqualified from arranging Nippon Telegraph and Telephone's planned $13 billion share sale because of soured stock offering in Europe in March; possible disqualification is related to fact...", "word_count": 118, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GOLDMAN MAY BE BARRED", "print_headline": "WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: ASIA; GOLDMAN MAY BE BARRED", "body_text": " **********The No. 1 underwriter of Asian stocks in the first quarter, the Goldman Sachs Group, may be disqualified from arranging Nippon Telegraph and Telephone's planned $13 billion share sale because of a soured stock offering in Europe last month.

This syrupy concoction can still be had at old-fashioned kopi tiams all over Singapore. But just as in America, teenagers like Ms. Ong and older upwardly mobile workers nowadays flock to trendy cafes to ponder dating or dot-coms over pricey coffee concoctions. **********''Here, it's very high class,'' said Ms. Ong, who was wearing a pair of blue-lensed sunglasses to match her mobile phone. ''The kopi tiam is very low class. It's for those uncles and aunties.'' **********A principal agent for the change is Victor Sassoon, 42. In 1996, Mr. Sassoon, a Singaporean entrepreneur and former rock concert promoter, bought the Asian franchise for Coffee Bean, a chain of gourmet coffee shops based in Los Angeles and then little-known outside southern California. The stores he opened were very successful and Mr. Sassoon thought the Coffee Bean brand and its signature ice-blended coffee milkshakes were very hot. So in late 1998 he turned around and bought the American parent company, International Coffee & Tea L.L.C., from its founders -- a move analysts say is highly unusual. **********Mr. Sassoon now has 32 outlets here and 21 in Malaysia; the company expects to generate more than $100 million in worldwide sales this year. This month, it opened the first Coffee Bean in Taiwan. And with an eye on the success of Starbucks, Mr. Sassoon plans to expand across the United States and even take Coffee Bean public. **********''In America, we're really going to roll,'' Mr. Sassoon said as he sipped a black coffee in an office filled with posters from pop tours he brought to Southeast Asia, autographed by stars including Alanis Morrisette, Phil Collins and Michael Jackson. **********Fittingly, Mr. Sassoon's foray into coffee owes much to another pop singer, Paula Abdul. Mr. Sassoon and his wife, Michelle, promoted Ms. Abdul's tour to Southeast Asia in 1992. Three years later, while the Sassoons were in Los Angeles visiting Victor's brother Sunny, they met Ms. Abdul at the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf in Beverly Hills. Coffee Bean had already earned a reputation in southern California for a celebrity clientele that included the actors Jennifer Aniston, Tom Cruise and Bruce Willis. **********Mr. Sassoon mentioned he was considering bringing Coffee Bean to Singapore. ''Guys,'' Ms. Abdul recalls telling them, ''this is the greatest product in the world. You've got to get this company.'' Mr. Sassoon was sold. **********It was a good time to bring a new brand to Singapore. Asia's economic boom was fueling a taste for anything imported. In Singapore, a handful of companies were already catering to the newfound taste for expensive blends among well-traveled urbanites. Within months of opening the first Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, Singapore's first Starbucks opened, only 600 yards away. There are now 21 Starbucks outlets here -- and 226 throughout the Asia-Pacific, with plans for a total of 500 in the region by the end of 2003. **********Coffee Bean was founded in 1963 by Herbert and Mona Hyman, and quickly became something of a Southern California institution. Its 1987 addition of the ice-blends multiplied its popularity, but Mr. Sassoon said it took months to persuade the Hymans, who had never taken their brand much beyond Los Angeles, that expanding abroad was a good idea. **********Born in Singapore to an Iraqi-Jewish family and raised in Jakarta, Mr. Sassoon got his first taste for retailing when he inherited his father's business importing designer watches in 1984. He still runs the exclusive franchise for Cartier in Indonesia. Next was a chain of stores carrying a line of Disney baby merchandise, a franchise Mr. Sassoon and his wife ran until 1998. **********In 1990, they began promoting big-name events, starting out with the illusionist David Copperfield. But Asia's financial crisis erased Singapore from the pop tour map. In 1998, Billy Joel, Elton John and U2 all canceled visits here, and Mr. Sassoon took it as a sign that it was time to get out of the concert business. ''Boy bands have taken over from megastars anyway,'' he said. And the newcomers, he added, ''don't even last long enough to get them here.'' **********Mr. Sassoon also saw the writing on the wall for franchise operators. **********''The world's getting so small,'' he said. ''The licensing business is dead.'' So he approached the Hymans, then in their 70's, with a new offer: he and his brother would take the company off their hands. In December 1998, the Sassoons bought the company for an amount they declined to disclose. **********The Sassoons are less shy about their plans to expand in the United States. From 60 outlets in Southern California, they plan to add 50 this year in California, Nevada and Arizona, according to Sunny Sassoon, and may even venture as far as Chicago or New York. The company has consulted investment bankers and may try to spin off the Asian operations of Coffee Bean this year; it may also later try to list the United States company. **********(''Well heck, I should get some credit for that,'' said the Sassoon's surprised original consultant, Ms. Abdul.) **********Emulating the continental spread of Starbucks -- which has more than 2,800 outlets worldwide and which last year had $1.7 billion in sales -- will mean succeeding where other coffee chains have failed, analysts warn. ''It is a very difficult thing to do,'' said Scott Waltmann of Merrill Lynch in New York. With labor markets so tight, adding new stores eventually means sacrificing service, he said. **********Back in Singapore, Coffee Bean's rivalry with Starbucks seems more evenly matched, though neither will say much about the competition. The most pressure is on Singapore's own incumbents, the traditional kopi tiams. These noisy, open-air cafes, were once as central to Singapore's traditional neighborhood and village life as the small-town American diner or the English pub. **********Among the godowns, or warehouses, and villages of Singapore 30 years ago, the kopi tiam was not only a place to get a hot drink or quick meal from the hawker stalls but also served as both neighborhood watch center and fire station. In a city where very few could afford a newspaper and even fewer could read, the kopi tiam was a place to share a newspaper or hear it read out loud. **********Pang Eng Fong, 56, remembers growing up above his grandfather's busy kopi tiam among the rubber godowns along the Singapore River after World War II. **********The kopi tiam burned down in the 1960's and, like Singapore, Mr. Pang has moved onward and upward. After earning his doctorate in economics from the University of Illinois in 1971, he is now Singapore's ambassador to Britain. Where the shop once stood, trendy clubs operate out of restored buildings. Abandoned godowns are being pulled down to make way for Mediterranean-style piazzas and bars with names like Tivoli and Bar Celona. **********The old kopi tiam may not have had electricity or indoor plumbing, Mr. Pang said, but ''there was a sense of community that I think is hard to define now.'' **********There are still plenty of other kopi tiams in town even today. Not far from where Ambassador Pang grew up, his cousin Pang Peng Bee, 55, serves up as many as 700 cups of coffee a day at his Tanglin First Stop Coffee Shop. Coffee here is prepared not in a gleaming espresso machine but by pouring pitchers of scalding water mixed with powdered grounds through a sort of sock. **********Most of Singapore's old kopi tiams moved into food courts in the 1960's and 1970's as old neighborhoods and villages were demolished to make way for bland public housing. Where Ms. Ong's favorite Coffee Bean stands, for example, was a village of pepper and pineapple farmers. As the city grew richer in the 1980's, food courts abandoned the tropical heat for air-conditioned shopping malls. **********Now, per capita incomes are on par with many parts of Western Europe, and mass-market consumer goods are not enough for the status-conscious Singaporean. Wine bars, cigar bars (Cubans only, please), organic food shops and microbreweries have all begun to proliferate. Dining outdoors, once considered plebeian, is now called alfresco. **********Starbucks, too, has upmarket hopes here. ''Starbucks is a place where people want to meet,'' said Loh Jee Fang, a marketing executive at the company's franchise operator, BonStar Pte. Ltd. ''It's a destination in itself.'' **********When Mr. Sassoon opened the first Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf in Singapore in November 1996, the local newspaper ran a coffee glossary complete with pronunciation key. The chain's popularity was undiminished by Asia's financial crisis: sitting in cafes became a relatively cheap alternative to shopping and traveling. In late 1997, Mr. Sassoon expanded to Malaysia. **********The beans are roasted in California and shipped out in vacuum-sealed packs. Coffee Bean's baristas, mostly teenagers, are taught strict quality control, relying on a timer to make sure they pull every shot of espresso with just the right amount of crema. They mix the coffee with milk in a glass, Mr. Sassoon said, so they can monitor the mixture by its color. **********Of course, not everyone is won over. Holding a cup of Mr. Pang's muddy brew between inch-long fingernails, Stephen Chiok, a 37-year-old telephone technician, says he is one of the many ordinary folks uninterested in coffee served ''where they have all the test tubes and whatnot.'' At this kopi tiam, the barista is a balding man in flip-flops and a threadbare white T-shirt with 30 years of experience. Another self-styled kopi purist, 60-year-old Poon Luan Yak, scoffed, ''Starbucks -- that's for youngsters.'' **********Indeed, Ms. Ong acknowledges that her taste for coffee never ventures beyond the ice-blendeds. These frosty coffee-flavored smoothies account for roughly 40 percent of Coffee Bean's overall sales, according to Mr. Sassoon. The only special skill required to make one is the ability to mix the prescribed ratio of coffee syrup, milk and ice in a blender. **********''There's no style here,'' said one Coffee Bean barista as he pureed yet another ice-blended. ''The blender is my style.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/11/world/an-elusive-date-with-history.html": {"writer_name": "Jane Perlez", "pub_date": "2000-02-11", "snippet": "Jane Perlez analysis, citing new crisis in southern Lebanon and other circumstances in region, holds that time is running out on Clinton administration in its attempt to forge Middle East peace accord (M)", "word_count": 891, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis; News Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "An Elusive Date With History", "print_headline": "An Elusive Date With History", "body_text": " **********With the election of Ehud Barak as the prime minister of Israel last year, some senior Clinton administration officials were almost giddy with the prospect of peace in the Middle East. They even had their eye on creating an enduring White House photograph: the trifecta of the Syrian, Palestinian and Israeli leaders all lined up with President Clinton as the triumphant peacemaker. **********But time is running out on Mr. Clinton's administration. Though the president has pledged to work until the very end of his term on a Middle East accord, realistically, he would like to have the makings of a peace deal fashioned in the coming months. **********And circumstances in the region are not marching apace. **********Mr. Barak is no longer seen as the popular new man easily able to make bold moves on the peace front. Rather, he is a leader weakened by a party fund-raising scandal and facing an electorate distrustful of a deal with Syria. **********The Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, is described by diplomats as furious that the Syrians, with whom he has poor relations, are getting so much attention. **********The Syrian president, Hafez al-Assad, appears to have retreated to his Damascus palace, where he is busy trying to calm internal squabbling over who will succeed him. **********Then there is the new crisis in southern Lebanon, inspired, many Israelis believe, by Mr. Assad: Hezbollah guerrillas have killed six Israeli soldiers and Mr. Barak has reluctantly responded with air strikes. **********The Clinton administration has concentrated on counseling restraint on all sides. But at the very least, these events will delay a resumption in the Israeli-Syrian talks, officials said. Syrian state radio gave a taste of this in a bulletin on Wednesday, saying: ''Barak has wasted opportunities for peace and pushed the region towards a scenario where all options are open.'' **********For the Clinton administration, such delays are decidedly unhelpful. The longer the Syrian talks are on hold, a Western diplomat in the region said, the harder it will be to restart them. But restarting them will remain a tantalizing objective for Washington, the diplomat added, because the issues separating the Syrians and the Israelis are fairly stark, especially when compared with the complicated issues between the Palestinians and the Israelis. **********But Mr. Assad, who is embroiled in fights between his army officers and backers of his brother, Rifat, and his desire to have his son, Bashir, succeed him, appears disinclined to return to the negotiating table. ''The Syria talks won't get off in a hurry,'' the diplomat said. **********A hurry is what is needed. By July, Mr. Clinton runs into the political convention season. In September, the general election will be under way. Another consideration is his wife's Senate campaign in New York, where the large number of Jewish voters will be closely watching for a peace deal. **********''Every month that goes by, the time factor looms larger and larger,'' said Thomas Smerling, the Washington director of the Israel Policy Forum. ''The clock is ticking on the longevity of the administration, on the longevity of Arafat and Assad,'' both of whom are ailing. **********Fairly soon, said Mr. Smerling, the administration may have to lower its sights on what can be realistically accomplished by the end of the year. This may well entail choosing where to put the emphasis: the Syrian track or the Palestinian track. **********If the administration tries to plug along on both tracks, as is most likely the case for the moment -- because this is Mr. Barak's preference -- decisions will have to be made on whether to aim for a final agreement between the Palestinians and Israelis as called for by Sept. 13, or to make do with what is called a general framework agreement. The latter was supposed to have been achieved by next week, but is now hung up on bickering between Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat over a land transfer on the West Bank. **********Mr. Arafat has what he believes to be a trump card: If a final agreement is not reached by September, he has said he will declare a Palestinian state anyway. It would be a patchwork affair of disjointed pieces of the West Bank as well as Gaza but would probably be recognized by some European countries. **********Despite the tight timetable, administration officials claim to be relatively upbeat that Mr. Clinton can manage a decent outcome, if not the whole success that they had envisioned when Mr. Barak came to power. They are counting a payoff from seven years of dealings by Mr. Clinton and his aides in the Middle East -- ranging from former Secretary of State Warren Christopher's work with Mr. Assad, to the accords between the Palestinians and the Israelis at Wye, Md. **********Senator Joseph Biden, Democrat of Delaware and the ranking minority member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that no other president had amassed ''the degree of trust among all the parties.'' **********But whatever the trust Mr. Clinton may have built with the Middle East leaders, Mr. Clinton remains at their mercy. In the end, they will act to satisfy their own interests, not Mr. Clinton's desire for a page in history. **********''The American role is still limited,'' said Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League. ''The United States can only do as much as the parties allow them to do.

Reynolds Tobacco Holdings, the maker of Camel and Winston cigarettes, is expected to report its second consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth. **********Philip Morris said yesterday that its third-quarter profit from operations rose 6.8 percent, to $2.24 billion, or 99 cents a share, compared with $2.1 billion, or 87 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales rose to $20.06 billion from $19.88 billion. **********The results matched analysts' estimates, according to First Call/ Thomson Financial. **********In the most recent quarter, a gain of $139 million, or 4 cents a share, on the sale of a French candy business made net income $2.32 billion, or $1.03 a share. In the quarter a year earlier, the company took charges of $136 million for closing a factory and reducing cigarette production in Brazil and $8 million for job cuts in the United States. Those charges made net income $2 billion, or 84 cents a share. **********Shares of Philip Morris rose 94 cents, to $31.69. **********Neither Philip Morris nor R. J.

Still, many are surprised that smokers have recovered from the ''sticker shock'' of higher prices and so quickly, stemming the exodus from smoking in only one year. With consumers 18 to 24, a particularly important segment of the tobacco market, the prevalence of smoking has actually increased, to 36 percent from 32 percent, since the settlement, according to William P.

The interest rate on the loan the dealer secured for him from a local bank was 8.75 percent, better even than the employee rate at the bank where he works. **********Soon, though, he began seeing even more attractive rates advertised on the Internet. One Saturday Mr. Jutting, 51, typed an online application at the PeopleFirst.com Web site and was approved almost instantly. He refinanced his car. **********The tracking of every twitch in interest rates has been developing into a bit of a national obsession for a while, and consumers have become quite willing to refinance home mortgages when rates bounce favorably. Playing hopscotch with car loans is a newer phenomenon, fraught with pitfalls for the incautious. **********Mr. Jutting's case illustrates the kind of situation in which refinancing makes sense. He refinanced the $20,000 balance he owed on his car at 7.49 percent for five years. His original note was for six years, so his new monthly payment is actually $25 larger, but he will make fewer payments; all told, he will save $800. **********But many auto refinancings do the opposite, lowering monthly payments by stretching out the term, and thus greatly increasing the total to be repaid. Some refinance lenders will let consumers borrow more than they owe on their old loan, or even more than the car is worth -- giving borrowers extra cash to use as they wish, but leaving them deeper in debt than before. **********Refinancing of car loans is growing rapidly, with much of the action online, and lenders are stepping up marketing efforts. Reasons for the tactic's rising popularity can be found at both ends of the consumer sophistication spectrum. Relatively savvy car buyers, like Mr. Jutting, who for one reason or another have gotten stuck with high-rate loans are eager to replace them with lower rates; others with less financial acumen may respond to the siren song of lenders' advertising -- and mistake lower payments for less debt. **********SAVING the consumer money is the heart of the lender's pitch, of course, a pitch often directed to the names in commercial databases of recent car-loan borrowers. One recent mailing from Auto-refi Financial Services says ''save up to $40+ per month'' in eye-catching type. A company spokeswoman said its officials were not ready to discuss its offer, which she called a prototype, with a reporter. **********In general, auto refinancings work the way home refinancings do. The new lender pays off an existing loan in full and replaces it with a new loan on different terms -- a longer or shorter term, a higher or lower interest rate. **********But there is a crucial difference. Homes tend to rise in value over time, or at least hold their value. But new cars depreciate sharply, especially in the early going, when  they are often worth far less than what is owed on them. That condition is called being upside down. **********''If you paid sticker price with a low down payment, you're upside down in your loan when you drive off the lot,'' said Tamela Rich, director of auto development at LendingTree, a Web site that helps arrange loans. **********Consider a year-old BMW 528i sedan that sold new for $40,000. If the owner put down $2,000 and borrowed at 10 percent for five years, the $11,684 paid so far still leaves a balance of $38,736 on the loan. That is because, like a home mortgage, a car loan's early payments are mostly interest, not principal. But the Kelley Blue Book trade-in value of the car has fallen by now to $33,005. **********This is a financially dangerous time for the car owner; neither a sale nor an accident that totals the car will yield enough to repay the loan. A refinancing that extends the term or increases the amount borrowed, as many do, will make matters worse, prolonging the upside-down period. **********Sometimes, though, a refinancing is just what is needed to correct a borrowing mistake. ''So many customers go into the dealership and haggle over the price of the car until they get to where they can see the light at the end of the tunnel -- and then lose their guard a bit when it comes to financing,'' said Bob Ferber, an auto finance executive at eloan.com, an Internet-based lender. Eloan says that about one-quarter of visitors to its Web site want to refinance car loans. **********The very low promotional interest rates automakers have long offered on some models are beginning to dry up -- DaimlerChrysler said last week it would almost entirely stop offering them -- and the run-of-the-mill loan rates available through dealers are usually a bit higher than can be obtained directly from banks or credit unions. **********BORROWERS with stained or strained credit can also benefit. Making even a few timely payments on the kind of high-interest loan offered to a ''subprime'' borrower may qualify the consumer to refinance at a lower rate. **********Given the Federal Reserve's recent efforts to head off incipient inflation by increasing interest rates, general declines in consumer rates are probably not in the immediate offing. And if they were, they would be more likely to show up in mortgage rates, which are more volatile than auto loan rates. **********There are many loan provisions to pay attention to besides the rate and term. The old loan agreement may have features like gap insurance, warranties, and credit life and disability insurance that may be missing from a refinance offer. **********And timing is important. Lenders prefer to refinance vehicles that are less than six months old, when they still may be worth 80 percent or more of the purchase price. Cars much more than a year old may be rejected as having too little collateral value. Lenders rarely advance more than 130 percent of the car's value. **********Still, the annual percentage rate is ''the one number a customer should focus on,'' said Doug Lebda, chief executive officer of LendingTree.com, because lenders are required by law to calculate it in a way that allows apples-to-apples comparisons. **********Things to Ponder in Reassessing Debt **********A KNEE-BUCKLING car payment may have you thinking refinance, but unless you are sorely strapped for immediate cash, a new loan that lowers the payment by stretching the term may do more long-term harm than short-term good. Here are some points to keep in mind when considering an auto loan refinancing. *********** Home equity beats car equity. Rates on home equity loans are often lower than car loans, with an added bonus: the interest is usually tax deductible. ''If you own a home and have equity, nearly 100 percent of the time the right solution is to refinance your house,'' not your car, said Doug Lebda of LendingTree.com, a Web site where borrowers can solicit loan offers from lenders. *********** Apply selectively. The Internet makes applying for loans almost too easy. According to Bankrate.com, the banking industry data firm, many consumers do not realize that a flurry of applications in a short time, including inquiries to services like LendingTree, can damage their credit rating before they have borrowed a penny. *********** Know where you stand in lenders' eyes. Making even a single timely payment on a high-rate car loan can improve your credit score enough to qualify for a new loan at a lower rate for the same term -- just the situation where a refinancing makes the most sense.

Television executives groaned about low ratings, derivative shows, lazy comedy writing, the rise of hipper cable-channel programs and the same old tired format set in an apartment or workplace. **********Then came ''Malcolm in the Middle.'' **********A surprise success in its first two weeks, the new half-hour Fox comedy, about a dizzy family whose middle son is a genius, has not only resuscitated the troubled network but revived hopes for the genre. It was almost as if the coffin was being lowered when someone noticed the corpse was breathing. **********''Malcolm in the Middle,'' which has received the best reviews of any comedy in years, has tied for No. 2, after ''E.R.,'' among viewers in the 18-to-49 age group coveted by networks and advertisers. In its first week, ''Malcolm'' was seen by 22.4 million viewers over all. In its second week, the show's audience increased to 23.2 million viewers, making it the most-watched comedy on television. **********Whether ''Malcolm in the Middle'' actually restores the status of sitcoms -- like ABC's ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' did for game shows -- or merely results in poor imitations, will not be known for a while. But the impact on the networks has been swift. **********''One thing you can be certain of is that every comedy pitch will include the pitch, 'a ''Malcolm in the Middle' kind of sensibility,'' said David Kissinger, president of Studios USA Television, an arm of USA Networks. ''I've already begun to hear that.'' **********The show is unusual in several ways. For one thing, it is more expensive than other sitcoms. It costs almost $1.2 million for each episode, in contrast to the traditional sitcom, which in its first year may cost $800,000 to $900,000 an episode. That's because ''Malcolm'' is not made on a stage, with three or four cameras, before a studio audience whose laughter is often heightened by a laugh track. This process goes back to ''I Love Lucy,'' first broadcast in 1951. **********Instead ''Malcolm'' is made like a movie, with a single camera, on an indoor set as well as outdoors, without an audience or a laugh track. Another show using the same technique is HBO's ''Sex and the City.'' This single-camera method, rarely used on sitcoms, gives the show a far more realistic look. **********''The single camera allows audiences to have a fresh view of the form,'' said Gail Berman, president of the show's producer, Regency Television, an independent company affiliated with Fox, a unit of the News Corporation. ''The form hasn't moved that much. It goes back to Desi Arnaz. Now, with 'Malcolm,' you'll see additional single-camera shows.'' **********But the show's early success is hardly based on its grittier look and its form. Its appeal -- and Ms. Berman said she was surprised that the audience was heavily male -- is that its characters are funny and unpredictable, and thus a far cry from the failed sitcoms in recent seasons cloned from the big hits, ''Seinfeld'' and ''Friends.'' **********Linwood Boomer, the show's creator and executive producer and a longtime TV writer of programs like ''Third Rock From the Sun,'' called ''Malcolm'' a faintly autobiographical comedy about a middle-class family: four squabbling brothers, and an unconventional mom and dad who seem to watch over the boys with humor and amazement. **********The early success of ''Malcolm'' underscores the strange and sharp reversals that occur in the TV business -- just like in the movie business. **********Late last year, Fox -- and its executives -- were in the doldrums. The network's high-profile comedy series, ''Action,'' about a loathsome Hollywood producer, had failed, and Fox was littered with duds like ''Time of Your Life,'' ''Family Guy,'' ''Ryan Caulfield,'' ''Harsh Realm'' and ''Get Real.'' At the same time, shows like ''X-Files'' and ''Beverly Hills 90210'' were aging, and Fox seemed to be relying on often-silly reality programs that embarrassed the network's executives. **********The UPN network, which is owned by Viacom and Chris-Craft Industries, **********was almost written off by rivals and certainly by critics for its failure to find an audience. Today, UPN's audience has climbed 35 percent over last season among adults 18 to 49 -- and an extraordinary 90 percent among men 18 to 34 -- because of the success of several shows, notably its Thursday night wrestling extravaganza, ''WWF Smackdown.'' **********And Walt Disney's ABC unit, which finished the season as the No. 3 network last year, will likely finish No. 1 this year among adults 18 to 49 because of the success of ''Millionaire.'' This hugely successful quiz show has already spawned imitators at the other networks. **********The two-week success of ''Malcolm in the Middle'' will probably spawn imitators of its own. ''The rules are off,'' said Rick Rosen, a partner at the Endeavor Agency, which packaged the show. **********Before the success of ''Malcolm,'' he said, ''when clients tell us about their new shows, and they say they're single-camera shows, we tell them that if they mention single camera, the networks won't validate their parking.'' **********''The networks are so desperate for hits now,'' he added. ''The success of 'Malcolm' shows there are no more rules.'' **********The show itself was initially developed for UPN, which passed on it and allowed Ms. Berman and Regency Television to bring it to Fox. Doug Herzog, president of entertainment at Fox Broadcasting, read the script last year on a plane flying from New York to Los Angeles and agreed to broadcast the show. **********Mr. Herzog, who was new to the Fox job after serving as chief executive of Comedy Central from 1995 to 1999, said, ''My naivete worked in my favor. Here was a script about a 9-year-old kid, a single camera show, no laugh track, Linwood not considered a well-known writer. This was, like, authentic. It was funny. It was not politically correct. I said, 'Let's give it a shot.' '' **********To rival TV executives, the show's success is based not only on its humor, but on the expensive marketing campaign created by Sandy Grushow, chairman of the Fox Television Entertainment Group. Weeks before the show's premiere, on Jan. 9, Fox began heavily advertising the show on radio shows that appeal to audiences between 18 and 34 years old, on cable networks like MTV and on billboards at shopping malls around the nation. The campaign's cost reached more than $5 million. **********At one point, just before Christmas, Mr. Grushow got a call from a rival, Stu Bloomberg, co-chairman of the ABC Entertainment Television Group. Mr. Bloomberg was driving in Massachusetts. ''He said he kept hearing 'Malcolm' ads on the radio,'' Mr. Grushow laughed. ''He wanted to kill me.'' **********Mr. Grushow said he was certain that the success of ''Malcolm'' would have a ripple effect on other networks. He said that the relatively unused forms of a single camera and no laugh track was the key. **********''The American public tends to have gotten pretty cynical about those brightly lit sitcoms with souped-up laugh tracks,'' said Mr. Grushow. ''There's a lack of honesty to them that is clearly not appealing to what has become a much more sophisticated audience.'' **********Jay Sures, a television agent at United Talent Agency, said that ''Malcolm'' would have ''enormous impact.'' But, he added, if a spate of comedies about offbeat families, made with a single camera, results, they will not be seen until 2001. At the moment, scripts have already been ordered and networks are starting to make pilots for the fall. **********''The family sitcom has always had a cyclical history,'' he said. ''Before 'The Cosby Show,' family shows were seen as dead. 'The Cosby Show' revitalized it. Then by last year it seemed to hit bottom. Now, with 'Malcolm,' the up cycle is back.'' **********There are, of course, some current successful and enduring network comedies, among them ''Friends,'' ''Frasier,'' ''Dharma and Greg,'' ''King of Queens,'' ''Will and Grace,'' ''Drew Carey'' and ''Everybody Loves Raymond.'' But in the last year, the sitcom fatalities have mounted: ''The Naked Truth,'' ''The Mike O'Malley Show,'' ''Union Square,'' ''Conrad Bloom,'' ''Caroline in the City,'' ''Fired Up,'' ''Suddenly Susan.'' **********''The challenge is to find a show that taps into a unique voice, one that pulls you in and separates itself from the clutter,'' Lloyd Braun, co-chairman of the ABC Entertainment Group, said. '' ' Malcolm' has done that, in much the same way as our show, 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.' '' **********At NBC, executives were somewhat buoyed by the success of their rival's show. NBC, while broadcasting ''Seinfeld,'' for years had also flooded its schedule with often-lame comedies that are no longer on the air. Garth Ancier, the president of NBC Entertainment, who took over the job last year, said that the number of comedies had recently been ''trending down'' in favor of dramatic shows. Now, perhaps, the trend is reversing. **********''We just picked up a show called 'Daddio' '' he said. ''It's about a nuclear family with a stay-at-home dad.'' **********The show was written before ''Malcolm.'' But the success of the Fox show certainly didn't hurt the prospects of ''Daddio'' getting scheduled."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/19/technology/kozmocom-delays-ipo-talks-to-buy-urbanfetchcom-continue.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-08-19", "snippet": "Kozmo.com Delays IPO, Talks to Buy Urbanfetch.com Continue", "word_count": 615, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Kozmo.com Delays IPO, Talks to Buy Urbanfetch.com Continue", "print_headline": "Kozmo.com Delays IPO, Talks to Buy Urbanfetch.com Continue", "body_text": " **********Kozmo.com Delays IPO, Talks to Buy Urbanfetch.com Continue **********August 18, 2000 **********&nbsp; Kozmo.com Delays IPO, Talks to Buy Urbanfetch.com Continue By REUTERS &nbsp; Related Articles **********Kozmo.com Lays Off 10 Percent **********(August 16, 2000) **********Kozmo Co-Founders Step Down **********(July 20, 2000) **********Kozmo Lays Off 24 Employees **********(June 20, 2000) **********EW YORK -- Kozmo.com, an Internet retailer that home-delivers everything from videos to fast food and CDs, has postponed its initial public offering until at least early next year, amid talks to acquire chief rival Urbanfetch.com. **********A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday said the offering of up to $150 million had been withdrawn due to \"market conditions.\" **********Michael Gordon, a spokesman for the New York-based online retailer, said delaying Kozmo's IPO - which was filed in March before the stock market dip that has battered dot-com stocks - would allow the company to become profitable first. **********\"We have enough capital, we have the flexibility and we have the confidence in our business model to go public, probably in the early part of next year,\" Gordon said. **********Gordon also said Kozmo would lay off one percent of its staff, about 30 or 40 employees, from its New York headquarters. The latest layoffs follow a round of job cuts last week, when 275 employees from the company's field service dispatch were let go. In June, the company cut 24 jobs from its headquarters. **********Executives at Kozmo would not comment on reports that it plans to acquire rival etailer, Urbanfetch. However, a source close to the deal, being handled by Credit Suisse First Boston, said talks between the companies are continuing and a decision could take at least another week. **********The takeover would bring to an end a period of bitter public rivalry between the competing Internet delivery services. **********Kozmo filed a lawsuit in 1999, in which it accused Urbanfetch of copying its business model. The case was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. Last month, Joseph Park stepped aside as Chief Executive, retaining the role of Chairman. **********Analysts said acquiring Urbanfetch would be a clear win for Kozmo, and protect Urbanfetch, in a difficult business environment. **********\"There's not room for two players in a financially-constrained market like this one,\" Forrester Research analyst Evie Black Dykema said. **********Analyst Ken Cassar from Jupiter Communications said a successful and cost-effective acquisition of Urbanfetch would certainly make Kozmo a more appealing IPO candidate. **********\"The market in which it hopes to thrive is a scale-driven market,\" Cassar said. \"And you have to be big in order to thrive.\" **********Urbanfetch's greatest appeal was that, while smaller than Kozmo, it had higher average orders, he said. \"Fragmentation of the market could potentially do in at least one of the players and potentially all of them.\" **********Dykema noted that Kozmo was not unique in delaying its IPO in a market that is \"not incredibly strong.\" The delay would give Kozmo time to consolidate and improve its position, for example, by acquiring Urbanfetch, she said. **********\"Density determines success and for two players like Urbanfetch and Kozmo to be competing head on in a key market like New York, it is just unnecessary strife,\" Dykema said. **********With the support of high-profile investors including Amazon.com Inc., Kozmo has raised more than $250 million. **********Kozmo delivers in 11 cities, including New York, Chicago and San Francisco, and this week it opened in San Diego.

It should then be close to radio advertising, projected to climb to $26.6 billion.  Daily newspapers are still expected to generate the highest advertising income, an estimated $63.2 billion in 2004. **********The Internet will continue to stimulate media growth almost across the board, said James P. Rutherfurd, executive vice president of Veronis Suhler, which is based in New York.  ''The good news is that it has sparked a metamorphosis for traditional media,'' he said. ''By developing content-rich Web sites and information portals, traditional publishers and television networks are positioning themselves to capture their share of revenue diverted to the Web over the next several years.'' **********The report found that newspapers had lost some classified and real estate advertising to the Internet. But newspapers have offset these losses with strong national advertising, increased dot-com ad spending and development of online classified advertising programs. Another positive trend for newspapers, the report said, was the aging of the United States population, since 71 percent of people over the age of 35 read a daily newspaper each weekday. **********In addition, the forecast said that ''contrary to popular thought, television viewing is not being cannibalized by growing Internet use.'' **********''Instead,'' the report said, ''many Internet users actually watch television while surfing -- in a majority of households, computers are co-located in the living or family room with the television.'' **********It also said that ''while the television market has benefited from dotcom ad dollars, this influx is not expected to last, as some Internet entities change their advertising emphasis to more targeted media.'' **********Veronis Suhler said this development should be positive for consumer magazines, which, with their large, targeted audiences, have become an increasingly attractive advertising vehicle for dot.coms. These publications have proved ''very resilient when it comes to the Internet's growing reach,'' the report said, in part because the Web ''has so far been unable to successfully duplicate the look, feel and ease of use of magazines and other printed media and is unlikely to do so.'' **********Mr. Rutherfurd said: ''The traditional media have audiences that trust them, are comfortable with them, return to them. It's often just as convenient to get information from a printed product or from television as it is to surf through the Web. **********''The Internet is easy for search and comparison shopping, but not for random access,'' he added. ''If you're looking for what's going on in the sports world, for example, flipping through a magazine or newspaper, with a catchy picture or headline, is better than surfing page after page on the Internet.'' **********He also said the Internet was not as portable as print media since the weight and battery performance of laptops can be an issue. ''In the wireless world, you can access e-mail and stock quotes, but it's not great to read the speech Clinton gave last night,'' he said. **********The forecast also predicted that although the decline in broadcast television ratings has slowed since 1997, it will resume after the 2000 elections, the Sydney Olympics and the recent spike generated by reality-based programming. **********It projected that interactive entertainment -- PC games and console video games, like Sega's Dreamcast system -- would have the highest growth rate of any segment of the communications industry through 2004. Hourly use per person per year of video games is forecast to climb 21.5 percent through 2004, on top of a 29.4 percent annual increase between 1995 and 1999. Spending is also forecast to grow 21.7 percent, to $13.8 billion, through 2004. **********According to the report, between 1995 and 1999, hourly annual Internet use rose 106.8 percent.

Those same characteristics could propel wireless Ethernet as embodied in the 802.11b standard, which allows data to be transmitted at 11 megabits -- 11 million bits a second. **********The 802.11b format is catching on so quickly that it is displacing alternative wireless competitors that include Bluetooth and HomeRF. The cost of 802.11b technology continues to plummet; chip sets that cost as little as $10 or less may arrive in the next two years. So it should become cheaper and easier to set up an office network wirelessly than with traditional Ethernet wires. **********To be sure, there are some clouds ahead. The 802.11b wireless transmitters operate on the 2.4 gigahertz radio band, which does not require a license to use. Some technical experts worry that this band may soon grow so congested that it will create the world's first wireless data gridlock. **********The standard, first popularized by Apple Computer in its Airport line of wireless products last year, is now being embraced  so quickly that it is touching off a wireless ''air rush'' as start-up companies and telecommunication vendors vie to lock up valuable sites at airports, hotels and other public hot spots. Such companies operate the Internet server computers by which wireless users actually connect to the global network. **********The appearance of the wireless standard in public spaces is following on the heels of installations on university campuses and corporate office parks. And some community 802.11b wireless networks have been set up, including SFlan in San Francisco. **********As part of SFlan, some Internet hobbyists  have set up inexpensive 802.11b networks on their rooftops and are distributing Internet service throughout their neighborhoods. One user, Tim Pozar, said his local network reached a half-mile radius around his home. **********Brewster Kahle, a computer network expert who has led the SFlan project, said, ''It's possible that a grass-roots broadband network could be built organically.'' **********But for now, commercial efforts seem to be gathering steam most quickly. There have been a series of announcements in recent weeks by wireless companies including  Aerzone , Mobilstar and Wayport, that have struck deals with airports and hotels to install 802.11b. **********Just last Friday, United Airlines said it was teaming with Aerzone, a San Francisco-based subsidiary of Softnet Systems, to deploy 802.11b in Red Carpet Club airport lounges, gate areas and terminals in as many as 50 airports served by the airline. **********''This is potentially a huge business because we offer the two things people want most: relatively unlimited bandwidth and mobility,'' said Lawrence B. Brilliant, chief executive of Aerzone. **********Just two days earlier Wayport, based in Austin, Tex., announced it was installing 802.11b in the lobbies of 15 hotels in the Los Angeles area. Wayport has already started its service at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and the Austin Bergstrom airport. **********And while so far Apple and I.B.M. are the only two computer makers to offer portable systems with built-in 802.11b capability, by early next year the standard is expected to become a common built-in feature on all makes of portable computers. **********Meanwhile, a number of sports stadium deals have been announced and several of the wireless start-up companies say they have been in talks with Starbucks to offer wireless Internet service in the company's nationwide chain of coffee shops. **********Indeed the possibility of Starbucks's encouraging customers to spend time sipping coffee in its stores while they read their e-mail has created a new technology buzz-phrase: the ''high-loiter retail'' marketplace, in the words of Brett Stewart, Wayport's president and founder. **********The wireless networks based on 802.11b are also becoming popular as a convenient and low-cost way to create a network within homes already connected to the Internet through D.S.L. or cable modems. **********All this activity raises the possibility that 802.11b might upset the plans of some of the big telecommunications giants that are planning to spend millions of dollars building third-generation data and voice cellular networks. If millions of computer users and companies effectively build their own high-speed data network from the ground up, the telecommunications carriers might think twice about putting money into third-generation systems. **********The 802.11b standards offer far greater speed than the proposed third-generation network standards, which generally offer two megabits that must be shared by all the users of a single cell. And the industry is finishing a standard called 802.11a, which will allow even higher speed -- 54 megabits a second -- on the 5 gigahertz radio band. **********In fact, a top Microsoft executive, Craig Mundie, said his company was trying to rally the computer and telecommunications industries to agree upon that standard for the future of wireless data networking. **********If the largely spontaneous 802.11 wave does swamp the various other wireless data networking standards, it might be fitting.  After all, it was as an anarchic self-assembling world of isolated networks that the Internet originally came into being."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/21/technology/impressive-new-video-displays.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-09-21", "snippet": "FOR several years, the military has created its maps using computers rather than drawing boards.

But when it comes time to use them in battle, things become decidedly low tech. \"They take a paper map and staple it to a 4-by-8 piece of plywood,\" said Jim Birch, business development director for microsystems and displays at the Sarnoff Corporation. \"That's the army we have today.\" **********Recently the military turned to Sarnoff, the successor company to the David Sarnoff Research Center and RCA Laboratories, to be part of a project to develop electronic maps. Mr. Birch said that what was emerging from the research, however, was a technology that might find widespread use off the battlefield. It should, according to Mr. Birch, create jumbo-size (3 feet by 6 feet initially), high-resolution, flat-panel displays that could be used for everything from medical imaging to showing movies in theaters. **********\"There's not a display out there right now that can show high resolution over a large area,\" Mr. Birch said. The gigantic computer displays tacked on buildings in Times Square, along the strip in Las Vegas and at sports stadiums around the world generally use light-emitting diodes, but at best they offer very low resolution. \"They're good for viewing by crowds from a distance,\" Mr. Birch said. Plasma displays, a more recent and costly large-screen panel system for computers, also fall short when fine detail is necessary. **********At the other extreme of the display resolution world, the best high-definition televisions can produce an image made up of two million picture elements, or pixels. That sounds impressive, but Mr. Birch said that a 35-millimeter film negative generally contains at least twice that number of pixels. And an ordinary X-ray may have eight million pixels. **********The monitor project is based in part on existing technologies. Anyone who has attended a rock concert knows that one way to construct a huge video display is to pile several monitors together and then electronically divide the overall image among the screens. The downfall of such systems, however, is the appearance of the seams that separate the monitors. **********The company says that it has found a way to make the seams or gaps invisible without sacrificing image quality. In the past, some systems have tried to minimize the gaps by electronically making images slightly fuzzy where the screens meet. Sarnoff's solution to unsightly seams, a technique Mr. Birch called tiling, has come from the optical world. **********A prototype system will start with six L.C.D. screens assembled to form a 3-by-6- foot display. To increase their brightness, the screens will be backlighted by special white, light-emitting diodes rather than fluorescent lamps like those normally employed in laptop computers. Then a layer of tiny lenses will be added on top of the screen grid: every L.C.D. screen in the grid will be topped with hundreds\" of individual lenses, Mr. Birch said, although he declined to give the exact number. **********The lenses, in turn, will be aimed to project a seamless image on a plastic screen that provides the final layer of the screen's sandwich. Unlike bulky rear-projection systems now used for the huge televisions favored by sports bars, the new Sarnoff system will be just 10 inches thick regardless of the overall screen display size. (Production models will probably be only eight inches thick.) **********Not only is the system seamless, but Sarnoff estimates that it will be able to display 30 million pixels. That's good news for topographic map users but troubling for engineers. The problem, quite simply, is that current computer technologies can't move that much data from a computer's central processing unit to the screen fast enough to allow, for example, full-motion video. The image would be trapped in electronic gridlock on its way to the screen. **********Instead of developing a new type of image server, Sarnoff solved the problem in a 32- inch, three-million-pixel demonstration prototype by sharing the workload. Each of the L.C.D.'s in the system is fitted with its own Pentium processor. Software developed by Sarnoff allows the main computer controlling the on-screen action to do only a portion of the actual image processing before sending the problem off, as a highly compressed data file, to the screens. The Pentium chips on the L.C.D.'s then take those bundles, expand them and finish the image processing. The Sarnoff system also has a way around another phenomenon known to concertgoers. When stacked in a grid, differences in color, brightness and contrast between individual screens becomes glaringly obvious. Sarnoff is giving its system the ability to watch itself. A video camera will take in the entire scene and feed the image to software that will ensure, for example, that a wayward screen doesn't render a pop star's nose \u2014 or any other object \u2014 excessively red or unnaturally bright. **********When the Sarnoff lab finishes its first large prototypes, probably in the next year and a half, the company's scientists won't exactly be overwhelmed with the material they can watch on it. Other than the Pentagon's maps, Mr. Birch said, he isn't aware of any digital images currently available that could take full advantage of a 30-million-pixel screen, and current scanners are unable to convert images made using other media to digital formats with that degree of fidelity. **********Mr. Birch estimated that the high-resolution, 3-by-6-foot screen would cost $30,000 although a lower-resolution version suitable for high-definition television could be available for $10,000. But sports fans counting on seeing every drop of blood from the big game don't have to start saving their money. Cost aside, Mr. Birch said, the high-resolution system would be overkill, even for the keenest sports fans. \"Nobody,\" he said, \"needs 30 million pixels in their home right now.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/27/world/house-vote-on-china-trade-the-politics-was-local.html": {"writer_name": "Adam Clymer", "pub_date": "2000-05-27", "snippet": "News analysis of United States' House 237-to-197 approval of China trade deal, most important foreign policy vote so far this year; vote seen reflecting reality that members vote their districts, calculating impact of legislation on jobs gained an...", "word_count": 1124, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis; News Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "House Vote on China Trade: The Politics Was Local", "print_headline": "House Vote on China Trade: The Politics Was Local", "body_text": " **********The most important foreign policy vote so far this year, the 237-to-197 House approval of the China trade deal, was no new affirmation of internationalism by an often provincial Congress, but a reaffirmation of one of its oldest truths: Members vote their districts. **********That is, they vote their districts if their constituents have an interest, and a trade bill is a singular foreign policy measure because the question of jobs gained and lost commands attention from lawmakers and constituents ordinarily not much concerned about the rest of the world. **********But other foreign policy matters have far smaller constituencies, and are much more subject to Washington's political influences, especially partisanship. To put it meanly, each party plays politics with foreign policy; to put it kindly, each trusts presidents of its own party but discerns grave weaknesses on the other side. **********In any case, the ''internationalist'' Republicans who supported President Bush's Persian Gulf war in 1991 suddenly became ''isolationist'' Republicans who opposed President Clinton over military action in Somalia (where Mr. Bush actually had sent the troops), as well as in Bosnia and Kosovo. The Democrats, meanwhile, eagerly seized the labels the Republicans had dropped. **********There are some members of Congress who take the ''internationalist'' view on trade, intervention abroad, United Nations financing and comparable issues regardless of party, at least most of the time. **********But looking at a dozen key votes dating back to the gulf war, there are only 10 current House members who voted that way all the time. Several are Southern Democrats with no union pressure over trade to worry about. Two are Democrats from Washington State, where union desires to sell Boeing airplanes to China overcome all other trade questions. And one is a moderate Republican, Representative Constance A. Morella from the suburbs of Washington, D.C. **********But most representatives rise or fall on domestic records, and for them ''foreign policy is totally unimportant most of the time,'' said Barbara Bardes, a political scientist at the University of Cincinnati. ''They are available for those swing votes as long as it doesn't hurt them.'' **********And more of them are available these days because two factors encouraging instinctive support of a president no longer matter. **********One was the cold war, which drew the argument that the United States would seem weak to the Soviet Union if the president could not enforce his foreign policy views, even in areas of no concern to Moscow. **********A second is the departure of the World War II generation from Congress. Only nine veterans of that war now serve in the House. The Senate has lost the voice of Bob Dole, who could tell his colleagues that once the president had made a decision, even a weak one, he must be supported. **********The ''sort of 'president knows best' attitude is gone,'' said another student of Congressional behavior on foreign policy, James McCormack, an Iowa State University political scientist. **********Indeed, that generation has been replaced by the skeptical veterans and nonveterans of the Vietnam era, for whom ''the commander-in-chief thing doesn't work,'' Dr. Bardes said. ''They are worried about becoming too involved.'' **********That attitude produces resolutions demanding withdrawal of troops from Bosnia and Kosovo, delays in appropriations for drug wars in Colombia and, at its most intense level, Senate rejection of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. **********The consequence is that, ''given the polarization of the parties, almost any major initiative requires a major effort'' by the president, said Bob Pastor, a political scientist at Emory University in Atlanta. **********This China trade bill got that intense effort, not just from the administration, but from business and House Republicans, too. **********But without outside allies of the weight of the business interests that backed this bill, the administration lost the nuclear test treaty and faces continual difficulties in getting the money to pay back dues to the United Nations. **********That effort was required because even if this was fundamentally a trade bill, where most of the votes depended on jobs gained for Florida fertilizer mills or lost to textile plants in North Carolina, it also carried the baggage of a foreign policy measure about a Chinese government that no one in Congress will defend. This was not a pure trade measure, like the question of extending lower tariffs to Chile. **********The 57 Republicans who voted no were primarily motivated by China's treatment of Christians and political dissidents, plus its reported espionage activity against the United States. And others were tempted, doubting the argument that trade would broaden Chinese society. **********Representative Tom Tancredo of Colorado dripped with sarcasm: ''We have been told wonderful things will flow from expanded trade with China. Workers' rights will be respected, religious freedom will be enhanced, and probably Jeffersonian study groups will be popping up all over China.'' **********But supporters like Representative Nancy L. Johnson, Republican of Connecticut, disagreed. She quoted a clergyman, Rev. Daniel Baida Su, who told the Ways and Means Committee that the deal and membership in the World Trade Organization obliged ''China to play by the rules.'' **********''In the process, China will need to strengthen its legal institutions, train more legal professionals, learn to follow international legal procedures, and educate its people about the concept of rights, law and international norms,'' Ms. Johnson quoted Mr. Su as saying. ''This process alone is a breakthrough with important philosophical implications for China as a nation. When a Chinese realizes he has rights as an investor that government should not violate, then more likely he will also realize that he has other rights as a human being.'' **********But her argument would not have prevailed without the sense in Congress that more jobs were to be gained than lost, and without the labor opposition suffering from the label of ''protectionism,'' concerned about saving the jobs of union members at the expense of the American economy in general. **********John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., called that label ''very unfair.'' He said in an interview: ''We realize the value of trade with any country. We recognize the expansion of globalization. But in this new global economy, we must strive for rules that protect human rights and workers rights and the environment and not just profits.'' **********It was the bill itself that was protectionist, he said, as an ''outright attempt to protect profits without any concern for human rights and workers' rights.'' **********That argument was often heard on the House floor. Representative Janice D. Schakowsky, an Illinois Democrat, said the bill encouraged United States companies to take ''advantage of the nearest slave labor conditions and wages.'' That sort of attack went largely unchallenged. **********But arguments like those of Representative Marge Roukema prevailed. The New Jersey Republican saw huge opportunities for American energy, gas, construction, telecommunications and engineering companies in China. ''Not only for New Jersey,'' she said, ''but for the nation, the bottom line here is that this is a jobs bill.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/07/business/the-fund-flies-then-flops-the-investors-still-believe.html": {"writer_name": "Floyd Norris", "pub_date": "2000-04-07", "snippet": "Floyd Norris column on investors' confidence in PBHG New Opportunities fund and PBHG Select Equity fund despite huge losses; says New Opportunities fund has lost 42 percent of its value in less than four weeks and Select Equity fund is down 37 per...", "word_count": 605, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Fund Flies, Then Flops.

He is young. He knows technology. He often sells stocks a day or two after buying them. He appears to be fearless. **********''I'm used to the volatility,'' he said in a telephone interview yesterday. ''I haven't had any problem.'' **********That is a remarkable attitude for a man who manages two funds that were sent reeling by Nasdaq's version of March Madness. One, the PBHG New Opportunities fund, lost 42 percent of its value in less than four weeks. The other, the PBHG Select Equity fund, is managed a bit more conservatively and went down only 37 percent. **********More remarkable still is the fact that most of his investors don't seem very alarmed either. ''Redemptions have not been a problem,'' he said. AMG Data Services estimates that about 10 percent of the assets in Select Equity, and 20 percent of those in New Opportunities, have been withdrawn over the last three weeks. But those figures are dwarfed by earlier inflows, and the vast majority of investors appear to be hanging on. **********Therein lies the secret to the rebound of the Nasdaq market over the last two days -- a bounce that provided a 9 percent rise for New Opportunities and a 10 percent gain for Select Equity. The people who made a lot of money buying highflying technology stocks over the last year, and particularly over the last six months, are not convinced that anything has changed. The volatility may have shaken out some speculators, but many still believe. **********''The strategy is to own the fastest-growing companies in the universe, regardless of price,'' Mr. Slattery said. Let others worry about valuation. He goes for growth, whatever the value. It is an attitude that drives some veteran money managers crazy. But it has worked very well for Mr. Slattery and his investors. **********On Feb. 11, the 27-year-old Mr. Slattery, who uses a nickname rather than his formal name of Frank P. Slattery V, completed his first year as a fund manager. The fund that was started for him in early 1999, the New Opportunities Fund, was up 622 percent during that first year. It was closed to new investors in November, and he took over another fund, the Select Equity Fund, at that time. Even with the recent travails, both funds are still up nicely. **********Mr. Slattery keeps around 80 percent of New Opportunities in what he views as the 30 fastest growing companies. He says he keeps them until the growth slows, paying no attention to price. The remainder of the fund is used for what amounts to day trading as he looks for stocks that are about to catch the attention of other speculators. ''The stock moves two or three bucks and I move on,'' he said. **********But he keeps the stocks he really likes. One such stock is MicroStrategy, which produced a return of more than 1,000 percent for Mr. Slattery the first year he owned it. Then the software and Internet company was forced by its auditors to change its accounting, and the stock tanked. It is down 82 percent from its March 10 high, which came on the same day the Nasdaq market peaked. Mr. Slattery figures that Strategy.Com, MicroStrategy's Internet subsidiary, would trade for more than the $4.7 billion the whole company is now worth, if it were separated. **********What will scare away the investors in such funds? A few bad weeks won't do it. For many, it will take a long, grinding process, one that produces bad news in repeated quarterly statements, not just in newspaper headlines.

Most analysts predict the central bank's governors will increase interest rates when they meet next Thursday, but many worry that the move could stunt growth without shoring up the euro. **********''It is a self-produced problem,'' said Hans Meltzer, an economist at Deutsche Bank Research. ''If the E.C.B. were as generous about inflation as Mr. Greenspan and the Federal Reserve, it wouldn't have a problem.'' **********When the euro was introduced in January 1999, the European Central Bank announced that its goal was to keep inflation below 2 percent a year.  Ernst Welteke, president of the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, and a governor at the European Central Bank, drove home the nature of European worries in a toughly worded speech today. **********''The E.C.B. cannot be satisfied with the developments of the external value of the euro,'' Mr. Welteke said. Noting that the weak euro has led to sharply higher import prices, Mr. Welteke said the risks of inflation had increased measurably. **********Since its introduction, the euro has lost more than 20 percent of its value against the dollar. At its current value of about 91 cents, it remains near its all-time low of nearly 88 cents. **********The euro's weakness stems primarily from the drawing power of the American economy, which continues to attract huge amounts of foreign investment and thereby generate demand for dollars. The weak euro has aggravated inflationary dangers because it has pushed up the cost of imports, most particularly of oil. With prices still near their highest levels in years for oil, which is purchased exclusively in dollars, European fuel bills have pushed up the prices of other products. As a result, Europe's annualized rate of inflation is now about 2.4 percent. On Thursday, the German government reported that prices in German factories increased in July at the fastest rate in nearly a decade. **********But many economists argue that the inflation threat has been overstated. Mr. Meltzer of Deutsche Bank noted that most of the recent surge in prices stems from soaring oil prices rather than from more structural causes like rising wages. Stripped of oil and other volatile items, the core inflation rate is 1.3 percent. Many analysts are betting that central bankers will raise their baseline interest rates next week by one-half of a percentage point, from 4.25 percent to 4.75. That is still substantially lower than the United States federal funds rate of 6.50, , but it poses risks. **********The most obvious risk is that it will stop Europe's current economic upswing, just as unemployment in Germany and France is beginning to sink below 10 percent for the first time in years. If economic growth does slow, the decline could drive the value of the euro down. Though currencies normally rise when interest rates are increased, the euro's biggest source of weakness is Europe's slower economic growth compared with that of the United States. **********The currency risk was put into focus this week, when a closely watched survey of German business sentiment showed a sharp drop in confidence. The news quickly prompted some forecasters to conclude that German growth had peaked, and investors reacted by selling euros and briefly pushing their value below 89 cents. **********In hindsight, many analysts said they believed that the drop in confidence was misleading and that the German economy, Europe's biggest, still had room to grow. The German central bank has predicted that growth will approach 3 percent next year, and the Deutsche Bank predicts it will go slightly higher. **********But the fragility is clear. Recent data on Europe's trade balance showed that the weak euro continued to bolster exports by making them cheaper in world markets and that European imports were increasing.

The goal is to offer sponsors an easier way to buy everything from commercials during ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and ads in Disney Adventures magazine to banner ads on ESPN.com and spots on a giant video screen perched atop the ''Good Morning America'' studio in Times Square. **********The refocusing of the ABC Television Network's sales operations is to be accomplished through a new unit, ABC Unlimited, intended to integrate and coordinate the purchase of commercial time and ad space by marketers across all units of ABC's parent, the Walt Disney Company. This includes broadcast; cable; syndicated and local TV; radio; and print and online media. **********The changes, detailed yesterday at a news conference at the ABC office near Lincoln Center in Manhattan, involves promotions and new appointments for five executives as well as the hiring of about 50 employees to add to a staff of about 150. **********Until now, the ABC sales department had been widely considered the most traditional among the broadcast networks, reflecting the meat-and-potatoes approach of its longtime previous parent, Capital Cities/ ABC. By comparison, the rival CBS, now a part of Viacom Inc., formed CBS Plus, a division with a purpose similar to that of ABC Unlimited, in November 1998. Cable companies like the Turner Broadcasting System, part of Time Warner, have also assiduously pursued sales across disparate properties. **********ABC is ''keeping up with the Joneses,'' said Marc Berman, media analyst for the Mediaweek.com unit of VNU USA, who covered the news conference for The Programming Insider, a daily e-mail newsletter. **********Divisions like ABC Unlimited, dedicated to what is known in the media industry as cross-selling, are ''something all the networks have to think about,'' Mr. Berman said, as they seek to improve their effectiveness by broadening their horizons at a time when advertisers are turning increasingly to alternatives like the Internet, promotional campaigns and cause-related marketing. **********The shifts at ABC, described as the results of six months of study, planning and testing, are emblematic of the attempts by established media brands to keep abreast of upstart competitors amid a rapidly changing landscape. One purpose is to wean marketers from their long-held view of broadcast network television as only a ''cpm medium'' -- that is, one to be bought on the basis of the lowest cost per thousand viewers achieved through tough, confrontational bargaining, which diminishes perceptions of its worth. **********Rather than sell ''the same way we've done it for many, many years,'' said Alex Wallau, who became president of the network in June after 25 years at ABC, the idea was to foster ''more productive relationships and partnerships'' with marketers and agencies by making ABC Unlimited ''the point of entry for the entire range of media assets of the Disney company.'' **********''This is a huge allocation of people and resources to something at the heart of what we do,'' he added. **********ABC Unlimited will be headed by Mike Shaw, who becomes president for sales and marketing at the ABC Television Network. He succeeds Marvin Goldsmith, a longtime network executive being named to a new post, executive vice president at the ABC Broadcast Group, consulting on sales strategies. **********''Going to advertisers with an integrated marketing approach really is the key,'' said Mr. Shaw, 46, who is being promoted from executive vice president and national sales manager, the No. 2 post in the department behind Mr. Goldsmith, 59. Mr. Shaw will report to Mr. Wallau. **********''We want to sit down with advertisers at the beginning of the process and find out their marketing objectives,'' then determine how our various assets can respond to those needs,'' Mr. Shaw said. ''This is a long-term way of doing business.'' **********In the last year under Mr. Goldsmith, ABC became the highest-rated TV network as a result of the runaway success of ''Millionaire'' and broke revenue records with the telecasts of the Super Bowl in January and the Academy Awards in March. **********In the so-called upfront market in June, when commercial time is sold ahead of the annual TV season, ABC set another record by selling about $2.4 billion worth of spots to run in the 2000-2001 season. **********The ABC sales executives are ''at the top of their game,'' said Joe Mandese, who attended the news conference in his capacity as editor of The Myers Report, a media industry newsletter, so it ''is very symbolic they're moving in this direction.'' **********''All the networks are talking about wanting to get a bigger share of the budgets'' of major marketers, he added. ''It will be interesting to see how this plays out.'' **********Also involved in the reorganization is Laura Nathanson, 42, who is being promoted to executive vice president and national sales manager from executive vice president for prime-time sales. That broadens her purview to include other aspects of the broadcast schedule like daytime, news and children's programming. **********Bill Bund, 46, is being named to the new post of senior vice president for integrated sales. He had been manager for sports sales for the Central and Western division of ABC Sports, which recently underwent a similar reorganization of its ad sales operations, now handled by a new unit called ESPN ABC Sports Customer Marketing and Sales. **********And Dan Longest, 35, is being named to the new post of senior vice president for integrated marketing and promotion, reporting to Mr. Shaw. Previously, the network marketing department had reported to Mr. Wallau. That is intended to foster closer cooperation between the sales and promotion functions. **********One ''danger'' ABC Unlimited will try avoiding, Mr. Wallau said, is to succumb to the pressure to lower prices typically exerted by advertisers buying time and space across various properties of a media giant. **********''We have to make them understand and appreciate the value of what we're doing,'' he added.

As a result, the state's attorney, Samuel Del Villar, made the accusations against Mr. Espinoza public on Wednesday by filing a formal request with the Mexican Congress to strip him of his immunity. Opposition parties hold a razor-thin congressional majority, but it is unclear if they can muster enough votes later this spring to approve Mr. Espinoza's indictment and trial. **********Although several PRI mayors have appeared in recent decades to plunder city coffers, none has ever been formally charged, and no member of Mr. Zedillo's cabinet has faced criminal prosecution. **********Documents that Mr. Del Villar filed with Congress accused Mr. Espinoza of approving huge financial transfers from the city treasury to top aides, two of whom have been previously charged with fraud and are fugitives. **********Aides to Mr. Espinoza argued that some of the missing money was paid to television stations for city advertising, but they have been unable to document those transactions, prosecutors said. The newspaper La Jornada reported that some of the missing $50 million was paid in bribes to journalists covering City Hall during Mr. Espinoza's tenure. **********In a statement Mr. Espinoza read to a packed Mexico City news conference on Wednesday, he complained that he and other PRI leaders were being used as scapegoats by an opposition eager to ''discredit candidates who have served in PRI governments.'' He refused to respond to questions. **********Mr. Zedillo's office issued a statement expressing the president's ''complete confidence'' that the accusations were ''legally baseless.'' **********But Mr. Del Villar, who earned a Ph.D. in law at Harvard, has won crucial cases as the city's top prosecutor.

[Obituary, Page 51.] **********Syria itself, however, moved swiftly to give at least the appearance of stability. After the announcement of the death, Parliament began to pave the way for Mr. Assad's son Bashar, a 34-year-old ophthalmologist and army colonel, to take over. **********While an autocrat who brooked no dissent, Mr. Assad transformed Syria from a backwater nation into a semideveloped one and, more important, a regional power broker. Over the years, he earned begrudging acceptance from world leaders who criticized his outmoded Soviet-style leadership but came to appreciate his courtly tenacity and deep-seated convictions. **********''We had our differences, but I always respected him,'' President Clinton said today as he issued condolences from Northfield, Minn. **********Mr. Assad leaves big shoes to fill at the helm of a nation of 17 million whose isolation is reflected in the fact that it remains largely unconnected to the Internet. **********After the death of his oldest son in a car accident in 1994, Mr. Assad had turned to grooming his next oldest, Bashar, and a crucial formal step in the transition of power was to have taken place next Saturday during a rare political convention of Syria's ruling Baath Party. **********But Bashar Assad still has a potential family feud to quash with his uncle, Rifaat Assad, who always aspired to succeed his almost ascetic older brother. And beyond that, it is unclear whether the ruling Alawite ethnic minority led by the Assads will be able to retain its lock on Syrian politics under another member of the family. **********Bashar Assad, according to his father's authorized biographer, the English journalist Patrick Seale, ''would not deviate from his father's legacy.'' But even if he formally assumes power in the near future, it will take him considerable time to emerge from the shadow of his father and assert himself as leader. **********This opens up the possibility of a tense and destabilizing transition in Syria at a crucial time in the relationship between Syria and Lebanon and between Syria and Israel. Israel's recent troop withdrawal from southern Lebanon after 22 years scrambled the power lines in the Israeli-Lebanese-Syrian triangle. **********Although Mr. Assad took a resolutely hard line toward Israel, many Western diplomats believed that he was the linchpin to any breakthrough between Israel and its northern neighbors. Many believed that only Mr. Assad was strong enough to deliver a change in five decades of hostile habits. **********Still, beneath anxiety about what lies in the immediate future, some Israeli and Western leaders expressed hope tonight that Mr. Assad's death could stimulate a new political and economic opening of Syria that could improve the chances for peace. **********''For 30 years, Assad was Syria, and Syria was Assad,'' said the Israeli Justice Minister, Yossi Beilin. ''With his death, this is undoubtedly a different Syria. My hope is that whoever will replace him will understand that Syria's only chance for serious economic growth will come by way of peace with Israel.'' **********Palestinian leaders said they hoped that Palestinians and Syrians could reconcile after a long-strained relationship between Mr. Assad and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, which had put them at odds instead of side by side in their separate struggles with Israel. **********Mr. Assad had survived several assassination attempts and at least one previous heart attack and had suffered from a variety of debilitating illnesses for years. But despite his gaunt appearance and his infrequent travels abroad, many in Syria had wondered if talk of his imminent demise was not exaggerated. **********Syrian television made an official announcement only after the news had circulated first internationally. It showed members of the Syrian Parliament standing for a moment of silence, many of them crying and holding their heads in their hands. **********''This is a day of sadness and sorrow in every home, school, farm, factory and quarry,'' the announcer on state-run television said. ''Sadness is in the heart of every man, woman and child because the legacy of his accomplishments is a sun that will shine not just on this generation but on the many to come.'' **********In Israel, state television interrupted regular programming to run live broadcasts from Parliament -- a highly unusual sight here -- that included recitations from the Koran in memory of Mr. Assad. **********When Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel first took office last sumer, he assiduously courted Mr. Assad, issuing flattering public messages about his strength as a leader. Mr. Barak and many Western experts believed that Mr. Assad wanted to return to peace talks with Israel in order to regain the Golan Heights in his lifetime and to ease the burden on his presumed successor, his son. **********Mr. Assad was Syria's defense minister when Syria lost the Golan in the 1967 Middle East war. **********But after the ice between Israel and Syria was broken last winter, the short-lived peace effort between the two nations, with the United States as intermediary, screeched to a halt. **********In Geneva in March, Mr. Clinton made a final, failed attempt to revive the talks at a meeting with Mr. Assad. The meeting ended with American pronouncements that its diplomatic focus would shift to the Israeli-Palestinian track. **********But after Israel withdrew its troops last month from Lebanon, where Syria is the power broker, officials here and in Syria voiced tentative questions about renewing the peace effort. Mr. Barak, however, said publicly this week that he was wondering if Mr. Assad would ever be fully behind it. **********Israel expressed condolences tonight to the Syrian nation, but it also voiced concern over how a transition period would affect the calm that has reigned on its northern border since the troop withdrawal. **********''Israel views with importance the keeping of quiet on its borders with Syria and Lebanon and expects that Syria will continue to do so, too,'' said a statement issued by Mr. Barak's office tonight. **********Syria possesses a largely Russian-equipped military machine that is believed to be far less potent today than when Mr. Assad, a career military man, assumed power in 1970. But with mid-range and long-range missiles, and with 30,000 troops stationed in Lebanon, it remains a force to be reckoned with in the region. **********Syria installed the current civilian leadership of Lebanon. But after the recent Israeli troop withdrawal and with eagerness to reconcile their nation, the Lebanese leaders as well as the Hezbollah guerrilla movement backed by Syria and Iran started to test just how much autonomy Damascus would permit. This transition period could strengthen their move in that direction. **********Mr. Assad, known as the Lion of Damascus because his family name means lion in Arabic, was one of the last surviving members of a generation of Arab rulers after the deaths of King Hassan of Morocco and King Hussein of Jordan. **********Mr. Assad had surprised Middle East observers by attending King Hussein's funeral, a visit that marked a warming in what had been an icy relationship with Jordan. Since then, the late King Hussein's son, King Abdullah, has been a frequent visitor to Damascus and has cultivated a personal relationship with his fellow Western-educated scion, Bashar Assad. **********In much of the Arab world, Mr. Assad was seen as a purist who remained until his death one of the last few believers in Arab nationalism. He disdained those, like Egypt, Jordan and lastly the Palestinian Authority, that negotiated individual peace treaties with Israel. **********Mr. Assad believed that Israel wielded too much power in the region, and that the peace treaties reflected the imbalance of power. **********The Arab League praised him tonight as ''one who devoted his life to serving the Arab and Islamic nations and fighting for the recovery of their land and for Arab right.'' And in Gaza City, Mr. Arafat called for a three-day period of mourning and said the Palestinian people ''would stand with their Syrian brothers and believe in their ability to survive this critical moment.'' **********In Syria, Mr. Assad will be remembered quietly for some other traits as well -- like intolerance and the fear he inspired. A momentous marker of this was a massacre in Hama in 1982, when Mr. Assad succeeded in squelching an Islamic insurgency by having thousands killed. **********Still, the country immediately fell into deep mourning today. Black banners were unfurled from apartment house balconies in Damascus, and noise in the streets stilled. Preparation got under way tonight for his funeral, scheduled for Tuesday. **********Lebanese television reported tonight that Prime Minister Emile Lahoud of Lebanon had been talking to Mr. Assad on the telephone earlier today when the line suddenly went dead. ''His last words were, 'Our destiny is to build a better future for our countries,' '' Mr. Lahoud said of Mr. Assad.

Mattresses can get lumpy, and they are flammable to boot. And even money market accounts have been known to get into trouble. **********There are, however, some precincts in the investing world where people are less likely to suffer. Following are excerpts from conversations last week with analysts and portfolio managers about four such places in the market. **********Beyond a Technology Rush **********Charles T. Freeman is portfolio manager of the $15.6 billion Vanguard Windsor fund, which has stayed almost religiously focused on value stocks over the last few years while so many other money managers chased increasingly expensive technology shares. During the technology sell-off from March 10 through April 14, his fund gained 8.4 percent, versus a 34.2 percent loss in the Nasdaq composite. **********Q. What do you make of the volatility we have seen in the stock market so far this year, particularly in technology stocks? **********A. There is a lot of uncertainty and nervousness. We have had a real long run in the economy and an unusual run in the stock market. These are late-cycle jitters and are very understandable. **********The edginess is compounded by the fact that we are in a cycle of rising interest rates. None of us really know how many times the Fed is going to raise rates, and there is always the risk of them overshooting. So this is a scary time. **********Technology stocks seem like the last place to hide, and that gives us extreme valuations. **********Q. Given the way the market has performed over much of the last 12 months, a time when technology has outperformed nearly every other sector, is it surprising that investors continue to gravitate toward those stocks? **********A. Stocks in general have been weak since the middle of last year because of the Federal Reserve. It is not at all surprising when the Fed is raising rates to see stocks get hurt. Technology has been the exception. **********From July 1 of last year through the end of March, technology stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 index, which represent about one-third of the index, were up 60 percent. The other two-thirds of the S.& P. was down 3.7 percent. **********I don't think a lot of weight is being given to a recession right now, but it is hard to find any sign of it in the way technology shares are being valued. Nontechnology stocks, by comparison, have taken a much better account of what a recession might mean. **********Is technology spending sacrosanct? Probably. Is it deferrable? Probably, and in a recession it would be deferred. **********Q. What criteria do you use to identify and invest in value stocks? **********A. We like to buy stocks with low price-earnings ratios relative to the market, to be price-opportunistic when we buy them, to be disciplined on the sell side and to concentrate in areas where it makes sense. **********We try and not really stick our necks out. Stocks that trade at 15 to 16 times earnings are a nice platform. That is how we try and deal with risk, by not paying too much for things. **********Q. Of your top holdings, which stocks have the potential to do very well in coming months? **********A. At the end of March, our top holdings were AT&T, Alcoa, Citigroup, Associates First, Pharmacia & Upjohn, TJX, Aventis, I.B.M., MCI WorldCom, Burlington Resources and Washington Mutual. **********Of those, the four that strike us particularly are Alcoa, Pharmacia & Upjohn, Associates First and TJX. Those are stocks that all have upside from 30 percent to 60 percent. **********Q. At some point, the market will get a handle on when the Fed will finish raising rates. At that point, is it your view that the broad market will rally, and that technology will fall in favor of other sectors? **********A. It does seem that technology will slide as the rest of the market rallies, albeit irregularly. Our portfolio was up 14 percent in the month of March and rose some more in April. **********My take on the up leg in stocks like this is that the market is sniffing out the end to the Fed rate cycle. **********I think they will raise rates three more times and no more, which is what the bond market seems to be thinking. **********If that is true, then they will have finished tightening by the end of the fall. It would not be too early for the stock market to be anticipating that now. When that happens, money seems to go into a broad list of stocks and comes out of technology. **********A Dull Sector Changes Its Stripes **********Time was, utility stocks were most often associated with widows and orphans. Regulated streams of revenue and cash flow. Consistent dividend payments. No muss. No fuss. **********That was before deregulation, here and around the world. Utility stocks are still good for widows and orphans. But there are also some utility companies that pay absolutely no dividends, instead offering investors a growth stock story at a lower multiple than your basic dot-com. **********Jonathan C. Raleigh, a managing director and electric utility analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company, talked about what is happening in Power Land. **********Q. Utility stocks are not the uniformly stodgy, safe places to stick money that they used to be. Doesn't that mean that investors need to do at least some homework before considering an investment? **********A. Utilities used to be all the same. Now they are uniquely different. Some have only 5 percent of their business in unregulated areas. But with the onset of deregulation state by state, more and more assets are being deregulated, and more and more opportunities have arisen for utilities to invest in other assets. For some companies, that has translated into problems. **********Edison International and CMS Energy, to name two, are stocks that have done pretty poorly as unregulated investments: so far this year Edison International is down 29 percent and CMS is down 37 percent. They are the two worst performers in the S.& P. utility index, which comprises 29 companies. **********There has been a lot of talk about owning some of the traditional electric company stocks. I have said that is fine, you can do that, but if you want to take advantage of companies with hard assets, with real revenues and real cash flows, you have to look at the leaders in the power sector that have spent their lives as deregulated businesses. **********Q. It sounds like you have some nontraditional utility companies in mind. What are they, and why do you like them? **********A. The two most prominent ones are AES and Calpine. Neither transformed from regulated to unregulated. **********Calpine was the fifth-best-performing stock on the New York Stock Exchange last year, rising more than 400 percent. Over the last three years, it is up 655 percent. **********Last year, AES was the second-best-performing stock I cover, rising 58 percent. Over the last three years, it is up 228 percent. **********These are not utilities, because they are not regulated. They are growth power companies. Neither stock pays a dividend, and there are risks associated with both. **********Q. Are there any traditional utility stocks that you like? **********A. Peco Energy, the Philadelphia-based utility, is one. Unicom in Chicago is another. And Constellation Energy, which is the Baltimore-based utility. Those our our favorite plain-vanilla utilities. **********Q. Aren't there also some utilities that are transforming themselves into fiber optic cable companies? **********A. There are companies that are building out fiber optic cable. The biggest to date is Montana Power, which about a month ago announced they are selling the remnants of their utility business, so that all that is left is broadband. They have been in the business for the last 10 to 12 years. And Dominion Resources is doing it in the Middle Atlantic and Southern states. **********Brighter Days in Real Estate **********He wasn't the Warren Buffett of his time, but Mark Twain said he liked real estate because he was pretty sure God wasn't going to make any more of it. Or words to that effect. **********For the last couple of years, however, investors have shunned that view. Real estate investment trusts, the securitized way to play the dirt market, have been underperformers. **********That has begun to change. Jonathan Litt, senior real estate analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, discussed  the possible security, if not serenity, in investing in bricks and mortar. **********Q. What is the case for buying REIT stocks? **********A. REIT's are in a particularly good spot today because investors are increasingly becoming more nervous about the broader market and questioning valuations. **********The reason you own REIT's is that currently they trade at a discount to net asset value of about 12 percent. Historically, they have traded at a premium of about 7 percent. **********As a group, they also have the highest yields of any stock group, at about 8.6 percent. That is higher than most investment grade corporate bonds. **********In addition, the real estate business in the United States is very healthy. Ninety percent of REIT revenue this year is identifiable, because owners have guaranteed lease obligations. There is not a lot of guesswork for chief executives when they come in in the morning. **********All that said, if the market decides it hates REIT's, the stocks will get whipsawed about. This is not a money market account. There is risk to the valuations. **********Q. Isn't real estate highly vulnerable to rising interest rates? And aren't we pretty far along in the current cycle, particularly if the Fed inadvertently overdoes it and pushes the economy into recession? **********A. Today, REIT's are conservatively leveraged. We are talking about 50 percent or less debt. We have never had more conservative leverage on real estate. It is a phenomenon of the 1990's that is a residue of the 1980's. **********And why are rates going up? Because of concerns about inflation. In times of inflation, investors have traditionally wanted to own gold and real estate. Rents are tied to the rate of inflation, which is a great store of wealth for investors. **********I see REIT's being in a good place for the next recession, as opposed to the last one, which was like the 100-year flood in the real estate business. **********Yes, we are definitely past the sweet spot of the real estate cycle, which lasted from 1993 to about 1997. We are now in equilibrium in terms of supply, demand and pricing. **********Over the next 6 to 12 months, we may see a little overbuilding in areas like Dallas, Houston, Atlanta and South Florida, but demand appears so strong it will be absorbed. **********Q. Which REIT stocks are you recommending? **********A. First, the focus should be on the blue chips, and investors should own three, not just one. **********The stocks we like the most right now are Avalon Bay Communities, a multifamily REIT based in Alexandria, Va.; Boston Properties, which owns high-profile office assets in markets like New York, Boston, Washington and San Francisco; and Simon Property Group, which is our top pick among retail REIT's. They are doing some of the most innovative things in changing the way regional malls are operated. **********Food Stocks as Comfort **********People have to eat, but for the last year investors have absolutely hated food stocks. **********For the 12 months ended March 31, the food stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 36.5 percent. Ouch. **********Still, there is evidence over the last five weeks that some investors are taking comfort in food: since March 15, stocks including Bestfoods and Quaker Oats are up 30 percent or more. John O'Neil, an analyst at PaineWebber, served up some thoughts on the business, and the stocks: **********Q. Why has such a stable business been so beaten up by investors? **********A. Part of it is due to a shift in focus to more growth-oriented stocks in the overall market. **********The fall in the food group was worst between November and February of this year, when for no structural reason the stocks fell off a cliff. During that period they were oversold, and fell to 14 times to 15 times earnings. That is the lowest they have been in 10 years. **********Q. So, these food stocks are on sale. But shouldn't people looking for growth steer clear of them? **********A. Over all, the food industry only grows at the rate of the population. The successful food companies will be those that can increase their share of the consumer stomach. **********Historically, people have thought of food stocks as a group. But they are not all created equal. You want to own these stocks not just for defensive reasons, but as assets that can grow and appreciate as well. **********And there are a handful of companies that are well positioned to grow earnings at a low double-digit rate. Marketing is the key to growth for food companies. **********Q. So who in your view are the best marketers in the business? **********A. Over time, there are only a handful of stocks worth owning. We are focusing on four -- Quaker Oats, Bestfoods, General Mills and Nabisco. These are stocks you can buy and put away. They have the skill and execution capabilities to sustain long-term growth. **********Q. You seem especially keen on Bestfoods. Why? **********A. Bestfoods is the best example of a buy-it-and-put-it-away stock. **********They have grown earnings at a 12 percent annual compound rate over the last 10 years. Two-thirds of its earnings come from outside the United States, and it gets 35 percent of its total profits from emerging markets. **********As a food company, they are less susceptible to economic downturns in those markets than other consumer goods companies. **********It is like Coke or Gillette or Colgate, but the stock trades at half the multiple of those companies. **********Q. Which of the companies you follow just don't get it? **********A. There are a handful of food stocks you don't want to touch, because they are not spending to grow their businesses. And if they decide to invest soon, their earnings will be lower near term, and the stocks will fall. **********Campbell Soup is the prototype of the stodgy food company. Volumes are down in soup, in Pepperidge Farm cookies, in V8 beverages. And their marketing expenditures are down. **********We would also shy away from H. J. Heinz and Kellogg. We have a neutral rating on Hershey Foods as well. The outlook there is improving, but the news is already priced into the stock. **********Q. What is going to happen with Nabisco? Carl C. Icahn is looking at it. Do you see other bidders coming in? **********Q. Nabisco is for sale. If it can be sold at all, I think it will be sold by the end of the year. **********In addition to Mr. Icahn, I think Danone, a French food company, will take a look at it. And I think Campbell Soup should look at it. **********Acquiring Nabisco would give Campbell an opportunity to diversify and get a management team that is among the best in the industry."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/11/world/opening-campaign-netanyahu-invokes-will-of-the-nation.html": {"writer_name": "Deborah Sontag", "pub_date": "2000-12-11", "snippet": "Former Israeli Prime Min Benjamin Netanyahu announces intention to recapture Likud Party leadership and office of prime minister; says Prime Min Ehud Barak should not be allowed to frustrate will of nation by blocking Netanyahu's ability to run fo...", "word_count": 1288, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Opening Campaign, Netanyahu Invokes 'Will of the Nation'", "print_headline": "Opening Campaign, Netanyahu Invokes 'Will of the Nation'", "body_text": " **********Having disappeared from the Israeli political scene for 19 months, former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu returned tonight in full, media-savvy Netanyahu style. He flew in from abroad, swept onto the evening news and proclaimed his intention to recapture first the Likud Party leadership and then the office of prime minister. **********Back in the embrace of the television cameras, Mr. Netanyahu said Prime Minister Ehud Barak should not be allowed to frustrate ''the will of the nation'' by blocking his ability to run for office. **********Mr. Netanyahu said he would work to brush aside the political and legal obstacles to his candidacy that were placed in his path by Mr. Barak's resignation from office today. **********''The man who bypassed the will of the nation while in power is now bypassing its will in order to stay in power,'' Mr. Netanyahu said, giving a taste of his combat readiness. ''He is not resigning in order to restore calm or stop the Palestinian violence or to return security to our people. Something else is happening here: the most cynical political trick in the history of Israel. He is resigning in order to prevent the people from freely and democratically electing a new prime minister and Parliament.'' Still, for Mr. Netanyahu, who commands a significant lead in opinion polls, becoming a candidate will not be as easy as announcing his intention to run. Mr. Barak indeed foiled his rival's expected candidacy in an unexpected political strategem this weekend, and it will take dexterous political and legal maneuvering by Mr. Netanyahu to survive Mr. Barak's move. **********On Saturday night Mr. Barak wrested the political initiative from a Parliament prepared to vote soon to dissolve and head toward new general elections in late spring. **********He announced that he would resign instead, forcing a special election within 60 days for prime minister alone. Under the law for special elections, the field of candidates is limited to members of Parliament, which excludes Mr. Netanyahu. **********Mr. Netanyahu, 51, quit his seat and the Likud leadership on the day that Mr. Barak, 58, overwhelmingly defeated him for prime minister in May 1999. He then turned over the reins of a weakened party to Ariel Sharon, 72, and fled politics for the life of a consultant and lecturer. In the Israeli nationalist camp, there has been a steady drumbeat for his return, especially since the eruption of the Palestinian uprising 10 weeks ago. **********But Mr. Sharon long ago discarded the idea that he was a mere caretaker, and he now hopes to run for prime minister as the Likud candidate -- another stumbling block, although probably a minor one, for Mr. Netanyahu. **********Judging by the polls, Mr. Barak stands a much better chance against Mr. Sharon, which clearly influenced his decision to resign. **********Almost two weeks ago, when Parliament approved a draft bill to dissolve, Mr. Barak said he would not fight the legislators' desire to depose him. At the time, he also said he would not circumvent it by resigning to keep Mr. Netanyahu out of the race. **********At his televised news conference tonight, Mr. Netanyahu, whose nickname is Bibi, gave a dramatic reading of Mr. Barak's words from then: ''I already beat Bibi, and I'm not afraid of him. The possibility of resigning in order to neutralize him did not even pass through my mind for a single moment.'' **********But during the subsequent two weeks, Mr. Barak said, he came to believe that many members of Parliament did not really want to undergo new elections. He said he had decided not to ''drag'' them through a new general election and to seek a fresh mandate from the people for himself alone. **********Those two weeks also featured a steady stream of opinion polls that showed him losing badly to Mr. Netanyahu. The polls showed Mr. Barak's Labor Party suffering a debilitating blow as well, and there was discord within Labor. Mr. Barak changed his mind. **********This afternoon, President Moshe Katsav accepted the prime minister's resignation, which takes effect on Tuesday, and congratulated him for seeking to determine at the polls whether the entire nation stands behind him. **********Mr. Barak, a tight smile darting across his face, quickly corrected the Israeli president. In 1999 he sought to be the leader of ''ev-er-y-bo-dy,'' as his slogan said. Now, his sights are lowered. ''A majority,'' he said. ''For me, a majority of the people is enough.'' **********Later today, by an informal vote, the Labor Party's central committee swiftly chose Mr. Barak to be its candidate for prime minister. That ended a brief turbulent period within the party during which a dovish faction had considered running a candidate against him for party leader. **********With the election around the corner, there was no time for an internal race, and Mr. Barak stood unopposed in today's show-of-hands vote. Shimon Peres, a leader of the doves and a former prime minister, did not attend the meeting. **********''He was elected by a majority, and it was a democratic move,'' said Avraham Burg, the speaker of Parliament, who abandoned the idea of opposing the prime minister because of the accelerated election schedule. **********Mr. Barak thus successfully quelled potential opposition within own party, although there is still some discussion of the peace camp mounting a third-party candidate. Israeli Arab lawmakers are also considering fielding a candidate, which would be a serious blow to Mr. Barak. And several Likud lawmakers are contemplating mounting a challenge to Mr. Sharon if Mr. Netanyahu is not allowed to run. **********But Mr. Barak's most daunting opponent is Mr. Netanyahu. Mr. Netanyahu has two options for finding a way into the race. His followers are pursuing both. First they are seeking to amend the law governing special elections to allow someone who is not a member of Parliament to run for prime minister. **********That is a cumbersome route, because it requires fast-tracking a bill and then earning an absolute majority of the fractious 120-member Parliament. Such a bill could also face a court challenge; Israel has never had a prime minister who was not also a member of Parliament. **********Mr. Netanyahu seemed to be urging his followers down a different route. He said he believed that Parliament should continue what it started two weeks ago and take a final vote to dissolve itself. **********In that case, Parliament's legal adviser ruled today, Mr. Netanyahu would be allowed to run and elections for prime minister and Parliament would be held simultaneously. It is widely expected that Feb. 6 will be the election day. **********But Israeli political analysts said tonight that it was far from certain that there was majority backing for dissolving the house. Parties who fear that they will lose seats are not eager. For instance, Shas, the rigorously Orthodox party that represents working-class Sephardic Jews, is known to be reluctant. **********Leaders of Shas said they were awaiting a ruling from the rabbis who guide them. **********Indeed, spurred by Mr. Barak's maneuver, the political system spun into a frenzy of activity today as the prime minister's associates and opponents alike consulted legal advisers to determine what possible paths lay ahead. **********Many predicted that the complex legal issues would end up in court. Inevitably, then, Israelis noted that having built their suburbs and shopping malls on the American model, they were now mirroring the disarray in the American political system. **********''In an act of symbiotic identification, Barak has brought Israel into a constitutional frenzy reminiscent of what is taking place in America,'' Chemi Shalev wrote under the headline ''Act of Kamikaze'' in the newspaper Maariv. ''The difference is that, one, there they have already had elections and, two, there they don't know who has lost yet.'' **********Similarly, Nahum Barnea, a columnist for Yediot Ahronot, writing that ''no trick from the law books'' should prevent Mr. Netanyahu from running if he is the favored right-wing candidate, asked, ''What are we, America?''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/11/technology/watching-the-great-fire-from-a-safe-distance.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-05-11", "snippet": "Watching the Great Fire From a Safe Distance", "word_count": 1022, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Watching the Great Fire From a Safe Distance", "print_headline": "Watching the Great Fire From a Safe Distance", "body_text": " **********Watching the Great Fire From a Safe Distance **********May 11, 2000 **********NEWS WATCH Watching the Great Fire From a Safe Distance **********o one may ever know whether the convergence of Mrs. O'Leary's cow and a lantern started the Great Fire of Chicago on Oct. 8, 1871, even though it is known that the blaze began in or near the O'Leary barn.

Two devices are required to ensure secure conversations -- one for the caller and another for the recipient. Once both users press the \"secure\" button on their Privatel boxes, their conversation is unintelligible to people who might be tapping the wire illegally. **********The device was designed by L-3 Communications, a New York company that develops communications systems and other high-tech products. According to the company, the Privatel is the same device that has been used by the United States military, the National Security Agency, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, among others. Developers at L-3 expect that it will be popular among executives who rely on telephones to conduct business with people in other countries, where restrictions on wiretapping by corporations and government agencies are often nonexistent. **********\"People don't recognize that there is no protection of security overseas,\" said Frank Lanza, L-3's chairman and chief executive. \"There is tremendous vulnerability.\" **********Mr. Lanza would not comment on whether the device's encryption could be descrambled by the United States government. But it was the N.S.A. that approved L-3's commercialization of Privatel, so it seems likely that federal agencies have figured out a way to decode the device's encryption. **********Each Privatel unit costs $595; the price drops to $495 if 100 or more devices are bought at a time. **********LISA GUERNSEY **********When No Excuse Will Do: Cards for Home Printers **********Through the miracle of technology, electronic greeting cards can really save your hide when holidays (like, say, Mother's Day THIS weekend) sneak up on you.

D. &nbsp; BIERSDORFER **********Hearing Aid's Flexible Cover Makes a Good Fit Easy to Get **********Walk-and-wear hearing is what Dr. Craig Newman, an audiologist at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, calls the new hearing aids he has been dispensing. **********For the past few months, Dr. Newman has been equipping patients with a tiny digital hearing aid (about the size of a raisin) that is easy to fit. **********The device is slipped into a soft foam disposable cover that is much more flexible than the harder coverings of other hearing aids. The foam, with a microchip inside, slides right into the ear canal. **********\"The audiologist programs the chip to provide clear sounds, and you are in and out the same day,\" Dr. Newman said. **********The hearing aid, a gray plastic device, is manufactured by Sonic Innovations in Salt Lake City. A patient's hearing is evaluated and an impression is made of the ear. In a few weeks, the patient returns to have the doctor check the fit, Dr. Newman said. **********One patient, Judy Simpson of Magna, Utah, said she liked the device because it eliminated the cleaning chores necessary with her former hearing aid. **********\"When the foam cover gets dirty, I can just throw it away and put in a new one,\" she said. \"And because it's so tiny, most people can't see it. **********\"They think I've gone in for ear surgery because they can't see a big thing sticking out of my ear.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **********ANNE EISENBERG **********Home | Site Index | Site Search | Forums | Archives | Marketplace **********Quick News | Page One Plus | International | National/N.Y. | Business | Technology | Science | Sports | Weather | Editorial | Op-Ed | Arts | Automobiles | Books | Diversions | Job Market | Real Estate | Travel **********Help/Feedback | Classifieds | Services | New York Today **********Copyright 2000 The New York Times Company"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/08/your-money/IHT-hard-times-for-hardcore-value-fund.html": {"writer_name": "Judith Rehak", "pub_date": "2000-01-08", "snippet": "LIKE MOST of its stand-alone peers in the United States, the $61 million Greenspring Fund is a no-load fund.

In a country where fund families routinely spend millions of dollars a year on promotion, it does not advertise, nor is it sold by brokers. Most of its shareholders find it by word of mouth or press reports. **********So it follows that Charles Carlson, Greenspring's manager for almost a decade, is accustomed to being on his own, his fund having earned a reputation as a low-risk, hard-core value vehicle that paid above-average dividends and held up well in down markets. **********But in the last two years, it has been lonelier than usual. Like most funds that specialize in undervalued plays, Greenspring has struggled in one of the worst markets for this kind of investing in years. Its sectors of choice \u2014 real estate investment trusts, small cap stocks, junk bonds \u2014 have performed dismally. **********\"We're a balanced fund with a distinctive strategy,\" Mr. Carlson said. \"Our equities are in hard-core value securities, and our bond portion is in special situations. Not too many balanced funds do that.\" **********Nor is he about to alter his strategy, which produced two years of top quartile performance before a 16 percent loss in 1998 and a 2.7 percent return this year. **********\"My current portfolio is the highest quality at the lowest price in years,\" he said. **********To get an idea of how he makes his choices, consider his largest holding: a 6 percent stake in \"busted\" convertible bonds from Waste Management Inc., the largest trash hauler in the United States. **********Convertibles are bonds that can be swapped for stock in their issuers under certain conditions. They are considered busted when the stock falls so much that an investor would lose money by exercising the conversion feature. **********Typically, investors who bought a bond because of the conversion feature bail out of a busted issue, causing the price to fall and the yield to rise. But potential buyers are often slow to focus on the high yield, Mr. Carlson said, which for him spells opportunity. **********In the case of Waste Management, its shares have plunged to around $17, from $60 in May, as the company became entangled in a series of accounting problems after merging with a competitor. But Mr. Carlson is betting that it will get back on track, and, accordingly, he has snapped up the company's convertibles for an average 84 cents on the dollar, currently yielding 10.5 percent to maturity on Feb. 1, 2002. The conversion feature will be valuable if Waste Management's stock rises above $43.56. **********Another busted convertible in Greenspring's portfolio is from Kellstrom Industries Inc., a company in the aircraft parts and leasing business. Last fall, it announced a joint venture that would take the leasing assets off its balance sheet. **********\"Since that meant a lower growth rate, the common stock fell precipitously, and the convertible went with it,\" Mr. Carlson said. But investors failed to recognize that it was a good move for the bonds, so their price fell, and yield soared to 22 percent to maturity in October 2002. Such plays have contributed to a yield of 11.8 percent on the fixed-income portion of the Greenspring portfolio, as of Dec. 23. **********Greenspring's equity picks \u2014 57 percent of the fund \u2014 are equally iconoclastic. The biggest holding, at 3.4 percent, is UnumProvident Corp., a year-old merger of the two largest U.S. disability insurers. A series of missteps and a larger-than-expected $217 million loss for the third quarter caused the shares to lose half their value, although they have started to recover since the former chairman of Provident took over as chief of the merged companies. The stock sells for only 11 times expected 2000 earnings. **********One theme that has paid off for the fund is takeover candidates. Among current holdings are Reliastar Financial Corp., a life insurer that Mr. Carlson said he expected to be acquired now that U.S. banks can own insurers. **********Greenspring's performance began to pick up in the final weeks of 1999, and Mr. Carlson received a vote of confidence from Laura Lallos, editor of the on-line service for Morningstar Inc., the Chicago fund data company. **********\"Managers like him have had a hard time,\" she said. \"But he does ferret out value and find stories that work out. I still have confidence in him when those stocks come back into favor.\" **********For further information: **********GREENSPRING FUND.

Each had paid $1,900 to $2,900 for the privilege of attending this ''floating palace of populism'' as Mr. Hightower described it: a Holland America cruise ship, the M.S. Ryndam, which features a quarter-mile jogging track, a casino, 24-hour room service and a daily lecture on the art of cigar appreciation. **********This year is the Nation's 135th year, making it the oldest weekly magazine in America, and yet it has never turned a profit, said Victor Navasky, its publisher since 1978. (He added that there was a rumor the magazine once turned a profit for three years, but he has been unable to figure out when.) The magazine has instead supported itself with contributions from private donors like Michael Douglas and Paul Newman; some minor fund-raising efforts and some ad and subscription sales. According to the Audit Bureau of Circulations, the magazine's rate base, the circulation guaranteed to advertisers, is about 97,500. **********But that is all changing now, Mr. Navasky said in an interview over a breakfast of sausage links and scrambled eggs in the Rotterdam Room. This year the magazine is the closest it has ever been to profitability: in 1996, the magazine lost $900,000, he said; in 1998, $300,000, and last year, it only lost $166,000. This year, The Nation might break even, he said. **********In order to make money, however, the magazine has found itself relying on fund-raising techniques that do not quite fit with the themes of anti-commercialism in its pages. **********On the Ryndam, for example, there was a counter spread with Nation pamphlets advertising The Nation Platinum Visa card, which is illustrated with an Edward Koren drawing of Uncle Sam reading the magazine and holding his head in shock. The Nation, reads the pamphlet, has been ''politically charged since 1865.'' The Visa program, despite some criticism from readers about its capitalist aspirations, made about $50,000 last year for The Nation, Mr. Navasky said. **********And there is The Nation Legacy program, which boldly encourages potential donors to make bequests to The Nation in their will. Mr. Navasky said that arrangement was by its nature a mixed blessing. **********''A lawyer calls you up and says, 'I've got some good news and some bad news,' '' he said last week. '' 'The bad news is that Mr. So-and-So died. The good news is that he went back and forth for 15 years about who would get the money, and for a while there it was the A.C.L.U., but guess what? You won the draw.' '' **********While the platinum Visa card and the predeath bequests are unconventional ways for a magazine to make money, the cruise is perhaps most unconventional. For the last three years -- as long as the cruise has been up and running -- Nation patrons have complained vigorously about the fact that these fund-raising seminars are held on cruise ships, which have been accused of exploiting nonunion employees as well as being environmental polluters and vandals of fragile ocean ecosystems, cruise patrons said. **********But they keep coming back: 375 patrons attended the first cruise, 175 attended last year's and more than 300 attended this year's trip, which cruised from Fort Lauderdale and visited Half Moon Cay in the Bahamas; Georgetown, Grand Cayman; Cozumel, Mexico; and Key West. **********On past cruises, repeat guests like John O'Neill, a Marxist who looked more like a Republican heavy in his spanking-white deck shoes, Rolex watch and Holland America windbreaker -- have tried to organize unions for the ship's workers. **********(Sometimes, Nation patrons complain about issues unrelated to the cruise venue. On last year's cruise to Alaska, the Nation contributor Christopher Hitchens made a crude joke about Princess Diana, prompting a women's caucus session. This year, verbal fisticuffs broke out between those who supported Al Gore versus those who supported Ralph Nader.) **********And on every cruise, there are loud complaints about the fuel being used to propel the boat from one tourist destination to the next. **********''It bothers me that we are burning a huge amount of petroleum to be at sea,'' Ms. Kingsolver said at the global warming conference. ''And if we did nothing but sit on this ship and consume food and create garbage, that would be worse. But if everybody who can gets off the ship and walks 100 feet away from the buyers and sellers and money-lenders in port and gets to see what a mangrove swamp is or see some of the endemic species, then that person will take away a concern for global warming and disappearing species.'' **********(Later, Mr. Navasky sent a note up to the stage to be read aloud by Mr. Hightower, the panel's moderator, which advised the audience not to worry, that the fuel powering the ship was a vegetable oil derived from ''genetically altered mung beans gently harvested by unionized workers.'') **********Guests are hardly dispassionate on what most of them conceive of as a highly ironic arrangement. **********''There is a certain irony, that is for sure,'' said Suzanne Ivester, a copy editor from Knoxville, Tenn. ''We're burning fuel, the cruise employees have no unions, and at times I wonder if it doesn't make sense just to have this in a hotel somewhere.'' **********Barbara Williams, Mr. Hayden's wife, called the cruise ''one of the necessary evils of keeping something afloat. I'm married to a politician so I understand those things.'' **********Of course, the reason to do the cruise despite the fat-cat trappings is that it makes money for the magazine -- about $750 a person, and if you consider that 300 people paid to attend this year, well, that's a good piece of change. **********One of the richest ironies of The Nation cruises is that Mr. Navasky was inspired by the success of a similar cruise program run by The National Review, which is as right-wing as The Nation is left-wing liberal. Not only that: Eric Alterman, a Nation contributor, wrote an essay for the magazine in 1997 about a week he spent on a cruise to Alaska with The National Review, describing in vicious detail the elaborate food, the servile staff and the ostentatious surroundings with a disdain that would be telling and amusing if it weren't the exact same ship The Nation cruised on this year, the M.S. Ryndam, that he were describing. **********''My gosh, I didn't even realize that,'' Mr. Navasky said. ''Oops.'' **********Clearly, it is difficult to hold a serious dinner discussion about the tragedy of post-communist Russia when two dozen Indonesian waiters are conducting a parade of baked alaskas past your table. But the idea is to create a sense of community with other Nation readers. **********''It is wonderful to be a leftist surrounded by other leftists, and not feel solitary and weird about it,'' Ms. Kingsolver said. ''It is such a relief to be able to sit at a dinner table and know that you are not going to hear a sexist joke or a racist remark about the wait staff. There are so many Republicans out there. You just don't know where they'll turn up.'' **********And, of course, there may be a kind of smug satisfaction in criticizing the hypocrisy of the cruise itself, several passengers said. **********''Complaining about it gives you something to do,'' Stan Ivester, a University Press editor based in Knoxville, said. ''Other than skeet-shooting off the back of the boat.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/03/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-accounts-595098.html": {"writer_name": "Constance Hays", "pub_date": "2000-04-03", "snippet": "Roundup of advertising account changes (S)", "word_count": 98, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Accounts", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Accounts", "body_text": " *********** American Public Transportation Association, Washington, to Periscope Marketing Communications, Minneapolis, to handle its first account.

Alan Nevins, a prominent literary agent with Michael Ovitz's Artists Management Group in Los Angeles, took promotion a step further last week by placing orders for at least 18,000 copies of his client's new book at a handful of small bookstores that report sales to The Times's list keepers. **********''This order of books should be reported the week ending August 18th to The New York Times in the business category, as an off-site author book signing,'' Mr. Nevins wrote in a fax to one bookstore, putting the date in bold for emphasis. **********Times editors involved with the best-seller list said Mr. Nevins's effort would not influence their compilation, because unusually large bulk orders are deemed suspect and are typically not counted. But Mr. Nevins's activities seem likely to reinforce concerns among publishers and bookstores about efforts to influence the various best-seller lists artificially. **********For his part, Mr. Nevins said manipulating the best-seller list was not his intention when he sent orders worth more than $75,000 to four Los Angeles bookstores for thousands of copies of the new book, ''Hope From My Heart: 10 Lessons for Life,'' written by his client Rich DeVos, the 74-year-old co-founder of the marketing giant Amway. **********Mr. Nevins said he arranged the sales on behalf of companies that distribute Amway products so they could resell the books at a markup during their fall sales conferences. Amway sells a variety of items like cosmetics and soap through a pyramid-style network of salespeople. He said he arranged special discounts from the publisher because of the size of the orders, but Mr. Nevins declined to explain why he opted against the even cheaper alternatives of buying through a book distributor or directly from the publisher. **********But Ron Land, a sales executive at the book's publisher, Thomas Nelson Publishers, said that getting the book on the best-seller list was indeed the motive for arranging the sales at bookstores. **********''The purpose of directing those sales through the stores was to get the book a presence in the marketplace and get it on the list, and give our marketing a jump-start,'' Mr. Land said. He said he believed that it was ''very common'' for business book authors to arrange bulk purchases either from seminars they lead or companies they run, directing the sales through stores to get on the lists. **********''Most people who are successful in the business book area have a large machine behind them, like Amway; that is just the way things are done nowadays,'' he said. **********Owners of the stores involved say Mr. Nevins made his intentions clear to them as well. **********Mr. Nevins's firm, Artists Management, issued a statement yesterday: ''We are concerned about the issues that have been raised. As a matter of corporate policy, we don't condone or support any activities that could potentially jeopardize the integrity of any best-seller list. We have asked our outside counsel to conduct a thorough fact-finding review of the matter and will take whatever action is appropriate.'' **********Mr. Nevins's effort began last week with calls to the bookstores with an unusual proposition involving Mr. DeVos's new book. **********Mr. Nevins offered to pay the stores in advance to order thousands of books at deep discounts from the publisher, for direct shipment elsewhere. ''Many thanks for your help in this matter,'' he wrote in his fax.  ''More to come!'' **********Some bookstores played along. **********''We said fine,'' said Mahri Kerley, owner of Chaucer's Bookstore in Santa Barbara, Calif. Mr. Nevins sent her a check for $25,200, instructing her to pay $22,680 to Thomas Nelson Publishers for 6,000 copies of the book. At $3.78 cents a copy, that was a considerable discount from the normal price to bookstores of about $6.50 a copy. And the arrangement left Ms. Kerley $2,520 in profit without the risk of stocking a single book. **********''It was amazing,'' she said. ''Who am I to turn it down?'' **********Ms. Kerley said she happily reported the sales to The Times, knowing that the best-seller list compilers would disregard the order as an anomaly. But she did not tell that to Mr. Nevins. ''I figured that he had to have that much brains,'' she said. **********At Mr. Nevins's request, Dutton's Brentwood Bookstore, in Brentwood, Calif., bought and reported sales of about 8,000 books. After calling Dutton's for advice on Mr. Nevins's proposal, Chevalier's Books in Los Angeles also bought and reported sales of 4,000 copies. **********One bookstore balked at Mr. Nevins's request. ''I put my finger to my nose because it stunk,'' said Karen Watkins of Vroman's Bookstore, in Pasadena, Calif., who received a fax from Mr. Nevins outlining the same terms. **********She said she immediately reported to The Times and to the American Booksellers Association that a scheme was afoot to manipulate the best-seller list. ''I was stunned that he put something like this in writing,'' Ms. Watkins said. No other independents or any of the chains reported any orders at all for the DeVos book. **********Mr. Nevins is not the first to try to influence The Times's best-seller list. In 1995, Business Week reported that Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema arranged large purchases of their own book, ''The Discipline of Market Leaders.'' The magazine said a consulting company associated with the authors paid $250,000 to buy 10,000 copies of their book and funneled 30,000 to 40,000 additional purchases through corporate clients, all made at stores. Times editors said the efforts might have influenced the book's rank on the list, but not its appearance there. **********The Times does not disclose its survey methodology, a secrecy that some critics say fuels speculation about potential manipulations. **********''People in the business are suspicious because The Times's formula is guarded like some kind of secret sauce,'' said Oren Teicher, chief operating officer of the American Booksellers Association, a trade group representing independent bookstores. The association compiles a best-seller list of its own each week, based on sales reports from 350 stores whose participation is publicly disclosed. **********Michael Kagay, The Times's surveys editor, whose department compiles the list, said the paper kept its methods secret to make outwitting its system more difficult. **********Charles McGrath, editor of The Times Book Review, said that although manipulating the list was not impossible, it would be expensive and difficult. **********Mr. Kagay said the paper relied on reports from big chains as well as a constantly changing list of hundreds of independent stores. The paper does not disclose the stores' names, although people in the industry contend that they are widely known. Mr. Nevins managed to call at least four stores that report to The Times. **********After receiving sales reports from stores, the Times editors look for unusual sales patterns. In many cases, the editors remove or mark down unusual sales, Mr. Kagay said. When they decide that including the bulk sales is appropriate -- sales to a local book club, for example -- the editors also note on the weekly published list which books received bulk orders. **********Mr. Land of Thomas Nelson, a religious publisher based in Nashville, said it was partly the frequency of such special notes that led him to believe it was common practice for a business author to arrange bulk orders of his own book. **********Mr. Kagay said the extremely improbable sales of Mr. DeVos's book -- at a time when no other stores reported any sales, and coming from small stores that report only a few hundred sales of even a Harry Potter book -- certainly would have excluded the DeVos book from The Times's list."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/18/business/international-business-a-new-horizon-for-china-in-trade.html": {"writer_name": "Craig Smith", "pub_date": "2000-12-18", "snippet": "Focus on effect on world trade of China's entry into World Trade Organization; few of immediate changes will be as momentous as opening of nation's telecommunications industry; foreigners will be able to buy up to 25 percent of Chinese mobile netw...", "word_count": 858, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A New Horizon for China in Trade", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; A New Horizon for China in Trade", "body_text": " **********Liang Bingjun, chatting on his mobile telephone, is one reason the West ought to be excited about China joining the World Trade Organization next year. **********A quarter of every dollar spent on the phone by Mr. Liang and other mobile phone owners in China could belong to a foreign company as soon as China joins the W.T.O. That's not small change. With more than 65 million cell phone users, China is already the world's second-largest wireless market and is expected to surpass even the United States by the end of next year. **********Telecommunications is just one way in which China's trade organization membership will make an immediate splash. While reams of questions remain about what will happen after the world's most populous country joins the global trading club, there are some reasonable certainties about instant changes that will alter the global market forever. Others will happen gradually over five years. **********China's W.T.O. membership will not change everything: the country will continue to protect many of its sectors from foreign competition. But joining the organization will force open the nation's economy more in the first five years than during the previous 20 years of reforms. Some of the biggest changes will come on the first day. **********Tariffs are set to fall on a wide range of products. On the first day of China's W.T.O. membership, for example, the import duty on some automobiles will drop to 63.5 percent from 80 percent now, the first step in a five-year decline that will bring all car duties down to 25 percent. **********Finance companies like GMAC, meanwhile, will be allowed to offer car loans, putting millions of Chinese consumers within sudden reach of buying an imported car. **********And China has promised to scrap the murky, politicized process by which it decides what companies have access to its market. **********Insurers, for example, will no longer wait years to hear if they are among the anointed ones. The day after China joins the W.T.O., the country's insurance regulator is supposed to have applications on hand for qualified companies that want to sell insurance in the country. And, under W.T.O. rules, the regulator will have to act on the applications within a set period of time, giving a written explanation to companies whose applications are turned down. That will be a relief to insurers that have spent millions of dollars waiting for word from the regulators with no information at all. **********Insurers are eager to start: China's entire insurance market is still smaller than Taiwan's, but the government expects it to expand at a double-digit rate for at least the next decade. **********''With incomes rising, there's little doubt the market will grow quickly,'' said Patrick Cranley, the Cigna Corporation's representative in Shanghai and the chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce here. **********As a W.T.O. member, China won't be able to arbitrarily limit the number of foreign insurance companies operating here. **********Other foreign services will become immediately legal. Foreign law firms, which have operated in a gray area for years, will at last be allowed to counsel clients on Chinese laws and rules related to commercial transactions, though they will not yet be allowed to argue cases before Chinese courts. **********In some cases, China is already amending those laws and regulations to comply with W.T.O. standards. The country's legislature has drafted amendments that will lift burdens from foreign investors setting up factories in China. Those amendments will take effect when they are approved by the full legislature, a largely rubber stamp body, at its next session early next year. **********Among other changes, foreign companies will no longer be required to use a certain amount of local materials or components in the products they make in China. And factories that are 100 percent foreign-owned will no longer be required to export at least half their China-made goods. Nor will licenses for wholly foreign-owned manufacturers be granted based on the level of technology they bring to China. **********''That should make it easier for foreign companies to invest,'' said Patrick Norton, a Shanghai-based lawyer with the American law firm O'Melveny & Myers. **********Few of the immediate changes will be as momentous as the opening of China's telecommunications industry, though, which itself is on the verge of explosive growth. Upon China's joining the W.T.O., foreign companies will be allowed to buy up to 25 percent of Chinese mobile telephone networks, and up to 49 percent within three years. **********Foreign telecommunication giants are already jostling for position: Britain's Vodafone Group paid $2.5 billion for a 2 percent stake in China's biggest mobile telephone company, China Mobile Communications, earlier this year and has said it is ready to buy more. Hong Kong's Hutchison Whampoa holds a 2 percent stake in China Unicom, China's second mobile telephone operator, which is shopping for a still larger strategic investor. And there may also be more mobile telephone licenses issued in China after the country joins the W.T.O. **********Mr. Liang, 25, who keeps his cell phone glued to his ear at a coffee shop on Shanghai's bustling Nanjing Road, said he was happy about the changes W.T.O. entry will bring. ''If there are foreign companies in the market, there will be more competition and prices will come down,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/27/business/equity-offerings-for-this-week.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-03-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 504, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Equity Offerings for This Week", "print_headline": "Equity Offerings for This Week", "body_text": " **********The following equity and convertible debt offerings are expected this week: **********Adolor Corp., Malvern, Pa., an initial public offering of six million shares.

The district court held that Windows and IE are separate products because ''consumers today perceive operating systems and browsers as separate 'products,' for which there is separate demand.'' The district court thereby rejected this court's June 1998 decision, stating that this court's test was inconsistent with the Supreme Court's decisions in Jefferson Parish and Kodak. **********The district court's ''consumer demand'' test would chill innovation to the detriment of consumers by preventing firms from integrating into their products new functionality previously provided by stand-alone products -- and hence, by definition, subject to separate consumer demand. Even one of plaintiffs' experts on relief, Carl Shapiro, agreed that ''innovation often takes place in the computer industry through the integration of various capabilities or functions into a single piece of hardware or software.'' For instance, word processors now include spell checkers and PC's now include built-in modems -- even though both features used to be sold separately as add-on products. Under the ''consumer demand'' test, the addition of such features -- which plainly benefited consumers -- could be challenged as an unlawful tie, thus requiring judges and juries to second-guess product design decisions. . . . **********Microsoft Did Not Maintain A Monopoly Through Anticompetitive Conduct **********A.

There is no danger of Microsoft's ''becoming slothful, routinized, sleepy, or wanting in alertness, initiative, and progressiveness, as a result of the quiet life sought and usually achieved by a monopolist.'' Given the competitive nature of the software industry, the district court's holding that Microsoft has monopoly power is contrary to commercial reality. . . . **********There is no finding -- nor could there be -- that Microsoft controls a significant percentage of the productive assets in the operating system business, and thus no finding that Microsoft could restrict total output of operating systems and thereby raise prices. Without acquiring new productive assets, existing competitors such as I.B.M. or the producers of Linux or BeOS could expand their ''output'' to meet the entire consumer demand for operating systems -- it is simply a matter of signing new license agreements. . . . In other words, the market position of Windows was created by, and is dependent on, consumer demand, not Microsoft's control of total output. **********B. Microsoft Did Not Engage In Anticompetitive Conduct **********. . . In ruling that Microsoft engaged in anticompetitive conduct, the district court improperly applied a burden-shifting approach. According to the district court, if the evidence reveals a significant ''exclusionary'' impact -- apparently, anything that adversely affects a rival -- then ''liability will attach'' unless ''the defendant comes forward with specific, procompetitive business motivations that explain the full extent of its exclusionary conduct.'' This approach fails to distinguish between anticompetitive conduct that prevents a competitor from reaching the marketplace (thus decreasing consumer welfare) and procompetitive conduct that defeats a competitor in the marketplace through improved products, increased distribution and lower prices (thus increasing consumer welfare). . . . **********The district court also erroneously relied on evidence of Microsoft's intent to win business from Netscape in concluding that Microsoft's conduct was anticompetitive. Consistent with this focus on intent, the district court placed great weight on the unremarkable proposition that Microsoft sought to maximize IE's share of browser usage at Navigator's expense, a perfectly procompetitive intent. . . . **********C. No Causal Link Was Shown Between The Allegedly Anticompetitive Acts And the Maintenance Of a Purported Monopoly **********. . . Plaintiffs have never contended that Microsoft acquired monopoly power unlawfully. To the contrary, the DOJ's own economist in 1995, Nobel Laureate Kenneth Arrow, acknowledged that ''Microsoft appears to have achieved its dominant position in its market as a consequence of good fortune and possibly superior product and business acumen.'' As a result, even assuming it possesses monopoly power, Microsoft, ''no less than any other competitor, is permitted and indeed encouraged to compete aggressively on the merits.'' . . . **********The District Court's Extreme Relief Is Unsustainable **********A. The District Court Improperly Entered a Sweeping Decree Without a Hearing **********. . . By submitting six lengthy declarations and more than 50 new exhibits in support of their proposed final judgment, plaintiffs acknowledged that the existing trial record was insufficient to support the radical relief they requested. Whereas the trial focused on Microsoft's competition with Netscape in developing and distributing Web browsing software, plaintiffs' proposed decree was much broader, (i) encompassing products like Microsoft Office, Windows 2000 Server and Windows CE that are outside the markets defined by the district court, and (ii) addressing complex issues that were not even mentioned at trial, such as interoperability between PC operating systems and non-Microsoft server operating systems. . . . **********The district court did not find that plaintiffs' proposed decree and Microsoft's vehement opposition thereto created no triable issues of fact. To the contrary, the district court recognized that plaintiffs' declarations and Microsoft's offers of proof presented highly divergent views on the ''effects which may or may not ensue if the proposed final judgment is entered.'' The district court rejected Microsoft's request for an evidentiary hearing not because such a hearing was unnecessary to resolve factual issues, but because it did not think that testimony from knowledgeable witnesses would be useful in resolving such issues. (''In its experience the court has found testimonial predictions of future events generally less reliable even than testimony as to historical fact, and cross-examination to be of little use in enhancing or detracting from their accuracy.'') The district court's doubts about the utility of evidentiary hearings are not grounds for repudiating this core element of due process. **********B. The Breakup of Microsoft Is Unwarranted as a Matter of Law **********Under general equity principles, an injunction should be no more burdensome than necessary to prevent recurring violations of the law. The district court's findings and conclusions of law do not begin to justify breaking up Microsoft, extreme relief not even hinted at in the complaints. Leaving aside negotiated consent decrees, no court has ever split apart a unitary company not formed by mergers. Microsoft did not become the leading supplier of operating systems by acquiring its rivals. Rather, it built its current position from scratch by (i) developing a succession of operating systems, each markedly better than its predecessors, (ii) broadly licensing those products to OEM's at attractive prices, and (iii) evangelizing system services supplied by those products to ISV's. The fact that no court has ever ordered the breakup of a unitary company like Microsoft demonstrates the extreme nature of the district court's decree. . . . **********The District Court Committed Reversible Error in Its Handling Of the Case **********A. The District Court Failed to Provide Microsoft With Adequate Opportunity To Prepare for and Defend Against A Dramatically Expanded Case **********The district court abused its discretion in rushing this case to trial five months after the complaints were filed and in limiting Microsoft to 12 trial witnesses after plaintiffs were permitted to broaden their case well beyond the narrow claims alleged in their complaints. **********A few months for discovery and pretrial preparation is ''unheard of in antitrust litigation,'' particularly in cases involving a monopolization claim. At an ABA conference, the district judge stated that he put this case on a fast track to ''avoid the Vietnam morasses'' that the DOJ's Section 2 cases against I.B.M. and AT&T became. Although that was perhaps a laudable objective, the breathless pace of the litigation severely prejudiced Microsoft, especially after plaintiffs dramatically expanded their case. In the Seventh Circuit's words, if an antitrust case ''ought not resemble a marathon, neither is the 100-yard dash a good model.'' **********In the end, many witnesses with knowledge of disputed factual issues could not be deposed, and document discovery was artificially constrained. . . . **********B. The District Court Created A Procedural Framework in Which Reliance on Hearsay Was Inevitable **********Although a party seeking reversal based on erroneous admission of hearsay in a bench trial bears a heavy burden, that burden is met here. The district court largely suspended application of the Federal Rules of Evidence at trial, admitting scores of newspaper and magazine articles and other rank hearsay. In fact, the expansion of plaintiffs' case, together with the limitation on the number of witnesses, made reliance on hearsay inevitable. The district court evidently contemplated such a result, stating before trial that it expected the parties to make ''liberal use of summary witnesses.'' Following this advice, plaintiffs' witnesses submitted lengthy written direct testimony that went well beyond their own personal knowledge. . . . **********The District Judge's Public Comments Concerning The Merits of the Case Require That the Judgment Be Vacated And the Case Reassigned **********On June 8, 2000, the day after judgment was entered -- but with important post-trial motions still to be heard -- numerous news organizations, including The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times, Washington Post, Newsweek, USA Today and National Public Radio, began publishing stories based on interviews with the district judge. . . . **********The district judge's public comments about the case both during and after trial violated the Code of Conduct for United States Judges. Canon 3A(6) provides: ''A judge should avoid public comment on the merits of a pending or impending action.'' The official commentary states: ''The admonition against public comment about the merits of a pending or impending action continues until completion of the appellate process.'' The Code of Conduct is thus clear that ''a judge never may discuss the merits of a pending case in a nonjudicial forum, especially when he has reason to know that the parties to the litigation may appear before him again for further judgment in the case.'' Because ''the proscription against commenting on the merits of a pending case in a nonjudicial forum is absolutely unequivocal,'' the district court's repeated public comments about this case are indefensible. Such comments are grounds for disqualification under 28 U.S.C. $S455(a), which requires a judge to ''disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.'' Indeed, the district court recently stated that he would consider recusing himself if this court does not affirm his ruling. . . . In fact, the district judge's remarks reveal sufficient antagonism toward Microsoft to ''cause an objective observer to question [the judge's] impartiality.'' . . . The district judge's violations of the Code of Conduct are emblematic of the manner in which he conducted the entire case -- employing improper procedures and changing the rules of the game, always to Microsoft's detriment. To preserve the appearance of justice, should any of plaintiffs' claims survive review, the court should vacate the judgment as to those claims and remand for a new trial before a different district judge. **********Conclusion **********The court should reverse the judgment below and direct the entry of judgment for Microsoft. As to any aspect of the judgment not reversed, the court should vacate and remand the case to a different district judge for a new trial. **********Terms of the Trade **********DOJ -- Department of Justice. **********IE -- Internet Explorer, Microsoft's browser. **********ISV -- Independent software vendor. **********Navigator -- Internet browser from Netscape Communications. **********OEM -- Original equipment manufacturer (PC maker). **********OS -- Operating system."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/20/world/taiwan-s-new-leader-ends-decades-of-nationalist-rule.html": {"writer_name": "Erik Eckholm", "pub_date": "2000-05-20", "snippet": "Chen Shui-bian is sworn in as Taiwan president, ending fifty years of rule by National Party, much of it under martial rule; photo with predecessor Lee Teng-hui; Chen repeats pledges not to declare independence unless Taiwan is attacked, but does ...", "word_count": 1145, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Taiwan's New Leader Ends Decades of Nationalist Rule", "print_headline": "Taiwan's New Leader Ends Decades of Nationalist Rule", "body_text": " **********Chen Shui-bian was sworn in as president of Taiwan this morning, a landmark for Taiwan's democracy but the start of a risky period in relations between this prospering island of 23 million people and a strengthening Chinese mainland that claims Taiwan as its own. **********With his inauguration, Mr. Chen ended 50 years of rule -- much of it under martial law -- by the Nationalist Party that fled from the mainland under Chiang Kai-shek in 1949. **********As the candidate of the Democratic Progressive Party, which has long advocated Taiwan's independence from China, Mr. Chen won a three-way race in March, in the island's second election of a national leader. **********He succeeds Lee Teng-hui, 77, the flamboyant Nationalist who became world famous for ushering democracy to Taiwan but whose recent tenure was increasingly tainted by his party's vote-buying and corruption. **********''This is the first peaceful transition of power from one political party to another in Taiwanese history and probably in all of Chinese history,'' said Wu Yu-shan, a political scientist at National Taiwan University. ''But this triumph is being overshadowed by the prospect of deep tension across the Taiwan Straits.'' **********Today, in his first speech as president, Mr. Chen repeated pledges not to declare independence unless Taiwan comes under attack, but he did not give Beijing the commitment to ''one China'' it demands, and serious new tensions seemed likely. **********''Long live freedom and democracy,'' he shouted as he concluded. **********The inauguration took place in a brief ceremony inside the presidential palace a few minutes after 9 a.m. Mr. Chen bowed before a picture of Sun Yat-sen -- who is claimed by both the Taiwanese and the mainland governments as founding father -- then pledged to uphold the Constitution and was handed the national seal. **********The ceremony capped the storybook rise of Mr. Chen, 49, whose intelligence and preternatural determination took him from mud-house poverty to success as a corporate attorney before he became involved, in 1979, in the dissident movement against the Nationalists' authoritarian rule. He became a star of the opposition after his election as mayor of Taipei in 1994. **********Annette Lu, 55, was sworn in as vice president. She is an outspoken feminist and advocate of Taiwan independence with a law degree from Harvard who spent more than five years in Nationalist prisons in the early 1980's. **********Until recently, Mr. Chen called for Taiwan's formal independence from the mainland -- a step that Beijing has repeatedly said would bring a military attack. Seeking to broaden his appeal among the worried electorate and to placate the United States, which is pledged to help defend Taiwan but does not want to be drawn into war, Mr. Chen has moderated his position. **********Mr. Chen now says that since Taiwan already functions like a state it does not need to declare independence. He has held out olive branches to Beijing, proposing to talk about strengthened commerce and even about the meaning of ''one China.'' **********Beijing officials have expressed growing impatience with Mr. Chen's refusal to accept their absolute precondition for any talks -- that Taiwan is part of a single China. **********Earlier this week, the Communist Party's flagship paper, People's Daily, said that Mr. Chen has ''adopted an evasive and defiant posture'' over the one-China principle and that his friendly gestures ''lack sincerity.'' It reminded him that ''matters of sovereignty are not for negotiation.'' **********In recent months, China has warned that indefinite delay in progress toward unity may be grounds for military action. **********Mr. Chen's long-anticipated inaugural speech today was almost an anticlimax, devoted mainly to calls for domestic reconciliation, cleaner politics and economic issues. **********In the most scrutinized portion, on cross-straits ties, Mr. Chen offered good will and pledged not to take formal steps toward independence.  As long as the mainland does not use military force against Taiwan, he said, ''I pledge that during my term in office, I will not declare independence.'' **********He made one cryptic reference to ''jointly'' dealing ''with the question of a future 'one China,' '' which fell far short of the kind of commitment Beijing has sought. **********The international turnout for today's ceremony provided a stark reminder of China's relative power and its campaign to isolate Taiwan diplomatically. Listed as attending were only four heads of state -- from Swaziland, Nicaragua, Palau and Nauru -- countries drawn from fewer than 30 states that have dared to recognize Taiwan in return for its financial aid. **********Representing President Clinton was Laura D'Andrea Tyson, a former White House adviser. Although the United States sells defensive weapons to Taiwan and has strong economic ties, senior American officials do not visit since the United States, by agreement with Beijing, does not grant formal recognition. **********Taiwan's political status and relations with Beijing are always central issues here. But Mr. Chen's strongest mandate from the election, analysts say, was in domestic affairs, especially to start cleaning up corruption in politics, including growing ties between local Nationalist politicians and organized crime. **********As he takes on these and other issues, Mr. Chen will be operating in what for Taiwan is the novel territory of a divided government. **********Mr. Chen received less than a majority of votes in the election and faces a legislature dominated by the Nationalists. Experts give him good marks for cobbling together a multiparty cabinet that may blunt some opposition. But many still wonder whether he can govern with any force in a jumbled system of presidential and parliamentary institutions that in the past was always controlled by one disciplined party. **********In what many people here regarded as a master stroke, Mr. Chen persuaded the former Nationalist defense minister and a retired general, Tang Fei, to serve as prime minister. Mr. Tang is one of several holdovers in the national security field, a deliberate effort to assure various parties -- China, the United States and the Taiwanese -- that Mr. Chen will not act rashly to incite China. **********Mr. Tang's powers relative to the president's are not clearly defined, and he has lately been suffering complications from surgery. **********The cabinet includes a mix of Nationalists, members of Mr. Chen's party and others. But divisive questions have already been raised within the Nationalist and the Democratic Progressive parties about the party loyalty of those in the cabinet, and the extent to which they should follow Mr. Chen's lead on issues. **********Since Mr. Lee, the outgoing president, was forced from his job as Nationalist Party leader, the Nationalists have been in chaos. **********A new third party, led by James Soong, a former Nationalist, is struggling to lure supporters from the legislative ranks and define its role. And the Democratic Progressives have begun squabbling as well. **********''Any new government is going to be somewhat messy and incoherent,'' said Shelley Rigger, an expert on Taiwan at Davidson College in North Carolina who gives Mr. Chen high marks under difficult circumstances. ''Chen is trying to put together a government that can actually govern, and he had to violate the conventional rules of party politics.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/27/world/in-assault-on-islamic-rebels-a-bid-to-end-algeria-s-civil-war.html": {"writer_name": "John Burns", "pub_date": "2000-01-27", "snippet": "Bid by Algerian Pres Abdelaziz Bouteflika to end eight-year civil war by beginning offensive against Islamic guerrillas who have defied government amnesty has erupted into some of fiercest fighting in years; at least 125 soldiers and guerrillas ha...", "word_count": 912, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "In Assault on Islamic Rebels, a Bid to End Algeria's Civil War", "print_headline": "In Assault on Islamic Rebels, a Bid to End Algeria's Civil War", "body_text": " **********A bid by Algeria's president to end an eight-year civil war by beginning an offensive against Islamic guerrillas who have defied a government amnesty has erupted into some of the fiercest fighting in years. **********Reports in Algerian newspapers have said that at least 125 soldiers and guerrillas have been killed since the government began its offensive in a mountainous area of western Algeria about a week ago. **********The government attack follows an ultimatum included in a peace plan President Abdelaziz Bouteflika put forward after he was elected last April. His proposal for a ''civil concord'' with the guerrillas, ratified in a national referendum in September, hinged on an amnesty for any rebel surrendering before Jan. 13. A pro-government newspaper in Algiers, El Khabar, said last week that 4,200 rebels might have surrendered, more than double the figure previously given by the government. But by most counts, at least 1,500 rebels, perhaps substantially more, remain active. **********When he proposed the amnesty, Mr. Bouteflika said that guerrillas who prolonged the war would face ''a fight without mercy'' and ''eradication.'' He waited six days past the deadline before sending paratroops, infantry units and helicopters against one of the main guerrilla strongholds in the hinterland of Relizane province, 95 miles southwest of Algiers. The region is one of several that have served as base areas for guerrilla attacks on the Mediterranean coastal plain, where 90 percent of Algerians live. **********The combat area -- which includes the Oursenis national park, a vacation area before the war -- is thickly forested with pines and cedars and rises to nearly 4,000 feet. Le Matin, an independent Algiers newspaper, reported on Monday that 25 government soldiers and about 100 guerrillas had been killed, with 70 of the dead rebels being accounted for in fighting on Saturday. The paper said about 230 guerrillas were still holding out against the main thrust of the government attack. **********The stakes are high. Mr. Bouteflika was hand-picked for the presidency last year by Algeria's generals, who have held decisive political authority since shortly after Algeria's independence from France in 1962. His pledge to Algeria's 30 million people was that he would bring about ''national reconciliation'' by ending the war. **********By unofficial estimates, 100,000 people have been killed in the conflict, most of them civilians who have been bombed in cafes, markets and schools, stopped at guerrilla roadblocks and executed, or slaughtered by the hundreds in village massacres. **********Algerians see the conflict as an extension of what they call their national ''nightmare,'' reaching back to the eight-year war of independence  with a French colonial army that historians say cost about one million lives. **********More than an end to the war rides on Mr. Bouteflika's shoulders, since many Algerians believe there is little hope of the generals' allowing the emergence of a genuine parliamentary democracy or of Algeria's rising from the economic abyss into which it fell in the 1990's until the fighting ends. **********Although Algerians are gaining confidence that the back of the Islamic insurgency has been broken, it is not clear yet that the war's end is at hand. For one thing, the rebels' ''eradication'' would void the generals' main claim for retaining decisive political power. **********''It's a little early to say, but I'm not at all convinced that this is the end game,'' said High Roberts, a specialist on Algeria who teaches at the London School of Economics.  ''I'm not convinced that there is a consensus in Algiers to make a definitive end to all the armed groups.'' **********The amnesty plan has had some striking successes. On Jan. 11, two days before the amnesty expired, the guerrilla group that started the war, the Islamic Salvation Army, agreed to dissolve itself after Mr. Bouteflika granted its estimated 8,000 fighters a blanket amnesty. The move effectively ratified the status quo, since the Islamic Salvation Front, the political group that controlled the fighters, had observed a cease-fire since August 1997. **********Perhaps more significant has been Mr. Bouteflika's success in opening amnesty negotiations with a splinter force led by a guerrilla leader, Hassan Hattab, who broke with the main insurgent group over its attacks on civilians. Algerian security force spokesmen have said that Mr. Hattab has 1,500 fighters in his group, the Salafist Group for Proselytization and Combat, which has been active in the mountains of the Kabylia area about 70 miles east of Algiers. **********What remains unclear is how many guerrillas will accept, or defy, their leaders' decisions on the amnesty. The interior minister, Yazid Zerhouni, said last week that ''about 80 percent'' of all the guerrillas had surrendered, but did not specify how many men that involved. Although the Islamic Salvation Army's leader, Madani Mezrag, signed a statement dissolving the force, the actual hand-over of arms by his fighters appears to have been sporadic. Government spokesmen have said that 1,100 of the Mr Mezrag's fighters have surrendered in the Jijel area, 130 miles east of Algiers, but others have yet to respond. **********A major point of contention in the government's negotiations with the guerrilla leaders has been the amnesty terms. The deal with the Islamic Salvation Army provided that the rebel fighters would be merged into the government army and used in the war against rebel holdouts. This appears to have been the case already in the Relizane offensive. **********For other groups, a sticking point could be Mr. Bouteflika's insistence that the amnesty will not cover ''blood crimes,'' rape or acts of terror in public places, a definition likely to cover many of the rebels."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/24/technology/gateway-aims-to-be-computer-trainer.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-08-24", "snippet": "August 24, 2000", "word_count": 620, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Gateway Aims To Be Computer Trainer", "print_headline": "Gateway Aims To Be Computer Trainer", "body_text": " **********August 24, 2000 **********&nbsp; Gateway Aims To Be Computer Trainer By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS **********EW YORK -- Gateway Inc. is admitting publicly what most computer makers generally try to sweep under the rug: using a computer can be pretty darned complicated. **********On Thursday, it is launching an advertising campaign to drive home that point.

He called the negotiations ''a creaky machine that needs to be geared up,'' and suggested that President Clinton might return on Thursday. **********Two of the four committees set up to discuss specific issues met for the first time today, to deal with bilateral relations and security.

One is to draw new borders, and the other is to take up the related issue of Syria's access to water, especially the Sea of Galilee. **********Because of the tight news blackout, almost all information is coming from American officials who are being extraordinarily careful not to divulge specific details of the talks.

That panel is presumably to discuss what security measures -- troop pullbacks, early warning systems and similar steps -- would compensate Israel for the loss of the Golan Heights buffer zone. **********But Syrian officials have been using phrases like the ''reciprocal and equal security arrangements committee,'' suggesting that they may be seeking more than just a restoration of the Golan Heights, which it lost in the Arab-Israeli war of 1967. **********The security arrangements hinge to some degree on what intelligence both countries could receive from a  monitoring station on the Golan Heights that might be staffed by Americans, perhaps with Israeli and Syrian observers.

Israeli press reports suggest that Mr. Barak wants an aid package that could be valued at more than $17 billion, a figure that would probably face considerable hurdles in Congress. **********He would also like more formal assurances of how the United States would go to Israel's aid in times of crisis. **********Although that idea has come up many times before, Israeli leaders are split about the wisdom of such a treaty, suggesting that it could restrict Israel's options and its ability to sell arms to countries like China, sales that regularly prompt objections in Washington. **********But there are also reports, inside and outside Shepherdstown, that Syria might also receive some aid to build up its security forces, though presumably on a smaller scale and of less sophistication than help to Israel. Any military aid to Syria would face opposition in Congress. And even within the Clinton administration, some officials said they believed that the White House could not provide aid to a country that it has long accused of harboring and aiding terrorists."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/04/business/world-business-briefing-africa-profit-grows-at-gold-fields-ltd.html": {"writer_name": "Henri Cauvin", "pub_date": "2000-08-04", "snippet": "Gold Fields Ltd, world's third-largest producer of gold, says quarterly profits more than tripled, to $53 million, helped by improved efficiency at its mines and decline in value of South African rand (S)", "word_count": 91, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PROFIT GROWS AT GOLD FIELDS LTD.", "print_headline": "WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: AFRICA; PROFIT GROWS AT GOLD FIELDS LTD.", "body_text": " **********Helped by improved efficiency at its mines and a decline in the value of the South African rand, Gold Fields Ltd., the world's third-largest producer of gold, reported that quarterly profits more than tripled to 370 million rand, or $53 million.

His lawyer, Yaakov Weinroth, said he was ''itching for a trial'' to demonstrate that there is ''nothing to'' the accusations. **********''I'm being persecuted,'' Mr. Netanyahu repeated several times in a 50-minute interview tonight on Israel's Channel One, which returned him to the prime-time spot that he dominated during his three years in office. ''I define this as a hunt. It's a hunt. They're hunting me and my wife down.'' **********If justice officials take the police recommendation to put Mr. Netanyahu on trial, it could thwart his ability to make a political comeback. While he has not publicly expressed interest in doing so, the right-wing opposition to Mr. Barak has been lackluster, and many here have long assumed that Mr. Netanyahu would eventually be tempted back into the political ring. **********Under the Israeli legal system, police investigate and either close a case or make a recommendation to the state prosecutor or attorney general. But a police recommendation does not always lead to prosecution, as Mr. Netanyahu well knows. In 1997, while he was prime minister, the police suggested that he stand trial on corruption charges, but the attorney general, Elyakim Rubenstein, declined to prosecute, saying there was insufficient evidence. Mr. Rubenstein remains in the position. **********In this case, the police said the Netanyahus ''illegally removed'' 700 gifts to the state of Israel when they left the prime minister's residence. The police said some of the objects, which included candelabra, silverware, carpets and a gold letter opener from Al Gore, had been altered to remove inscriptions that clearly marked them as gifts to Israel. Some were found in the Netanyahus' Jerusalem apartment and some in a warehouse, the police said. **********In the interview tonight, Mr. Netanyahu said that Mr. Barak had kicked him out of the prime minister's residence prematurely -- although it was weeks after Mr. Barak took office -- and that Mr. Netanyahu did not have time to sort his belongings while packing. He said he was entitled to take some presents -- perhaps referring to the gifts of minimal value that he can accept under the law. Holding up a woman's brooch, he said the police had grilled Mrs. Netanyahu for four hours about the pin, which an appraisal later showed to be worth $1.50. **********The police also said the Netanyahus had accepted $50,000 worth of free services from a contractor, Avner Amedi, over many years. Mr. Netanyahu denied that tonight, saying the amount was wildly exaggerated. **********The police described an illegal ''give-and-take relationship,'' which amounted under the law to bribery. They said it began when Mr. Netanyahu was a lawmaker and continued through his three-year tenure as a charismatic prime minister. He eventually lost the confidence of the nation but retained many loyal followers. **********The police would not specify today what the contractor received in return. **********They said they discovered ''a number of cases'' in which Mr. Netanyahu ''did, in fact, act on Amedi's behalf.'' But the police report indicated that the relationship broke down when Mr. Amedi did not get everything he requested -- supposedly, he was seeking a government contract -- and so billed Mr. Netanyahu. But he did not get paid. **********After Mr. Netanyahu lost the election, the contractor, with the Netanyahus' knowledge, submitted to the prime minister's office another bill for $110,000 worth of expenses related to moving, the police said. The ''very high bill raised suspicions about criminal acts,'' and government officials suspected that the Netanyahus were trying to ''foist'' their private expenses onto the government, the police said. **********The police investigation began after a newspaper, Yediot Ahronot, printed the officials' suspicions. The newspaper said the private work included ''four floor polishings in a single month,'' ordering a crane to install bars on the Netanyahus' private apartment's windows, and arranging for an electrician to fix Mr. Netanyahu's exercise machine. **********''Sara Netanyahu pushed to have the debt paid off by the prime minister's office while trying to do away with the Netanyahus' personal debt,'' the police said. **********The police also said Mr. Netanyahu had summoned Mr. Amedi and had asked him to deny the nature of their relationship, for which they recommend that the former prime minister be charged with obstruction of justice. **********The contractor is the state's chief witness, and most of the police case is believed to be based on information he provided. They questioned 100 other people, too, and noted what they considered inconsistencies and ''improbabilities'' in the Netanyahus' account. **********Mr. Netanyahu said tonight that Mr. Amedi was not telling the truth and that the police were building a case on lies. ''They penetrated our home, picked through our belongings, called me a thief, my wife a thief and trampled our dignity with tendentious leaks,'' he said. **********Mr. Netanyahu's political allies echoed his assertion that the police were out to get him. ''The police have been behaving as if they were on a chase mission to find Netanyahu guilty of something,'' said Uzi Landau, a lawmaker from Mr. Netanyahu's Likud Party. **********But as Mr. Netanyahu's television interviewer pointed out, the Israeli police have a full plate of investigations before them, focusing on figures across the political spectrum. President Ezer Weizman is under investigation for accepting a large cash gift from a French businessman. Mr. Barak's campaign fund-raising practices are also under investigation. **********And on Monday, the police began an inquiry into whether a leading rabbi, Ovadia Yosef, should be prosecuted for incitement after a blistering sermon against the education minister. **********''It's a very dark day for Israeli politics,'' said Ophir Pines-Paz, who is the chairman of Mr. Barak's governing coalition. ''The whole spate of investigations looks bad and is bad. We all have to be very careful.

Yeltsin, further putting his own stamp on the Kremlin. **********By choosing Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov, 42, for the Russian government's No. 2 position, Mr. Putin also signaled the importance of Russia's relations with its Western creditors -- and dropped a hint about a possible successor as prime minister, if he wins the March 26 presidential elections. Until the elections, Mr. Putin will stay on as Russia's prime minister. **********In other changes, Mr. Putin ousted Pavel P. Borodin, one of Mr. Yeltsin's closest and longest-serving aides, from his job as chief of the Kremlin's powerful property management office. Mr. Borodin was appointed secretary to the new union between Russia and Belarus. **********Mr. Putin also demoted Nikolai Y. Aksyonenko, a former first deputy prime minister closely tied to the financier Boris A. Berezovsky, a media magnate and a master of Kremlin intrigue. Mr. Aksyonenko, who five months ago was boasting that he  controlled Russian economic policy, was bounced down to minister of railways. **********With his first major cabinet reshuffle, Mr. Putin struck a note of independence from the Yeltsin team -- widely known as ''the family'' -- which has been tainted with charges of corruption and unsavory business dealings. **********Last week, within days of Mr. Yeltsin's unexpected Dec. 31 resignation, Mr. Putin removed Tatyana Dyachenko, Mr. Yeltsin's daughter, from her Kremlin job as the president's ''image maker.'' **********In ousting Mr. Borodin, Mr. Putin, 47, showed that loyalties to the old team will not count for much in the period preceding the elections. **********Mr. Borodin managed an empire that, besides the Kremin itself, included thousands of government-owned properties, offices, apartments, country houses, cars and hospitals that make up a vast network of perquisites and privileges distributed among top Russian office holders. **********That job, and Mr. Borodin's special relationship to Mr. Yeltsin, helped protect him last summer during a Swiss investigation into whether he had accepted kickbacks from a Swiss firm that did extensive reconstruction work in the Kremlin. That same scandal also touched members of the Yeltsin family, who reportedly used credit cards provided by the Swiss company. No charges have been filed. **********Meeting with top members of his cabinet today, Mr. Putin said the changes were purely ''technical.'' His press spokesman, Mikhail Kozhukov, said it is premature to talk about Mr. Kasyanov's chances of becoming prime minister if Mr. Putin is elected president. **********But with most of his time now spent in the Kremlin, carrying out presidential duties, Mr. Putin needs a loyal top deputy to head the cabinet in his absence, ''someone whom he fully trusts and whose effectiveness he can be 100 percent sure of,'' Mr. Kozhukov said. **********Mr. Kasyanov, a former employee of the old Soviet central planning committee who became finance minister last May, has earned a reputation as a tough negotiator during talks with private and government creditors. Russia, which inherited the Soviet Union's debts, has been able to renegotiate the payment schedule for bills owed to foreign governments in the so-called Paris Club, while talks with the so-called London Club, made up of private investors, are still continuing. **********''Kasyanov is not a genius, but he has shown himself to be competent within the framework of the Finance Ministry's mandate which is budget preparation, and debt restructureing,'' said Margot Jacobs, a financial analyst at United Financial Group, a Moscow investment firm. ''It is important for Western investors to have somebody with a familiar face.'' **********''The most important news is about Aksyonenko,'' said Eric Kraus, head of strategy for Nikoil, a Russian brokerage house. ''He is Berezovsky's creature, and so this is a substantial blow to the Berezovsky bloc. The move indicates that after the elections, some oligarchs are going to have their wings clipped. They won't be expropriated, but they will be less influential.'' **********Mr. Aksyonenko played a central role in the brusque management takeover last September of Transneft, Russia's oil pipeline monopoly, which took place when Mr. Putin was out of Moscow. The change of directors has subsequently been declared illegal by a Moscow court. **********But even as Mr. Putin maneuvers to put distance between himself and the politically unpopular Yeltsin team, it is still not clear whether he is simply positioning himself for the coming elections, pitting Moscow's various warring clans against each other or really cutting himself loose from his old political mentor. **********Mr. Putin's first appointment as acting president was to choose Aleksandr Voloshin, an influential aide to Mr. Yeltsin, as his own Kremlin chief of staff. According to some observers, Mr. Voloshin, who advised Mr. Yeltsin on his resignation strategy, is expected to play a central role in Mr. Putin's presidential campaign."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/23/business/2-airlines-seek-to-press-court-actions-on-unions.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "2000-11-23", "snippet": "United Airlines and Northwest Airlines are asking federal courts to increase enforcement of earlier orders barring their mechanics from disrupting flights; both seek contempt orders against mechanics unions, which negotiate new pact; United flight...", "word_count": 620, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "2 Airlines Seek to Press Court Actions on Unions", "print_headline": "2 Airlines Seek to Press Court Actions on Unions", "body_text": " **********United Airlines and Northwest Airlines returned to federal court today to seek enforcement of orders they received in the last week barring their mechanics from disrupting flights. **********United, a unit of the UAL Corporation, said it had asked a federal court to further enforce an order United obtained last Friday against the mechanics' union because illegal job actions were still disrupting flights.

Postol, an arms expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who opposes the weapon, said Pentagon investigators were seeking to question Dr. Schwartz about declassified documents that she shared with him, apparently one in particular.

South Korea's banks, often accused of providing easy credit for financially strapped conglomerates, or chaebol, had to base their credit decisions on economically sound considerations, not special relations with companies or their owners. **********\"The president has set a year-end deadline for restructuring the economy,\" an official at the Ministry of Finance said. \"The banks are going by changed rules and regulations.\" **********Until the government this year again cracked down on favoritism and cronyism, said the official, \"cross-guarantees among companies and insider trading would have prevented this type of crisis.\" The humiliation endured by Hyundai Engineering & Construction, by far South Korea's largest construction company, and Dong Ah, the country's third-largest construction company, \"is a sign of change.\" **********Yet another sign of the sometimes wrenching changes Tuesday was an announcement by the newly appointed top executives of Daewoo Motor Co., in bankruptcy since last year, of a plan that calls for dismissing 3,500 of its 17,000 workers in an effort to cut costs. The plan was prompted largely by Daewoo's creditor banks, which have indicated that they would provide as much as dollars 400 million in fresh credit, provided the company demonstrates its ability either to return to profitability in two years or to find a buyer. **********Lee Jong Dae, in his second day as Daewoo Motor chairman, said he hoped to be able to begin to reduce liabilities that he acknowledged now total dollars 16 billion. \"I believe we can succeed if we try to solve our problems with the help of our labor union, banks, the government and our suppliers,\" Mr. Lee said. **********The union that represents most of Daewoo Motor's workers signaled the difficulties, declaring that it would not accept layoffs, but the company said there was no choice. Daewoo workers said they had not yet been paid for October, and some workers said they had not received any pay for two months. **********Analysts said the main reason for the cutbacks appeared to be an effort to make Daewoo an attractive target for acquisition by another company. Daewoo has been negotiating with General Motors Corp. ever since Ford Motor Co. said it was no longer interested after discovering the extent of Daewoo's debts and obligations. **********\"Daewoo Motor is so indebted on a global basis, it's hard to get a grip on its actual debts,\" said Hank Morris, a long-time industry consultant here. \"GM may say it's not in a position to bid for the corporate entity but to ask for a facility here, a facility there.\" **********Daewoo's plan calls for selling nearly dollars 90 million worth of real estate as well as its 25 percent stake in Korea Delphi, a parts manufacturer, and also to cut production. The company said it expected to sell 730,000 cars from its South Korean plant next year, down 15 percent from 855,000 this year. **********Overseas, Daewoo said it would cut production at its money-losing Polish plant from 220,000 vehicles last year to 126,000 this year and also reduce the output of plants in Romania, Ukraine, Uzbekistan and India. Daewoo's major foreign plants were acquired in a burst of expansion in the 1990s that helped to drive the entire group into bankruptcy. **********Hyundai Engineering & Construction, meanwhile, missed the deadline Monday for payment of loans but avoided falling into default by paying back the loans Tuesday after several of its clients paid large bills. \"We never expected our creditor bank would refuse our request for a bridge loan,\" said Yoon Ung Hwan, the company's director of investment relations. **********Dong Ah's problems were far more serious. The company applied for court receivership, in effect declaring bankruptcy, after its creditor banks reportedly refused to extend an additional dollars 349 million in credit.

That forced the board members -- who after a year and a half of planning are eager to be replaced by the election -- to weigh their desire for completing their charge quickly with the conflicting demands of the people they are charged with representing. **********But after a night's rest, the board on Friday unanimously agreed to streamline and stagger its planned September election, which is intended to select nine so-called at-large board members. **********The new plan calls for individual Internet users -- essentially anyone over 16 with an e-mail and postal address -- to elect five board members in a direct election before Nov. 1, instead of the original plan to have the same users select an electoral council, which in turn would have selected all nine at-large members by Sept. 30. **********The board also agreed to launch a new study of the at-large membership process to see how the final four at-large board members would be selected. Because the plan delays the selection of the last four, they also agreed to extend until 2002 the terms of four of the nine appointed board members, who were set to hand over the reigns on Sept. 30. The board has not yet decided which four will stay on. **********The process ultimately will result in a board of 18 elected members, plus a board president. Nine other board members were elected last fall by three so-called supporting organizations, which represent specific groups like Internet service providers, domain name registration companies and the intellectual property interests concerned about protecting their brands in cyberspace. **********Also on Friday, the board proceeded with plans to create more top-level domains, the suffixes that end Internet address like .com, .net and .org. The board directed the groups that have been studying the issue to present its reports in 10 days for public comment. The board hopes to complete plans for adding new domains at its next meeting, to be held in July in Yokohama, Japan. **********The different groups working on proposals for the new domains on Thursday told the board they had agreed that 6 to 10 new domains should be added. But they had not yet agreed on crucial details, including how to pick the company that will run the registry and whether or not trademark holders should get first dibs on their famous marks in cyberspace. **********It also directed the groups representing so-called country code domains, the more than 240 two-letter suffixes like .uk and .us, to help ICANN staff members prepare a proposal on several touchy issues, including how the country code registries will help finance the operations of ICANN and whether governments should have sovereign control of the codes representing their countries and territories. **********The showdown Thursday over the at-large election process, the final organizational task for ICANN, had been brewing since the Center for Democracy and Technology and Common Cause last week issued their report. **********That report, financed by the Markle Foundation , said ICANN's original voting plan was plagued by conflicting goals, a lack of accountability and the absence of safeguards against capture by special-interest groups. **********Although everyone who lined up to speak on Thursday urged the group to put process over deadline, their proposed solutions varied. Some voiced support for the report's suggestions; others proposed staggering the election or reducing the number of at-large board members. Still others wanted to eliminate the general membership altogether. **********But the criticism came more than six months after ICANN's original board adopted its election plan, spurring obvious resentment and frustration among the appointed board members. **********Hans Kraaijenbrink, one of the appointed members, angrily told the crowd Thursday that the report from Common Cause comes \"one minute before midnight,\" adding: \"We are back to Square 1. I don't want to be back to Square 1.\" **********He and other board members said they were concerned that too broad a group was angling for a voice in the process. ICANN's charge, Kraaijenbrink and a colleague, Gregory Crew, said, is to oversee the narrow, technical functions of the Internet. **********But both supported the plan Friday, although Kraaijenbrink had the original resolution amended to replace references to the board being persuaded with language stating simply that the board \"observed\" the consensus. **********\"I was not persuaded by all the arguments but I observed the reality of the situation and I can go forward with that,'' he said after the meeting. **********Esther Dyson, the board's chairwoman, and Vinton Cerf, an Internet founder and one of the recently elected board members, on Thursday had said they were concerned that direct elections could result in the selection of people not sufficiently knowledgeable about the technical operations of the Internet. **********\"I am concerned about capture by people who don't know what they are doing,\" Dyson said. \"... People who are stupid, individually.\" **********Public-interest groups, however, were concerned that the proposed indirect elections would dilute the voice of individual Internet users who will ultimately be affected by ICANN policy. To compromise, the board agreed to establish a nomination committee that will seek out qualified candidates. **********ICANN has already began its effort to build the at-large voting body, launching a Web site last month where Internet users older than 16 can complete an application. **********ICANN's president, Mike Roberts, said that 6,000 people have already filled out the online application form. He said that the bulk of the applicants were males between 20 and 40 and that 70 percent were from North America, with another 20 percent from Europe. ICANN officials say that are working on an outreach campaign to include more women and to make the make the pool of applicants more geographically diverse. **********Related Sites **********These sites are not part of The New York Times on the Web, and The Times has no control over their content or availability. **********Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) **********Common Cause **********Center for Democracy and Technology **********Markle Foundation **********Jeri Clausing at jeri@nytimes.com welcomes your comments and suggestions."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/02/technology/l-losing-face-985619.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-11-02", "snippet": "Jenniffer Murdaugh letter questions point of Web site mentioned in October 26 article about people rating neighbors' looks as they walk by", "word_count": 75, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Losing Face", "print_headline": "Losing Face", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********What is the point of the Web site mentioned in '' 'Face Time,' With a Twist'' (Oct. 26)?

Talent agencies focused their energies on signing up actors, writers and directors and finding jobs for them in films and television. **********Times have changed. The agents are still brash. But a new breed has emerged over the last few years that is less interested in schmoozing with stars and studio and television executives. In fact, these agents are spending far more time in Silicon Valley than in the San Fernando Valley, where Warner Brothers, Walt Disney and Universal make their films and TV shows. **********''The real issue is how the two communities, Silicon Valley and Hollywood, play into each other,'' said Dan Adler, who runs the new media division of the Creative Artists Agency, an increasingly powerful unit that has grown to about 15 agents from three in a year. **********''Each of them offers remarkably complementary assets, tools, ideas,'' he said. ''The issue is, can they each fully appreciate and fully leverage what the other one offers in terms of helping Hollywood tell stories better or helping technology reach a broader audience?'' **********Not far from the sleek headquarters of Creative Artists in Beverly Hills, John Mass, a vice president for new media at the William Morris Agency, said: ''There's a growing understanding of the assets of each community and what each brings to the table. Going forward, people in the entertainment community will look at technology not just in how it enhances existing content but how new forms of content might be created with the new technology.'' **********Virtually every talent agency in Hollywood is reaching out to the Internet -- either by making deals for their clients to produce material for the Web or advising high-technology and other companies seeking ties to  the entertainment business. **********William Morris and Creative Artists dominate the field, each with an expanding separate division that works hand in hand with traditional agents. A third agency, Endeavor, has also begun moving energetically into Internet business. **********''We've said to our clients, 'We want to make sure you're educated in what's going on now and what's coming down the pike,' '' said Lon Rosen, the chief of the new media division at Endeavor. Adam Sandler, David Spade and Jon Lovitz, as well as Larry David, who helped create ''Seinfeld,'' are among the Endeavor clients who are creating content for Internet sites. **********Thus far, however, Hollywood's overhyped plunge into the Internet world has been troubled. Earlier this month, Pop.com, an entertainment site that was introduced with fanfare last October and had the backing of Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen, as well as the director Ron Howard and the producer Brian Grazer, virtually closed shop. Most of the company's 80 employees were laid off after the live-action and animation site failed to find a buyer. **********Similarly, the high-profile site Shockwave.com, which had spent millions of dollars on deals with filmmakers like Tim Burton, James L. Brooks, David Lynch and the team of Matt Stone and Trey Parker, announced it laying off some workers in Los Angeles and San Francisco. The company indicated it would focus more of its attention on online games and slow the pace of its high-priced celebrity contracts. **********But these and other setbacks are hardly deterring talent agents. **********William Morris, which has taken the most aggressive approach to new technology, began its new media division eight years ago, more than an epoch on Web time. Several Morris agents had become fascinated with the Internet and asked the agency's leadership to explore its potential for entertainment. The unit, with about 15 people now, is led by Mr. Mass, Johnny Levin, Lewis Henderson and Paul Bricault. **********Mr. Mass said the agency's role was to ''seek out new and different distribution channels for our clients and serve as navigators in the entertainment business for companies, similar to what we do for writers, actors, directors and producers.'' **********Morris sought not only to link its stars and directors to Internet sites but also, far more lucratively, to help  high-technology and other companies establish links with the entertainment industry. ''Ten years ago, these new companies, whether it was Cisco or Sun Microsystems, didn't really see themselves in the entertainment business,'' Mr. Levin said. ''Now many of them do. We can advise them. **********''A lot of corporate America was compartmentalized,'' he added. ''You were in the movie business. Or the television business. Or you made cell phones. Or you were in the Internet business. All these lines are getting convoluted now. You can have diverse, unrelated entities coming together through the portal of the talent agency.'' **********So along with Sophia Loren, Regis Philbin and Whoopi Goldberg, the agency's business clients now include Anheuser-Busch, British Telecommunications, Lucent Technologies, Nokia and Texas Instruments. The agency has established a significant relationship between two clients, Anheuser-Busch and Broadband Sports, in which the beer company became the largest advertiser on Broadband's Web site. **********In the last year, the agency has also worked with eBay to move offline into the worlds of publishing, retailing and television. **********''A lot of books are being written about antiques, a lot of publications are addressing the issue of collectibles, and the most popular series on PBS is 'Antiques Roadshow,' '' Mr. Mass said. ''Those are eBay enthusiasts. And we are trying to help them extend their brand through traditional media.'' **********Similarly, the agency helped connect eBay to another client, the Mills Corporation, one of the biggest mall developers in the United States. One result has been that eBay promotes itself at malls nationwide. Morris has also been hired by British Telecom to help provide films, games and other entertainments for the company's new Internet site in Britain. **********Unlike William Morris, where the emphasis appears to be on corporate clients and new media companies, Creative Artists' central strategy focuses on shaping Internet-related deals for clients. With his partners Johnny Knoxville and Jeff Tremaine, Spike Jonze, who directed ''Being John Malkovich,'' has created an offbeat comedy project, ''Jackass,'' that has been picked up by MTV. Oliver Stone and the action producer Jerry Bruckheimer have signed deals with Z.com, which offers short films and live action and animation on its site. Cindy Crawford has signed a deal with eStyle to sell, among other things, clothes for young children. Two other Creative Artists' clients, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, who have accompanied Mr. Adler to Silicon Valley several times and to the M.I.T. Media Lab in Cambridge, Mass., are building their own Internet company, which will also produce television shows. **********Other clients working with Mr. Adler on Internet deals include Will Smith, Nicolas Cage and Sarah Jessica Parker. Media companies represented by Creative Artists include iPix, eStyle, Extend Media and TiVo. **********For Hollywood agencies that are dealing with the Internet, Mr. Adler said, flux is the norm. ''There are no standard business models, there's no finite list of players; it's ever-changing,'' he said. ''There's no vernacular everyone is sharing. There's a lot more chaos in front of us, and in front of our clients. Frankly, we're all in a business that we don't fully understand, where the business models may change tomorrow. That's what makes it an adventure.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/06/world/cia-links-cited-on-peru-arms-deal-that-backfired.html": {"writer_name": "Tim Golden", "pub_date": "2000-11-06", "snippet": "Fifty thousand surplus assault rifles that were sold by Jordan to Peruvian military in 1998 with CIA's approval end up with Colombian guerrillas in deal involving ousted Peruvian intelligence chief, Vladimiro Montesinos, crucial CIA ally in region...", "word_count": 1459, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "C.I.A.

But his account was immediately challenged by officials in Jordan and Colombia, who suggested that the Peruvian government was more deeply involved than it cared to admit. **********Now, since his ouster in September, Mr. Montesinos has himself been implicated in the arms deal by two of the men who organized it. Peruvian officials are moving to prosecute him in connection with a large personal fortune he apparently hid in Swiss banks, and State Department officials are complaining privately that the C.I.A. was slow to inform them fully about what had gone on. **********American officials say the evidence of Mr. Montesinos's possible role in the gun running remains unclear. But they say the C.I.A.'s handling of the case has raised new questions about the agency's ties to Mr. Montesinos, deepening a rift in the Clinton administration over how closely it should dealing with an official who has been linked to human rights abuses and other crimes. **********''We don't know for sure that he was involved, but there's a lot of smoke coming from his direction,'' an administration official said. ''We do know that we should have had a lot of the information a lot earlier than we got it.'' **********Intelligence officials, who like others would discuss the matter only on condition of anonymity, defended the C.I.A.'s actions. They said that while the agency may have been slow to uncover what had happened, it informed administration officials promptly this year after the guns had been traced back to Jordan. **********While the C.I.A. had worked closely with Mr. Montesinos and depended on him to support covert anti-terrorism and drug-interdiction programs the United States has operated in Peru since the late 1980's, they said, the agency has also reported in detail on his purported misdeeds. **********Mr. Montesinos has not been heard from. He fled to Panama on Sept. 24, after the disclosure of a videotape that showed him bribing an opposition legislator. When Panamanian officials refused private pleas from the United States and the Organization of American States to grant Mr. Montesinos political asylum, he flew back to Peru on Oct. 23 and went into hiding. **********On Friday, after Switzerland's discovery of five bank accounts holding some $50 million, Peruvian officials announced that they would try to prosecute him for illegally enriching himself during his decade-long tenure as President Alberto K. Fujimori's most powerful adviser. **********If Mr. Montesinos was in fact earning money from arms trading, that apparently never crossed the minds of the American intelligence officers in Amman. **********Intelligence officials said there was nothing unusual about Jordanian military or intelligence officials running a proposed arms sale past the C.I.A., even though they were under no formal obligation to do so. **********''They said, 'Would it upset our relationship with you if we sold these weapons to the Peruvian government?'' one of the officials said. ''It's not unreasonable that the Peruvian government might want weapons of this type. The Jordanians aren't required to ask us.'' **********Although the United States had closely watched weapons purchases by Peru since its longstanding border dispute with Ecuador erupted in open warfare in 1995, C.I.A. officials did only a cursory check of the deal, several American officials said. **********Agency officers in Amman informed senior diplomats and defense attaches at the American Embassy, officials said, but no one cabled word of proposal to the State Department. **********The C.I.A. officers did notify their headquarters in Langley, Va., where it was then passed along to the agency station in Lima. Nonetheless, intelligence officers there never raised the matter with Peruvian security officials because, an intelligence official said, ''it was told to us in confidence by the Jordanians.'' **********Several administration officials argued that this amounted to far less than adequate notification by the C.I.A., regardless of the outcome.  ''This was not an appropriate thing to have happen,'' a senior official said. ''This was an issue that should have been put before policy makers.'' **********The arms broker who arranged the sale, Sarkis Soghanalian, said in an interview that he, too, had been told the guns were going to the Peruvian military, and that he had demanded and received end-user certificates validating that claim. **********But Mr. Soghanalian, who is awaiting trial in Los Angeles on unrelated money laundering and bank fraud charges, also said the Peruvians  sought from the start to establish a discreet relationship they might use to buy more sophisticated weapons. And after agreeing in December 1998 to sell the 50,000 Jordanian rifles for just under $500,000, Mr. Soghanalian said he flew to Lima to discuss Peru's other weapons needs. **********The arms dealer, a Lebanese citizen who has sold vast amounts of  weapons worldwide, said he had met in Lima with several senior military officials and had lunch at a private Lima yacht club with Mr. Montesinos, who was introduced to him as ''the boss.'' **********He said, 'We need someone like you,' '' Mr. Soghanalian recalled. **********Peruvian officials presented Mr. Soghanalian with a shopping list of more than $70 million worth of hardware that he thought could have been meant only for a regular army: antiaircraft weapons, communications gear and equipment to upgrade tanks. **********The broker said there were some strange aspects to the arrangement: The Peruvians asked to pay for the future purchases in cash and offered him $22 million as a down payment. They insisted on air-dropping the AK-47's to their troops. The first of the cargoes was also turned back in the Amazon basin for reasons that were never clear, and the shipments were finally aborted in August 1999 after 9,540 of the rifles had been sent. **********But Mr. Soghanalian said he did not think much of the fact that the Peruvians also wanted to buy a large quantity of Russian SA-7 Strella missiles, a shoulder-fired weapon that would immediately change the balance of power in Colombia if obtained by the insurgents. **********Many military analysts have speculated that it is only a matter of time before the guerrillas try to obtain such weapons in response to a $1.3 billion package of American aid that includes almost $400 million for new helicopters for the Colombian security forces. The retired Peruvian Army lieutenant who arranged for the Jordanian shipment with Mr. Soghanalian, Jose Luis Aybar, has also identified Mr. Montesinos as the official who oversaw the arms deal. But Mr. Aybar said he was unaware that the Jordanian cargo consisted of assault rifles, a claim that Mr. Soghanalian and others contradicted. **********American officials remain divided about Mr. Montesinos's possible role in the affair. **********Several officials said C.I.A. reporting on the matter had been notably thin, despite the agency's extensive contacts in the Peruvian security forces. They said senior State Department officials, including the under secretary, Thomas R. Pickering, had been deeply dissatisfied with the flow of information from the agency, both about the its own early role in the case and about the possible involvement of Peruvian officials. **********''Every time you asked a question, it would take a few days to get an answer,'' an official said. ''And every time, their story would change a little. It was like pulling teeth.'' **********But an intelligence official noted that after the Colombian military seized some of the AK-47's in mid-1999, the C.I.A. helped trace them, confirming in April that they had come from the Jordanian shipment. That discovery was promptly reported to White House, State Department and Defense officials. **********The agency also informed Peru, apparently prompting the news conference on Aug. 21 at which Mr. Fujimori and Mr. Montesinos claimed to have broken up a ring of international smugglers who had sought to pass themselves off as Peruvian officials. **********The intelligence official also said that despite the claims of Mr. Soghanalian and Mr. Aybar, the C.I.A. still had no credible information that the fugitive Peruvian intelligence chief had been involved in sending guns to the Colombian rebels. **********''We don't have any illusions about his background,'' the official said of Mr. Montesinos. ''But we do not have intelligence information -- other than the statements of a couple of individuals -- that ties him to it.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/10/business/business-this-money-doesn-t-just-talk-it-wraps.html": {"writer_name": "Andrea Higbie", "pub_date": "2000-12-10", "snippet": "Ostentatious gift wraps are proving popular this year; examples cited; photo (M)", "word_count": 585, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "This Money Doesn't Just Talk.

She was experienced: she once owned a gift-wrapping shop in Arlington, called Wrapsody, with her mother, Terry. **********Ms. Timberlake won $10,000 for her efforts, as well as the chance to wrap a 2001-model Jaguar S-Type for display at a Dallas car dealership.

The ring was set in a box within a larger box to make it appear to float. It was then escorted by a guard (the customer's) to the recipient. The cost was $100, not including the guard. **********A 1950's martini set with vodka and olives was cosseted in $25 sheets of handmade embossed wrapping paper. ''The gift recipient's apartment was once featured in a magazine,'' Mr. Barker said. ''So we knew this gift had to look perfect.'' In this case, perfection totaled $200. **********Is it better to give than to receive -- to wrap than to unwrap? ''I love wrapping gifts,'' Ms. Timberlake said.

Officials are pressing Russia to accept a defensive system that it considers a grave, destabilizing threat, but which some Congressional Republicans believe is not nearly big enough. [Excerpts from the American document, page A10.] **********''The U.S. national missile defense system, which will be limited and intended to defend against several dozen long-range missiles launched by rogue states, will be incapable of threatening Russia's strategic deterrence,'' said a summary of the administration's arguments, presented to the Russians. **********The administration wants to change the treaty to let the United States build the first phase of a defensive system with 100 missiles and their launchers, as well as a sophisticated new radar system on Shemya Island in Alaska. But the administration also wants a second phase, to include another 100 missiles and launchers at a second site. In its proposal, the United States calls for talks on an expanded system to begin as soon as next March -- after Mr. Clinton's successor is inaugurated. **********Russia fears that any agreement to allow a limited defensive system would open the door to demands for a further expansion that would gut the aims of the ABM treaty, which prohibits national defensive shields. The theory was that by limiting the nations' defenses, the treaty takes away their compensating need to build up their offenses, providing some stability. And if nations feel invulnerable to attack, they might be tempted to launch a first strike. **********American negotiators have tried to assure their Russian counterparts that the system would pose no threat to Russia's strategic nuclear deterrence, but rather would focus on more isolated threats of ballistic missile strikes. **********The American document went to great lengths to reassure Russia that even if the two countries agree to reduce their warheads to between 1,500 and 2,000 as proposed under the next phase of the planned nuclear arms reduction, known as Start III,  the Russian nuclear force would have nothing to fear from the American defensive shield. **********''These strategic forces give each side the certain ability to carry out an annihilating counterattack,'' the document said. ''Forces of this size can easily penetrate a limited system of the type the United States is now developing.'' **********The summary, which was presented to the Russians in January by the senior American negotiator, John D. Holum, went on to say that in the event of a first-strike attack, Russia would still be able ''to send about a thousand warheads, together with two to three times more decoys, accompanied by other advanced defense penetration aids'' that would easily overwhelm the limited American system. **********''Authoritative written Russian sources claim that the Russian Government understands that the capabilities of its defense penetration aids are extremely high,'' the document said. ''These same written sources, supplemented by the statements of senior Russian military personnel and defense industry representatives, clearly present the idea that the Russian Government anticipated that is defense penetration aides could easily overcome the U.S. N.M.D. system,'' referring to the national missile defense. **********The documents outlining the administration's position were obtained by The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists in Russia and passed on to The New York Times. The bulletin plans to make them available on its web site (www.thebulletin.org). Senior administration officials declined to comment on the documents, but in interviews today discussed the rationale behind the proposals. **********The proposals amount to the administration's opening offer in negotiations that have barely got off the ground. **********While senior American and Russian officials have held repeated discussions over the last year, the Russians have not yet decided whether to even engage in negotiations on the treaty. In public -- and equally so in private, officials said -- the Russians have adamantly opposed any changes to allow a missile defense. **********''It's very much an open question whether Russia is going to conclude that it is in Russia's interest to do a deal with this administration,'' a senior administration official said. **********However, the discussions have intensified with the recent election of Vladimir V. Putin as Russia's next President and the coming end of President Clinton's second term. **********At a news conference capping of three days of talks that centered on national missile defense, the Russian foreign minister, Igor S. Ivanov, and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said today that discussions would continue when Mr. Clinton and Mr. Putin meet in Moscow in June. **********President Clinton has not made a decision so far on whether to deploy a defensive system. He is not scheduled to do so until after the Pentagon's next antimissile test in June. **********Mr. Ivanov said that ''considerable differences'' remained, and he repeated that Russia believed the ABM treaty should ''remain a cornerstone of strategic stability.'' **********Dr. Albright responded by saying that the administration, too, wanted to preserve the treaty but also wanted to adapt it to ''21st-century needs,'' a reference to the missile threats that intelligence experts have warned are fast approaching. **********The administration's proposal would not directly amend the text of the treaty, but rather revise it by adding two brief ''protocols.'' They would allow the first phase of a missile defense and provide extensive measures for verification of the system's missiles and radars. **********Another senior administration official said the decision to propose protocols was simply easier than trying to revise the wording of the treaty line by line. It could also allow Russians to declare that the treaty itself remained unchanged. However, the administration official said, ''It's not like cosmetics are going to solve this problem.'' **********If approved by the Russians, the protocols would still face a test in the Senate, which would have to approve them before they took effect. More than 20 Republican senators said they would not accept Mr. Clinton's proposed changes, contending that they would limit a defensive system too much. **********The protocol covers only the first phase of the American missile defense system, intended to counter an attack from North Korea, which will be able to threaten the continental United States with ballistic missiles by 2005, according to a classified intelligence estimate. **********The administration stopped short of asking the Russians to approve immediately the second phase of the system, which would be based at a still undecided location and counter threats from the Middle East and Persian Gulf, which intelligence consider to be a decade or more away. **********However, an article in the protocol explicitly allows either side to reopen negotiations as soon as March 1, 2001 ''to take into account further changes in the strategic situation.'' **********The decision to ask for only the first phase, while insisting on the right to expand it further, was a practical one, the officials said. **********They said they assumed it would be easier to get the Russians to accept only a first phase, which American consider more urgent, rather than a larger system. The decision also reflected the change in administrations next January. **********The officials emphasized that the United States only plans to build two phases, but the proposed language does not specify that. With Republicans in Congress pressing for a further expansion of the system, the protocol's lack of specificity may well stoke the Russian fears of facing a slippery slope to a larger system. **********The protocol would also allow the United States to build a radar in Alaska and upgrade early-warning radar stations in Alaska, Massachusetts and California. **********Lisbeth Gronlund, a senior staff scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, which opposes a national missile defense, said the radar undercut a linchpin of the treaty, which limited such systems on the theory that once they were built, antimissile missiles could be quickly deployed. **********Stephen I. Schwartz, publisher of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, said he was troubled by the assumptions underlying the administration's reassurances to the Russians. **********The documents, he said, showed that the administration was willing to accept the continued existence of a large Russian nuclear force, rather than seek bilateral reductions. **********''The United States Government would forsake deep reductions in the Russian and American arsenals in favor of deploying a limited missile defense against a threat that doesn't yet exist,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/09/world/10-die-as-violence-surges-on-palestinian-day-of-rage.html": {"writer_name": "Joel Greenberg", "pub_date": "2000-12-09", "snippet": "Israeli security forces kill seven Palestinians, and Palestinian gunmen kill three Israelis in one of deadliest days of violence in West Bank and East Jerusalem since outbreak of current Palestinian uprising; violence comes in 'day of rage' called...", "word_count": 949, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "10 Die as Violence Surges on Palestinian 'Day of Rage'", "print_headline": "10 Die as Violence Surges on Palestinian 'Day of Rage'", "body_text": " **********Ten people were killed today in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in one of the deadliest days of violence since the outbreak of the current Palestinian uprising more than two months ago. **********The violence surged as Palestinians marked the 13th anniversary of the first uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

Putin acts on his promise to build a better foundation for the country's still shaky market economy, a top official of the organization said today. **********Since last fall, the fund has held off providing new credits to Russia, insisting that its government and Central Bank first tackle long-promised changes that would restore international confidence in the way business is done here. **********Today, after meeting with Mr. Putin and other top officials, Stanley Fischer, acting managing director of the monetary fund, said that for the first time in several years he had heard a consensus on the need to push reforms in Russia toward a ''second beginning.'' **********He said the issue of the delayed credits -- once a burning topic in Moscow -- had not come up in his official talks, which he said had focused on issues like tax and banking reforms, accounting standards and corporate governance. **********''There is a difference this time,'' said Mr. Fischer, who has a long familiarity with the fund's often tortured relations with Russia. ''The level of tension is just way down, and we are in a much more normal type of relationship.'' **********Buoyed by a surge in world oil prices and the boon of a sharp devaluation of the ruble, the Russian government has been able to manage so far without the expected credits and has even met most of its foreign debt payments this year -- including those owed to the fund. **********But Mikhail M. Kasyanov, the first deputy prime minister and finance minister, said this week that Russia could use $1.5 billion in credits from the monetary fund to pay off arrears to Russian defense factories and regional governments. **********The country's improved economic situation is a major reason for the calmer atmosphere surrounding Mr. Fischer's visit this week, in contrast to the pent-up anxiety that has accompanied the fund's missions to Moscow in recent years. **********Mr. Fischer said Mr. Putin had emphasized the importance of improving the investment climate in Russia while at the same time protecting a social safety net for the poor. Those elements will be part of a comprehensive economic program that is expected to be presented by Mr. Putin's research group, headed by German O. Gref, in late May, after Mr. Putin is inaugurated and appoints his new government. **********Armed with the mandate he won in his election on March 26 and backed by a newly compliant Parliament, Mr. Putin can push for reforms on his own, without help from the fund, Mr. Fischer said. **********But like other Western observers, Mr. Fischer was cautious enough to note that the real test would come when the Putin program was put into practice. ''We have to see the program being put into effect,'' he said. At a conference here on Thursday, he complained that ''vested interests'' had been the main obstacle to Russia's first reform efforts. **********Mr. Fischer also met today with Viktor V. Gerashchenko, chairman of the Russian Central Bank, which the fund has pressed to keep more open books. **********In an interview published today in the daily Sevodnya, Sergei V. Kiriyenko, a former prime minister and leader of a rightist party, said the fund's most important role was to support Russia's next reform effort. **********''This is a unique moment,'' said Mr. Kiriyenko, who met with Mr. Fischer on Thursday. ''All this is happening when the economy is on the upswing. The I.M.F. experts and Stanley Fischer, a man who has always advocated tangible help to Russia, are aware of this.'' **********-------------------- **********American Held Without Charges **********WASHINGTON, April 7 (Reuters) -- The United States said today that Russia had not formally charged an American arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of spying. **********The man, identified by the United States Embassy in Moscow as Edmond Pope, was visited on Wednesday by a consular officer in Lefortovo Prison, said James P.

Second, it delivers crisp movie images and sound directly into the living room, and Japan adores the movies. **********But will digital video disk players -- the latest must-have product in the United States -- be the next home electronics bonanza here? The picture is still fuzzy. **********Although Japanese DVD manufacturers are bursting into the U.S. market, they must struggle for buyers back home, where cramped housing and a slow economy crimp demand for pricey home theaters built around DVDs. **********The DVD story is an unusual twist to the globalization trend, where most companies score in home markets first and expand abroad later. Instead, Japanese makers are trying to duplicate their U.S. success in Japan. **********DVD players, which went on sale in late 1996 in Japan and the following year in the United States, can play feature-length movies, about two hours of viewing, from a disk that looks like a CD. **********Hooked to a 36-inch TV monitor or an even larger flat-panel screen, a DVD player can show movies with the vivid, clear imagery and encompassing sound effects of cinema. **********That has made them a hit in the United States, where sales more than quadrupled last year to about 3 million from nearly 700,000 in 1998, according to NPD Intelect, a Port Washington, N.Y. market researcher. **********But in Japan, only 388,000 DVD players were sold last year, though up a healthy 62 percent from 1998, says the Electronic Industries Association of Japan. **********The reasons for the lag are uniquely Japanese. One problem is tiny apartments in Japan. **********Like many Japanese, Fuminori Nakaya, 44, already has his share of electronic gadgets, so much so that his suburban Tokyo home is full of stuff. **********\"I live in an apartment,\" said Nakaya, whose living room, at 15 feet by 12 feet, is large by Japanese standards. \"There's no space to set up a DVD.\" **********Another problem is the economy. **********While the United States is on a roll, Japan is struggling to recover from an anemic economy that has greatly slowed consumer spending. Persuading people to go out and buy a luxury item is no easy chore. **********A DVD player costs roughly $380 in Japan, more than three times what VCRs start at. The bill for related home theater equipment can quickly add up, with an amplifier going for about $1,700 and the latest flat-screen technology $3,800 or more. **********Then there's software. While DVD players here cost the same as in the United States, the video disks are twice the U.S. price at around $50. Software makers are reluctant to cheapen them without a larger audience. **********While most DVD movies sold in Japan are from Hollywood, they must be modified for the Japanese market. **********\"In Japan, DVDs are still for the minority -- those who're so crazy about movies they're willing to pay for the latest technology,\" said Junichi Nishikawa, a manager Pioneer manager. **********Still, the potential is clearly there. **********VCRs are extremely popular in Japanese homes. Video rental shops are just about everywhere. And DVDs seem an attractive alternative to the steep cost of a movie ticket in Japan -- about $16 -- and long waits in line that can accompany a night out at the cinema. **********Even so, the appetite for movie entertainment in the United States is hard to match. **********Ten times more Americans went to movies than Japanese last year, according to the Motion Pictures Producers Association of Japan in Tokyo, although the American population is only about double Japan's. **********America's greater passion for movies translates well to home theater, some industry officials say. **********\"The idea of the home theater was easily accepted in the United States,\" said Hitoshi Hitokoto, manager of Sony's DVD product planning. \"It appealed to only a small part of the Japanese population.\" **********Like so many electronics goods, most DVD players are produced by Japanese companies, with Sony topping U.S. market share at 30 percent, followed by Pioneer and Toshiba, NPD Intelect says. **********Producers are hardly writing the market off. Instead, they are trying to adapt -- and are making some significant headway. **********The market got a big boost this year from sales of Sony's PlayStation 2 video-game machine, which can also play DVDs. The PlayStation 2, set to go on sale in the United States this fall, has sold 2 million in Japan since hitting stores in March. **********Another hit is the portable DVD machine, which looks like a laptop computer -- a plus for Japanese who don't have space for a home theater. **********Answering another concern, manufacturers such as Pioneer and Matsushita Electric Industrial are coming out with DVD machines in Japan that can record TV programs just like VCRs. **********Both companies plan to sell the models in the United States, although a date has not been set. **********Home | Site Index | Site Search | Forums | Archives | Marketplace **********Quick News | Page One Plus | International | National/N.Y. | Business | Technology | Science | Sports | Weather | Editorial | Op-Ed | Arts | Automobiles | Books | Diversions | Job Market | Real Estate | Travel **********Help/Feedback | Classifieds | Services | New York Today **********Copyright 2000 The New York Times Company"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/14/business/l-deregulation-reconsidered-245429.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-05-14", "snippet": "Safe Energy Commnication Council research director Christopher Sherry letter on April 30 article holds states that are deregulating utilities must mandate full divestiture of generation assets before allowing utilities to recover so-called strande...", "word_count": 143, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Deregulation, Reconsidered", "print_headline": "Deregulation, Reconsidered", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********Re ''Deregulation Has Given Power to the Power People'' (April 30), which looked at the improved financial outlook of utilities: **********Deregulation has given utilities an unprecedented multibillion-dollar  bailout at the expense of consumers and a vibrant competitive market. **********But states that are still deregulating can help remedy the situation.

It took the Swedes the equivalent of 70 years of computer time to decipher 10 increasingly difficult codes set by author Simon Singh in his international bestseller \"The Code Book.\" They ranged from ciphers dating back to ancient Greece through Victorian codes and the famed Nazi Enigma code machine from World War Two. \"It is the toughest code that has ever been cracked,\" Singh said on Thursday before handing over the first prize cheque for 10,000 pounds ($15,000) to the team headed by Fredrik Almgren. Almgren works on Internet security. He solved the puzzle with software developer Torbjorn Granlund and a trio of computer buffs from the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. The challenge had obsessed thousands of codebreakers around the world. They even set up their own website which attracted 2,500 fans from a 14-year-old schoolboy to maths professors. Singh, believing that the ultimate prize was out of their reach, had already given a 1,000-pound prize to two computer buffs who had cracked the first nine codes. But then the Swedes came through with the solution to the final \"512 bit\" code. Singh, who has a doctorate in physics at Cambridge University, took two years to create the brain teasers with Dr Paul Leyland, who works for Microsoft in Cambridge. They worked in total secrecy. \"I regularly went into my little garden, dipped the relevant papers in molten wax and set them alight,\" Singh told Thursday's Daily Telegraph. Almgren admitted that it was a long, hard grind and the Swedish team were tempted to abandon ship at times. \"The first stages were very simple but at one point we thought we wouldn't get any further than stage eight,\" he told BBC radio. \"When you do come to the 10th stage it is a question of heavy mathematics and rather difficult algorithms that I don't even claim to understand myself.\" The cipher the team finally cracked is similar to the on-line security used by Internet banking and shopping outlets. But Singh argued that this did not mean Internet security had been compromised. \"It is the sort of thing that some people do use on the Internet for Internet security,\" Singh said. \"That doesn't necessarily mean that Internet security is invalid because it took a year for a team of Swedes to crack this with some very sophisticated computers.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/27/business/midstream-fast-forwarding-those-campus-visits.html": {"writer_name": "James Schembari", "pub_date": "2000-08-27", "snippet": "Collegiate Choice offers videotapes of college campuses which allow prospective student applicants to preview campus atmospheres without traveling to visit; drawing (M)", "word_count": 825, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fast-Forwarding Those Campus Visits", "print_headline": "MIDSTREAM; Fast-Forwarding Those Campus Visits", "body_text": " **********AS they approach their freshman year of college, our soon-to-be-unaffordable children give us a taste of expenses to come when we take them to visit the schools that have caught their eye. Some of them are in places that might as well be Timbuktu. **********The wish lists are usually long, involving colleges in different parts of the country, so some parents stagger these exhausting trips over the course of a year -- generally their child's junior year of high school. That can get expensive. **********My neighbors in Connecticut traveled with their daughter this month to visit schools in Chicago, and will go later to California. A family I know in the Midwest hit the Boston area last month, as well as Maine, Rhode Island and Connecticut; they plan to go to Chicago and Indiana  in the fall and California next spring. By using frequent-flier miles and staying with friends, they are keeping the total cost of the trips to about $4,000; the father is even borrowing a video camera to record some of the visits. **********Actually, there is a way that he could have stayed home. Parents can reduce the cost and trouble by taking advantage of videotapes now available for many colleges around the country. Some come from the colleges, and some from independent companies. Some can even be viewed on the Internet. Although most people involved with these videos caution that a tape is no substitute for an actual visit, they do say it is a good way to cull a long list of college choices and save a few stops on that junior-year marathon. **********''If you're considering making a trip that is more than a day's drive away, you might look at the tape to see if it's worth it,'' said Christopher M. Klass, president of the Klass Report of Manhattan, which sells college videos. ''When you get back, you can use the tapes to review and refresh your memory. The videos are also good for people who can't afford to visit the schools.'' **********The Klass Report (www.klassreport.com, $19.95 a school) has tapes of 40 colleges, but the company has not shot any new videos since 1997, so some information may be outdated; Mr. Klass said he hopes to add more schools this fall. His tapes are professionally shot, edited and narrated and include topics like student-teacher ratios, on-  and off-campus living arrangements and what there is to do off campus. **********Tapes offered by Collegiate Choice ($15 a tour, www.collegiatechoice.com) are far from professional, and that is part of their charm. They look as if they were shot by someone's dad. And they were. **********Cliff Kramon of Tenafly, N.J., who makes the tapes and is the father of two adult sons, is a salesman for his family's Manhattan clothing company; he travels around the country on business. His wife, Sami, a college adviser, urged him to videotape a couple of college campuses for her during a business trip a few years ago. He now has about 350 tapes. **********He uses a ''you are there'' approach, taping the campus and then recording the tour that the college gives to visiting parents and students. He asks the student guide the kinds of questions a parent would ask; he adds no narration or other comments of his own. **********''I don't want to hear the school say what the student-faculty ratio is; I ask the tour guide,'' he said. ''I want to know how safe the area is. I want to know if the school empties out on the weekend. No school wants to admit it is a suitcase school.'' **********Search Communications in Philadelphia (www.searchbyvideo.com, $8 a school) doesn't shoot its own videos; it distributes tapes made by about 300 colleges. The company's Web site also offers the online videos of 10 colleges and plans to add more. **********Joyce E. Smith, executive director of the National Association for College Admission Counseling in Alexandria, Va., said parents should find out what a college offers free before buying a commercially distributed tape. **********''Sometimes parents get caught up in this college transition thing and spend money they didn't have to spend,'' she said. ''There's lots of free good information available from the college if parents just ask.'' **********HAVE mixed views about the tapes. I didn't care for the editorial comments in the Klass tapes, but they gave a good view of the college. Collegiate Choice had the most unvarnished approach, but when a tour guide was boring, so was the tape. The tapes offered by the colleges and by Search Communications give a good overview, but they are part of the schools' marketing efforts. **********Some tapes were incredibly dull, but the one for Virginia Tech was so clever, and the student narrators so talented, that I hoped the school would end up as one of my own children's choices. **********So much for culling the list."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/09/business/big-carmakers-extend-benefits-to-gay-couples.html": {"writer_name": "Keith Bradsher", "pub_date": "2000-06-09", "snippet": "sGeneral Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler division announce they will extend medical, dental and prescription drug benefits for same-sex partners of their 466,000 hourly and salaried employees; move is largest yet by corporate America t...", "word_count": 965, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Big Carmakers Extend Benefits To Gay Couples", "print_headline": "Big Carmakers Extend Benefits To Gay Couples", "body_text": " **********General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler division announced today that they would begin offering medical, dental and prescription drug benefits for same-sex partners of their 466,000 hourly and salaried employees in the United States, the largest move yet by corporate America to provide such benefits for gay and lesbian couples. **********Many companies in the financial, media, entertainment and airline industries and some state and local governments have offered same-sex benefits in the last several years. But gay and lesbian advocates said the automakers' decisions dwarfed previous corporate moves and were particularly welcome because Midwestern companies have been slow to provide such benefits. **********''When the Big Three come together as a group to announce domestic benefits for same-sex couples, it's really a sea change,'' said Kim I. Mills, the education director of the Human Rights Campaign, a group that represents gay, lesbian and transgender Americans. ''We have not seen this kind of movement in the manufacturing sector.'' **********The two largest American companies offering same-sex benefits until now have been I.B.M. and Citigroup, she said. Both companies are based in the New York area, where gays and lesbians are more influential than in the Midwest. **********The Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit expressed dismay at the automakers' decision. The Catholic Church favors open and equal access to health care, but ''anything that compromises or erodes the traditional shape of the family tears at the very fabric of moral relationships that the church seeks to uphold,'' said Ned McGrath, a spokesman for the archdiocese. **********The federal government does not provide same-sex benefits for its employees. In the private sector and among state and local governments, such benefits are offered to 18 percent of workers, according to a study last year by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan group in Oakland, Calif. The companies and governments offering the benefits are most likely to be in the Northeast, on the West Coast or in Minnesota and Wisconsin, two states with a liberal tradition, said Kenneth McDonnell, a research analyst at the Employee Benefit Research Institute in Washington. **********David L. Murphy, Ford's vice president for human resources, said that the U.A.W. had demanded same-sex benefits during contract negotiations last autumn. Ford concluded that the benefits would add less than $5 million a year to Ford's $2 billion in annual health care costs. G.M. and DaimlerChrysler also calculated that the costs would be small, Mr. Murphy said. **********When automakers provide a new benefit to their hourly workers, they usually offer it to salaried employees, too, as they are now. Companies in other industries have found that less than 1 percent of their employees register for same-sex benefits, and Mr. Murphy predicted that this would hold for the auto industry. **********The automakers will not offer the benefit to retirees, but same-sex partners of current employees can retain their benefits after these employees retire. Those seeking the benefits must provide an affidavit and evidence of shared financial responsibilities. Unmarried heterosexual partners of employees will remain ineligible for benefits. **********The U.A.W. has been under mounting pressure from its gay and lesbian members to win better legal protections and benefits for them. The Canadian Auto Workers union had made the issue a priority, winning same-sex benefits from G.M. in Canada in 1993. Chrysler resisted in Canada until it lost an arbitration case in 1997, and Ford held out in Canada until last year. **********''It became kind of a personal thing, that people had objections to gays and lesbians and couldn't get past that to see them as workers,'' said Basil E. Hargrove, the Canadian union's president. **********U.A.W. leaders declined to comment on the same-sex benefits, which will take effect on Aug. 1. **********Chrysler drew national attention in 1997 when it chose not to advertise on the episode of ''Ellen,'' a television sitcom in which the lead character, Ellen DeGeneres, made clear that she was a lesbian. Chrysler executives further antagonized gay and lesbian groups then when they compared the show with the murder trial of O. J. Simpson, saying that they did not buy advertisements on socially polarizing shows. Chrysler resumed advertising on subsequent episodes that included lesbian themes. **********The controversy caused some gay and lesbian employees at Chrysler to organize as People of Diversity, an advocacy group that now has about 100 members. Only a quarter of them are in the U.A.W., but they tried hard to enlist the U.A.W.'s support, said Michelle Walters, the group's co-chairwoman. **********Virtually all of Chrysler's top leadership has turned over since Daimler-Benz took over the company in November 1998. Kathleen Oswald, Chrysler's senior vice president for human resources, said that by stressing diversity, the company wanted to ''make sure we would continue to get the best and brightest.'' **********She declined to comment on Chrysler's previous policies, other than to say, ''The 'Ellen' program certainly helped raise awareness.'' **********DaimlerChrysler's other divisions, Mercedes cars and Freightliner heavy trucks, are not unionized except for one Freightliner factory that has a separate labor contract. Both divisions said today that they had no plans to offer same-sex benefits. **********Ms. Walters said that two executives had played a large role in changing industry attitudes: Thomas T.

''We acknowledge that there is an Argentine component to this uncertainty,'' Mr. Marx said flatly. **********At that moment, he sounded less like a government official and more like the investment banker he had been until December. Many in the audience already knew him, and had come for reassurance that Argentina's problems would not explode into the century's first economic prairie fire. **********Their minds were not set at ease. Their foremost worry is the nearly $20 billion in debt that Argentina has to refinance next year. That won't be easy, given the sorry state of investor confidence in the country. Two years after a brutal recession ended, Argentina's economy is still struggling -- growth of just 1 percent is expected this year -- and no one knows when the besieged Argentine government will be able to put together a budget. The dollar-pegged peso is hurting exports and may be too overvalued to sustain. The country's $123.5 billion in federal debt is also a growing headache, and last week, Standard & Poor's put Argentina on a credit watch, with a negative outlook. **********On top of all that, a political crisis is roiling Buenos Aires. Carlos Alvarez, the vice president, resigned a few weeks ago over a bribery scandal that is threatening to unravel the ruling alliance that Fernando de la Rua cobbled together when he became president in December. **********The turmoil in Argentina has set off rumors that the United States Treasury Department and the International Monetary Fund are working on a financial bailout to keep Argentina from defaulting on its loans. Both agencies deny the rumors. The fund already has arranged a $7.4 billion line of credit, of which $2 billion is available for use. But Tom Dawson, the fund's director of external affairs, said there had not been any discussion of additional credit. **********As always, Lawrence Summers, the Treasury secretary who was the American official most involved in the 1995 bailout of Mexico, is keeping his cards close to the vest. He declined to comment on the rumors, but he acknowledged that he was watching Argentina carefully. **********''Argentina is a country that has a strong record of reform during the 1990's, and that should serve it well,'' Mr. Summers said after a recent meeting in Montreal. **********That record of economic reform is part of what makes Argentina's sudden volatility so hard to ignore. For most of the last decade, Argentina was a symbol for American-style, market-oriented economics. Under the guiding hand of Domingo Cavallo, a former minister of the economy, Argentina transformed itself into an exemplar of a developing nation. **********But when things were going well, Argentina went off its fiscal diet. It overspent, racking up serious deficits and borrowing heavily. The current government inherited a seriously weakened economy, and efforts to restore confidence have backfired. **********DESPITE Mr. Marx's assurance that everything is under control, many economists fear that Argentina's troubles could prompt a regional disaster, or worse. Argentina represents anywhere from one-quarter to one-third of benchmark emerging-markets indexes like the one put out by J. P. Morgan. If Argentina has trouble refinancing its debt or goes into default, the entire region could be hurt, as happened after the Mexican crisis in 1995 and Brazil's currency devaluation in 1999. American investors and banks have a big stake in Argentina, and a default could leave them holding billions of dollars in bad loans. **********Having suffered through those earlier debacles, investors are particularly sensitive to Argentina's woes. ''It's the old saying,  'Once burned, twice shy,' except here it's more like five times burned and really shy,'' said Walter Molano, managing director of BCP Securities, a brokerage firm based in Greenwich, Conn. **********Leonardo Leiderman, head of Latin American research at Deutsche Bank, is one of the few economists willing to predict that Argentina will pull through. ''Our call is that Argentina will not default on its obligations next year,'' Mr. Leiderman said. ''But it's going to take a strong stomach to get through the weeks ahead.'' **********During his recent visit to New York, Mr. Marx also acknowledged that difficult times could increase the temptation to use economics for political gain, which wary investors would probably rather not have heard. **********''We have to turn back to basics,'' he said, and not give in to political pressures ''that might distract us so that we do not act like rational human beings.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/21/business/greenspan-speaks-softly-with-big-stick.html": {"writer_name": "Floyd Norris", "pub_date": "2000-01-21", "snippet": "Floyd Norris comment on power of Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan to control US economy; says Greenspan and his colleagues want to slow economy, but Greenspan does not want to take blame for it; Hoenig & Co chief economist Robert J Barbera ...", "word_count": 590, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Greenspan Speaks Softly, With Big Stick", "print_headline": "Greenspan Speaks Softly, With Big Stick", "body_text": " **********PITY Alan Greenspan. Suddenly the talk around Wall Street is that the Federal Reserve just doesn't have the power it once had over the economy. The Fed has raised interest rates three times, and the economy -- and the stock market -- just keep rolling along. Interest rates are no longer important. **********If such talk brings on a feeling of deja vu, it may be because you remember the days of 1991 and 1992, when this economic expansion was young and widely derided as weak and fragile. Then the talk was of ''profitless growth'' and ''pushing on a string.'' The Fed's efforts to stimulate the economy were faltering. **********In fact, the economy has changed, and there probably is a longer lag before the Fed can have a major impact. But the Fed is far from impotent. If Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues really want to slow the economy, they can. And it appears that Mr. Greenspan wants to do just that; he just doesn't want to take the blame for it. **********At least that is the way I read the most intriguing part of his speech to the Economic Club of New York a week ago. In it he pointed out that consumption is rising much faster than incomes or productivity, and attributed a large part of that to the booming stock market and the feeling of wealth that it has produced. **********That cannot last, he said: ''What will stop the wealth-induced excess of demand over productivity-expanded supply is largely developments in financial markets.'' **********In other words, it is the markets that will slow the economy, not vice versa. ''He sees rising interest rates as the force that will ultimately cap the equity market's advance, contain equity wealth effects, and thereby rein in excess demand,'' said Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig & Company. **********Mr. Greenspan would like us to think that he is a passive observer, with the market raising long-term rates and the Fed just following along. He would like to avoid being blamed for bringing down the stock market, so he avoids talk about overvaluation and thus reassures investors. **********But there are signs that the Fed's medicine (or is it the bond market's?) is starting to work. Much of the stock market is stuttering, although technology stocks have recovered from their early-January swoon and are setting records. There is unprecedented volatility within the stock market, as the Dow Jones industrial average plunges while the Nasdaq composite zooms, or vice versa. There have been just six days in the last decade when one of those indexes rose at least 1 percent while the other fell by that amount. Four of them were in the last two months. **********Technology mutual funds have taken in $12.7 billion from investors since mid-November, reports AMG Data Services, while the rest of the equity-fund universe received just $4.5 billion. ''I've never seen it this concentrated,'' said Bob Adler, AMG's founder. ''Technology is the only focus.'' The trade deficit sets new records each month, as wealth-effect-driven consumption pulls in imports. **********The yield on 10-year Treasuries has climbed from 5.9 percent to 6.8 percent since mid-November, while the Nasdaq composite is up 30 percent. You can take that as evidence that the Fed cannot stop this runaway economy, or the technology bull market. Or you can agree with the wisdom of the late economist Herbert Stein, as quoted by Mr. Greenspan: ''If a trend cannot continue, it will stop.'' **********Mr. Greenspan thinks interest rates will rise enough to offset, if not end, the wealth effect.

While that has meant bargain travel for American tourists, it has generally meant miserable returns for Americans holding foreign mutual funds. **********According to Morningstar Inc., foreign funds lost 10.69 percent of their value through the third quarter, compared with a small loss of 1.54 percent in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. **********Those few foreign funds that have done well this year generally concentrated on picking stocks, not on hedging their currency risks. Still, debates over to what extent investors should venture back into foreign funds often turn into debates over currencies, especially the euro. **********For the first three quarters, Morningstar found 29 individual funds in positive territory, with 15 having returns above 5 percent. **********The Ivy International Small Companies fund, one of the top performers, returned better than 21 percent for the nine months. Miranda Richards of Henderson Investors in London, the fund's manager, attributed the results entirely to stock-picking, with no currency hedges to bolster the results. **********''There are very good small-cap companies that are global leaders in niche businesses,'' and her job is to find them, Ms. Richards said. Because the companies are small, she is often able to meet with the company's top management, not just the investor relations staff. As a result, she said, she has a better opportunity to know a company well than do managers of funds that invest in large-cap companies. **********One of her core holdings is Rational, a German company that has 41 percent of the world market for  some specialized ovens used by professional cooks. She bought shares in the initial public offering earlier this year and expects 40 percent annual growth in the stock price. Another favorite is CSL, an Australian company that is a leader in blood plasma products. **********If investors have the appropriate horizon of five years or more, she said, they will have less reason to worry about exchange rates. ''On this fund, we have no hedges at all at the moment,'' she said. ''We do not do very much hedging, because over the long term, currency fluctuations are less important.'' **********Sheridan Reilly said that the Ivy Funds, where he is international equities chief, are now unhedged but  would consider currency hedges when they would be likely to enhance returns or preserve capital. If a portfolio were ''overhedged,'' he said, ''it could limit the upside.'' **********THE costs of hedging can vary widely, he said, from ''negligible'' in Japan, where interest rates are extremely low, to punishingly expensive in politically or economically less stable countries like Indonesia and Malaysia, where short-term interest rates have been more than 25 percent in recent years. ''That means you're agreeing to give up 25 percent if you hedge,'' he said, because hedges are a function of interest rates. In such conditions, he added, ''we exit the market.'' **********Mr. Reilly said Ivy's approach was twofold -- stock-picking based on a thorough five-year review of individual companies and on disciplined portfolio construction. He cited Siemens of Germany as a favorite. ''Over the past five years, it has slowly transformed itself from quasi-state-owned to a vibrant entrepreneurial company,'' he said. He also likes Nokia of Finland, despite its recent tumble on an earnings warning. **********In constructing a portfolio, Mr. Reilly said, Ivy looks for companies with price-to-earnings ratios below the market's, earnings growth rates and return on equity above the market's, and price-to-book ratios near the market's. **********''American investors should have up to 30 percent of their holdings in foreign equities,'' he said. ''There are tremendous opportunities.'' But they should go in only for the long term -- three to five years -- he added. **********An independent investment adviser, Michael Stolper, had similar views. His San Diego firm, Stolper & Company, works with institutions and wealthy individuals, often by investing directly in domestic stocks and using mutual funds for international holdings. Among the funds he likes are Acorn International, Oakmark International, Tweedy Brown Global Value, Harbor International Growth and the various Templeton funds. **********''We still have about a 20 to 25 percent weighting overseas,'' Mr. Stolper said, a proportion with which he was happy. Asked if he looked for funds that hedged for currency fluctuations, Mr. Stolper said: ''I'd probably be more nervous if they told me they were fully hedged than if they weren't. The cost of hedging can be awesome. **********''The longer I'm alive, the less conviction I have that anyone can predict currencies with accuracy,'' Mr. Stolper said. ''I'm surprised at the strength of the dollar and the weakness of the euro. It's a rotational pattern.'' **********Does that mean that today's depressed euro offers a buying opportunity for American investors? ''There could be a tactical advantage,'' Mr. Stolper said, if new money or tax-sheltered retirement-account money is to be deployed. But he said he would not advise selling holdings with a big taxable capital gain to go into a European fund now. Attempts to time the market are usually ''exercises in vanity over economics,'' Mr. Stolper said. **********Peter Harrison, head of the global portfolios group at Chase Fleming Asset Management in London, which markets funds in 44 countries including the United States, said the long-term results of an investing strategy were clearer when portfolios were left unhedged. ''We don't, as a rule, hedge any of our portfolios,'' he said. ''First and foremost, we are great believers that stocks matter. History and academic evidence show that performance is driven much more by companies than by where they are listed.'' **********Many American investors, enjoying strong domestic markets and the strong dollar, have not felt a need to diversify overseas, Mr. Harrison said. But he thinks Europe will follow the United States in the growth cycle, and he said he was optimistic about the euro for the long term. ''We feel it is being dragged down by sentiment,'' he said, ''and by European companies buying U.S. assets -- $150 billion this year.'' **********But Richard Gluck, senior vice president and head of the fixed-income team at the Ivy Funds, said the euro ''is not likely to be strong any time soon.'' He gave several reasons: ''Europeans are investing heavily in the United States. Japanese are liquidating European positions, putting pressure on the euro. The United States has an extraordinarily strong economy with high productivity levels. The oil-price rise hits Europe twice because oil is priced in dollars, and the E.C.'s central bank has been pursuing an anti-inflation policy.'' **********Germans have been buying United States Treasury bonds, he noted, and given the dollar's strength against the euro, ''they are up 26 percent this year.'' **********Still, ''things do change over time,'' Mr. Gluck said. ''The euro will find its base level,'' he added. ''So be diversified; don't catch the wave after it has moved 20 percent.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/10/business/dividend-meetings-276529.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-01-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 64, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dividend Meetings", "print_headline": "Dividend Meetings", "body_text": " **********A partial list for this week. **********MONDAY **********AAR Corp **********TUESDAY **********Firstar Corp New Wis (Now Firstar) **********Greenbrier Cos Inc **********WEDNESDAY **********General Amern Invs **********Rite Aid Corp **********Walgreen Co **********Wallace Computer Svcs Inc **********THURSDAY **********Ford Mtr Co Del **********Reliastar Finl Corp **********Tanger Factory Outlet Ctrs Inc **********FRIDAY **********Lilly Inds Inc **********Lubys Cafeterias Inc (Now Lubys Inc)"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/21/business/preludes-congratulations-remember-me.html": {"writer_name": "Abby Ellin", "pub_date": "2000-05-21", "snippet": "Dot-com millionaires and other sudden celebrities must cope with sudden rush of calls from people soliciting money, selling something, pitching business deals or otherwise working an angle; drawing (M)", "word_count": 745, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Congratulations!

Along the way, he said, he  traded his ''dumpy'' apartment in Boston for ''a cool one on the 26th floor,'' acquired a 63-inch television with a $12,000 sound system and garbed himself in $20,000 of Armani clothing. His calls came from struggling writers, from agents and editors who previously ignored him, and from a few mothers of daughters who ache to date a writer. (The disadvantages of dating writers, of course, are a different column.) **********Ever since Peter Klamka, 31, of Ann Arbor, Mich., saw his net worth climb to somewhere between $4 million and $30 million, he has heard from many people. ''I've gotten calls from old friends and girlfriends, from people who passed on the deal -- lots of 'I-should-haves,' 'if onlys' and 'I didn't think you could pull it offs,' '' said Mr. Klamka, the founder of PTN Media, a publicly held company that produces and distributes fashion, style and beauty-related content for Web sites. That's not to mention ''college buddies, mostly lawyers, who want me to bring them on as an in-house counsel for a huge salary and lots of cheap options,'' he added. **********What brings them out of the woodwork? ''People can find out anything quickly and easily via the Internet,'' he said. ''They see that I have two-million-plus shares of PTN, and they look at the price of the stock and just assume I can access that amount with my A.T.M. card. **********''Everyone thinks you're a V.C,'' he added, referring to a venture capitalist. ''They have deals, inventions, various business opportunities that range from nightclubs to car washes.'' **********Mr. Klamka has not yet invested in any of that; most of what he has seen have been ''wild dreams with no shot of success -- their idea, my money and Rolodex and they get all the profits if it works,'' he said. But he is not opposed to helping someone if there is a viable plan. **********Mr. Mezrich has done things like paying a friend's rent, and he picks up checks at nightclubs without expecting others to ever do the same. ''It feels weird asking for cash from someone who I know doesn't have it,'' he said, ''when I've got three books on the shelves right now.'' **********DO people like him merely for his financial status? He is philosophical. ''I'm not concerned with people's motivations,'' he said. ''If they like me because I'm a successful writer, well, that's part of who I am.

The man who straddles it, with the authority to determine what direction his country and his movement take, is a chubby-cheeked 39-year-old Shiite Muslim cleric named Hassan Nasrallah. **********In Beirut today, as a national holiday was declared to celebrate the Israeli retreat and as Hezbollah solidified its hold on liberated villages in the south, the normally reticent Sheik Nasrallah made grandiose pronouncements as if he were commander in chief of a victorious army after a long campaign -- as many in the Arab world believe he is. He proclaimed that his fighters had won the only Arab victory in the 50-year conflict with Israel. **********He also received a stream of visitors bearing congratulations -- among them the foreign minister of Iran, Kamal Kharazi -- at his beat-up Beirut headquarters, and he fielded questions about his intentions now that Hezbollah's 18-year resistance to Israeli occupation has paid off. **********But Sheik Nasrallah, who has made an art form out of ambiguity to keep both Israel and his rival Lebanese political factions in suspense, still refused to give anything away. **********He repeated what he had said earlier this week -- that Hezbollah does not consider the withdrawal complete and will not until all Lebanese prisoners are released from Israeli jails and a small plot of land called Shebaa Farms near the Golan Heights is vacated by Israel. **********In Israel, officials have said that a portion of that land was never part of Lebanon and so does not figure into any withdrawal plans. **********Sheik Nasrallah said the retreat by Israeli soldiers and many of their allies in the South Lebanon Army  was ''an important step.'' But he would not say whether Hezbollah would give up its military operations if its further conditions were met. **********''We always said that we weren't going to answer that question until a complete withdrawal takes place,,'' he told journalists tonight. ''I know what should be done, but I won't tell you because it's a tactical ploy.'' **********Nor would Sheik Nasrallah say whether his militia would lend its arms to a fight on behalf of Syria to drive Israel out of the Golan Heights or assist Palestinian extremists who may try to use southern Lebanon as a launching pad for attacks on Israel. **********Hezbollah -- ''Party of God,'' in Arabic -- has heroic stature in Lebanon and beyond, and Sheik Nasrallah, who has concentrated substantial religious and political authority in his own hands, has both options and constraints in deciding which way to take it. **********He has been the general secretary of the organization since 1992, when his predecessor, Abbas Musawi, was assassinated by Israel forces. Under Sheik Nasrallah's stewardship, Hezbollah has tried to recast itself as a national resistance movement, fielding candidates in parliamentary elections and inviting Sunni Muslims and Christians to join its ranks. **********Trained exclusively in Islamic law and modern weaponry, Sheik Nasrallah has made no secret of his antipathy toward Israel and the United States. Israel, he has said, is a ''cancerous'' interloper in the region. His eldest son, Muhammad Hadi, then 18, was killed in a fight with Israeli soldiers in the security zone in 1997. **********But in his intermittent interviews during the past eight years, he has also tacitly accepted the peace negotiations that both Lebanon and its overlord, Syria, have entered into with Israel. If a peace accord is signed, Sheik Nasrallah has said, Hezbollah will resist as a political party by opposing any normalization of relations with Israel. **********A founding member of Hezbollah, he served as a commander in the Bekaa region during the 1980's, when the militia effectively ran the area, enforcing a strictly puritanical Islamic social code. Now Sheik Nasrallah presides over a many-tentacled organization that not only runs a militia of an estimated 5,000 fighters but manages schools, hospitals, a television station, two radio stations, construction crews, an Internet site and a political party with nine seats in the Lebanese Parliament. **********The organization is tightly structured but still has its layers of diverse elements. Many of its veterans fought with radical Palestinian factions in the civil war and later moved under the Iranian umbrella after the Palestinians were ejected from Beirut. Still others came from Amal, the first national movement representing the traditionally marginalized Shiites. Others are clerics with loyalties to different factions of Shiite theologians in Iraq and Iran. **********Born in 1960, the son of a grocer from the Bekaa, Sheik Nasrallah attended theological schools in two of the famous centers of Shiite Muslim learning -- Karbala, in Iraq, and Qum, in Iran -- before returning to Lebanon in 1982. That year, Israel invaded Lebanon in an effort to control guerrilla attacks on its northern towns. Also that year, Iran, flush with the fervor of its 1979 Islamic revolution, dispatched some 1,000 of its elite Revolutionary Guards to the Bekaa to train Lebanese Muslims in warfare and, according to Western intelligence officials, terrorism. **********Hezbollah, the fruit of their training mission, operated in relative secrecy for two years, first proclaiming itself and its holy war against Israel and the United States in 1984.  But the State Department has accused Hezbollah of being involved or at least suspected of involvement in the 1983 bombings of the United States Embassy in Beirut, which killed 63 people, and the Marine barracks in Beirut, which killed 241. The group later expanded its operations to kidnapping Americans and Europeans in Lebanon. **********Sheik Nasrallah has denied that the group participated in the bombings, but was quoted last month in an Arabic magazine as saying he wished that it had, because ''that would have been a great honor.'' **********Israeli analysts see Sheik Nasrallah as the political, rather than military, mastermind of Hezbollah, adept at navigating between the often rival ambitions of the group's main patrons, Iran and Syria, and just as nimble at adjusting to shifts in their policies. **********''He knows how to integrate the pragmatic and the ideological,'' said Shimon Shapira, a military adviser to Benjamin Netanyahu, the former Israeli prime minister, and the author of a book on Hezbollah. **********That attribute was on display in his statements today. Sheik Nasrallah said the time is not yet right for Hezbollah to demand a bigger share of political power in Lebanon or even to try to capitalize on its current  popularity to win a bigger bloc of seats in parliamentary elections in August. ''It's important after a victory to maintain internal unity,'' he said. ''So we would rather keep the same number of seats. **********''The Hezbollah can be modest politically, as well as in every other way,'' he added with a smile."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/11/business/markets-market-place-sec-seeks-increased-scrutiny-new-rules-for-accountants.html": {"writer_name": "Gretchen Morgenson", "pub_date": "2000-05-11", "snippet": "Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Arthur Levitt calls for increased oversight of accounting firms and new rules on conflicts of interest at firms, saying that both are necessary to keep auditors independent and standards of financial rep...", "word_count": 1078, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MARKETS: Market Place; S.E.C.

Seeks Increased Scrutiny And New Rules for Accountants", "body_text": " **********The chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission called yesterday for increased oversight of accounting firms and new rules on conflicts of interest at the firms, saying that both are necessary to keep auditors independent and standards of financial reporting in the United States high. **********In a speech at the New York University law school, the S.E.C. chairman, Arthur Levitt, said accounting professionals were being tempted to lower auditing standards to keep paying customers happy. ''Too many auditors are being judged not just by how well they manage an audit, but by how well they cross-market their firm's nonaudit services,'' he said, referring to consulting services that now make up the bulk of revenue at large accounting firms. **********Auditor independence and reliability are is at the heart of investor confidence in corporate financial statements, Mr. Levitt said. ''With our markets at their present level and with international competition being more a factor than ever before, it's critical that we do not lose the public confidence that has made our markets the greatest in the world,'' he said in an interview. ''The surest way to lose that confidence is to step back from the commitment to full disclosure and accurate numbers.'' **********The industry's reaction to Mr. Levitt's speech was generally supportive. ''I believe that there is a real need for a change in the regulatory environment and a need for global financial reporting standards,'' said James J. Schiro, chief executive of PricewaterhouseCoopers. ''The chairman's initiatives will play a crucial role in accomplishing that.'' **********But Alan Anderson, senior vice president for technical services at the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the industry's trade group, said: ''I'm not sure we heard anything new and different in this speech. These things have been on our plate for years.'' Revealing some sensitivity about the prospect of increased regulatory scrutiny, Mr. Anderson said he would not comment on the concept ''until we see a formal proposal.'' **********The S.E.C. is focusing on three major areas. First, it will require accounting firms to examine their past conduct and detail any violations of independence rules that may have occurred. It also wants to see greater oversight of the accounting profession by the Public Oversight Board, an independent accounting industry review organization set up by Congress more than 20 years ago after the bankruptcy of the Penn Central Railroad. As envisioned, the oversight board would better shape the agenda and the code of conduct for the profession and conduct special reviews of practices when needed. **********For its part, the S.E.C. staff will prepare new rules about which consulting services may be offered by accounting firms to their corporate clients and which should be forbidden given the conflicts they pose, Mr. Levitt said. **********Within two months, the S.E.C. staff will also come up with revised rules on stock ownership by employees of accounting firms. The existing rules, which prohibit auditors and their families from holding stock in companies the accounting firms count as customers, have been viewed as too restrictive. For example, the spouse of an accounting firm's partner in a California office is barred from owning stock in a company that is an audit client of the firm in Maine. Mr. Levitt said the new rules would get rid of irrationality. **********The regulatory scrutiny comes after a series of high-profile corporate accounting frauds that auditors missed at companies including Cendant, Sunbeam and Livent. Public shareholders lost hundreds of millions of dollars in these cases, and confidence in accountants was shaken. **********Last January, partners and employees at PricewaterhouseCoopers were found by the S.E.C. to have routinely violated rules forbidding their ownership of stock in companies they were auditing. The investigation found 8,064 violations at the firm, which then dismissed five partners. Pricewaterhouse said at the time that it did not believe that the integrity of any audit had been compromised by the violations. **********The issue of auditor independence has grown thornier in recent years as accounting firms have remade themselves into full-service operations, in which auditing takes a back seat to more profitable consulting services. According to the S.E.C., auditing now represents 30 percent of accounting firms' revenue, down from 70 percent in 1977, while consulting and other advisory services represent more than half of revenue, up from 12 percent. **********The potential for conflict is that an auditor, eager to get consulting fees from a corporate customer, would not be as aggressive on its audit as he might otherwise be. John H. Biggs, chairman of TIAA-CREF, the pension fund management group, said that his organization makes it a rule to hire separate firms for audits and for consulting services. ''When you're paying the auditor $3 million to do an audit and paying them $17 million to do management consulting, it's way out of balance,'' he said. **********Laurence A. Tisch, co-chairman of the Loews Corporation, said: ''Arthur is trying to do the right thing. There's no question what he's trying to do is divorce auditing from consulting on a formal basis, and I think American business has no problem with it.'' **********A further indication of the change that is roiling the accounting profession is KPMG's announcement last week that it planned to spin off the majority stake in its consulting services unit in an initial public offering aimed at raising $1 billion. If a KPMG auditing client owned stock in the consulting firm, a conflict could arise. **********Mr. Levitt's call for greater power for the Oversight Board comes just a week after the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants sent a letter to the board saying that it would no longer pay to cover the board's investigation of violations of investment rules. The Public Oversight Board, headed by Charles A. Bowsher, former United States Comptroller General, is financed by 1,300 accounting firms. **********When asked about the letter, Mr. Anderson said it was a routine attempt ''to get our arms around a work plan for this project.'' **********''It unfortunately got blown out of proportion,'' he said. ''We have always supported a strong oversight board, and we will continue to support it.'' But, he added, the S.E.C. should not run the oversight board. **********Others saw the letter as an attempt by the accounting group to stifle investigations into its member firms' conduct. After Mr. Levitt's speech yesterday, Mr. Bowsher said: ''We intend to make sure everyone understood the P.O.B. was not going to be intimidated and was not going to be pushed around here.'' **********Mr. Schiro of Pricewaterhouse said: ''Funding for the P.O.B.'s special independence compliance reviews must be continued. Thwarting special reviews is contrary to the profession's interests.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/20/business/databank-august-14-18-no-need-to-trim-the-sails-for-now.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-08-20", "snippet": "Wall Street expects Federal Reserve to leave interest rates unchanged at upcoming meeting; last week's stock index averages noted here (S)", "word_count": 188, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "No Need to Trim the Sails, for Now", "print_headline": "DATABANK: AUGUST 14-18; No Need to Trim the Sails, for Now", "body_text": " **********Wall Street is expecting the gray heads at the Federal Reserve to leave interest rates alone when they meet on Tuesday - leaving analysts looking at a slow summer week. **********Inflation has continued to poke along, showing only glints of price pressures in the fine-print numbers.

In the last several weeks alone two of the nation's largest athletic shoe chains, the Venator Group, owner of the Foot Locker and Lady Foot Locker chains, and Just For Feet Inc. have closed what could amount to hundreds of stores. Altogether, retail space for athletic footwear dropped 15 percent last year and is expected to continue to shrink, analysts said. **********''There is still an abundance of retail space out there for athletic footwear,'' said Jim Severyn, vice president for athletic leisure at Kurt Salmon Associates, a retail consulting firm. **********But in many ways the brand is a victim of its own early successes and optimism that it could repeat them. For much of the 1980's and 1990's Nike was on fire. The company benefited as athletic shoes became a hot fashion statement that could be worn with jeans and suits alike. Then the company expanded as it took market share away from other brands. **********Nike's stunning success lulled itself and vendors into thinking that the growth could continue to soar, even as the total market was cooling. Between 1995 and 1999 athletic shoe sales in the United States grew from $6.8 billion to $7.1 billion, or less than 1 percent, according to Goldman, Sachs. **********''This industry has been more mature for longer than the industry itself recognized, and that's what is causing the problems now,'' Ms. Mager of Goldman, Sachs said. **********Nike has not been alone in suffering from American consumers' new love affair with alternative footwear like rugged boots and lug-soled shoes. Reebok and Adidas have also had rough going. But Nike, which accounts for some 45 percent of the domestic athletic shoe market, and which gets 61 percent of its revenue from athletic shoes, cannot help but be affected by consumers' relative indifference to owning another pair of sneakers. **********The company finally got a jolt when the Asian financial crises combined with slowing domestic sales. Nike's total sales dropped from $9.6 billion in fiscal 1998 to $8.8 billion in fiscal 1999. This year the company has posted solid earnings growth, but that uptick has not protected it from the market's wrath because total sales for fiscal 2000, ending on May 31, are expected to be about $9.1 billion, below 1998's level. **********Susan Silverstein, a footwear and apparel analyst with Bank of America Securities said the stock was pummeled so hard yesterday because at a meeting with analysts management offered, ''no peg or strategy for new growth.'' **********That could be bad news for America's favorite value investor, Warren E.

Mr. Barak was back in business, surfing away from the political and socio-economic headaches that appeared to be about to ground him. **********Now, four months later, peace with Syria seems a dying prospect -- although nothing can ever be pronounced officially over in the volatile Middle East peace efforts -- while Mr. Barak's popularity is at a low, according to polls. **********And Mr. Barak, a former general who was known for his single-mindedness, faces widespread criticism for putting too much energy into Israeli-Syrian peace and not enough into anything else -- not even Palestinian peace, despite his own self-imposed deadlines on that track. **********Against this backdrop, Mr. Barak will fly to Washington for a previously unplanned meeting with President Clinton on Tuesday. The announcement of the meeting was made on Saturday night, and today Mr. Barak told his cabinet -- the routine message before such meetings -- that no breakthroughs were to be expected. **********It was clear, however, that the Israelis seek to pick up momentum -- not just for the peace initiatives but also for Mr. Barak's sagging profile on the national stage. Politically, it was time for Mr. Barak, who will stop in Egypt on the way to the United States, to jet off on an important mission. **********That added impetus to a diplomatic agenda about to speed up anyway: the door to peace with Syria may still be open, but it is closing; the deadline for a framework agreement with the Palestinians is in May; the coming troop withdrawal from Lebanon requires international backing and coordination as soon as possible. **********And the Jewish holiday of Passover, which starts on April 19, is a slow week in the middle of a hectic preparatory period for a busy May. **********''The calendar dictated the need,'' said Gadi Baltiansky, Mr. Barak's spokesman. ''May is a very important month. It is the target date for an agreement with the Palestinians, and also, we need to get organized on Lebanon. We said we would pull out by July, but maybe even by next month. Certainly two months, three months, no more.'' **********The White House said Mr. Clinton and Mr. Barak would focus their talks on the Israeli-Palestinian final status negotiations and on the withdrawal from Lebanon. But senior Israeli officials said that they expected Mr. Clinton to approach the meeting with Mr. Barak -- and then a subsequent one, nine days later, with Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader -- as he did his failed summit meeting in Geneva last month with Hafez el-Assad, the Syrian president. **********A senior administration official said in Washington today that the initial proposal for the White House meeting came from the Israelis and that no three-way meeting was contemplated. The two sides have enough differences remaining, the White House concluded, that it would be easier to make progress without both leaders in the same room at the same time. **********And a senior Israeli official said: ''Clinton wants to do with Barak and Arafat what he did with Assad. He wants to say, 'Take off your mask. Will you, Mr. Barak, agree to A, B, C -- tell me where you stand. Will you, Mr. Arafat, agree to D, E, F?' He wants to force a kind of deadline urgency, to bring it to a bottom line: enough already, is a deal possible or not?'' **********Mr. Clinton's meeting in Geneva with Mr. Assad revealed an impasse that seemed unbreakable, and the Americans left the next move to Syria. There were faint indications this weekend that Syrian officials may still be interested. **********First, Farouk al-Shara, the Syrian foreign minister, said Syria would welcome an Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, even if it were unilateral. Previously, Syria had voiced opposition to an Israeli troop withdrawal that was not part of an Israeli-Syrian agreement. **********Then, Patrick Seale, an English journalist who is Mr. Assad's biographer and confidant, put forth a proposal to settle a crucial difference between the two parties. Speaking on Israel Radio, Mr. Seale said he was acting independently, but some Israeli commentators reacted as if it were a sign of a softening from Mr. Assad himself. Mr. Seale proposed, in effect, that Israel and Syria share the Sea of Galilee area. **********Israeli officials said they have heard nothing directly from Syria or through the Americans. But Mr. Barak said today, ''We are responsible enough, or sensitive or attentive enough not to close the door completely -- certainly not on our own initiative.'' **********Chemi Shalev, a columnist for the newspaper Maariv, said Mr. Barak, ''like every spurned lover,'' would welcome any advance from Syria. ''The last few days have shown Barak just how empty and cruel the world can be without Assad, the essence of his term in office,'' Mr. Shalev wrote. ''Barak would be happy to leave behind him his stumbling coalition and the lame economy and ascend once again on the wings of history.'' **********It was a busy day of fighting in southern Lebanon today as plans for the withdrawal continued apace. The Iran-backed Hezbollah guerrilla fighters wounded two soldiers from the Israeli-backed South Lebanese Army. Attacks from within the Israeli-controlled security zone wounded some Lebanese civilians. The guerrillas fired a mortar shell across the border into Israel, hitting a chicken coop. Israeli warplanes then struck suspected guerrilla targets. **********The violence drew a passionate response from Mr. Barak, who used it to defend the plan for unilateral withdrawal of troops from Lebanon, which some fear will spark cross-border violence. **********The Palestinian track to peace is no less bumpy. Today, Mr. Arafat dismissed the intensive negotiations that have been going on in Washington as ''just chat.'' He has said repeatedly that Israel is proving intransigent and that its negotiators are not empowered to make big decisions. Israel has said the same of Mr. Arafat's negotiators in the past, although Mr. Barak's spokesman today characterized the talks as ''quite positive'' and ''very advanced.'' **********As to Mr. Barak's perceived need to revive his image as a leader, his spokesman said Mr. Barak does not pay attention to the polls. **********''It's not something that should dictate a leader, his behavior or his priorities,'' Mr. Baltiansky said. ''The mood and the atmosphere can go up and down very easily and quickly. Barak is not a magician; he is a statesman. It has been nine months. The government is not falling down. The government has done a lot of things. **********''Indeed, if this Syrian thing happens,'' he continued, ''everyone will say that something historic has been achieved.

Clad in shiny metallic windbreakers that made them look like refugees from ''Lost in Space,'' sales clerks swarmed over the young customers. **********They showed the latest cellular phones by Motorola and Nokia, as well as local brands, Konka and TCL. They raved about new features like wireless Internet access and a built-in Chinese-English dictionary. They hawked plastic covers, in fluorescent red and green, to spice up a plain phone. **********''Everybody in China wants to own a mobile phone,'' said Hacken Hwang, 23, the store's general manager. ''For men, it's like having a cigarette lighter. For women, it's like wearing an accessory.'' **********Jegaxunlian is one of 200 stores that line a boulevard in this southern Chinese city. Local residents call it Telecom Street, and it is a popular gathering place for students, street hustlers, even off-duty soldiers. Everyone, it seems, is looking for a phone. **********Two decades after American corporations began talking about China, making hyperbolic statements about selling cars and Coke to a billion people, the country finally seems to have generated a market that justifies much of the promotion. **********Cellular telephones are a genuine revolution here. Not only are they a way for people to sidestep China's cumbersome terrestrial phone network, they are the status symbol of choice for a generation of Chinese. **********''As a hip Chinese yuppie in Shanghai, you're much more likely to be concerned about carrying around the latest phone than if you are a yuppie in London or New York,'' said Patrick Benzie, chief strategist at Intrinsic Technology, a wireless Internet services company in Shanghai. **********''You're talking about a massive number of phones,'' Mr. Benzie said. **********Intrinsic estimated that China has 65 million cellular users, a number it expected to grow to 105 million next year and 155 million by 2002. By then, China will surpass the United States as the largest wireless market. **********China Mobile, the dominant cellular provider, has 40 million subscribers and is the world's second-largest carrier. The largest carrier, Vodafone AirTouch, recently paid $2.5 billion for a small stake in the company. **********China Mobile and its main rival, China United Telecommunications, or China Unicom, do not sell phones at a subsidized price along with service, as is done in the United States. So the onus is on the phone makers to peddle their products. This has led to a fiercely competitive market, in which the foreigners woo affluent buyers with cutting-edge features while the local companies scrap for the mass market. **********''The foreign brands are doing massive amounts of marketing,'' Mr. Benzie said. ''That's the challenge for local companies.'' **********From billboards to television commercials to displays in shopping malls, cellular phones loom large. China, far from lagging behind more developed countries, is helping set the pace in the design and marketing of cellular phones. **********Phillip Leacock, director of mobile-phone marketing for Motorola Greater China in Beijing, said, ''The U.S. has the latest of everything in the wired-telephone business. But when it comes to wireless, China has a much greater appreciation of technology than the U.S.'' **********Motorola has sold about 25 million mobile phones here since 1992, and is neck and neck with Nokia in market share (each has about 30 percent). **********Ericsson, Sony and the other foreign manufacturers account for 35 percent, while the Chinese companies battle for the remaining 5 percent. **********China is important to Motorola, not least because its mobile-phone business has withered elsewhere. The company, based in Schaumburg, Ill., derived $3 billion, or 10 percent, of its 1999 revenues from sales of phones and other products here. But with the  emergence of more than a dozen local producers, Motorola's China beachhead is under threat. **********Eager to defend its franchise, Motorola has turned China into a laboratory for marketing ideas. It recently opened three high-concept stores -- in Guangzhou, Shanghai and the western city of Chengdu -- to promote its brand. **********The stores, called Motorola Towns, feature Buck Rogers-style displays about the company's technical achievements, like the radio transmitter that Neil Armstrong used to talk to Mission Control when he became the first man on the moon. Motorola's latest phones are displayed in glass cases like jewels. They look less like communications devices than like lifestyle accouterments. **********In the store is a seating area, where customers can chat or take a break from shopping. The idea is to create a sort of oasis in China's frenetic shopping malls. Sales clerks, again in metallic windbreakers, are on hand to demonstrate the features of Motorola phones. The stores offer free repair service, regardless of where customers bought their phones. **********If this sounds a bit like Nike Town, the jazzy stores where Nike sells athletic shoes and a dash of attitude, that is no coincidence. Mr. Leacock said Motorola was influenced by Nike, which pioneered stores that are entertainment attractions as much as retail outlets. **********The only two other players who have done this are Nike and Sony, he said, adding ''there was a huge gap in the wireless space.'' **********Sharon Zhong, the manager of Motorola Town in Guangzhou, acknowledged that many of the people who browse through her store will buy their phones on Telecom Street, where the prices are 10 percent lower. But Ms. Zhong said she believed that many of them will buy a Motorola phone. **********''Improving the image of Motorola is more important than how many phones we sell,'' she said. ''The people over there might as well be selling vegetables at the market. They can't explain all the features of our phones.'' **********Motorola Town draws about 4,000 customers a day. On a recent afternoon, it buzzed with young people and families, who behaved as if they were in a carnival fun house. People lined up to make calls on a giant Motorola phone. Others hopped into a Mercedes sports car, equipped with a Motorola car phone, that had been sawed in half. **********''The decor is very modern and striking,'' said Tang Ren-zhong, 30, an interior decorator from the nearby town of Foshan, who brought his wife and their two children on an outing to buy a mobile phone. **********Pang Ke, a businessman from Jiangxi Province, said his friends told him to visit the store when he came to Guangzhou. He whiled away the afternoon there, reading the paper and calling friends. **********But Mr. Pang also had a practical reason for coming: he was looking for a new plastic cover to protect his battered Motorola phone. Mr. Pang has owned the phone since 1998. He  estimated that he made 20 to 25 calls a day on it, and he acknowledged that it has become almost indispensable. **********''Before I owned one, I was fine without it,'' he said. ''But if you told me that I couldn't have one anymore, I wouldn't know what to do.'' **********With customers like these, Motorola will always be able to sell phones in China. But the company wants to secure its position at the high end of the market. So it has been designing products especially for China. One new model, the Accompli, featured a screen like that of a hand-held computer, where the caller taps out the desired number with a tiny wand. **********The Accompli also has an English-Chinese dictionary, useful for business executives. And at nearly $600, the phone is not likely to be bought by many other people. But in prosperous Guangzhou, there is no shortage of people who can afford such a phone and would prize it as a totem of success. **********The Accompli is also able to transmit wireless data, a business that analysts say has vast potential in China. **********''The challenge for us is to renew our products so that we're not just selling a basic phone,'' Mr. Leacock said. **********Basic phones will increasingly be the province of the Chinese companies, many of which are based near Guangzhou, in the Pearl River delta. **********Companies like Konka and ZTE are churning out phones, using components from Motorola and other foreign companies, that cost far less than the brand-name models. **********Konka, the largest maker of color television sets in China, began making cellular phones last year. The company said it expected sales of $1 million this year and $5 million in five years. It uses Chow Yun Fat, the Hong Kong movie star, to pitch its products. **********ZTE, once partly owned by the People's Liberation Army, noted proudly that 40 percent of its employees work in research and development. But China's cellular market is driven more by style than technology, a fact Motorola has recognized in building its Motorola Towns. **********Wei Zaisheng, a senior vice president of ZTE, defended the emphasis on technology, saying that as the market matured, consumers would demand advanced features over style. In the meantime, he is not ready to cede the world's most promising cellular market to Motorola or Nokia. **********''As a local company, we can offer better service,'' he said. ''And as Chinese people, we understand the needs of the Chinese better.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/19/business/ex-executive-of-bankers-trust-pleads-guilty-to-falsifying-books.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "2000-09-19", "snippet": "Bruce Kingdon, former managing director of Bankers Trust Corp, pleads guilty to making false entries in bank's books to cover up millions of dollars in shortfalls (M)", "word_count": 268, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ex-Executive of Bankers Trust Pleads Guilty to Falsifying Books", "print_headline": "Ex-Executive of Bankers Trust Pleads Guilty to Falsifying Books", "body_text": " **********Bruce Kingdon, the former managing director of the Bankers Trust Corporation, pleaded guilty yesterday to making false entries in the bank's books to cover up millions of dollars in shortfalls. **********Mr. Kingdon faces up to six months in prison when he is sentenced in December but could receive probation.

''I am Javed Iqbal, killer of 100 boys,'' he told the receptionist in the lobby of the newspaper office. ''Please tell someone in the reporting section that I have come to surrender.'' **********The receptionist recalls being unsure what to do. Was this pathetic-looking man really Pakistan's most notorious killer? Or merely some bothersome fool? **********The hour was late, just after 9 p.m. Deadlines were pressing. Ten minutes passed before a reporter was finally summoned, and he was staggered at the scoop. He invited Mr. Iqbal, scourge of this entire nation, upstairs for questioning. **********And that is how it came to an end Thursday, the frantic monthlong hunt for a vengeance-seeking confessed killer, a man who enticed young teens -- most of them beggars and runaways -- to his tiny apartment in historic Lahore. He fed them and entertained them and asked their life stories and took their snapshots. Then he suffocated them, later dissolving their bodies in large vats of acid. He poured the residue in an alleyway sewer. **********Mr. Iqbal, 38, a wealthy, tormented man, kept an annotated list of his deeds, with his victims' names and ages and the dates of their deaths. He kept piles of clothing and shoes taken from his victims. When, by his count, he had killed 100, he stopped. **********''I could have killed 500, this was not a problem, money was not a problem,'' he told reporters and editors in a small office as they recorded his words. ''But the pledge I had taken was of 100 children, and I never wanted to violate this.'' **********The ''pledge,'' he said, was an act of revenge against the police. He repeated an account he had written in an earlier confession, of how two young servants had beaten him up badly last year, of how the police had ignored his complaints and instead accused him of sodomy, something he had been charged with before. **********He decided that the killing of children would be his means of retribution. ''In this way, I would take revenge from the world I hated,'' he said of his six-month homicidal binge. ''My mother cried for me. I wanted 100 mothers to cry for their children.'' **********He succeeded. **********Early this month, as news of the crimes became public, parents lined up by the thousands to rummage through huge piles of rumpled clothes and old shoes that had been found in Mr. Iqbal's apartment. Some found items that had belonged to their missing sons. Others merely saw their children's photos spread across wobbly tables at the police station. Or they read the morbid details in Mr. Iqbal's diaries. Parental grief became a daily spectacle as more and more people complained, ''Why can't the police find the killer?'' **********Criticism of the police has been immense, with riots in Lahore. **********In late November, Mr. Iqbal actually turned himself in to a policeman, who ignored his confession as a fantasy. The murderer then sent his incriminating diary and photos to the newspaper The Jang, whose reporters, on Dec. 2, were the first to search his apartment and find evidence of the crimes. By then Mr. Iqbal was a fugitive, though notes he left behind indicated that he intended to drown himself. **********He surrendered on Thursday at the three-story offices shared by the The Jang, an Urdu-language publication, and its sister paper, The News, which is written in English. **********At Mr. Iqbal's request, the army was called to take him into custody rather than the police. At the time the police were announcing that they had arrested two men suspected of being accomplices of Mr. Iqbal. The two, Muhammad Shahzad and Muhammad Nadeem, were caught trying to cash a traveler's check in the name of Javed Iqbal. They admitted that they were helping the killer hide out in the culvert and the cave, the police said. **********Mr. Iqbal, who lived off the money from the sale of a family business, contends that he was helped him in the murders by various confederates, including one who has already died in police custody. On Thursday the killer said that many of the victims were made to inhale a mixture of cyanide and acid as they slept. **********''I myself wore a mask, and after about five breaths, the sleeping victim would be dead,'' he said. ''Then my friends would place the body in a container and later drain it away.'' **********According to The Jang and The News, Mr. Iqbal was unrepentant as he told his story. He was calm as he was led away. ''I am a relieved man today,'' he said, even as he acknowledged that his fate was likely to be the gallows. **********He reflected on his actions as heroic, something in the long-term public interest.

If his new sport utility vehicle -- the one he thought the Ford Motor Company needed right away to stay competitive -- was to beat out a luxury sports car being promoted by more senior rival executives, he and his small team would have to come up with an inexpensive design. **********So they improvised. Instead of a whole new design, which would be far too costly, they would simply bolt a roomy passenger cabin, stocked with leather seats and other family-friendly amenities, to the underbody of the existing Ranger pickup truck. The plan's crowning beauty was that the new vehicle could be built on the Ranger assembly line, using many of the same robots and auto parts. **********''It's a lot riskier to do a complete new vehicle, particularly back then,''  Mr. Ross recalled. ''In hindsight, we probably could have afforded it, but hindsight is always 20-20.'' **********Ford called it the Explorer, and it succeeded beyond anyone's wildest dreams. Months after it went on sale, in April 1990, it was America's No. 1 sport utility vehicle; today, 3.2 million are on the road. And it was a gold mine: while Ford made less than $1,000 on the average sedan, the profit on an Explorer was nearly $8,000. **********The Explorer was a marketing dream -- the perfect vehicle for a baby-boom generation that wanted it all. You could use it as your family car, and it had the rugged, adventurous image of a truck. The problem was, it also had the Achilles' heel of a big, tall truck: it rolled over more easily than a car would. **********The roots of that problem lie in Ford's original design decision to build the new sport utility on the bones of a pickup truck instead of all in one piece, like a car. **********Most other sport utility vehicles are also built on pickup truck underbodies. Indeed, many have rollover death rates considerably higher than the Explorer's. But the Explorer has become the most visible example of the problem because of recent deaths in sport utility vehicles after treads peeled off their Firestone tires. **********A review of recently obtained Ford documents, as well as interviews with executives, engineers and marketers, shows how Ford designed itself into a box, then struggled to design itself back out. The biography of the Explorer reveals how executives at Ford, under great pressure to be in on the coming sport utility boom, decided to build their entry in a hurry and on a shoestring, but with only moderate attention to stability. **********In succeeding years, amid rising concern about rollovers, Ford engineers strove to adapt that tippy, bouncy pickup design for a family vehicle that spent far more time racing down the highway than bumping along dirt roads. In the end, they had only limited success. **********In most of the deaths linked to the Firestone tires, the vehicles were Explorers, and in almost every case they flipped over. Today, federal safety officials said the number of complaints of deaths linked to the tires had risen to 148. And while much attention has been focused on the tires, the accidents have also raised questions about the Explorer itself; in fact, tire problems have caused a tenth of the more than 1,200 Explorer rollover deaths since 1991. **********An analysis of federal crash statistics by The New York Times shows the price that drivers of Explorers pay for a car with the lineage, and image, of a truck. The analysis shows that since 1991, occupants of Explorers have been 2.3 times as likely to die in rollovers -- tire-related or not -- as people in traditional cars. What is more, they are nearly twice as likely to die in rollovers as are occupants of Jeep Cherokees and Grand Cherokees, the only popular sport utilities long built like cars. **********And the Explorer's fatal rollover rate has been rising considerably, according to the analysis. While the rates for cars and the Jeep sport utilities have stayed fairly steady (roughly 40 or 50 fatal rollovers per million vehicles), the rate for the Explorer rose from 53 per million in 1994 to 121 last year. Rates for other midsize pickup-based sport utilities have also risen, though not as much. Experts attribute the trend to a mix of factors, particularly growing numbers of younger drivers as middle-age parents have switched to even bigger sport utilities. Tire problems did not push up the Explorer rate significantly until last year, when they accounted for 18 of the 121 deaths per million vehicles. **********The Explorer may be the sport utility leader, but it is hardly alone, and its story illuminates the kind of trade-offs other automakers made, as they tried to balance cost, safety and market appeal. Most of the 21 million sport utilities on the road -- including the Ford Expedition and Excursion; the Chevrolet Blazer, Tahoe and Suburban; the Dodge Durango; and the Toyota 4Runner -- were built on truck bases. **********In the Firestone cases, Ford officials say a flaw in the tires, not the Explorer's design, was to blame. In designing the Explorer, they say, they consistently erred on the side of safety. Not only has the Explorer passed all the company's stability tests, they add, but it has the lowest rate of fatal rollovers of any similar-size pickup-based sport utility. **********''Our analyses continue to find that the Explorer is a very safe vehicle and has performed very well in the hands of its customers since its introduction 10 years ago,'' said Ernest Grush, Ford's manager of safety-data analysis. **********But many auto-safety experts have argued that there was a cocktail of blame behind the accidents -- that after the tires failed, the Explorer's pickup-truck base and high center of gravity made it harder to control, while drivers often made the fatal mistake of swerving at high speed. **********Mr. Ross said the company had considered stability issues in early designs. But another Ford manager on the original project said rollovers had not become a priority until a controversy erupted in the late 1980's over the rollover record of the Bronco II, which was also based on a Ranger underbody. **********''At the time we locked up the design of the Explorer, we had no knowledge of the rollover problems of the Bronco,'' said the manager, who insisted on anonymity to avoid being identified by company executives or lawyers suing the company. ''It all hit later.'' **********And by then it was too late, for Ford and the other automakers as well. **********''There was a flurry of 'Let's have a sport utility,' and look around for the nearest platform,'' said Brian O'Neill, president of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which is financed by insurers seeking to reduce the cost of crash claims. ''I don't think a lot of thought went into a lot of these designs. There was a bandwagon, a gravy train, that they couldn't afford not to jump on.'' **********The Creation **********Facing Trouble In Detroit **********The mid-1980's were tough years for Detroit. Two oil shocks had nearly bankrupted Ford and Chrysler and humbled even General Motors. When the American economy began recovering in 1983, the soaring dollar allowed Americans to buy Japanese cars much more cheaply. **********But as gas prices fell, the American auto industry began to sense salvation in a group of obscure, and relatively fuel-inefficient, vehicles known as light trucks: sport utility vehicles, pickups and minivans. Chrysler introduced the first modern minivan in November 1983, and the same autumn brought the Jeep Cherokee, the first four-door sport utility with the comforts of a car. Buyers snapped them up. **********Observing popular culture, Ford recognized why Cherokees were selling so well. The rugged Western look was in style for clothing, partly because of Ronald Reagan's popularity. The researchers paid particular attention to Hollywood, where the top box-office draws were films like ''Top Gun,'' ''Rocky IV'' and ''Rambo First Blood, Part II.'' Americans, the researchers concluded, wanted automobiles that communicated ruggedness, individuality and an outdoor spirit. **********The clear answer, Ford's light-truck team decided, was what, by the standards of the day, would be an unusually large sport utility vehicle. **********''The Ford Explorer has the message, 'I'm big, I'm tall, I'm prepared to explore the world,' '' said Dr. Clotaire Rapaille, chairman of Archetype Discoveries, a psychological research company that works for Ford and other automakers. Its name constantly brings that message home. ''The letter ''x'' means outside, exterior, exploration,'' Dr. Rapaille pointed out. **********Ford's research found that potential Explorer buyers cared a lot about their image and that the image they hoped to be envied for often had little to do with the way they actually used their Explorers. While they were unlikely to drive off-road even on vacation, for instance, they wanted four-wheel drive because it suggested they took adventurous trips. **********From a marketing standpoint, that week or so of vacation became ''the most important week of the year,'' said Mr. Ross, now the vehicle development director for Ford's Land Rover subsidiary in Britain. **********So as it rolled out the Explorer in 1990, Ford began a marketing campaign to build the Explorer's image as a versatile vehicle that could take its owners anywhere their fantasies led them. Television ads consistently showed the Explorer going on adventurous trips, traveling over rock fields and mountain tracks, instead of running errands, a much more common use. Soon Ford added references to luxury. One ad showed a couple splitting their time between a Manhattan penthouse and a country cottage. In 1995 and again this year the Explorer became the nation's best-selling family vehicle. **********Of course, the adventure ads overlooked the Explorer's shortcomings in everyday driving. The rollover problem was the most significant. But there were others. **********Off-road, for instance, four-wheel drive helps motorists free themselves from deep snow and mud, but it provides little, if any, advantage on roads that are merely wet or covered with light snow. And off-road vehicles tend to be harder to stop. The four-wheel-drive Explorer needs 164 feet to stop from 60 miles an hour, 20 to 30 feet more than a typical family car. **********The driving habits of many Explorer owners did not help. An extensive Ford survey in 1993 found that sport utility buyers said they drove faster than other motorists drove, followed other vehicles more closely than other drivers did and were especially likely to risk driving in bad weather. **********Off-road driving also requires a high floor, so that the vehicle does not scrape its gas tank and other important components on rocks, and so that the wheels have plenty of room to bounce up and down. But a high floor limits cargo space and makes it harder for people to climb in and out, particularly the elderly. **********The Explorer, in short, had a case of ambiguous identity. It said so right there in the ''special notice'' at the front of the owner's manual: ''Your vehicle is not a passenger car.'' **********The Problem **********Unpleasant Surprise In Rollovers **********In early 1989, with the Explorer just a year from mass production, Ford executives found themselves with a puzzle. **********Consumer Reports, enormously influential in the auto industry, had just criticized the Explorer's two-door ancestor, the Bronco II, for a tendency to roll over during certain high-speed turns. Having already designed most of the Explorer and ordered its parts, company documents show, Ford grasped anxiously for a solution. **********Ford executives, by their own account, were surprised by the extent of the Bronco's problems. Even so, rollover problems had plagued sport utilities since primitive truck-based ones were built for the military during World War II. Indeed, costly rollover lawsuits involving truck-based Jeeps had pushed American Motors to design the Cherokee from scratch as a sport utility vehicle in the early 1980's. **********But once a sport utility is built on a pickup-truck base, particularly a base designed for another vehicle, it is extremely difficult to make it as stable as a well-designed car-based model, most auto engineers say. **********Car-based vehicles have two main advantages, they say. Their seats -- and hence their centers of gravity -- are considerably lower. And since they are built as a single unit, they are more rigid than vehicles whose passenger compartments and underbodies are manufactured separately. **********No matter how firmly bolted together, tall vehicles based on pickup trucks are more prone to sway during sharp turns, said Roy Lunn, a legendary designer of Ford sports cars who later designed the Cherokee. This is especially true of the Explorer and other vehicles with ''leaf spring'' suspensions -- a cheap, simple design dating back to buggy days. **********To make a pickup-based sport utility as rigid as a car-based model, Mr. Lunn added, ''you would have yourself such a heavy chassis that it wouldn't be practical, so you just live with it.'' **********As the Ford engineers pondered their problem in 1989, they would have to live with that first design decision made three years before. To undo it would have set the Explorer back years more, and besides, this was the Explorer they wanted. So again, they improvised. **********They came up with three options, company documents show. They could choose shorter suspension springs to lower the front end by half an inch and the back by an inch. They could recommend a fairly low tire pressure, which would give the Explorer a more stable ride (except when a tire failed) -- as well as the softer ride favored by people accustomed to cars. And they could redesign the entire vehicle to mount the wheels two inches farther apart. **********They chose the first two. And when prototypes passed Ford's stability test, they decided against the widening, which would have been extremely time-consuming and expensive. ''Utilize as many of the chassis revisions as possible without delaying Job 1,'' said a Ford memorandum, using industry jargon for beginning mass production of a new model. **********The decision making shows how they weighed costs and benefits -- and, ultimately, were hemmed in by the original design as they tried to make that tippy truck into a safer family vehicle. **********On the one hand, they did improve stability. On the other, the more radical option would have made it even safer. According to the government's new rollover ratings, which rank vehicles from one to five stars, the changes Ford made each added a quarter star. The widening would have added three-eighths more. **********In the end, though, what they did not do was make the Explorer as stable as a traditional car or sport utility built on a car base, according to crash statistics and the rollover ratings, which compare the height of a vehicle's center of gravity with its width -- the lower and wider the better. The Cherokee scores near the top of the two-star group in the five-star ratings, while the Explorer is at the low end. (A Ford Taurus sedan, by comparison, rates four or five stars, depending on the model year.) **********Mr. Ross, the Explorer planner, said a pickup-based sport utility could be as stable as a car-based model. In the case of the Explorer, he said, Ford's primary stability goal had been to make it better than the other sport utilities on the market at the time. **********Ford took a similar tack several years later, with the 1995 Explorer. The front suspension was redesigned to be somewhat less prone to rollovers, but the new suspension was also lighter, providing less weight down low in the vehicle. Ford rejected a costly move to lower the engine, so the Explorer's center of gravity actually rose slightly. **********The Trade-Offs **********Along With Benefits, Design Liabilities **********Automobile design is a matter of trade-offs. And often, dealing with one problem only adds to another. **********For instance, using the Ranger's underbody for the Explorer gave Ford the image it wanted, with the budget it needed. But while the Explorer looked roomy, its design actually limited the weight it could safely carry. **********By extending the passenger compartment and installing a second row of seats, Ford made the Explorer more than 600 pounds heavier than the Ranger but did not upgrade the suspension and tires to carry the bigger load. That meant a typically equipped Explorer could carry 1,025 pounds, even less than the 1,100 pounds for a Taurus. Many Explorers are built to carry as little as 900 pounds --a 150-pound person in each of five seats and 150 pounds of cargo. **********Sport utility vehicles are more prone to roll over when heavily loaded because the seats and cargo area are above the vehicles' center of gravity. By contrast, the stability of cars and minivans is less affected when they are full because the passengers and cargo are situated at roughly the cars' and minivans' center of gravity. **********Whether overloading played a role in the Firestone tire failures is not clear. Some of the Explorers that crashed were stuffed with people and luggage; some were not. In general, though, overloading ''can really affect your stability and handling,'' said Donald F. Tandy, an engineer who oversaw much of the early work on the Explorer. **********Another trade-off involved the tires. Ford chose the same size tires it had long chosen for the Ranger. Those tires had the lowest possible rating for withstanding high temperatures. And when the company lowered the recommended tire pressure in 1989 to increase stability and soften the ride, it also further reduced the tires' ability to carry weight without overheating. **********Tire pressure became an issue in the Firestone controversy, with Firestone arguing that the lower recommended pressure -- 26 pounds per square inch, compared with 35 for the Ranger -- had contributed to the tires' failure, especially where Explorers were being driven at high speeds in high  temperatures. **********For its part, Ford pointed out that Goodyear tires inflated to the same pressure almost never failed on Explorers, and that Firestone had endorsed the recommendation for nearly 10 years, until it recalled 6.5 million tires last summer. Even so, Ford recently raised the recommended pressure to 30 pounds. **********Sometimes, the trade-offs are not intended, and not understood until much later. **********Ford believed the Explorer's size and design made it safe, Mr. Ross said, and Explorer occupants do have an unusually low death rate in multivehicle crashes. But he acknowledged that planners had scarcely considered whether the Explorer, while safer for its own occupants in a crash with a lower-riding car, was more deadly to other motorists. **********Pickup-based designs are much deadlier to other motorists than are car-based models because these vehicles are heavier and taller and rely on two stiff, heavy steel beams that run the length of the underbody and curve up like runners of a sleigh. Instead of crumpling and absorbing shock, these beams tend to slide up and over cars' bumpers and door sills, punching into the other vehicle's passenger compartment. **********Quantifying that danger is difficult. **********Ford says it has no specific statistics for the Explorer. Its senior traffic-safety researcher, Priya Prasad, said the designs of all light trucks were responsible for an extra 1,000 deaths a year in other vehicles. **********One statistician, Hans Joksch of the University of Michigan, has studied the deadliness of the Explorer's design. Explorers cause 115 to 140 deaths a year in vehicles they strike, while big cars of the same weight cause 30 to 40. So the Explorer's design appears to cost about 100 extra lives a year -- almost as many deaths each year as in tire-related crashes of Explorers over the entire decade. **********The New Explorer **********Making Safety A Higher Priority **********Ford is trying to position itself as the industry's safety leader, so when it invited reporters last month to see the completely redesigned 2002 Explorer, engineers waxed particularly enthusiastic about new safety features. **********The tires are larger, with a higher recommended pressure. The vehicle is two and a half inches wider -- the option discarded in 1989 as too expensive and time-consuming. The stiff steel rails of a pickup-truck underbody remain, but Ford lowered them considerably when it exchanged the Explorer's primitive suspension for a sophisticated car-like one, a change that also improved the braking to car quality. And the new underbody can no longer be built on the same assembly line as a Ranger. **********Taken together, these changes should mean that the Explorer would be less likely to roll over and less deadly to other motorists as well. But the decisions to incorporate them were actually made several years ago, before the tire cases threw a spotlight on the Explorer's stability. **********Impressed by the success of the Durango, with its third row of seats, Ford decided to add a third row to the Explorer as well. The width, tire sizes, suspension strength and maximum payload were increased mainly to accommodate the extra passengers and make the Explorer more competitive with other models, though stability was also considered, Ford executives said. **********The rails were also redesigned to curve down just behind the grille. Mr. Prasad said this change seemed obvious only with hindsight. **********More than half all midsize and large S.U.V.'s have been redesigned the last two years to be less deadly to other motorists. **********Even so, Mr. Tandy cautioned that while engineers could do much to make certain models more stable, sport utilities would always be somewhat more rollover-prone than cars because of their greater height. **********''Light trucks in general will have a higher rollover rate,'' he said, ''because of all the things that make an S.U.V. an S.U.V.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/15/world/peacekeepers-are-overwhelmed-in-kosovo-pentagon-envoy-says.html": {"writer_name": "Jane Perlez", "pub_date": "2000-03-15", "snippet": "Senior Pentagon official, in assessment of deteriorating situation in Kosovo, says that NATO-led peacekeeping operation has reached 'decisive moment' (M)", "word_count": 371, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Peacekeepers Are Overwhelmed In Kosovo, Pentagon Envoy Says", "print_headline": "Peacekeepers Are Overwhelmed In Kosovo, Pentagon Envoy Says", "body_text": " **********In a sobering assessment of the deteriorating situation in Kosovo, a senior Pentagon official said today that the NATO-led peacekeeping operation, which includes American troops, had reached a ''decisive moment.'' **********The official, who just returned from a visit to the American sector in Kosovo, did not say that more American troops would be sent to Kosovo.

''It never occurs to them that mounting a siege on a hospital is actually wrong. They have not lived in a world where detaining someone with force is actually unacceptable. It's as though they came from a different planet and that planet is ruled by the Burmese military regime and their values.'' **********In the two weeks leading up to the raid, the small army of no more than 200 fighters, under its young leaders Johnny and Luther Htoo, had been fighting for their lives. **********With the Burmese military closing in, 1,000 new refugees had fled across the border, and the Thais, to keep the fighters from crossing too, had begun to add their own artillery fire to that of the Burmese. **********The hostage-takers might have thought their raid would be easy.

''I transferred more than $1 million in less than a year to certain banks in Switzerland.'' **********But Mr. Mery said the money had gone only to further Mr. Chirac's political ambitions and that of his allies in the party, the Rally for the Republic, and had not been for Mr. Chirac's personal use. ''I tell you we were working for Chirac's benefit,'' Mr. Mery says on the tape. ''Not for Chirac's pocket personally, let me make that clear right away.'' **********The French Socialists called on the judicial system today to get to the bottom of the allegations, but their remarks were low-key. On the tape, Mr. Mery says that kickbacks the party collected were shared with the Socialist and Communist parties, though Mr. Chirac's party kept by far the biggest cut. **********The tape surfaced Thursday when the newspaper ran the first two pages of transcript. It reported that the tape had been recorded in 1996, when Mr. Mery was under investigation for illicit fund-raising. **********Mr. Mery, a developer and a member of the party's steering committee, says on the tape he is recording his confessions because unspecified promises made to him have been ignored. He says friends have told him to make the tape and spread the word that it exists. He says he hopes that it will guarantee his safety. **********Mr. Chirac, who has been dogged for years by hints of corruption during his terms as mayor and as leader of his conservative Gaullist party, took the highly unusual step of going on television on Thursday night to dismiss Mr. Mery's accusations as a ''fantastic story.'' He said the tape amounted to no more than producing ''a man who had been dead more than a year, laying out implausible events that supposedly happened more than 14 years ago.'' **********Today, without discussing the tapes, he made his scheduled appearance in the southwest of France and campaigned in favor of a referendum on Sunday to reduce the term of the French president to five years from seven. **********As long as Mr. Chirac is president,  he cannot be prosecuted for anything other than high treason."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/23/business/us-air-united-review-is-extended.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-12-23", "snippet": "US Airways Group and United Airlines unit of UAL Corp agree to extend period of regulatory review of their proposed merger until April 2 (M)", "word_count": 227, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "US Air-United Review Is Extended", "print_headline": "US Air-United Review Is Extended", "body_text": " **********In an apparent effort to keep their proposed merger alive, the US Airways Group and the United Airlines unit of the UAL Corporation said they had agreed to extend the period for regulatory review of the deal until April 2.

He said afterward, ''I would say we are opening a new page in relations.'' **********The immediate goal was to discuss the resumption of diplomatic relations between Bosnia and Yugoslavia, although according to Halid Genjac, the Muslim member of the presidency, talks did not go very far, Reuters reported from Sarajevo. **********Asked if he would apologize for Serbian actions during the war, Mr. Kostunica reiterated his stance that everyone's actions should be examined and that ''one-sided statements'' would not solve anything. **********''I am one of those politicians who will not use empty words, empty promises and empty apologies to in some way overcome all the complications of our relations,'' Reuters quoted him as saying. ''With all that has happened, all the crimes that were carried out and the victims there were on all sides, all this can be cured only by the truth.'' **********''We need a return of confidence, an examination of all that happened a few years ago and maybe a few decades ago,'' Mr. Kostunica added, alluding apparently to the World War II feuds and killings that helped stoke the disputes and wars of the 1980's and 90's. **********In a significant change from previous comments, Mr. Kostunica indicated that he would cooperate with the war crimes tribunal at The Hague, which has indicted high-level Serbian officials and generals for their actions in Bosnia and, for his actions in Kosovo, Mr. Milosevic. **********''When it comes to The Hague tribunal, we know it is a part of the Dayton accord and there are elements of it which can and must be implemented and we will take certain steps in that direction,'' Mr. Kostunica said, referring to the peace accords that ended the Bosnian war and divided the country into the Muslim-Croat Federation and the Serb Republic. **********Mr. Milosevic visited Bosnia only once during the war, in 1993, when he urged the Bosnian Serbs to accept an international peace settlement which they rejected. **********Mr. Kostunica, a lawyer who espouses Serbian patriotism but has criticized ethnic cleansing and the paramilitaries involved in it, was apparently determined to attend the reburial of Mr. Ducic, despite the evident concern of foreign diplomats who effectively administer Bosnia. **********Jacques Klein, a retired American general who heads the United Nations mission to Bosnia, flew personally to take Mr. Kostunica to Sarajevo. He called the trip a brave one on Mr. Kostunica's part, considering the Yugoslav president is still grappling with the supporters of Mr. Milosevic. **********''Kostunica deserves great credit. His advisers probably would have said, 'Don't do this. It's going to cause you problems in Belgrade,' '' Mr. Klein said. **********Mr. Kostunica was applauded by hundreds of bystanders as he arrived at the newly-built Church of the Annunciation, where Mr. Ducic was to be buried. **********''Long life, Mr. President,'' said one onlooker. Following dozens of Serb Orthodox priests in colored robes and glittering miters, Mr. Kostunica accompanied Bosnian Serb politicians around the church and inside for an hours-long service. Beside him stood his host, Mirko Sarovic, vice president of the Serb Republic and a leader of the nationalist Serbian Democratic Party. **********''It's a private visit, but it is turning into a public occasion,'' said Vladeta Jankovic, a leading adviser to Mr. Kostunica. ''People tend to see this as a provocation, which it isn't.'' **********''This is certainly not meant to be a demonstration of Serb nationalism and that is why he is going to Sarajevo.'' Mr. Kostunica's visit to Trebinje had been planned long before he had even thought of running for president, Mr. Jankovic said. **********But many Serbs attending saw it as an important political moment. ''All these people are from Serbia and for us the border does not exist. Of course, I want this to become part of Yugoslavia, and not Bosnia,'' said Nikola Miljanovic, a businessman. **********This open desire to change Bosnia's borders alarms the Muslim and Croat inhabitants of Bosnia, many of whom suffered at the hands of Serbian forces during the war. In Trebinje, as in many other places, the Muslims were expelled and their mosques destroyed. **********Mr. Kostunica did not speak at Trebinje and bore an expression of detachment as he stood listening to the speeches and sermons. The occasion was replete with the kind of religious and patriotic symbols that nationalist Bosnian Serb leaders made their hallmark during the 1992-1995 war. **********A popular Serbian poet, Matija Beckovic, spoke of the miracle that had brought the body of Mr. Ducic back to Trebinje at the very moment that Serbia found freedom and democracy under Mr. Kostunica, who defeated Mr. Milosevic in elections on Sept. 24. His speech won applause at almost every sentence. **********The Church of the Annunciation was paid for by a Serb living in Chicago, and is designed as a smaller version of the Serbian Orthodox monastery at Gracanica in Kosovo."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/28/business/worldbusiness/IHT-thinking-ahead-commentary-blair-can-claim-victory.html": {"writer_name": "Reginald Dale", "pub_date": "2000-03-28", "snippet": "For Prime Minister Tony Blair, the European Union summit meeting in Lisbon was meant to be a high point of Britain's tortured relations with Europe after decades of wrangling and bad feelings..The \"dot-com summit\" last week would be the defin", "word_count": 4613, "score": null, "source": "International Herald Tribune", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": null, "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Thinking Ahead/ Commentary : Blair Can Claim Victory at Summit", "print_headline": "Thinking Ahead/ Commentary : Blair Can Claim Victory at Summit", "body_text": " **********For Prime Minister Tony Blair, the European Union summit meeting in Lisbon was meant to be a high point of Britain's tortured relations with Europe after decades of wrangling and bad feelings. **********The \"dot-com summit\" last week would be the defining moment at which Britain's Continental partners finally saw the light and committed themselves to the liberal economic philosophy, exemplified by deregulation and flexible labor markets, that Mr. Blair has long espoused. **********It would be a political twofer for Mr. Blair: He would emerge as a genuine European leader, despite Britain's self-exclusion from the EU's single currency, the euro; and the meeting would help his aim of selling the euro to the British public by demonstrating that euro members endorsed sensible British-style economic policies. **********As it turned out, on a scale of one to 10, Mr. Blair scored roughly a seven in achieving his immediate political objectives. **********Mr. Blair has learned from experience that it is counter-productive to lecture Britain's partners, particularly France, about the superiority of British ways \u2014 or to claim a British \"victory\" afterward. Despite more than a century of the entente cordiale, France is no more inclined to celebrate the idea of a British victory than Britain would a French one. **********Before the summit meeting, Mr. Blair took pains to stress that Britain could learn from the Continent, listing numerous examples, including many of France's \"radical\" efforts to combat unemployment. **********In Lisbon, he apparently refrained from gloating over news this month that, partly thanks to the strong pound, Britain has overtaken France to become the world's fourth-largest economy, after the United States, Japan and Germany. **********Mr. Blair has also learned that most of the British press can be counted on to diminish whatever he achieves at an EU meeting \u2014 unless it is the clear-cut kind of victory, preferably over the French, that he was trying not to claim in Lisbon. **********Sure enough, the media gleefully lambasted Mr. Blair and his two ministerial colleagues for taking three separate planes, at public expense, to Portugal and then focused on his efforts to cold-shoulder Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel of Austria during the meeting's \"family photo.\" **********Mr. Schuessel is a pariah, at least before the cameras, for having formed a coalition with the extreme-rightist Freedom Party formerly led by Joerg Haider. **********Both of these stories got more play in much of the British media than the main item on the agenda, Europe's bid to catch up with the United States in entering the new Internet-based economy. **********This bid was vying for attention with another major issue of recent days: whether Mr. Blair would take a paternity leave when his baby is born, a question that puts him in rather a tight corner. The idea is strongly advocated by many of Mr. Blair's supporters, including reportedly his wife, Cherie, but could be hard to swallow for a prime minister who is acquiring a growing reputation as a \"control freak.\" **********Lisbon will not help him with that decision. But, for anyone listening, Mr. Blair is entitled to claim that the summit meeting went largely the way he wanted. **********The leaders made numerous specific commitments to adapt to the Internet economy, promote small companies, make finance more easily available for entrepreneurs and complete the EU's single market. **********Mr. Blair was right to say that the EU's shift away from the social regulation of the 1980s toward enterprise, innovation, competitiveness and employment marked a \"sea change\" in European thinking. **********But skepticism is still in order about the leaders' grandest goal \u2014 to make the EU the world's \"most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy,\" with virtually full employment, by 2010. **********Lionel Jospin, the French prime minister, who was noncommittal about some of the meeting's objectives, is becoming increasingly wary of economic and social transformations as French presidential elections, due in 2002, draw closer. In France as in Germany, powerful unions remain adamantly opposed to change. **********Europe lags far behind the United States in entrepreneurship, availability of venture capital and business skills. EU economies are hobbled by red tape, subsidies and high taxes. **********The proof of this Portuguese pudding will be in the eating.

He is a long-haul independent truck driver, and the technological revolution was being fought far from the cab of his big rig. **********But here was Mr. Barnes tap-tap-tapping away at the Cyber Stop at the Petro Truck Plaza in this central New Jersey crossroads. **********''You had better not be scared of computers any more if you drive a truck for a living,'' he said. ''It's how you communicate, how you find your next load, how you do your accounts, how other people find you.'' **********While Mr. Barnes used computers at the truck stop to send e-mail messages to his family and to some clients, his primary destinations in cyberspace are what are known in the trucking business as loadboards. These are Web sites where shippers and brokers post freight, in either full or partial truckloads, in hope of getting truck drivers to deliver the loads. **********The Internet is transforming the truck stop into a wired communications hub. For example, the Cyber Stop has five computer workstations open 24 hours and a computer-trained attendant. The truck stop also sells computer equipment and cell phones. **********On this day, Mr. Barnes was surfing Web sites, looking for freight that his truck could carry back to his home in Barton, Fla. **********''Right now, I could find something, but they don't seem to be paying enough,'' he said, scanning a few offers on Getloaded.com, one of about a dozen online loadboards. ''But this is still better than making phone calls and crossing your fingers that one would work out.'' **********The amount of goods being moved through the sites is relatively small in the overall scheme of things, with many of the shipments from occasional shippers. **********The granddaddy of loadboard purveyors is DAT Services, founded 22 years ago as Dial-A-Truck by Al Jubitz, a truck stop owner in Portland, Ore. The trucking industry had been deregulated in the 1970's, encouraging independent truck drivers and small companies to find extra loads rather than returning empty. **********Mr. Jubitz noticed drivers hanging around his stop after the usual meal and shower, hoping to find a load. So he decided to start signing up brokers and shippers who needed freight hauled from Portland. He listed the loads on a monitor at his truck stop and charged the drivers a nominal fee to get the phone number of the company wanting to move the freight. By the 1980's, DAT monitors could be found in hundreds of truck stops around the country, with 17,000  truck drivers and shippers subscribing. **********''DAT is still the Microsoft of our industry,'' said Ken Hammond, the vice president for marketing for Getloaded.com, founded two years ago in Richmond, Va. ''But the Internet is changing things -- the monitor was, in effect, a monopoly. The Internet has allowed us to cut into that.'' **********DAT, while keeping its television monitors in place, has edged onto the Internet. It hopes to leverage that 17,000-subscription base into an online service called DAT Conexus (www.datconexus.com). The new service not only finds loads for truckers to haul, it also lists drivers and companies with extra rigs for use or rental. **********DAT makes money from subscriber fees from truckers, freight brokers and shippers. Subscription prices vary depending on use and the size of the company. DAT also earns some revenue from online advertising for trucking supplies and used equipment. **********Getloaded.com, on the other hand, charges truckers $35 a month for unlimited use of the Web loadboards, but shippers and brokers can list loads free. **********''If a shipper can get on our boards for free and has to pay someone else, who do you think they will go to?'' Mr. Hammond said. ''In any case, we needed to develop a big database, and this is the way to do it. We couldn't have challenged DAT when it was the monitor loadboards, but with the Internet, the overhead just isn't there anymore.'' **********Mr. Hammond said Getloaded.com started making money this year, with 16,000 drivers or trucking companies subscribing for at least one month through the end of the year. But he said that he thought only a few companies would survive in the Internet load-matching market. **********In any case, said Randy Garber, vice president for operation services practice at the consulting company A.T. Kearney, the business seems more of a niche market than one that will take over the trucking industry. **********''The hangup is that trucking is still a relationship business,'' Mr. Garber said.  ''As much as the layperson may think of these things as commodities, if I am a shipper, I'll be damned if I want the last piece in the supply chain to my customer to be handled by any Joe Blow. A small part of my business? Perhaps. Some internal freight? Yes. But I don't think Wal-Mart is going to subcontract its trucking to loadboards any time soon.'' **********Linda Willis, the dispatcher for Admiral Truck Services, a small flatbed-trucking company in Waller, Tex., near Houston, said that Internet loadboards like Getloaded.com had been a lifesaver for her company. **********''We get loads out, but not many coming back, and they can be to different places all the time,'' she said. ''Fresno one day, Denver the next. Now I can get on the computer and find my guys a load back home instead of them just waiting and waiting around a truck stop.'' **********Efforts have been made to use similar services with ocean and air shipping, Mr. Garber said, but they have not fared well, in part because those industries are more centralized. Getloaded.com's Mr. Hammond sees an advantage for smaller companies like his in the fragmentation of the trucking industry, especially as independent operators get more computer savvy. **********Bob Johnson, an independent driver from Bangor, Me., was in the Bordentown Petro Cyber Stop with his laptop, which he uses to keep accounts and send e-mail messages home. Mr. Johnson said he had used DAT from time to time but was a bit skeptical. **********''Seems people use them out of desperation,'' he said. ''The only way to stay afloat is to have steady business.'' But he noted: ''There are the times I am in Alabama, and I want to get home and I need a load. Now that I have my laptop, I'd at least be more inclined to use it to get that load. It may not be the thing that saves the trucking industry, but at least it gets a few more loads moved, and that can't be all bad.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/11/technology/america-online-time-warner-merger-approved-by-european-union-2000101193455486085.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-10-11", "snippet": "BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Union's executive body on Wednesday conditionally approved America Online Inc.'s $129 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc., removing another obstacle in the proposed combination between the world's largest Inte...", "word_count": 454, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "America Online, Time Warner Merger Approved by European Union", "print_headline": "America Online, Time Warner Merger Approved by European Union", "body_text": " **********BRUSSELS, Belgium -- The European Union's executive body on Wednesday conditionally approved America Online Inc.'s $129 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc., removing another obstacle in the proposed combination between the world's largest Internet and media companies. Under the terms of the approval, AOL and Time Warner agreed that they will not unfairly muscle out rivals from the emerging media and entertainment markets in Europe, the European Commission said. In a statement, the commission of the 15-nation European Union said that AOL is to sever its structural links with German media giant Bertelsmann AG. That condition is meant to allow Bertelsmann to remain an independent competitor in Europe. \"The commission has a duty to prevent creation of dominant positions in all sectors, be they in the old or new economy,\" said EU antitrust commissioner Mario Monti. Antitrust officials were concerned about a resulting integrated company that \"could have dominated the online music distribution market and music players,\" Monti said. The AOL-Time Warner merger still has to be cleared by U.S. antitrust authorities, but the EU decision was seen as key for the chances of the merger going through. Sources said the EU antitrust authorities only formally endorsed the merger after the companies agreed to several concessions, including ending ties with Bertelsmann, Europe's biggest media company. That move will prevent AOL \"from having access to Europe's leading source of music publishing rights, thereby eliminating the risk of dominance in the emerging markets for online delivery of music over the Internet and software-based music players,\" the commission statement said. The companies also have provided guarantees that they will not unfairly discriminate against other companies that provide Internet content or within the music industry. The vote of the 20-member commission on Wednesday came at its weekly meeting -- two weeks ahead of its deadline. EU authorities made quick progress on the issue after Time Warner last week dropped a separate joint venture plan with EMI Group of Britain, which would have created a major music company. European regulators had strongly opposed that deal. With Bertelsmann, Europe's largest media company, competing on its own, the commission said it concluded that AOL-Time Warner \"wouldn't have the critical mass in terms of music publishing to dominate the market.\" Bertelsmann's BMG subsidiary is one of the world's five major music companies and EU antitrust officials feared the merger would have left the new company with the ability to keep the industry in a stranglehold. Bertelsmann is investing heavily to become the largest supplier of media content via the Internet. The antitrust division of the commission opened a probe into the proposed AOL-Time Warner merger in June, stressing the need for an open, competitive environment in the emerging cybermusic and entertainment markets."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/19/business/a-great-stock-trader-sails-off-at-least-for-the-summer.html": {"writer_name": "Floyd Norris", "pub_date": "2000-05-19", "snippet": "Floyd Norris tribute to Stanley Shopkorn, manager of equity part of $10 billion in hedge funds managed by Moore Capital, on Shopkorn's decision to take summer sabbatical to spend more time with his family; Shopkorn photo (M)", "word_count": 626, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Great Stock Trader Sails Off, at Least for the Summer", "print_headline": "A Great Stock Trader Sails Off, at Least for the Summer", "body_text": " **********STANLEY SHOPKORN is sailing away from the stock market.

We'll get to that later. **********When word spread this week that Mr. Shopkorn was taking a sabbatical -- he'll spend the summer cruising the Mediterranean with his wife; his son, who is graduating from college; and his daughter, who is finishing a graduate degree -- there was a tendency to assume another star had been shot down by this year's crazy stock market. But it evidently isn't so. Details on his performance are not available, because he runs the equity part of the $10 billion in hedge funds managed by Moore Capital, and those figures are not broken out from overall returns, but he seems to have done all right. This is not a case of a grizzled veteran who has lost touch with the markets and now sits around blaming the markets for being unreasonable. **********He's done well over the years in part because he usually has a view about where the economy is heading and what the big market theme is likely to be. But he also has a profound respect for the markets, and an ability to read the screen -- we used to say read the tape, but there is no tape anymore -- and sense when it  isn't wise to play a trend. **********In the early 1980's, when he was running the block trading desk at Salomon Brothers, he made lots of money shorting oil stocks on the way down after they reached historic levels of overvaluation. More recently, he did well buying such stocks, and he still thinks that companies specializing in oil and gas exploration are cheap, and that the price of natural gas is headed up. He got on the technology bandwagon early, and he thinks that game is not over, although future rallies are likely to be more selective in terms of quality. He hopes, but is not certain, that the Federal Reserve will be able to arrange an economic soft landing that will not devastate markets. **********Mr. Shopkorn will reassess his future come fall. In the meantime, he'll leave some of his money in funds run by people he trusts, and put the rest in short-term Treasuries. **********His finest hour came on Oct. 20, 1987, the day after Black Monday, when the Dow industrials fell 23 percent. An early rally faded, and the New York Stock Exchange halted trading in stock after stock as sell orders poured in. Fear abounded, and it seemed likely that America's financial markets were about to close for lack of buyers. **********It was then that Mr. Shopkorn, the head trader at Salomon, took a call from Robert Mnuchin, his counterpart at Goldman, Sachs. They agreed that the two firms -- then the most powerful ones in stock trading -- would provide the money to reopen stocks that had halted. Within minutes of that word being sent to the Big Board floor, the market began to rally. You can't prove that decision was crucial to ending the crash, but I believe it was. **********Yesterday I asked Mr. Shopkorn why he had decided to risk Salomon's capital at just that point. The trader wasn't about to admit to being a good Samaritan. ''I thought we were making a good market play,'' he said. ''We thought that it would bounce, and that people just needed capital.'' **********But then he paused.

There is abundant evidence that the act did much to improve prospects for blacks, but as the continuing series in The New York Times on race in America makes clear, discrimination persists, taking on more subtle forms that are less amenable to correction by legislation. Still, existing laws could combat discrimination more effectively. **********Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which took effect 35 years ago next month, prohibited employment discrimination and established the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The first studies on the law's economic impact were conducted by Richard Freeman of Harvard and Orley Ashenfelter of Princeton in the early 1970's. They found that after 15 years of stagnation, black men's earnings increased relative to those of whites shortly after the act took effect, with the median earnings gap closing from 36 percent in 1965 to 26 percent in 1975. Gains were particularly large for black professionals. The timing suggests, but certainly does not prove, that the Civil Rights Act was responsible for the improvement. **********Professors Freeman and Ashenfelter were quickly criticized by both the right and the left. From the right, critics argued that the narrowing gap was a mirage -- that low-wage workers, who were disproportionately black, were induced to drop out of the labor market by expanded income-transfer programs. The average wage of black workers rose, it was argued, because many who would have earned low wages left the labor force. Others argued that improvements in African-American education and Northern migration were responsible. Some left-wing critics argued that the strong economy, not civil rights legislation, had lifted the earnings of blacks. **********Underlying these criticisms was the belief of the right that job discrimination could not persist in a competitive economy because employers would bid up the wages of minorities if they were equally productive but less well paid, and the left's belief that more government intervention was needed to make a real dent in discrimination. **********The accumulating evidence has convinced most critics that the Civil Rights Act was a principal cause of black progress. The black-white earnings gap continued to narrow until the mid-1970's, in both strong and weak economic times. Several studies, including a recent working paper by Chinhui Juhn of the University of Houston, found that labor market dropouts accounted for only a small part of the narrowing. The gap shrank most impressively in the South, for workers in all age groups, suggesting that educational improvements and migration were not primarily responsible. **********It is possible that the earnings gap shrank because of deeper changes in society -- the very forces that led to the enactment of the Civil Rights Act. But a 1998 study by Kenneth Chay of the University of California at Berkeley found that when smaller establishments became covered by the act in 1972, the employment and pay of black workers increased in them more than in establishments that were already covered. Because societal forces operated on both large and small employers, coverage by the Civil Rights Act made the difference. **********The improvement in the relative economic status of African-Americans halted in the mid-1970's, especially for college graduates, and the earnings gap increased slightly in the 1980's. Strong economic growth in the late 1990's helped return the black-white wage gap for men to about where it was at the end of the 1970's. For black women, who have a smaller earnings gap than do black men, the gap has continued to widen slowly. **********Progress in narrowing the gap slowed primarily as a byproduct of forces that caused rising wage dispersion throughout the American economy. **********To some extent, the Civil Rights Act has also been a victim of its own success. The early cases brought under the law were predominantly class- action suits against employers who refused to hire African-Americans in higher-paying jobs and industries, like steel and aircraft manufacturing. **********The nature of litigation has changed. Research by John Donohue III and Peter Siegelman published in the Stanford Law Review found that in 1966, charges of racial discrimination involving hiring outnumbered those involving firing by 50 percent. In 1999 firing cases outnumbered hiring cases by more than six to one. The number of class-action suits, though up in the last five years, declined from a peak of 1,100 in 1975 to 28 in 1999. **********Antidiscrimination policy works best when it opens doors and gives people a chance to prove their mettle. Studies in which paired black and white job seekers apply for the same job routinely turn up evidence of bias in hiring. But cases involving individual discharges are easier and less costly for lawyers to pursue. This is unfortunate because ''abuses of the system are greater on the firing side, and the potential for achieving the goals of the legislation are greater on the hiring side,'' Professor Donohue said. **********Concerns about possible litigation over future discharges could also discourage employers from taking a chance on minority job applicants in the first place. **********To make the Civil Rights Act more effective, Professor Donohue proposes doubling or tripling damages in discriminatory hiring cases, as is done in antitrust cases, and curtailing punitive damages on the discharge side. **********But Paul Steven Miller, a commissioner with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, said he was concerned that different penalties for hiring and firing cases would send a signal that some forms of employment discrimination are more offensive than others. Instead, he favors increased technical assistance for minority job applicants, greater use of programs to send matched-race testers to apply for jobs and affirmative action to identify and reduce racial bias in hiring. **********Still, it is hard to argue with Professor Donohue when he says, ''It would be a shame if Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which embodies one of the most noble ideas of the 20th century, becomes used primarily as a way for less competent workers to hang on to their jobs or walk away with a sizable, undeserved severance package.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/15/business/no-headline-233285.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-11-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 0, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "No Headline", "print_headline": "No Headline", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/09/business/sales-of-debt-securities-scheduled-for-this-week.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-10-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 282, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sales of Debt Securities Scheduled for This Week", "print_headline": "Sales of Debt Securities Scheduled for This Week", "body_text": " **********The Treasury's schedule of financings this week is confined to tomorrow's auction of three-  and six-month bills and a 30-year Treasury inflation-pegged securities on Wednesday.

Boyle, a Long Island banker who played a major role in devising the first bank-issued credit card -- a forerunner of Visa and Mastercard -- died on April 30. He was 88 and lived in Garden City, N.Y. **********Mr. Boyle developed the Franklin Charge Account Plan, which charged interest and let customers make partial payments each month, in 1951 at the Franklin National Bank in Rockville Centre, N.Y. **********It was a novel plan for a bank. At the time, charge plans were limited largely to big New York department stores with suburban branches. Moreover, as Mr. Boyle once noted, ''banks did not lend money to the average fellow.'' Banks typically required borrowers to file an application with two co-signatures for loans of less than $500. **********In 1950, Diners Club introduced the first charge card -- meaning that balances had to be paid in full. But Franklin's plan, which used the marketing slogan ''Just charge it,'' was the first credit card. **********''The bank credit card is probably the most important and enduring legacy of Franklin National Bank, which was one of the key institutions in creating the culture of postwar  consumerism,'' said Stephan Salisbury, a cultural affairs reporter at The Philadelphia Inquirer who has studied the role of Franklin National Bank in bankrolling the rise of the Long Island suburbs. **********The Franklin Charge Card began in 1951 as a method of handling fuel oil dealers' credit and collections. **********By October the following year,  however, the program had expanded to 750 merchants serving 28,000 customers, with annual charges growing to $2.5 million annually. The First National Bank of Kalamazoo in Michigan was the second bank to offer the service, licensing the  charge account plan from Franklin in 1952 and signing up 30 merchants and 18,000 customers in its first three weeks of operation. Banks in Rochester and Plainfield, N.J., soon followed suit. **********Under the Franklin credit card plan, the bank took over the duties that were once the preserve of a department store's back office. It approved the creditworthiness of borrowers while handling the accounting, bookkeeping, billing and other paperwork. **********In return, participating merchants paid the bank a small fee for the service and agreed to abide by a fair practices code that required the  merchant to take back all returns and offer a full refund of the purchase price. **********The card was immediately popular with hardware dealers, clothiers and specialty stores in Nassau County, who began directing their customers to apply for the credit cards at the bank. The American Banker, the industry trade newspaper, said in October 1952 that the Franklin Charge Account Plan was allying the merchant and banker in the same way that car dealers and finance companies became allies in the 1920's and 1930's. **********Born in Brooklyn in 1911, Mr. Boyle left St. John's University to support his family by selling, among other things, hair tonic door to door. In 1941, he enlisted in the Army, where he served as an intelligence officer and rose to the rank of captain. **********By 1953, Mr. Boyle was in demand by the country's bankers who wanted to copy the Franklin Charge Card. He left Franklin National and began his own credit card consulting firm, but ran into legal battles with his former employer and gave up the effort. (Franklin was later acquired by European American Bank, which is now owned by ABN Amro of the Netherlands.) **********In 1956 Mr. Boyle founded Eastern National Bank in Smithtown, N.Y., the first national bank in Suffolk County, and served as chairman and president for 17 years. **********At Eastern National, Mr. Boyle inaugurated the ''golden passbook,'' a program in which the bank issued higher-yielding certificates of deposit, paying 6 percent interest in the 1950's, when banks typically paid 1 to 3 percent. **********After the bank's sale to Chemical Bank in 1972, Mr. Boyle worked as a stockbroker for a short time before retiring. **********Mr. Boyle is survived by his wife, Sheila; five sons, William Jr., Arthur  and John, all of Garden City; Joseph of North Massapequa, N.Y., and Timothy of Coram, N.Y.; three daughters, Virginia Satkowski, of Katonah, N.Y.; Therese Coughlin, of Basking Ridge, N.J.; and Patricia Antonelle, of White Plains; and 13 grandchildren."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/06/business/technology-federal-panel-is-wary-on-gene-altered-corn.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "2000-12-06", "snippet": "Federal advisory panel concludes that there is 'medium likelihood' that genetically engineered corn known as StarLink is potential allergen, a finding that could hurt food industry's quest to have it temporarily approved for human consumption (S)", "word_count": 663, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Federal Panel Is Wary On Gene-Altered Corn", "print_headline": "TECHNOLOGY; Federal Panel Is Wary On Gene-Altered Corn", "body_text": " **********A federal advisory panel concluded yesterday that there was a ''medium likelihood'' that the genetically engineered corn known as StarLink is a potential allergen, a finding that could hurt the food industry's quest to have the corn temporarily approved for human consumption. **********But the panel of outside scientific experts also concluded that there was only a low probability of significant allergy problems arising in the American population because there is little StarLink in the food supply. **********The advisory panel report is intended to help the Environmental Protection Agency decide whether to allow StarLink to be in human food for four years. Until now the corn has been approved only for animal use because of concerns it might cause allergies. **********But the corn has been found in taco shells, setting off recalls and causing millions of dollars in losses for farmers, grain elevators, flour mills and food companies. So Aventis CropScience, the developer of StarLink, is seeking temporary approval so the food industry can avoid further recalls and will not have to test its corn so extensively for the presence of StarLink. **********The advisory panel, which conducted a 12-hour public hearing last week, was not asked to make a recommendation, only to answer scientific questions. It concluded that there are many uncertainties -- about whether the protein is an allergen, about the level of exposure to an allergen needed to cause a reaction, and about the amount of the protein actually in foods made from corn. **********Those uncertainties, as well as the panel's judgment of the medium likelihood that the protein, known as Cry9C, is a potential allergen, could make it more difficult for the E.P.A. to satisfy the necessary standard for approval, which is that there be ''reasonable certainty of no harm.'' **********At the least, the 28-page report could delay any approval because it calls for more studies, which the E.P.A. said yesterday that it was undertaking. In particular the report said the government should test the blood of 7 to 14 of the people who complained of allergic reactions from products containing StarLink to see if they are in fact allergic to it. **********Still, people on both sides of the debate claimed victory. **********The panel ''has clearly agreed that there is a low risk to public health,'' Gene Grabowski, a spokesman for the Grocery Manufacturers of America, which represents food companies, said in a statement. **********But Richard Caplan, environmental advocate for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, said that even a low risk is too high. ''If you are the one with an allergic reaction you don't want it to be in the 'low' category, you want it to be as close to 'no' as possible,'' he said. ''My reading of this document is that E.P.A. should deny the petition.'' **********StarLink has a bacterial gene that allows it to produce Cry9C, a toxin that kills the corn borer, a common pest. Since this bacterial protein is not known to have been in the food supply before, there is no easy way to know if people are allergic to it. **********Another E.P.A. advisory panel earlier this year concluded that there was no evidence to indicate whether Cry9C is or is not an allergen. But Aventis put forth new evidence intended to show that the protein was not an allergen. It also argued that even if the protein were an allergen, people would not be exposed to enough to become sensitized and develop allergic reactions. That is because the corn was not widely planted and will not be grown in the future, even for animal feed, since Aventis has canceled its license for the seed. **********The advisory panel, made up mainly of academic allergy and agricultural experts, said ''there can be no final proof that Cry9C is or is not a food allergen.'' But it said the protein had, to some degree, several characteristics of allergens. It dismissed Aventis's new evidence as unconvincing. **********But it said that because of low levels in the diet, there is a ''low likelihood'' that people have been sensitized to the protein."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/02/business/company-news-kinder-morgan-buys-into-a-texas-gas-pipeline-and-unit.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "2000-06-02", "snippet": "Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP, number 1 seller of carbon dioxide, agrees to pay $55 million for Devon Energy Corp's stakes in Texas pipeline that ships gas and a project that injects it into oil reservoirs; oil companies use carbon dioxide to i...", "word_count": 113, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "KINDER MORGAN BUYS INTO A TEXAS GAS PIPELINE AND UNIT", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; KINDER MORGAN BUYS INTO A TEXAS GAS PIPELINE AND UNIT", "body_text": " **********Kinder Morgan Energy Partners L.P., the No. 1 United States seller of carbon dioxide, agreed yesterday to pay $55 million for the Devon Energy Corporation's stakes in a Texas pipeline that ships gas and a project that injects it into oil reservoirs.

It may run higher for franchisees who have large, suburban outlets with extensive playgrounds, and less for an urban franchise. McDonald's owns the real estate and building, but the franchisee must supply the equipment, furnishings and other improvements. **********Outside of the United States, things are different. The McDonald's Web site lists the cost of franchises abroad. Costs run from \u00a380,000 ($117,600) for a franchise in the north of England to $470,000 for Croatia and as high as $900,000 for a unit on the island of Grenada. **********Hal Theis, an officer in the company's international franchising division, said that in certain markets, McDonald's uses a development license. **********\"In that case, the amount of money you would need is considerably higher,\" he said. \"Not only would a franchisee own and operate the unit, but he would buy the property, build it, and is given the right to develop a certain number of restaurants in the area over time.\" **********In some places \u2014 like Copacabana in Rio de Janeiro, the Champs Elysees in Paris, inside the M25 highway in London and all of Hong Kong \u2014 real estate prices are so high that it would be impossible for franchisees to pay the rent. McDonald's owns those restaurants. **********The company also has special programs, called business facility leases, that encourage outstanding candidates with less than the requisite capital to run a restaurant on a leased basis and use the restaurant's cash flow over three years to fund their investment. **********Mr. Theis said this device was used extensively in markets such as Sweden, where many candidates are taxed so highly they cannot accumulate sufficient savings. **********For those who prefer fashion to food, Jean Cacharel Co. of France has been franchising retail units since 1975 and currently has 60 franchised boutiques, from Paris to Buenos Aires to Tokyo. Its largest concentration of franchise stores is in Italy. **********Nearly all franchisees are individuals, except for in Japan, where a corporation has the three franchises. **********Currently, as part of a global image shift for the Cacharel brand, and its alliance with a young British design team, the company is seeking new franchisees to open boutiques in world capitals like New York, London and major German cities. **********Jean Bousquet, the founder and chairman of Cacharel, emphasized that the company is first a design house with a global image and only secondly a franchisor. **********\"The most important thing we really want in a franchisee is a very highly professional person who already knows the fashion industry,\" he said. \"We are not only interested in money and location.\" **********In fact, unlike most franchisors, Cacharel does not charge a franchising fee. Franchisees must have enough money to lease a 120-square-meter (1,290-square-foot) shop in a prime fashion district (for instance, Soho in New York), and have enough money to decorate it to Cacharel specifications and to buy a full range of stock in the collection. **********Cacharel does not get involved in the financing. But franchisees typically sign a development contract with the company that commits them to sell 80,000 francs ($10,525) worth of Cacharel products per square meter per year. **********For more information: **********CACHAREL.

Issue Divides U.S. and Germany", "body_text": " **********The fiasco over the appointment of a new managing director for the International Monetary Fund has caused serious damage to the critical German-American relationship and revealed deep personal rifts within the governing coalition of Gerhard Schroder, the Social Democratic chancellor. **********With accusations flying between Berlin and Washington over one aborted German candidacy and another whose fate remains unclear, two things are evident: Germany's new political assertiveness makes the United States uncomfortable, and the German perception of America is increasingly critical. **********Michael Steiner, the chief diplomatic adviser to Mr. Schroder, said: ''It has been quite an experience trying to hit this moving target set by the Clinton administration. We have discovered that the superpower sees its global role not only in the military area but also in setting the rules of globalization through the I.M.F.'' **********He added, ''The superpower in Washington grew stronger, but Europeans are also gaining consciousness of themselves and cannot share the view that the role of the I.M.F. is simply to transport the philosophy of the superpower.'' **********His words reflected a strained moment in a German-American relationship that has stood at the core of Germany's postwar growth into a European power. ''The fight with America'' was the unambiguous headline in the influential paper Die Zeit this week over a lead article that was a chronicle of discord. **********Chief among the disputes, for the moment, is that surrounding the fund. The collapse of the candidacy of Caio Koch-Weser, Germany's deputy finance minister, after it was rejected by the United States has left a bitter residue marked by charges and countercharges as to who misled whom and who really made the mess. The atmosphere was not improved when the government of Social Democrats and Greens this week proposed a more conservative official, Horst Kohler, and the Clinton administration scarcely rushed to embrace him. **********Mr. Kohler, the German president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, appears likely to gain at least the formal approval of European Union finance ministers on Monday. But Italy is known to have strong private reservations, and the position of the United States remains unclear. **********The affair has proved particularly poisonous because Mr. Schroder -- habitually a follower of the all-politics-is-local school with little taste or instinct for international affairs -- chose to make a personal crusade of the German quest to head the fund in Washington. **********''This was the chancellor's step into the foreign policy arena,'' said a member of the cabinet. ''And now he is angry with the United States, angry with Joschka Fischer and angry with himself.'' **********The chancellor's irritation with Mr. Fischer, the Green foreign minister, has some of its roots in the fact that he remains much more popular than Mr. Schroder. But it has been immeasurably compounded by Mr. Fischer's evident decision, in the words of the cabinet member, ''to disappear into the bushes on the I.M.F. matter.'' **********The foreign minister, whose taste for the cameras is normally little short of irrepressible, has been conspicuously quiet, and if his much vaunted closeness to Madeleine K. Albright, the United States secretary of state, is real, it has proved of no evident usefulness to Germany in its quest to lead the fund. **********There is little love lost between Mr. Fischer and Mr. Steiner, the modern-day representatives of an old German rivalry between the foreign ministry and the chancellery over the control of foreign policy. Always simmering, this friction has now been revived with a bang. **********To American officials involved in the debacle, the overall impression has been one of German inexperience, mismanagement, clumsiness and ineptitude. This view, naturally, is not appreciated in Berlin. **********''The German approach was to say, now we're grown-up, we're going to show you we're grown-up, and we're just going to do it, without prior consultation, without lobbying, without involving our embassies -- nothing,'' said one American who has played a central role in negotiations. **********Certainly, Germany feels it is grown-up. Mr. Schroder's government has been at pains to make clear that it views itself as the initiator of a new phase in German history, one in which the period of postwar tutelage is over, a ''Berlin Republic'' has been born, and the country is ready to drop all adolescent coyness and call itself ''a great European power.'' **********As Die Zeit put it this week in trying to explain why so many tensions with the United States exist -- over the monetary fund, over American plans for a national missile-defense system, over capital punishment, over the European role in NATO and over much else: ''Past are the times when one was afraid of one's own courage and rather hid differences under the carpet.'' **********But while the United States pays lip service, and perhaps a little more, to the view that Germany's assumption of new responsibilities is healthy, it finds this more abrasive Germany unsettling. Especially when, as American officials put it, the country manages to mishandle a sensitive diplomatic quest to such an extent. **********Mr. Steiner said Germany's quest to lead the International Monetary Fund had been handled as ''professionally as could have been done.'' He added that he had documentary evidence that Germany had initially been misled by the United States. **********The thrust of this ''evidence'' appeared in today's issue of the respected Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, which published an elaborate, unsourced account of how the United States had told Germany that it would accept any consensus candidate of the European Union, before changing its view at the last moment. **********Germany had therefore played exactly by the rules in putting forward Mr. Koch-Weser and gaining formal backing for him from the European Union, only to be let down -- in Berlin's view -- by an unreliable Clinton adminstration wielding American power with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. **********''First, the Europeans just had to agree,'' Mr. Steiner said. ''Then we had to agree on somebody with the so-called necessary strengths. Well, nobody can think about reproaching Mr. Kohler for being weak. Nobody can even think about reproaching him for not knowing his job. And Mr. Clinton himself has now said a German managing director would suit him.'' **********The president has indeed expressed interest in a German head of the fund. But even quick American approval of Mr. Kohler -- and it is far from assured -- will not rapidly set right the battered German-American bond that remains the bedrock of America's security interests in Europe."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/04/business/company-news-hanover-buying-applied-process-solutions.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "2000-05-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 93, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HANOVER BUYING APPLIED PROCESS SOLUTIONS", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; HANOVER BUYING APPLIED PROCESS SOLUTIONS", "body_text": " **********The Hanover Compressor Company, which compresses natural gas to make it easier to ship and store, agreed yesterday to buy the closely held Applied Process Solutions Inc., a maker of equipment for processing oil and gas, for about $67.5 million in stock.

It does not chirp or  beep, it rings  an actual clapper strikes brass bells and the 1940's Bakelite body shudders -- like a voice from another time, like a wake-up call. **********Thomas Frank answers. He has been waiting, here in his home office in the Hyde Park neighborhood. On the other end of the line is an interviewer from a National Public Radio station at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, ready to fill an hour with a phone-in discussion of Mr. Frank's new book, ''One Market, Under God: Extreme Capitalism, Market Populism and the End of Economic Democracy'' (Doubleday). **********In a sweeping, savage and witty indictment of American business, Mr. Frank, 35, slams the notion that the 1990's lived up to the promise of the new economy -- a sensibility summed up by commercials for WorldCom that ask, ''Is this a great time, or what?'' **********Mr. Frank argues that the answer is ''or what.'' Behind the go-go stock market and the feel-good atmosphere, he says, the American economy that bloomed in the 1990's is sick: the divide between rich and poor has widened, he insists, and mechanisms like government regulation and unions that traditionally protected underdogs have been hobbled. **********Mergers and globalization, meanwhile, are homogenizing the world into one big Wal-Mart. Yet, he says, Americans have been sold the notion that the pixie-dust prosperity has touched almost everyone. **********His timing could not be better: Mr. Frank is riding a nascent wave of antibusiness resentment that shows itself in everything from consumer complaints about health maintenance organizations to trashed Starbucks stores during last year's World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle. Vice President Al Gore knew the sentiment was there when he attacked ''big tobacco, big oil, the big polluters, the pharmaceutical companies, the H.M.O.'s.'' And even Business Week asked on its Sept. 11 cover: ''Too Much Corporate Power?'' **********''One Market, Under God'' vivisects the libertarian manifestoes, management how-to books, academic gobbledygook, advertisements and finance-oriented cable networks to describe Mr. Frank's key bete noire: market populism. **********This phrase, Mr. Frank argues, captures a new genre of spin that turns traditional populism on its head. Instead of the classic populist stance on behalf of the little guy, market populism hijacks the power-to-the-people language to glorify capitalism and its biggest winners. Yeoman farmer, make way for the Foosball-playing high-technology chief executive, courtesy of evangelists like George Gilder, the former Reagan administration icon turned tech cheerleader; Tom Peters, the management guru; Walter Wriston, once the chief executive of Citicorp; and the creators of the Motley Fool stock-pickers Web site. **********Mr. Frank has been laying out elements of this argument for some time in his obscure magazine, The Baffler, and in earlier books, including ''Commodify Your Dissent (W. W. Norton, 1997). But ''One Market, Under God,'' published in November, is his manifesto. He attacks business pretensions, not with the cruel streak of Michael Moore in his films or the studied folksiness of Jim Hightower on radio, but with a cool, ironic wit that evokes the line of Elvis Costello, the rock star, who sang, ''Oh, I used to be disgusted/ **********And now I try to be amused.'' **********Admire machines -- worship their inventors **********-- newspaper advertisement for Merrill Lynch, pinned to Tom Frank's corkboard **********As he sits through the radio interview, elbows propped on his aged oak desk and head resting on his hands, Mr. Frank gives his spiel, its freshness faded by repetition over the course of a grueling book tour. He has returned just the night before from a California swing. But he limbers mentally as he speaks, his voice almost preppy and slightly nasal, holding up his part of the disembodied conversation, the anger rising. The sentences build and flow with the fluidity of hot jazz and the urgency of hard rock, one thought after another tumbling out. **********With the business boom on the Internet, he says: **********''A lot of business thinkers thought they had happened onto a kind of Golden Age, onto a new world. There's a business magazine out there calling itself Business 2.0, as if all of, all of history was, like, version 1.3, 1.4, that sort of thing -- and then now we've turned this Grand Corner, and market populism is kind of the expression of that feeling, of business at its most righteous, and at its most self-confident, and most willing to take on its enemies and, and shout them down if you will. **********''Basically, market populism understands corporations and the workings of the market as more LEGITIMATE than government, as closer to the people, as something the people understand -- and that's why they, according to market populism, even C.E.O.'s as wealthy as Bill Gates are men of the people in a way that someone like Al Gore, because he spent his life in government, can never be.'' **********Thanks to the attention his attack has drawn, the peripatetic Mr. Frank is showing up virtually everywhere, and virtually as well. In the online magazine Slate, he recently fought it out in the Breakfast Table, a daily debate feature, with David Brooks, an editor of the conservative Weekly Standard. Mr. Brooks also examined 90's-era prosperity in a book about what he calls ''Bobos,'' or bourgeois bohemians: ''Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They Got There'' (Simon & Schuster, 2000). **********''We both think and write about consumption a lot,'' Mr. Brooks wrote to Mr. Frank in their discussion. ''But whereas you have emerged as a left-wing critic of capitalism and consumption, I'm a right-winger who celebrates capitalism and consumption while finding them insufficient.'' **********Mr. Brooks accused Mr. Frank, in so many words, of being a faux populist. In an acidic exchange, he chided Mr. Frank for saying that he would rather talk with ''300 wage employees randomly chosen from Chi-Chi's, Cheddars, Chili's, Shoney's and Kenny Rogers of Rockford, Ill., over the entire punditocracy.'' Mr. Brooks retorted, ''Why are you hanging around the University of Chicago editing a highbrow magazine and writing books if all the insightful people are over at Shoney's?'' **********Mr. Frank responded: ''You have touched on an issue that comes up a lot at The Baffler. Where do such highbrows as us get off taking the side of the working class? Who do we think reads us, anyway? **********''My colleague David Mulcahey, who is sipping a 40-ouncer at the next desk as I write this, suggests that our audience is largely made up of people who like good writing but feel like they're getting a raw deal at work. Think Microsoft temps or academic adjuncts. They are, in short, proletarian bohemians, or probos.'' **********There seem to be a lot of probos out there -- a population of Americans who did not buy Microsoft stock in the early 1990's; who didn't reinvent their careers on the Internet; who feel that something is just wrong. He speaks for them, said Thomas Geoghegan, a lawyer and chronicler of the decline of the labor movement. ''If enough people say it and do it, you know people are afraid to speak up and say, 'You know, this is nonsense.' '' **********In doing so, Mr. Frank has commodified his own dissent, ''branded'' himself and his critique of market populism. And it sells. **********No one seems more surprised at this than Mr. Frank. As the radio interview progresses, his eyes grow wide in apparent disbelief. The callers are not going to argue with his premise, as some have, insisting that the Internet will make everything better. These are not even timid liberals, or disaffected Naderites. They are full-blown lefties. Asking questions about Karl Marx and quoting the turn-of-the century revolutionary Rosa Luxemburg. **********In Urbana. **********Who knew? **********They may be lonely, but they are not alone. **********''Frank's 'One Market, Under God' is but another in a series of superficial, ill-informed, poorly thought-out screeds on the shortcomings of modern capitalism. . . we get a long and self-indulgent sneer from a writer who seems more intent on rallying his band of true believers than on marshaling facts and analysis that might enlighten a wider audience.'' **********-- Steven Pearlstein **********The Washington Post **********Many people, of course, hear no music in Mr. Frank's message. Mr. Pearlstein lampooned his notion that people like George Gilder and Walter Wriston actually have an effect on the mind of middle America. Jacob Heilbrunn, writing for National Review, lauds Mr. Frank as ''hip and cool and authentic,'' but adds, ''He ignores fundamental truths about today's economy, like, umm, the fact that it's been good for just about everybody.'' **********Indeed, while the gap between rich and poor remains stubbornly wide, the wages of low and middle-income workers have risen faster than inflation since 1996 for the first time in years. **********David Eggers, author of ''A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,'' said in an e-mail interview that he was a fan of Mr. Frank, but his book ''isn't always fair, and it's often overstated.'' Still, he adds: ''We need Tom Frank to take his stance, to be unwavering in his rage. If he didn't exist, we would have to invent him.'' **********Mr. Frank claims not to have read the critiques. ''Reviews can say whatever they want. I go after plenty of people in my book,'' he says. ''I didn't invite Tom Peters to write a rebuttal.'' **********After the radio interview, Mr. Frank drives to The Baffler offices, across the Midway Plaisance from the University of Chicago campus. It is the kind of run-down neighborhood where a shoestring budget can go a long way. ''The secret to happiness is low overhead,'' Mr. Frank jokes. **********The weathered brick building, a former parking garage, is not square nor rectangular, but a crazy rhombus, its shape defined by the crowding-in of other structures that were long ago torn down. Inside, the building contains the studio of an artist who often works from recycled materials, along with the workshops of a cabinet maker and a mechanic who restores abandoned bikes. **********In such a place, The Baffler seems perfectly at home. Mr. Frank and the rest of the staff -- all of whom have other jobs to actually pay the bills -- applied the coats of peach-colored paint that cover the walls and weirdly curving ceiling. Two sets of heavy wooden shelves divide the room, with the University of Chicago law professor Cass Sunstein's name still taped below one cubbyhole. Other cabinets, hand built in the wood shop downstairs, separate Mr. Frank's desk from Greg Lane's, a fellow editor, and sport a sliding wooden window and screen retrieved from a junked confessional. **********The Baffler, too, crafts its wares from found objects, from the commercials on the air to the sprawl of the suburbs and the blandification of the cities. The magazine's commentators take these things, clean them off and put them in a new context, a different light. **********Mr. Frank is, in his way, trying to restore a languishing tradition -- social criticism -- and bring it to a popular audience, reaching back to the time of Edmund Wilson and the preternaturally cranky H. L. Mencken. One of the things Mr. Frank takes pains to show off in his offices is a shelf of Mencken's acerbic brainchild, The American Mercury magazine, whose format and design The Baffler freely imitates. **********Mr. Frank does not, however, live entirely in the past. Yes, the telephone is older than he is, but he bought it on eBay. It sits next to a Bondi blue iMac. The Baffler has a Web site, thebaffler.com. ''This isn't just Mencken redux,'' Mr. Geoghegan says. ''This is somebody who's read everything since Mencken and gone back to him -- a more sophisticated and nuanced view.'' **********''Who Can Carry the Baton in the Race Toward 6,000?'' **********-- Headline trumpeting the surge of the Nasdaq index past 5,000, pinned to Mr. Frank's corkboard **********Seeing the recent precipitous decline to under 2,500 of the Nasdaq, the tech-rich market that was supposed to share the wealth with the little guy, Mr. Frank says he feels recession on the way, and no ''soft landing,'' either. ''It's going to be awful, awful.'' he said. ''There's going to be a lot of efforts to put the blame at somebody's doorstep.'' **********The blame game has already begun, he says, with fingers pointed from the editorial pages of The Wall Street Journal and elsewhere. The targets? Liberals and social critics. **********''Not the investment bankers and the brokers, mind you,'' Mr. Frank says. ''It's people like me. I'm really looking forward to that.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/24/business/vicarious-consumption-a-rod-to-make-any-angler-compleat.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Cowell", "pub_date": "2000-09-24", "snippet": "Article on fishing rods made by Edward Barder of Newbury, Eng, which are priced from $1,680 to $2,240; other companies and individuals making expensive rods noted; photos (M)", "word_count": 1192, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Rod To Make Any Angler Compleat", "print_headline": "VICARIOUS CONSUMPTION; A Rod To Make Any Angler Compleat", "body_text": " **********WHEN you already have a Piaget watch and a Montblanc pen and are casting around for a new handmade emblem of arrival in the good life, think of Edward Barder in his brick-and-shingle workshop here. **********Mr. Barder makes the fishing rods that anglers with impeccable taste -- and deep pockets -- simply must have. **********He makes them to order from aged Chinese bamboo, in a traditional style that long predates the mass production of carbon-fiber or fiberglass rods that anyone can use nowadays. And he sells them at prices of $1,680 for a two-piece rod ($2,240 for a three-piece; line and reel, of course, are extra) to customers whose eyes glint at the rods' alchemy of silk and varnish, cork and cane. **********At three to four times what even the top-of-the-line carbon fiber rods fetch in the United States, the price may seem excessive. But in the rarefied world of split-cane rods, built from six triangular strips of bamboo to form a rod with a hexagonal cross section, Mr. Barder's are not alone. **********In New York, for instance, some fishing tackle stores advertise similar rods made by the R. L. Winston Rod Company, an American manufacturer, for $2,100 to $2,550. Another United States company, Thomas & Thomas Rodmakers, sells split-cane freshwater rods for $1,100 to $1,850. Split-cane rods made by Mario Wojnicki for the Scott Fly Rod Company run to $3,500. **********Somewhat more modest prices for cane rods are found in Britain, from $430 at C. Farlow & Company to $1,400 at Hardy Brothers. Another independent maker, Ian Martin of Durham in northeastern England, sells his rods for around $850. And there is a strong trade in secondhand cane rods: Stephen J. Fawcett, a Lancaster tackle dealer,  advertises old Hardy Brothers rods for up to $700, and antique rods can fetch prices as handsome as their silk whippings and varnished sheen. **********From his modest premises near the confluence of two trout streams, the Lambourn and the Kennet, Mr. Barder, 35, is tapping a market built partly on nostalgia for handmade products and partly on the cachet of a rod that anglers associate with the languorous chalk streams of southern England. He knows that it is a niche market: last year, Mr. Barder said, he produced just 67 rods, and his waiting list now stretches to six to nine months. **********''There's no serious attempt at getting some terrific output going,'' he said. ''If we try to make more rods, we run the risk of saturating the market, and one would sacrifice quality for quantity.'' **********Turning out one rod every three and a half working days, on average, will not earn a fortune for him or his sole employee, Colin Whitehouse. Total rod sales were about $116,000 last year, and the customers expect their rods to come with pampering touches like silk bags and handmade leather tubes to enclose them. ''This is something you do for love, not money,'' Mr. Barder said. **********Though this country often sees itself as the cradle of angling (Izaak Walton's ''Compleat Angler'' was first published in Britain in 1653), the most significant innovation in the history of fine cane rods is usually ascribed to Americans like Solon Phillippe, who is said to have made the first hexagonal rods in the mid-1800's, in Pennsylvania. And in a brief treatise on the subject in his catalog, Mr. Barder writes that ''the American responsible for taking the split-cane rod to its ultimate conclusion, that is, a precision-built, all-hexagonal rod with waterproof ferrules, a fine action and a modest weight, was Hiram Lewis Leonard.'' **********In 1921, G.E.M. Skues, one of Britain's most famous fishermen and a legend in the arcane world of catching trout with artificial flies, called his Leonard-made rod the best in the world, spurring British makers like Hardy Brothers to produce rods ''comparable to today's best,'' according to Mr. Barder's treatise. **********TECHNOLOGICAL advances in hollow fiberglass over the years -- and in carbon fiber rods in the 1970's and 80's -- seduced many British anglers away from what came to be regarded as the clunkier, less powerful and less accurate cane rods. **********Many have stayed away. Despite the cachet of the deluxe handmade versions, a spokesman for Farlow's fishing store in London's Pall Mall said there was ''no great upsurge'' in sales of cane rods generally. And Hardy's, a sister store nearby, expects to sell just 10 or 12 cane rods a year. **********In the United States, by contrast, there is a much bigger following for split-cane rods -- both those from manufacturers and from scores of craftsmen and small businesses. ''The U.S. market is the toughest to crack because they are so partisan about their own rod makers,'' Mr. Barder said. **********In a modest way, Mr. Barder sought to breach the wall last year by making a special millennium rod to be presented by the Flyfishers Club of London to the Anglers' Club of New York. John Larkin, president of the New York club, pronounced the Barder rod ''splendid'' after catching fish with it on England's River Itchen. **********Why do the cane rods appeal to well-heeled anglers? Some say the style of fishing associated with the rod, with its languid casts of curling fly-line, draws them back to a product made of natural materials and away from the whippier, less-forgiving modern carbon-fiber versions. It is a style associated, too, with the elite fishing grounds of southern England, where the rights to cast in the streams springing from chalk aquifers are usually controlled by syndicates that charge steeply for the privilege. A day's fishing on the River Test in Hampshire can cost $350 or more. So why not do it in style? **********Others say that for certain types of angling, the split-cane rod is simply more efficient. And in the United States, split-cane rods are regarded as part of a purist approach to fly-fishing -- a sport that attracts its share of purists. **********But, as with many other objects of desire, from fine Swiss watches and fountain pens to vintage cars, the appeal of a Barder rod may lie in the knowledge that a skilled person made it carefully and to order. **********At Mr. Barder's shop, it takes 40 to 60 hours of work, sometimes stretching over 12 to 16 weeks, to make a typical rod -- a two-piece, 8 1/2-foot-long split-cane trout version weighing just four ounces. Mr. Barder starts with Chinese bamboo tubes, some of them 35 years old. Then comes the delicate job of cutting thin strips, straightening them and planing them into tapered triangles with tolerances of less than one-thousandth of an inch.

Investigating magistrates in Geneva froze the accounts between June and October of last year. **********The banks involved include Credit Agricole Indosuez, the Swiss affiliate of a French bank, and Banque Pictet, a Geneva private bank. One of largest accounts at the Banque Pictet held about $84 million that was unfrozen by the Swiss judicial order, but remained off limits to the Kazakh government because of the American request, the lawyers said. **********Some of the accounts were available for the benefit of the Kazakh president, Nursultan A. Nazarbayev, as well as other officials and members of their families, officials said. **********The officials said that ''several dozen'' Kazakhstan accounts had been turned up by the investigation, though most were accounts of the Kazakh government and could not be frozen, and that fewer than 10 were personal accounts of Kazakh officials or family members. **********The Swiss officials said signers to some of the accounts included James H. Giffen, a New York consultant for oil and other trade deals in various regions of the former Soviet Union. **********A lawyer for Mr. Giffen, Mark J. MacDougal, said today that the allegations of wrongdoing were undercut by today's Swiss judicial order. **********''These rulings by a court that has actually studied the evidence confirms that funds owned by the Republican of Kazakhstan have been wrongfully seized by Swiss authorities,'' Mr. MacDougal said.''We hope that this is a first step in correcting the false accusations directed toward the republic and Jim Giffen.'' **********In June, the United States Justice Department said it had asked the Swiss for assistance in investigating the financial activities of Mr. Giffen, who has been an important adviser to Mr. Nazarbayev. **********The Swiss authorities said a Geneva investigating magistrate, Daniel Devaud, notified the Justice Department in January of suspicions that the accounts were financed by American and European oil companies as bribes to Kazakh officials. **********The suspicion, they said, was based at least partly on a pattern of clandestine and circuitous routes by which the money came to Switzerland, including foundations in Liechtenstein and shell companies in Switzerland, Panama and the British Virgin Islands. **********Swiss officials said that bank records showed that deposits had been made by American and European oil companies, and that they had notified the Justice Department because of the likelihood that the payments could violate the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. **********The Swiss officials said investigators in Geneva had identified four large transactions, two of them involving American companies, and two others involving European oil companies they declined to identify. **********The accounts were frozen after the Kazakh government asked the Belgian authorities last year to investigate the assets in Belgium of a political opponent of Mr. Nazarbayev, former Prime Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin. In May the Belgians asked the Swiss for help with their inquiry. **********Swiss officials said account documents indicated that the money in the Swiss accounts had been available for the benefit of Mr. Nazarbayev, Mr. Kazhegeldin, 48, and Nurlan Balgimbayev, 52, Mr. Kazhegeldin's successor as prime minister and now the top official at Kazakhstan's state oil company. **********A June 12 Justice Department document identifies Mr. Giffen and his Mercator Corporation of New York as being under investigation on suspicion of improperly funneling to Kazakh officials money from the Phillips Petroleum Company; the former Mobil Corporation, now Exxon Mobil; and the former Amoco Corporation, now BP Amoco. **********The Justice Department has said the oil companies are not a subject of the inquiry. Exxon Mobil and BP Amoco have said they are cooperating. Phillips has declined comment. **********Oil company officials have said they believe that the payments were at least in part standard payments to governments for oil contracts.

The Communists' old Palace of Culture has been renovated for the meeting at a cost of $60 million and renamed the Congress Center. **********But since Prague sought this honor, the monetary fund and the World Bank have become targets of rage against globalization and indifferent capitalism. The fund in particular has for some the same negative connotations that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has for far-right groups in the United States. **********Already, on various Web sites critical of the fund and its policies, like www.destroyimf.org -- ''a Web resource for all those mobilizing to end the poverty and injustice inflicted by global capitalism'' -- there is the cry, ''Turn Prague into Seattle!'' There, late last November, 40,000 demonstrators paralyzed the city, damaged businesses, clashed with the police and tied up a meeting of the World Trade Organization. **********Organizers and Czech officials expect 20,000 to 50,000 protesters -- some peaceful, some not -- to come here. The protests will certainly be the largest here since 1989, and perhaps the largest invasion of foreigners since the Soviets dropped by with their tanks in 1968. **********President Vaclav Havel has tried to satisfy and perhaps co-opt some of the more well-mannered groups by offering to meet with them at Prague Castle. **********The government has offered designated areas for protest and arranged for a private company, FAM, to equip the old Strahov sports stadium with tents, portable lavatories and food so the protesters will have a relatively clean and safe place to stay. **********The tent city will open on Sept. 21, and anyone may stay there for the duration for $37, said Tomas Doubek of FAM. There will be private security guards but no policemen, unless there is significant trouble. **********But the conservative party of former Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus objected to the arrangements, saying they looked as if the Czechs ''are collaborating with extremists,'' Mr. Doubek said. **********''Some legislators said, 'Let the protesters get a doctorate in finance, learn two foreign languages, work in a bank for a few years, and then they will be qualified to discuss I.M.F. issues,' '' he said. ''Surprisingly, nobody laughed at this stupidity.'' **********Alice Dvorska, an organizer with the Czech umbrella group Initiative against Economic Globalization, says she is worried about how the Czech police, with a history of aggressive crowd control, will behave. **********In May 1998 the police were taken by surprise by protests against the automobile industry and globalization. The police beat some protesters and some bystanders as well. **********''We're afraid of violence on the part of the police,'' Ms. Dvorska said. ''The Interior Ministry is purposely demonizing us. If you look at protests around the world, it is always the police who cause most of the violence.'' **********Chelsea Mozen is a 25-year-old American who quit a job in Washington to help organize the initiative's program of nonviolent demonstrations, dance and street theater intended to educate citizens. **********''It's not our main aim to shut the meeting down, although we think the I.M.F. and World Bank should be dissolved,'' Ms. Mozen said. ''We want a grass-roots display of our disagreement.'' **********But she says the police have been monitoring the group and its planning, including a meeting outside Prague last month. ''We're definitely under surveillance,'' she said. **********On Aug. 2 the group handed out fliers and performed a bit of street theater in Old Town Square, holding a symbolic soccer match between multinational corporations and representatives of the world's poor. The corporations won by bribing the referee, who represented the I.M.F. and the World Bank. **********Chuck Reinhardt, a high school teacher from New York, played the part of McDonald's during the match. ''The World Bank is not accountable,'' he said. ''They give out loans but don't bear responsibility for what is being done with the money, and most people around the world get no benefits from it at all.'' **********Ragnhild Eide Skogseth, 18, a Norwegian student who played Shell Oil, said the fund and the bank ''always say they want to help the poor, but the results are always the opposite.'' **********The Czech police have been training for the meeting and have worked with the American police and with the F.B.I., which has opened an office in Prague, mostly to monitor organized crime. **********The F.B.I. trained 24 Czech police officers in crowd control in the United States, said an Interior Ministry spokesman, Stanislav Gross, and the police have paid particular attention to the way the Washington, D.C., police handled the spring meeting of the fund and the bank in April. Hundreds of protesters were arrested there, but there was much less violence than in Seattle. **********Still, for the designers of the Web site, the meeting ''will be protected by a Czech police operation run by the F.B.I.'' It says, ''The challenge to the workers' movement is to shut down that summit with the biggest international demo Europe has ever seen.'' **********One problem for the police is the location of the old Palace of Culture. The main access from the city center, where most delegates will stay, is by a bridge over a valley that could be blocked by protest. **********The two closest hotels, the Corinthia Forum and the Panorama, are on the right side of the bridge, but because they have Libyan ownership, an American embargo would bar Americans from staying there. **********Horst Kohler, the fund's executive director, says he has ''full confidence'' in Prague's ability to handle the meeting. Emphasizing a need for ''internal reform,'' he said the fund was ''open for discussions and dialogue.'' **********''We're not hiding'' from the protesters, he said. **********Mr. Havel emphasizes the symbolism of Prague as the host of the post-Communist world's first annual meeting of the fund and bank.

In other words, Brazil's Congress is acting as if the crisis never occurred and procrastinating about approving the government's economic program. **********With the 2000 budget still not approved, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has summoned lawmakers back to Brasilia for a special session that began this week and is intended to force them to keep working until his agenda can be voted on. But Congressional leaders, clearly mindful of local elections later this year, have dismissed his austerity package as a mere ''wish list'' and countered with proposals of their own that would limit presidential powers and dip further into the federal purse. **********A year ago this week, the governor of Brazil's second-most-populous state announced a unilateral moratorium on repayment of his state's debt, a move that alarmed foreign investors and led them to begin pulling money from the country. **********Within days, Mr. Cardoso had been forced to allow a devaluation of the Brazilian currency, the real, which led to a sharp 40 percent decline in its value against the dollar. **********In the panic that followed, foreign bankers and Wall Street analysts at first predicted that Brazil's economy would contract by as much as 6 percent in 1999, with interest rates rising above 55 percent and the dollar worth as much as three reals. In reality, the economy bounced back quickly from the initial blow, closing the year with positive growth, and with interest rates at 26 percent and the real trading at 1.83 to the dollar. **********As a result, Brazilian legislators simply do not feel the same sense of urgency or international pressure as they did a year ago. In addition, it is the middle of a glorious summer here, which may help explain why fewer than one-fifth of the 594 members of Congress were on hand for the first quorum call this week. **********''This convocation is unnecessary and expensive,'' complained Geddel Vieira Lima, leader of the delegation of one of the parties in the government coalition. ''I don't see how we can vote on this entire agenda in this period of time.'' **********The ambitious agenda for the special session, which is scheduled to last until mid-February, includes renewal of Mr. Cardoso's line-item veto authority over the budget, reform of the tax and pensions systems and changes in labor laws. Other measures under consideration are limits on spending by municipalities and states and salary ceilings for government employees. **********The government argues that passage of its reform measures is essential if it is to meet performance targets set in the $41.5 billion economic rescue package it signed with the International Monetary Fund in November 1998. But with nationwide municipal elections scheduled for October, legislators want to be generous to win favor with voters, not to keep belts tightened. **********A group of 60 legislators within the government coalition, for instance, last month blocked a vote on renewal of a measure giving the executive branch more powers to limit spending because the president had refused to include their pet pork-barrel projects in last year's budget. Mr. Cardoso has ''had more problems with his supporters than the opposition,'' the business daily Gazeta Mercantil concluded after that incident. **********But Congress is also feeling cranky toward Mr. Cardoso because he recently vetoed a bill that would have erased more than $11 million in fines that were imposed on lawmakers who violated electoral campaign laws. That amnesty would have applied to more than 80 legislators and nine state governors, many of whom the president has been counting on to support his legislative package but who are now highly offended. **********''The veto could induce reprisals from lawmakers and put at risk the approval of measures that are of obvious urgency to the country,'' the daily O Estado de Sao Paulo warned in a recent editorial. The newspaper criticized the behavior of legislators as ''shameful,'' warning that the bill, which Congress is threatening to override, ''indirectly authorizes an anything-goes attitude'' in the campaign leading up to the October vote. **********Additional grounds for conflict between Congress and the president exist in a proposal by legislators to give themselves a 50 percent pay increase, to $80,000 a year. In a country where the minimum wage is $900 a year, the proposal is extremely unpopular and goes against Mr. Cardoso's emphasis on fiscal discipline and sacrifice. **********''I would prefer that Congress be on the side of public opinion,'' the president said just after Christmas, referring specifically to his veto of the electoral amnesty measure. To act in any other fashion, he added, is ''demoralizing'' to the country ''and leaves a sensation of impunity.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/25/world/russia-warns-afghanistan-not-to-aid-rebel-groups.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Gordon", "pub_date": "2000-05-25", "snippet": "Russian officials threaten to bomb targets in Afghanistan if Afghanistan's ruling Taliban shelters and aids Islamic militants fighting in Chechnya and former Soviet republics in Central Asia; say they do not plan ground attack in Afghanistan; Unit...", "word_count": 542, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Russia Warns Afghanistan Not to Aid Rebel Groups", "print_headline": "Russia Warns Afghanistan Not to Aid Rebel Groups", "body_text": " **********Russia warned today that it might bomb targets in Afghanistan if the Islamic-led government there shelters and supports rebels fighting in Chechnya and former Soviet republics in Central Asia. **********The Russian foreign minister and defense minister each suggested today that airstrikes might be carried out if the Taliban, the fundamentalist group that leads the Afghan government, supports Islamic militants fighting in the former Soviet Union. **********''If a potential threat emerges, various actions become possible,'' Foreign Minister Igor S.

''But we believe the Russians should exercise restraint.

But they assert that Russia is exaggerating the significance of the foreign assistance in order to portray its war in Chechnya as a struggle against an external threat rather than a battle against insurgent Chechens who are fighting for their independence. **********Chechnya is not the only Russian concern. Earlier this month, Mr. Putin suggested that Islamic rebels in Uzbekistan and other former Soviet republics in Central Asia were also receiving support from foreign sources. **********''We are ready to take preventative measures, if necessary,'' Mr. Putin said during a visit to Tashkent, the Uzbek capital. ''We are ready to take preventive measures, if necessary. Russia will certainly lend a hand to Uzbekistan.'' **********The recent speculation about airstrikes was ignited by comments earlier this week by Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the Kremlin spokesman for the war in Chechnya.

Papua New Guinea. The Galapagos Islands. The itinerary sounds like something Charles Darwin or Margaret Mead might have dreamed up. **********Travelers who sign up for ''Mysteries of the Earth,'' a new private jet tour offered by TCS Expeditions, will also study Polynesian culture on the Cook Islands, hunt for herbs in the Brazilian rain forest and gaze at orangutans in the jungles of Borneo. And that is only the first half of the trip. Then comes a safari in Tanzania, an elephant trek in Nepal and bird-watching in the Seychelles. **********If this is the kind of whirlwind tour that excites rather than exhausts you, be sure to check out the price before you start packing: $34,950 a person, double occupancy. And even if you can afford it, you're way too late: the tour, with departures next February and March, sold out months ago. **********Clearly, the private jet vacation has arrived. For years no more than flashy blips on the travel industry's radar screen, deluxe jet trips have built a booming business in the last five years, according to individual tour companies, though no organization tracks their combined revenue. **********In an age gilded by 10 years of prosperity, there seems to be no shortage of affluent travelers who want to cover as much prime territory as they can in the most expedient -- and most comfortable -- way possible. They can choose among tours of 14 to 26 days in length and ranging from $25,000 to $62,000 in price. Offered by TCS, Travcoa, Abercrombie & Kent, Intrav and a few other high-end operators, the tours use charter aircraft -- usually Boeing 737's and 757's and Lockheed L-1011's -- reconfigured to make them more commodious. **********TCS Expeditions uses 757's set up to seat 88 passengers instead of the usual 233. This year, the company is sending 1,500 people on 18 theme journeys, ranging from a European golfing trip that stops at six courses in four countries (including Gleneagles in Scotland and Ballybunion in Ireland) to a ''Lost Cities'' tour that goes to Laos, Mongolia and Uzbekistan, among other places. **********T. C. Swartz, the president of the company, said bookings doubled last year. Like other tour operators, he is surprised not only by the sudden popularity of the trips but also by their apparent habit-forming nature. **********''Nearly 70 percent of those who book one of our tours will book another,'' Mr. Swartz said. ''I used to think of these as once-in-a-lifetime trips. Obviously I was wrong.'' **********Business is also up at Intrav, based in St. Louis. It was among the first to offer private jet tours when it started around-the-world Concorde trips in 1987. (In the aftermath of the Concorde crash in France last month, Intrav, like other companies that charter Concordes, is choosing another aircraft.) **********David Drier, a senior vice president of Intrav, said recently that its number of jet trips had nearly tripled in the last five years, to 29 this year. Among them is ''Exploring the Ancient Cultures of the Eastern Mediterranean,'' which uses a Boeing 737 that seats 44 passengers instead of the usual 120. The two-week tour, with various stops in Greece, Turkey, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan,  costs $27,500. **********Matthew Upchurch, chief executive of Virtuoso, an association of 244 independent luxury travel companies with combined revenue of $2.5 billion, said the tours' popularity had ''taken us all by surprise.'' **********He attributes the recent interest to several factors. There is the strong economy, of course, something that has benefited luxury travel in general. (His association's clients spend an average of $6,000 a person for trips that last an average of seven days.) **********Mr. Upchurch also cites what he calls the  ''degradation of commercial aviation,'' which at this point ''can almost be described as hand-to-hand combat.'' Private jet tours -- with their promise of smooth, personalized service; palatable multicourse meals; and direct flights from one out-of-the-way location to another -- offer an attractive, if expensive, alternative to overbooked commercial flights and long delays. **********NED WEIGEL, 47, a real estate investor from Chattanooga, Tenn., signed up for the $28,300, 18-day ''Biarritz to the Bosporus'' trip from Intrav last spring. In one 48-hour period, his group flew from Biarritz, on the west coast of France, southwest to Bilbao, Spain, for an afternoon at the Guggenheim museum there, then returned to Biarritz for the night before heading to Madeira the next morning. On the way there, they stopped for a few hours in Granada, Spain, for tapas and a tour of the Alhambra. **********''If we had gone on commercial flights, it would obviously have taken many days,'' said Mr. Weigel who, at the end of the tour, overheard someone comment that his only regret was that he hadn't spent enough time on the plane. That comment, he added, ''just about says it all.'' **********Mr. Upchurch says there is one primary reason that luxury travel in general, and jet tours in particular, have been so successful in recent years: the accrual of wealth by the  maturing post-World War II generation. While jet tour operators say most of their clients are retired or semiretired, they are noticing a steady influx of people in their 30's and 40's. **********''Everybody has heard so much about the impact of the baby boomers that it's beginning to sound like white noise,'' Mr. Upchurch said. But, he added, ''the travel industry hasn't seen the full brunt of them.'' **********''They are not just a group of people with a lot of money,'' he said. ''They are the best-educated, best-connected, best-traveled and most demanding group of consumers in the history of mankind.'' **********Their parents, the mainstay of deluxe travel, viewed travel as a luxury, not a right, Mr. Upchurch said. But those of the post-World War II generation see it the other way around, and their guilt-free spending seems to be affecting their elders. **********''For many years, there was a reluctance to spend such money on expensive travel options, even if you had the means,'' said Mr. Drier of Intrav. ''Now the attitude is, 'Why not? We deserve this!' '' **********A new demand for ''unique'' experiences goes hand in hand with this new attitude. ''It's not enough to say you've gone to India or Australia,'' Mr. Drier said. ''It's what you've done when you're there that counts.'' **********On the ''Nepal and the Desert Kingdoms of Rajasthan'' tour, offered by Intrav, guests spend the night in the royal tents of the Maharaja of Jodhpur. On a jet tour around South America, Abercrombie & Kent arranges an after-dinner re-enactment of the Rio carnival. And on a recent around-the-world tour, Travcoa arranged for two hairdressers from Nairobi, Kenya, to fly to Nice, France, with its group of dusty, disheveled clients, so everyone could arrive in appropriate form for an evening in Monte Carlo. **********Mr. Weigel, who has taken four jet vacations with Intrav, has his own favorite experience: rising at dawn for a hot-air balloon trip to the Masai Mara Reserve in Kenya, where a table had been set up in the wilderness for a white-linen Champagne breakfast. **********FOR many people who take these tours, the extravagances -- breakfast on the plains of Africa, lunch on the lawns of the Umaid Bhawan Palace in Jodhpur, India, Christmas dinner at the Grand Hotel Victoria-Jungfrau in Interlaken -- are outshone by the routine luxuries: first-class accommodations everywhere possible; guides who include academic experts and former ambassadors; airline crews trained at prestigious hotel schools. **********But there may be a few drawbacks. Some travelers point out routine annoyances, like the respiratory illnesses that bounce back and forth among aircraft-bound tour members, and the decidedly feverish pace of many trips. David Dibner, a retired business executive, said TCS Expeditions' ''Lost Cities'' tour left him and his wife, Frances,  nearly exhausted after ''three weeks of two-night stands'' in Jordan, Cambodia and other exotic places. Mr. Dibner said he recognized the value of visiting ''extraordinary locations that the average tourist would not know how to get to,'' although, he said, his first jet tour would probably be his last. **********Nothing, however, is likely to keep Mr. Weigel from taking another one. He even says the tours are a good deal. ''People constrained for vacation time get the biggest bang for their buck,'' he said. ''So for me, it's obviously a value worth repeating.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/08/business/company-news-trw-says-earnings-will-be-well-below-expectations.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "2000-09-08", "snippet": "TRW Inc says third-quarter profit will be below forecasts by 19 to 24 cents a share (S)", "word_count": 98, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TRW SAYS EARNINGS WILL BE WELL BELOW EXPECTATIONS", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; TRW SAYS EARNINGS WILL BE WELL BELOW EXPECTATIONS", "body_text": " **********TRW Inc., a maker of auto parts and military equipment, said yesterday that its third-quarter profit would be below forecasts by 19 to 24 cents a share because of currency fluctuations, production cutbacks by Ford Motor and slower electronics sales.

Ground down by misrule and miscreants, Nigeria, the continent's most populous nation, was an ailing giant perilously close to collapse. **********On his second trip to Africa next weekend, Mr. Clinton's main destination will be Nigeria, which under the elected civilian government of Olusegun Obasanjo, who took power just 15 months ago, has undergone one of Africa's most stunning and convulsive political transformations. **********Mr. Clinton rhapsodized about a renaissance on his last visit to Africa. Nowadays, no one mentions the leaders he heralded then as beacons of Africa's rebirth: only months after his trip, the leaders of Uganda, Rwanda, Ethiopia and Eritrea all went to war, against one another, from the Horn of Africa to Congo. **********The hopes of Washington, and the West, now rest largely with Mr. Obasanjo and Nigeria. As he tries to restore freedom and bring some measure of Nigeria's immense wealth to its overwhelmingly poor people, Mr. Obasanjo must contend with secessionist tendencies, the spreading imposition of Muslim law in the north, rampant corruption and decades of neglect of the infrastructure that should hold his country together. **********Mr. Obasanjo's performance has been mixed. Faced with the declaration of Shariah, the Islamic legal code, in eight northern states, he has reacted cautiously and called for a political solution to the challenge of Islamic extremism. Yet he ordered soldiers to destroy a town in the oil-producing Niger Delta. His initial crackdown on corruption went far and wide, but his own aides have engaged in old-style influence peddling. **********He has called himself a true believer in democracy and appears to have reined in the military, but he has surrounded himself with weak ministers and has little regard for the National Assembly. **********As daunting as his problems are his potential assets: 113 million people above ground and billions of barrels of crude oil underground. On the continent with the world's richest natural resources and poorest people, Nigeria has so much oil that it may eventually rank second only to Saudi Arabia, but its inhabitants have one of the lowest standards of living. On a continent riven by cleavages among ethnic groups, Nigeria has the most, perhaps as many as 400. **********Nigeria is home to Lagos, a reeling, clogged metropolis that is yet Africa's most thrilling city. It is a country that has given birth to some of Africa's most resonant music and literature, yet it is also a place where only 1 in 270 people has a telephone. The National Electric Power Authority -- whose initials are also said to stand for Never Expect Power Anytime -- is so unreliable that several nationwide blackouts have occurred in recent months. Long lines at gas stations -- the iconic image of a country of corrupt leaders and suffering masses -- have recently reappeared. **********There is little sense here -- even less than elsewhere in Africa -- that politicians can improve the lives of ordinary Africans. The politicians, said Uti Akpan, 30, a textiles trader in Lagos, ''have abandoned the schools because their children do not go to schools here.'' **********''We are hungry, but they carry our money and go and invest outside,'' he said. ''If there's democracy here, we don't know.'' **********But Mr. Obasanjo, a retired general who is the West's new darling in Africa, seems resolved to try to improve the lives of Nigerians, even if he may find it as hard as previous leaders have to look beyond the big gated villa that is Abuja, Nigeria's spanking new capital, to the sprawling diversity and violent strife that lie beyond. **********In tranquil Abuja, planted in the sparsely populated heart of the country as a neutral zone, the troubles of the nation that has long represented both Africa's highest hopes and deepest despair seem unimaginable. **********Drive two hours north to Kaduna, however, and the despair is on stark display. In a city that once had a cosmopolitan tone and religious integration, where the political and military elite used to spend their weekends playing polo, riots killed thousands of residents this year, and neighborhoods reduced to rubble have become segregated between Muslims and Christians. ''If we want to get proper peace in Kaduna, we have to divide the state into two,'' Simeon Achi, 61, a Christian community leader, said inside his house there. ''Let them go to the north and let our people go to the south.'' **********To the northwest, in Zamfara, the first state to adopt Shariah this year, motorcycle taxi drivers have been whipped or caned for carrying women. A cow thief's hand was chopped off. **********''Sure,'' said Mahmud Aliyu Shinkafi, the state's deputy governor, when asked whether his government would continue cutting off hands. ''It's a deterrent.'' Just outside his office, workers were building a mosque in this officially secular country. **********At the other extreme of this vast country, in the mangrove swamps of the Niger Delta, people are threatening to take up arms to form their own republic -- so that all the country's oil would become theirs. **********''Every ethnic nationality in this country now has a focus on where it wants to go if the nation disintegrates,'' said Bello Orubebe, a lawyer in the oil city of Warri. **********A Convert to Democracy **********For most of the 1990's, under the dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, Nigeria was an international pariah. But for its oil, the West would most likely have forgotten it altogether. **********Then, in June 1998, General Abacha mysteriously died. His successor, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, surprisingly decided to restore civilian rule. And in May 1999 power passed to Mr. Obasanjo, a man much admired abroad for having relinquished power in 1979 after three years as a military ruler and viewed at home as a possible unifier of this almost impossible country. **********He is a Christian from the south in a country traditionally dominated by Muslims from the north, yet has the respect of that northern elite; he is a former absolute ruler who, in the three years he spent in jail under General Abacha's rule, is said to have become both a convinced democrat and a born-again Christian. **********The shaky democracy over which Mr. Obasanjo presides has been tested severely despite the new openness. Still, the center has held so far -- although in so fragile a fashion that President Clinton will spend his two days in Nigeria only in Abuja, for security reasons. **********''Nigeria and the transition there is of huge importance,'' said a Clinton administration official in Washington. ''Given its size and its potential role in stabilizing and democratizing Africa, Nigeria represents a huge opportunity for our own interests in Africa and also a huge challenge to us.'' **********In the last two years, Nigeria has risen from receiving nearly nothing in American aid to being at the top in sub-Saharan Africa: $109 million for general aid -- still less than $1 for every Nigerian -- as well as $10 million to reform its military and about $50 million to train and equip its soldiers for peacekeeping operations in West Africa. **********The United States wants Nigeria to play an increasing security role and to help America resist calls to intervene in places like Sierra Leone. And so within this short period Nigeria has gone from untouchable to being, along with South Africa, one of Washington's two most important partners in sub-Saharan Africa. **********Much of the West's hope for Nigeria lies in its leader, Mr. Obasanjo. **********Although his earlier presidency was marred by widespread corruption and human rights abuses, he relinquished power voluntarily in 1979, becoming the first general to do so and earning the lasting respect of Western leaders like President Carter. What is more, when the newly oil-rich Nigeria saw itself in the 1970's as Africa's leader, General Obasanjo was one of the leaders of pan-Africanism. **********Under General Abacha, Mr. Obasanjo was jailed in 1995 on a trumped-up charge of attempting a coup. After the general's sudden death, Mr. Obasanjo was released and soon declared his candidacy for president. **********The Hausa-speaking Muslim military elite, who have controlled Nigeria for most of its 40 years of independence, trusted Mr. Obasanjo even though he was a Christian Yoruba. The southwestern Yoruba and the northern Hausa are two of the country's three main ethnic groups; the third is the southeastern Ibo. The military elite bankrolled his campaign to an easy, if not altogether transparent, victory in February 1999. As Mr. Obasanjo prepared to take over in May 1999, he remained a giant question mark. Would he be a stooge of the north or his own man? Would he be a democrat his second time in power? **********Onukaba Adinoyi-Ojo, who was appointed managing director of The Daily Times, a  state-owned newspaper, by Mr. Obasanjo last year, said the president was converted to civilian rule after his first term. **********''He's not a reluctant democrat,'' said Mr. Adinoyi-Ojo, who has been a protege of Mr. Obasanjo since the early 1980's. ''Over the years he interacted with a lot of world leaders and saw that democracy was more beneficial. When he was imprisoned by Abacha, he never thought that could happen to him after having attained his position in Nigeria. He saw that only democracy could protect everyone's rights.'' **********Indeed, immediately after taking over, Mr. Obasanjo flushed the military of its politically ambitious senior officers, set up investigations into corruption and human rights abuses and, describing himself as a ''detribalized politician,'' appointed officials from diverse ethnicities in the military, ministries and his cabinet. The north, used to a monopoly on power, felt betrayed. **********Mr. Obasanjo's decision to become a born-again Christian ''has made him approach government with a messianic attitude,'' Mr. Adinoyi-Ojo said. ''He sees his second coming as a call from God as if he were a Messiah come to save this country. That's made him impatient. He's domineering. There's almost an I-know-it-all kind of attitude. Some feel he doesn't consult widely. I think he's aware of that fact.'' **********Mr. Obasanjo's failings have been overlooked by foreign governments. Restive Nigerians tend to swing to the other extreme nowadays, giving Mr. Obasanjo credit for little and seemingly forgetting the genuine strides during his administration. **********''The mere fact that Obasanjo has been able to hold this country together is praiseworthy,'' said Hakeem B. Harunah, a historian at the University of Lagos. **********Lagos, the political capital until two decades ago and the focal point of the opposition to the military, had felt the army's clamps more than any other corner of Nigeria. **********Grinding Poverty the Norm **********''There's a kind of freedom that we now enjoy,'' said Soji Omotunde, 45, a publicist who was browsing recently in a bookstore in the neighborhood of Ikeja. ''In spite of the political upheavals which are the product of a lack of democracy, we are on a path to survival.'' **********And yet, having grown used to the idea of greater freedom, most Nigerians now mention it as an afterthought. Instead, they focus on how their daily lives have otherwise not changed: despite the billions of dollars this country earns each year from oil, most Nigerians live in grinding poverty. **********Lagos reels daily, dragged down by the weight of its estimated eight million inhabitants, collapsing roads and an undercurrent of violence. Only the great Nigerian spirit -- of ''suffering and smiling'' at the same time, as the late Afrobeat musician Fela Anikulapo-Kuti described it -- lifts up Lagos's squalid slums and gaudy mansions into what is perhaps Africa's most vibrant city. **********Persuading Nigerians that a democracy can keep improving their lives remains a race against time for Mr. Obasanjo. Generals have long used the public's lack of confidence in politicians as an excuse to seize and keep power. Nigeria's last experiment with civilian rule, which began in 1979,  ended in 1983 because politicians proved altogether corrupt and incompetent. **********Some worry that the continuing shambles in Abuja will produce a repeat of the past. National Assembly members have exerted most of their energies in the last year on matters like obtaining allowances to buy furniture for their state-furnished private homes. In the end, senators who had been granted $35,000 to buy furniture awarded themselves $50,000 -- in cash. This month the Senate president, Chuba Okadigbo, No. 3 in government, was impeached after an internal investigation found that he had awarded himself $370,000 for furniture and $220,000 as a Christmas bonus. **********Nigeria now has its third Senate president in a year. The first had to resign after lying about his age and academic record; the first House speaker, No. 4 in the government, suffered a similar fate for the same reasons. Both allies of Mr. Obasanjo, they had been elected to their positions after his aides handed out bags of money to lawmakers to secure their votes, congressmen and senators acknowledge privately. **********The practice has come to be known as ''Ghana-must-go'' politics -- after the huge multicolored bags that illegal Ghanaian immigrants used when they were expelled from Nigeria in the early 1980's. In the National Assembly, the bags were needed to carry the bricks of notes of the local currency, the naira, of which the largest denomination until recently was worth only 50 cents. **********''What baffled me is that even the money recovered from Abacha has been stolen,'' said Mr. Akpan, the Lagos textiles trader. ''If you recover money from a thief and you go back and steal the money, it means you are worse than the thief.'' **********A small part of the $5 billion estimated to have been stolen by General Abacha has been recovered from overseas accounts, but the amount has been loosely controlled once back in Nigeria. **********The economy remains stagnant, partly because of the government's failure to privatize important sectors like the telephone industry. Nigeria's economy, like those of most African nations, still remains tightly controlled by the state. **********''Everyone is still trying to live off government patronage,'' said Kenneth Enahoro, 47, a businessman and the son of a prominent politician, Anthony Enahoro. ''The economy was destroyed by the long years of irresponsible military rule. It's going to take honest work to try and resuscitate the economy and give food to the man on the street, without relying on government handouts.'' **********The Ever-Present Nightmare **********After its vigorous start, the Obasanjo administration became bogged down by the various forces fueling the country's anger. Certain things have remained constant since British colonialists created it in 1914: a breakup has always been a nightmare, one that came close in 1967 when the Ibo tried to secede in the war of Biafra. A million Nigerians died. **********With the military out of power, the country's sectarian and separatist forces have hit Mr. Obasanjo with full might. Out of favor, powerful northerners have challenged him by encouraging the spread of Shariah. In Kaduna, the possibility that it would be enforced led to deadly clashes between Christians and Muslims. **********''You cannot have a country that is ruled by one law and, once you travel one hour away, by a different law,'' said Yohanna Madaki, a Christian lawyer, retired colonel and former military governor. With soldiers off the streets, ethnic-based vigilante groups have mushroomed. **********''People don't feel that they can rely on the government for protection, so they are going outside the system,'' said Ozonnia Ojielo, a lawyer at the Center for Conflict Resolution and Peace Advocacy, a private organization in Lagos. ''The result is that all these vigilante groups have created a sense of lawlessness.'' **********This sense of looming anarchy resurrected the military ruler in Mr. Obasanjo late last year. When clashes occurred in Lagos involving a Yoruba extremist group he ordered that its members be ''shot on sight.'' **********Around the same time, 12 police officers were killed in the Niger Delta by inhabitants of a town called Odi. Hundreds of troops sent by Mr. Obasanjo flattened Odi and killed countless innocent people. The president later expressed regret, but the good will he had earned by visiting the delta soon after his inauguration evaporated. **********''We thought a civilian regime would bring us succor,'' said Mr. Orubebe, the lawyer in Warri, perhaps the most unlivable city in West Africa. Its streets are forever choked with cars and motorcycles and a thick bluish haze hangs in the air. Mountains of garbage, dumped helter-skelter, had grown so high recently that several streets were blocked off. **********Mr. Orubebe spoke at dusk. After night fell, Warri reached its full surreal power. Surrounded by towering oil company gas flares that lit the sky, the city itself, lacking electricity, sank into darkness. Candles flickered along narrow streets in the center of town, where the shadows of thousands of people darted in and out of traffic and engine fumes mingled with the smoke from roadside cooking fires and burning garbage. **********The obverse of Warri is Abuja, a city of new villas and wide traffic-free streets, where the building cranes in the sky point to the destination of the delta's oil money. Leaders from Sierra Leone to Congo to Angola have plundered Africa's riches, stashing the money away in Switzerland and erecting sprawling gated villas, where they live guarded by armed men. Nigeria has perhaps Africa's biggest villas. **********Whether its new leaders will really look beyond the villa gates remains unclear. **********At a forum this week to foster better relations between the executive and legislative branches, Mr. Obasanjo castigated lawmakers, accusing them of neglecting their duties and focusing on obtaining government contracts. The lawmakers shot back that they had rooted out corruption by removing the Senate leadership. **********Lynda Chuba Ikpeazu, 34, a congresswoman, accused Mr. Obasanjo of continually undermining the legislature so that he could enjoy a ''civilian dictatorship.'' **********Still, in these quarrels, Ms. Ikpeazu saw the noisy workings of a young democracy. In the halls of the new National Assembly building here and in Lagos's flourishing media, Nigerians are arguing, clamoring, challenging. ''One year can't do much,'' Ms. Ikpeazu said. ''The important thing is that we have laid the foundation.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/04/world/uri-gordon-65-dies-aided-israeli-newcomers.html": {"writer_name": "Eric Pace", "pub_date": "2000-08-04", "snippet": "Uri Gordon, Israeli official and Zionist leader who played important roles in resettlement of thousands of Ethiopian and Russian Jews in Israel in 1980's and 90's, dies at age 65 (M)", "word_count": 739, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Obituary; Biography", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Uri Gordon, 65, Dies; Aided Israeli Newcomers", "print_headline": "Uri Gordon, 65, Dies; Aided Israeli Newcomers", "body_text": " **********Uri Gordon, an Israeli official and Zionist leader who played important roles in the resettlement of thousands of Ethiopian and Russian Jews in Israel in the 1980's and 90's, died on Sunday in Israel. He was 65. **********He had suffered for months from a number of illnesses, said Deborah Lipson, a spokeswoman for the Jewish Agency, a quasi-governmental organization that oversees immigration to Israel, The Associated Press reported. **********The craggy-faced Mr. Gordon was long known as Mr. Aliya -- the Hebrew word that in this context means immigration by Jews to Israel. The Jerusalem Post recalled in 1998, when admirers gathered to pay tribute to him, that he had been behind the airlifts ''from the former Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Ethiopia, Yemen, Syria, Albania and elsewhere.'' **********David Sommer, a member of the World Zionist Organization's 20-member governing body and a member of the board of the Jewish Agency, said, ''In many ways he believed in applied Zionism,'' meaning ''to do anything possible to bring people to come to Israel.'' Mr. Sommer added: ''He always believed that the climax of Zionism is to live in Israel. He was involved in people's lives. He participated in the new immigrants' arrival.'' **********Mr. Gordon played a central role regarding immigration on behalf of the Jewish Agency after rising to prominence there in the 1970's. He was involved in the planning the airlifting of tens of thousands of Ethiopian Jews in 1984 and 1993. He also helped prepare for Israel to accommodate hundreds of thousands of Russian Jews after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. **********Mr. Gordon directed the Jewish Agency's immigration and absorption department and its youth aliya department. For part of his career, he was active in Labor Party work with young adults. **********In the 1970's, while he was representing the Jewish Agency in the United States, he founded an American youth organization, Telem, also known as the Movement for Zionist Fulfillment, which required its members to commit themselves to emigrate to Israel. **********Mr. Gordon's intensity was recalled by Avi Granot, an Israeli Embassy official in Washington. Mr. Granot described being in a Los Angeles hotel elevator with Mr. Gordon one day in 1980. Mr. Gordon was then a Jewish Agency emissary to the United States and Mr. Granot a consular official in New York. Both were involved in developing Telem. **********''With Uri, when he got to be talking about what should be done, he wouldn't stop,'' said Mr. Granot, who is also a former Israeli ambassador to Ethiopia, ''and we ended up spending over two hours in the elevator going up and down, down and up.'' They were discussing Zionism. **********The Soviet influx was complicated and difficult. From 1989 through late 1994, roughly 500,000 immigrants from the former Soviet Union had flooded into Israel, at a time when its total population was only about four million . **********By then, Israeli officials were acknowledging that an estimated one-third of the immigrants were distant descendants of Jews who did not consider themselves Jews and had non-Jewish spouses. **********These immigrants had been allowed in because of an amendment to a 1950 measure called the Law of Return. The law, which specified who could immigrate, was altered in 1970 to extend immigration rights to any person with a single grandparent who was Jewish, even if the connection to Judaism ended there. **********''The amendment to the Law of Return, which was meant to deal with a few exceptional cases, turned with time into an automatic entry ticket into Israel for non-Jews in numbers beyond acceptable proportion,'' Mr. Gordon said in October 1994. **********In January 1992, the flow of Soviet immigrants to Israel sank to its lowest level in almost two years, Israeli officials reported. Jewish Agency workers said the drop was caused by acute problems facing those already in Israel -- lack of jobs and adequate housing. These troubles were reported back to relatives and friends in the former Soviet Union. **********''The government has no answer to the question of employment,'' Mr. Gordon said at the time. ''Until now it hasn't formulated a national plan for absorption.'' **********Mr. Gordon was the author, with Menachem Michelson, of the 1998 book ''Zionism Is Not a Dirty Word.'' **********Uri Gordon was born in Tel Aviv and later contracted polio. ''He was a short person who had a hard time walking,'' Mr. Granot recalled, but added that because of his powerful personality, nothing stood in his way. **********During the 1960's, Mr. Gordon led Labor Party Zionist youth groups. **********He is survived by his wife and three daughters."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/25/business/world-business-briefing-asia-ntt-investigation.html": {"writer_name": "Stephanie Strom", "pub_date": "2000-10-25", "snippet": "Japanese Fair Trade Commission begins investigation into allegations that unit of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone has tried to prevent competitors from setting up lines for faster access to Internet; photo (M)", "word_count": 176, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "N.T.T.

The main routes are flooded. **********''The people affected are some of the poorest of the poor,'' he added. **********On Friday, the United States Defense Department announced that it would send emergency supplies to South Africa and Mozambique. The supplies, which will begin arriving on Monday, will include 140 tents, 6,900 blankets, 6,000 water cans and 160 rolls of plastic sheeting for emergency shelter. **********The United Nations World Food Program is delivering food to more than 100,000 people in Mozambique, which has borne the brunt of this month's flooding. An estimated 300,000 Mozambicans have lost their homes, farms and cattle to the floods. And earlier this week, the United Nations and the Mozambican government issued an urgent appeal for $65 million for relief work in the storm-ravaged country. **********''There are immediate needs for food, shelter and medicine,'' Ibrahim Gambari, the United Nations' special adviser for Southern Africa, said of Mozambique in a radio interview that was broadcast today. ''But at the same time, the international community has to pay attention to the tremendous damage to infrastructure.'' **********Mozambique, which turned its back on decades of war to build one of the world's fastest-growing economies, has nearly 200,000 acres of farmland flooded, 141 schools destroyed and already short-staffed hospitals and clinics struggling to cope with demand. **********''Health services in the affected areas are overwhelmed by the number of patients and are working beyond capacity,'' the United Nations said in its appeal for emergency assistance. ''Drug stocks are running out, and there is a serious shortage of health workers.'' Rescue efforts in the region have been hampered by power outages and flooded roads, which have made it difficult for government officials and relief workers to reach stricken areas. **********In South Africa, Mr. Mathiva said the towns of Messina, Louis Trichardt and Thohoyandou were accessible only by helicopter. And the bad weather forced two copters, one carrying corn meal, blankets and tents, to turn back without delivering the desperately needed supplies. **********In Zimbabwe, government officials told the United Nations that many people had been marooned by flood waters. Earlier this week, a bus was swept off a bridge into the Mudzi River, killing all its passengers. The storm, has killed at least 29 people in Zimbabwe and exacerbated its fuel shortage as rough seas have kept an oil tanker from docking in Mozambique's port city, Beira."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/05/business/military-contract-for-ge.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "2000-08-05", "snippet": "Lockheed Martin selects General Electric to provide engines for transport aircraft for Air Force; contract's value is up to $2.6 billion (S)", "word_count": 81, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Military Contract for G.E.", "print_headline": "Military Contract for G.E.", "body_text": " **********The Lockheed Martin Corporation said it had selected General Electric to provide engines for an updated version of its Galaxy transport aircraft for the Air Force, a contract that could be valued at up to $2.6 billion.

Those savings are said to ensure a sustained boost to asset prices for years to come. **********\"There are two aspects to baby-booming,\" said Elroy Dimson, a professor of finance at London Business School, summarizing the case made by proponents of the demographic argument. **********\"One is to do with the growth and fundamentals of the economy people have more money to spend, so there are bright ideas for services and products. The second is money for retirement, needing to save for the future.\" **********Their reasoning is somewhat problematic. The boomers, who are now in middle age, have reached their most productive years and have the paychecks to prove it, and this prosperity is reflected in economic and corporate performance. **********But the methods for valuing equities already take those factors into account; stocks remain extremely expensive even using the rosiest projections for profit growth and economic health. Many proponents argue that boomers will continue to buy stocks no matter how overpriced they become, just because they have the money for it. **********They may do that, consultants and academics who study demographics say, but there are enough other influences on investing that the effect of an aging population can all but evaporate. Furthermore, they point out, even under the most favorable circumstances the boomer boost will be undone by that which will undo the boomers and the rest of us: time. **********The first decade of this century is the one that investors will have to pin their hopes on, demographers say. After that the boomers will begin to retire and enjoy the fruits of their labors. It is then that the public and private financial landscape may begin to look ugly. **********\"The proportion of OECD populations eligible for public pensions will start to rise more quickly in about 10 years' time, but the proportion that contains the main contributors will shrink,\" according to a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. **********\"The passage of the large baby-boom cohorts through the high-saving stages of the life cycle will tend to boost the private saving rate, but it may subsequently drop as older people draw down accumulated assets.\" **********So as the boomers begin to cash in their chips, fewer workers will come along to take their place producing and saving wealth. **********In Europe, for example, where problems confronting state pension systems are most acute, there are four workers for each retiree, according to a report by the consultancy PricewaterhouseCoopers. **********That ratio will fall over the next 50 years to 2.4 workers per retiree in Britain, 2.3 in France, 2 in Germany and just 1.5 in Italy. Looking at the same phenomenon in a slightly different way, the percentage of Europeans over age 65 will rise from 16 today to 25 in 2030. That is expected to put stress not just on pension programs but on economies generally. **********\"The rapid aging of the European population over the next 30 years will, other things being equal, reduce the size of the labor force and so decrease trend economic growth rates and put severe strain on existing pay-as-you-go state pension schemes,\" the report warns. **********\"The strains will be particularly severe in countries such as Germany and Italy where state pensions are relatively high compared to average earnings at present and where previous pension reforms, in contrast to the U.K., have not fully defused the potential impact of the demographic time bomb on the public finances,\" the report said. **********But a report on the subject by Merrill Lynch & Co. credits Germany with making a substantive effort to introduce pensions that will allow, or maybe force, workers to invest more money for their retirement to supplement what is seen as an unsustainably generous state pension. France, on the other hand, is making slower progress, Merrill says. **********Efforts by governments to prod their citizens to help fund their own retirements are viewed as vital to pension reform. Economists, market analysts and, belatedly, governments generally conclude that particular encouragement should be given to owning equities, either directly or through funds, and this largely accounts for programs in many countries to privatize state industries and provide tax incentives for buying stocks. **********As stocks have outperformed other assets over long periods, the more savers invest in equities, the less the state may have to provide as pensions. The potential improvement in governments' fiscal circumstances should result in lower interest rates and thus give stocks a further lift. **********Mr. Dimson noted that stocks' stronger long-term performance reflects the greater risk inherent in owning them; by encouraging savers to load up on stocks, governments shift investment risk to their citizens, another reason they can afford to provide tax breaks on saving plans. **********\"The move toward equity funds is complex, but it has a lot to do with the decline in interest rates across Europe,\" Diana Mackay, a fund consultant, said. \"This has meant that banks must look beyond deposit accounts for profitability; they are therefore more interested than previously in selling more complex mutual fund products. At the same time, their clients are finding bank deposit and fixed-income returns unattractive. This, together with the fear that governments will not deliver pensions, is encouraging long-term savings.\" **********That encouragement will help produce a net inflow into European equities of dollars 7.3 trillion by 2010, according to a forecast by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, with mutual funds being the largest conduit. **********The aging of the boomer generation is one key reason for the anticipated demand, said Teun Draaisma, a Morgan Stanley equity strategist. Two others are interest rates that are expected to remain low and legislation foreseen to be more shareholder-friendly, relating to tax and to such factors as stock buybacks. **********A study by another brokerage, Salomon Smith Barney, also expects a surge in equity ownership over the coming decade, with demand far stronger in Europe than elsewhere. **********Mark Howdle, author of the study, predicted that enough money would be invested in European shares by 2009 to nearly triple their value, to dollars 20 trillion, and to increase their portion of world market capitalization from 32 percent to 42 percent. **********Researchers at the OECD also say that boomer-led investment is likely to pick up and say that investors will be rewarded in several ways. **********\"Growing flows of savings into retirement accounts should promote increased breadth and depth of financial markets and encourage the creation of more financial instruments, including better retirement products,\" they argue, adding that \"these developments can be expected to lead to more efficient allocation of resources and risks.\" **********But they go on to say that any gains could prove short-lived as the next decade dawns. **********\"Aging could in itself depress private and national savings rates in the longer term, thereby lowering future economic growth and the level of per-capita consumption,\" they warn. **********\"The historical average rates of returns to pension funds may not be appropriate for calculating expected future returns.\" **********Mr. Draaisma cautioned that even the torrent of boomer money due to be invested in the next few years will not guarantee powerful markets. **********\"While the correlation between equity market performance and strong mutual fund flows is a positive one, it should not be overestimated,\" he said. **********\"In the end it is fundamentals that matter. The favorable liquidity outlook is comforting, but it is not a reason on its own to buy equities,\" Mr. Draaisma added. **********[Not to be reproduced without the permission of the author.]"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/22/business/cooper-tire-may-become-focus-of-a-safety-investigation.html": {"writer_name": "David Barboza", "pub_date": "2000-09-22", "snippet": "Natioanl Highway Traffic Safety Administration is considering opening investigation of Cooper Tire and Rubber Co; agency head Dr Sue Bailey says her office has recently become aware of lawsuits asserting that dozens of deaths and serious injuries ...", "word_count": 961, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Cooper Tire May Become Focus of a Safety Investigation", "print_headline": "Cooper Tire May Become Focus of a Safety Investigation", "body_text": " **********Six weeks after it pressed Bridgestone/Firestone to recall 6.5 million tires, the nation's traffic safety agency said yesterday that it was considering opening an investigation of a second tire maker -- the Cooper Tire and Rubber Company. **********Dr. Sue Bailey, head of the agency, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said her office had recently become aware of lawsuits asserting that dozens of deaths and serious injuries had been caused by premature tread separations on tires made by Cooper, the world's fourth-largest tire maker. **********She said the agency was still examining data and had not decided whether to begin a formal inquiry, which could lead to a recall. **********A review of accident reports and court records by The New York Times shows that early tread separation in Cooper tires has been named as the cause of accidents that led to at least 35 deaths over the last six years. **********Although Cooper tires are sold as replacements on an array of passenger and light truck vehicles, the accident reports are strikingly similar to those in the Bridgestone/Firestone case, in which the safety agency says it has received complaints of about 100 deaths, most of them involving Ford Explorers. **********As in the Firestone case, nearly all the Cooper lawsuits involve a sport utility vehicle or light truck being driven along a highway in a hot-weather state at a high speed when the tread suddenly separates, causing the vehicle to veer out of control and then roll over. **********A spokeswoman at Cooper, based in Findlay, Ohio, released a written statement strongly denying that the company's tires were defective or unusually prone to deadly tread separations. **********The spokeswoman, Patricia J. Brown, said the company had made an exhaustive review of its claims and adjustment data over the last six years and had found no pattern that would suggest it was making defective tires. The company, which makes about 39 million tires a year, declined to release that data but said it would submit it to Congress or federal safety regulators if asked. **********The Ford and Firestone case has cast a harsh light on the safety agency's ability to identify troublesome patterns and spot problems in a timely fashion. Yesterday, Ms. Bailey said the emergence of a significant number of lawsuits involving fatalities with Cooper tires -- a fact unknown to the agency until recently -- underscores why Congress should give the agency the power to compel tire makers to send the agency information about safety-related lawsuits. **********''Unfortunately, the public often does not know to contact N.H.T.S.A, but we're going to correct that,'' Ms. Bailey said. ''This is the kind of information that could be essential to us.'' **********In the current climate of concern, regulators and consumer advocates are pressing tire makers to release internal data on tread separations and serious accidents, particularly those involving light trucks, mini-vans and sport utility vehicles. A number of studies have concluded those vehicles are more prone than smaller passenger cars to roll over after a tread separation occurs at highway speed. Just this week, a Senate committee passed a bill to establish criminal penalties for companies that fail to notify the government about safety defects that result in death or serious injury. **********While the Firestone case is the only one in which regulators say they have discerned a pattern of dangerous defects, nearly every major tire maker is facing lawsuits over crashes linked to tread separations. Not counting the Bridgestone/Firestone cases, lawsuits in the United States claim that at least 100 deaths and serious injuries have resulted from such tire failures, according to court records. A large majority of the cases, several of which have been settled out of court, involve minivans, sport utility vehicles and light trucks of nearly every make. **********But, given the weakness of the system for data collection and analysis, there is considerable debate over when a collection of cases coalesces into a safety problem. **********Though some consumer advocates say that premature tread separations should almost never occur under normal conditions and that tire makers could easily solve the problem by adding nylon caps over the steel belts, tire makers say that tires often do fail because of unusual stresses, punctures and underinflation. **********''We make 200 million tires a year and we're very comfortable with what our data suggests about the safety of the product,'' said Chuck Sinclair, a spokesman at the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company in Akron, Ohio. **********Other tire makers say similar things:, that tires regularly fail, that poor maintenance or road hazards often lead to failures and that they see no evidence of a troubling pattern. **********Cooper officials say the company has made more than 250 million tires since 1994 and few complaints have been filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. That agency said that it received just 26 complaints against Cooper in the last decade, although 10 of those were filed in the last year. **********''We have made a careful and thorough analysis and have found no correlation between our lawsuit cases and any type of vehicle such as S.U.V., minivans or light trucks,'' the company said yesterday in a written statement. ''We have no reason to recall any tire.'' **********Several lawsuits, however, assert that poor quality control at the company's plants, particularly the one in Tupelo, Miss., has resulted in defective tires that sometimes fall apart on larger vehicles. **********According to a group of lawyers who are independently pressing claims against Cooper, 11 deaths and at least 4 serious injuries were caused by poor manufacturing processes at the Tupelo plant. **********''I have not seen a Cooper design defect case like the current Firestone situation,'' said C. Tab Turner, a lawyer who recently won a $3.4 million judgment against Cooper in Mississippi. ''Cooper is more of a story about poor manufacturing practices, which results in sporadic bad tires on various lines of tires. Their process controls are horrendous.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/22/business/world-business-briefing-americas-moderate-inflation-in-canada.html": {"writer_name": "Timothy Pritchard", "pub_date": "2000-11-22", "snippet": "Canada's annual inflation rate rises 2.8 percent in October from 2.7 percent in September (S)", "word_count": 61, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MODERATE INFLATION IN CANADA", "print_headline": "WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: AMERICAS; MODERATE INFLATION IN CANADA", "body_text": " **********Driven mainly by higher prices for natural gas and fuel oil, Canada's annual inflation rate rose to 2.8 percent in October from 2.7 percent in September, less than analysts had forecast.

Putting a brave face on it, William H. Donaldson, chairman and chief executive since a management shake-up in February, hailed ''a turnaround opportunity'' to put Aetna's health care business ''on the right track.'' **********Under pressure from investors annoyed at its stock price, Aetna agreed on Thursday to sell its lucrative financial services and international business to the ING Group of Amsterdam for $5 billion in cash. Mr. Donaldson said the new, slimmed-down Aetna, still the nation's biggest health insurer, would ''redefine the company's business model.'' **********Almost half the 19.5 million Americans covered by Aetna are in strict health maintenance organizations, which generally save money by requiring patients to get permission from a primary care doctor before seeing a specialist or taking a test. **********But the market has changed. ''Our world is different than it was 10 years ago,'' said Dr. Michael A. Stocker, president and chief executive of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield. ''In a tight labor market, employees are not happy about more cost-sharing. This is a luxurious time for luxurious products.'' **********Low-cost H.M.O.'s were a big success for U.S. Healthcare, Aetna's core unit, into the early 1990's, when employers were shocked by sharply rising health costs and holding onto employees was not a big concern. **********But as the economy roared and health care inflation slowed in the mid-1990's, insurers like Cigna, the UnitedHealth Group and Wellpoint Health Networks and other Blue Cross companies catered to customers who demanded more choice of doctors and fewer restrictions. **********Managing health care ''clearly is changing into a much more complicated business that requires absolute focus on the fundamentals,'' said H. Edward Hanway, president and chief executive of Cigna. ''It is not any different for any of us.'' **********Slow to change, Aetna is now playing catch up, trying to remake itself as a kinder, gentler company that causes fewer hassles for consumers, doctors and hospitals. Mr. Donaldson said it would soon offer new types of health coverage to meet consumer demand for ''more flexibility and choice.'' **********The sale to ING came on the heels of an embarrassing warning by Aetna on Tuesday that it had fallen short of expected second-quarter earnings. The cause, it said, was higher-than-expected medical costs in its core H.M.O.'s. **********Analysts said the warning meant Aetna was not paying enough attention to the most important and difficult task in managed care: anticipating future costs and setting rates to cover bills that often do not show up until months later. **********Investors are slow to forgive slip-ups that undermine earnings. Aetna shares dropped 20 percent this week, closing at $57.25, even though the ING deal included a payout of $35 for each Aetna share plus one share of a new Aetna Inc. Analysts said other managed care companies did not share Aetna's special problems. But except for Wellpoint, health care stocks lost ground this week. **********Analysts said Aetna would have to raise its rates 13 to 14 percent next year, at a time when competitors may be raising premiums by only 10 percent. **********Mr. Donaldson added that the new, more flexible coverage would be priced accordingly, indicating that rates would be higher for the new types of coverage than for the company's more restrictive H.M.O.'s. **********''There is nothing wrong with being kinder and gentler,'' said Kenneth S. Abramowitz, a health care analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, ''but they must charge corporate America for that strategy.'' **********Setting up the problems Aetna faces now, Mr. Donaldson's predecessor as chairman and chief executive, Richard L. Huber, spent $11 billion on a three-year buying spree. He scooped up three big managed care companies: U.S. Healthcare in 1996, Nylcare and Prudential Health Care in 1998. Aetna is still working on having them integrated into its information systems and culture. **********The latest and most problematical deal was the purchase of Prudential Health, an enormous money-loser. Investors hope to learn early next month, when Aetna reports on second-quarter earnings, whether the Prudential unit is still on track to reach break-even this winter, despite its recent rising medical costs. **********Time is running out for a turnaround at Prudential because deal-sweetening post-purchase paybacks to Aetna from the seller, the Prudential Life Insurance Company of America, will end next year. **********The company says it will have more to say about Prudential and other murky questions, including its latest membership numbers, when it formally reports on earnings on Aug. 4. **********With the mergers, Aetna became the biggest health insurer in New York and New Jersey and among the top three in Pennsylvania, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Virginia, Ohio and Texas. When it bought Nylcare for $1.1 billion, it had so many Texas members that it was forced to sell health plans with 460,000 members to Texas Blue Cross and Blue Shield. Blue Cross paid $420 million for the plans. **********The health care roster included 676,000 people in Medicare H.M.O.'s, which will drop to 320,000 next year when it shuts Medicare health plans in 11 states. Mr. Donaldson has said some of the plans are ''egregiously'' unprofitable. Suggesting further shrinkage in the membership rolls, Mr. Donaldson also made it clear that Aetna plans to discontinue other unprofitable lines in some markets. **********The transformation of the company started in 1995, when Aetna Life and Casualty, as it was then called, sold its property and casualty business for $4.1 billion to Travelers and bought an H.M.O. company, U.S. Healthcare, for a price that, in hindsight, is widely deemed excessive. **********Some Wall Street analysts say the price, $9 billion, was as much as three times what the company was worth. ''They got taken,'' said Todd Richter, an analyst at Banc of America Securities. Leonard Abramson, the founder of U.S. Healthcare, ''got the best deal ever done in the history of deals,'' Mr. Richter said. **********Mr. Abramson, now 67, resigned from the Aetna board last month. Under the 1996 deal, he still gets $3 million a year as a consultant and is due $10 million more when that contract ends next summer. ''There were contracts for his relatives and employees, a $25 million airplane and gas money for the plane,'' Mr. Richter added. Mr. Abramson did not respond to requests for an interview. **********Joyce Oberdorf, a spokeswoman for Aetna, said the price paid for U.S. Healthcare was only ''a moderate premium'' above the H.M.O.'s stock. But analysts recall that managed care stocks soared after Aetna maladroitly said it was planning to buy an H.M.O. **********''U.S. Healthcare had what we were looking for,'' Ms. Oberdorf said, ''information systems expertise, management of the stronger forms of managed care, a strong presence in several key markets, and a model that could be replicated.'' **********But replicating the tightly disciplined U.S. Healthcare model infuriated many doctors who were used to the more relaxed ways of the old Aetna. The U.S. Healthcare team insisted that doctors accept low-paying H.M.O. customers or give up all their Aetna patients. Doctors were paid a flat monthly fee called capitation for H.M.O. members, which put them at risk when patients had expensive illnesses. **********Mr. Huber minced no words in confronting critics, and soon Aetna was fighting off lawsuits around the country. **********Without giving away the store, Mr. Donaldson has tried to repair relations with the public and physicians. He announced that capitation would be dropped in several states for individual doctors and small group practices, who would be paid with the traditional fees for service. **********Most senior officials from U.S. Healthcare who took over Aetna after the merger have since been pushed out. Aetna is seeking a new health care chief, no easy task considering the challenges. **********James H. Dickerson, now president of Caremark Rx Inc., a pharmacy managed care company, amused analysts with an all too realistic joke back in 1997, when he moved from U.S. Healthcare to Aetna as chief financial officer. **********As Mr. Dickerson told it, a new finance chief found three envelopes in his desk ''to be opened in time of trouble.'' As trouble arrived, he opened the first envelope and read, ''Blame your predecessor.'' The second message was ''Blame industry conditions.'' The third was ''Prepare three envelopes.'' **********The tale was timely for Mr. Dickerson. He was shown the door a few weeks later."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/16/business/a-change-that-fits-his-personal-needs.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Cowell", "pub_date": "2000-06-16", "snippet": "George Soros announces his new $6.5 billion Quantum Endowment Fund; says his Quantum Emerging Growth Fund will be merged with Quantum Fund on July 1 to create new fund; adds new fund will rely less on borrowed money than in the past; photo (M)", "word_count": 441, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Change That Fits His Personal Needs", "print_headline": "A Change That Fits His Personal Needs", "body_text": " **********Insisting that he plans to withdraw from hands-on management of his huge hedge funds that once swung the world's markets, George Soros said today that a $6.5 billion fund to be introduced next month would seek lower returns and be run in part by outside money managers. **********Mr. Soros, whose Quantum Fund has been hit by the resignations of top managers and a flight of investors' cash, told reporters here that his Quantum Emerging Growth Fund would be merged with the Quantum Fund on July 1 to create the Quantum Endowment Fund.

Investigators believe that the bomb that blew up Pan Am 103, killing 270 people, was in a brown plastic suitcase checked in as unaccompanied luggage in Malta. **********Mr. Hendershot said he remembered that Mr. Abdul Majid was ''very general'' about the date in his July 1991 interview, saying he had seen the suitcase sometime between October and December 1988. **********Mr. Abdul Majid later became more specific, claiming to remember the exact date and giving other details about the day. **********But when the defense began to cross-examine Mr. Hendershot, he became very vague about details of his own investigation. He even answered that he did not remember whether one suspect he tried to interview had spit in his face. **********Presented with the chance to question Mr. Hendershot, the defense had shifted the ground away from the Libyans. Its own theory is that Pan Am 103 was blown up by a Palestinian terrorist cell based in Germany working with another in Sweden. Scottish investigators have said the German group was their prime suspects for many months, until attention shifted to the Libyans. **********The defense lawyers, William Taylor and Richard Keen, asked Mr. Hendershot about a trip he took to Sweden in 1989 to investigate the Palestinian group led by Muhammad Abu Talb, who was in prison there for other bombings. He confirmed that he had asked the Swedish police to get a warrant to search Mr. Talb's apartment. **********But he repeatedly answered ''I don't recall'' to questions about the apartment's contents: whether it contained disassembled clocks and watches and barometric devices -- all potential bomb triggers; whether it contained clothing made in Malta,  as clothing wrapped around the Lockerbie bomb was; whether it contained a calendar with a circle around the date of the bombing, Dec. 21, 1988. **********Mr. Keen was openly skeptical about Mr. Hendershot's vague recollection and his contention that he had not taken any notes during the search. **********''Isn't that unusual,'' Mr. Keen asked imperiously, ''for an F.B.I. agent to attend a search and not take notes?'' **********Mr. Hendershot replied that notes might not be taken when the search was in a foreign country. **********That followed an even rougher exchange with Mr. Taylor, the other defense lawyer, who expressed disdain that Mr. Hendershot could not remember whether Mr. Talb had spit on him. **********''Would you look at your notes please overnight and come see me tomorrow?'' Mr. Taylor asked. **********He later told the court that he would not recall the agent to the stand, ''as I can get the information I need from other witnesses.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/08/business/credit-offerings-planned-during-the-week.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-05-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 285, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Credit Offerings Planned During the Week", "print_headline": "Credit Offerings Planned During the Week", "body_text": " **********The Treasury's schedule of financing this week includes today's regular weekly auction of new three-  and six-month bills and five-year and 10-year notes being auctioned tomorrow and Wednesday. **********According to traders, at the close of the New York cash market on Friday the rate on the outstanding three-month bill was 5.78 percent and on the six-month issue, 6.01 percent.

After G.M. won the right to build Buicks in Shanghai, officials started talking instead about shutting manufacturers down. China has more than 100 car manufacturers, including those that assemble cars using kits imported from abroad. **********But China fears that without an expanded domestic car manufacturing base, imports could quickly dominate the growing market after the country joins the W.T.O. So the government is relaxing its grip on the industry, allowing car companies rather than officials in Beijing to decide what the market can bear. **********Honda was allowed to buy a defunct Peugeot joint venture in Guangdong province, in the south, several years ago, and earlier this year Toyota signed a deal to make passenger cars in the city of Tianjin, in the northeast. Car companies have also been allowed to set their own prices again; after a price war in the late 90's, officials had stopped the industry from cutting prices further . The Chinese joint ventures of Citroen, Volkswagen and General Motors have all reduced prices on their cars in the last few months. **********While China's automobile sales growth has been sluggish in recent years and the market has fallen far short of the ebullient estimates made in the mid-90's, no one doubts that the country will eventually become a major auto market. The cities are already choked with cars, but the country's eastern region is crisscrossed with new highways, most of them largely empty of vehicles. And a campaign to develop the long-neglected western region includes plans to build more roads there. **********Already, manufacturers like G.M. are reporting an unexpected surge in the number of private car buyers. And small, affordable cars, like the boxy Suzuki Alto already made by Changan, are the fastest-growing segment of the market. **********In June, Beijing finally gave Ford the go-ahead to negotiate a joint venture. ''Changan and Ford are now in negotiations trying to formalize details and prepare the proper documents required to put the proposal to the government for a final approval,'' said Kenneth Hsu, a Ford spokesman in China. **********Mr. Hsu declined to talk about what kind of car might be built or how large the venture might be, but auto analysts suggest that Ford is considering a version of its Ikon, a compact four-door sedan that the company created for the Indian market. The car would be larger than Changan's Alto but still in a price range that would put it in reach of China's new private car buyers. **********Ford currently has six Chinese joint ventures producing auto parts and offering after-sales service. It also has a 30 percent stake in the Jiangling Motors Corporation, which makes the Ford Transit, a light commercial van. **********Ford is not the only maker contemplating a small car. Toyota's joint venture in Tianjin will produce one. And because China has relaxed restrictions on new models by joint ventures, Volkswagen is expected to soon introduce a small car at its Shanghai venture. General Motors has studied building a version of the Opel Corsa at its Shanghai plant. The company has so far declined to comment on reports suggesting that it may introduce a small-car model as early as this year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/17/business/after-weekend-lull-investors-wait-for-other-shoe.html": {"writer_name": "Alex Berenson", "pub_date": "2000-04-17", "snippet": "Investors large and small are nervously wondering if selling that tore through United States stocks last week will resume when markets reopen; securities firms and many investors prepare for reopening, which promises to be volatile; investment ban...", "word_count": 828, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "After Weekend Lull, Investors Wait for Other Shoe", "print_headline": "After Weekend Lull, Investors Wait for Other Shoe", "body_text": " **********Investors large and small looked ahead over the weekend, nervously wondering if the selling that tore through United States stocks last week will resume when the markets reopen this morning. **********With markets closed, Wall Street only appeared quiet Saturday and yesterday. But behind the scenes, securities firms and many investors were making preparations for today, which at the least promises to be volatile. Investment bankers said that mergers and initial public offerings are likely to be put on hold until the market settles down. Already, dozens of initial offerings have been canceled or postponed, including one for the AltaVista Internet portal. **********Big mutual fund companies like Fidelity Investments mobilized employees to handle an expected surge in telephone calls from nervous investors. Money managers found themselves in their offices yesterday, talking to clients and considering whether to take advantage of last week's plunge to buy shares -- or preserve their remaining gains by selling more of their portfolios. In Silicon Valley, home to many of the New Economy stocks that have suffered the biggest declines, investors and technology company employees largely shrugged off their losses as to be expected in their volatile sector. **********Indeed, outright panic was hard to find over the weekend, except among the minority of investors who have bought stocks with borrowed money and are facing margin calls, or demands from their brokers that they put more cash into their accounts as collateral. **********But if hysteria was scarce, so was optimism about a quick turnaround. Many conservative investors still think that technology stocks are too expensive, and more aggressive investors are reeling from their enormous losses in the last month. **********Frederic E. Rowe, a general partner in Greenbrier Partners, a money management firm in Dallas, said from his office yesterday that he was there ''licking his wounds.'' Mr. Rowe, a value-oriented investor, said his conservative posture had helped him on Friday, when his portfolio fell less than the 5.8 percent drop posted by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Still, like many investors, Mr. Rowe said the speed and ferocity of the plunge had left him stunned. **********''It happened so fast,'' he said. Instead of acting abruptly on today, Mr. Rowe said, he planned to ''just sit there there and hold my breath.'' **********Mark Rowland, an Atlanta money manager who has avoided buying the new technology names that led the Nasdaq market up last year and are leading it down this month, said that the that market remains expensive, despite its huge decline. ''We used to sell dollar bills for $2,'' Mr. Rowland said. ''Now we've cut the price to $1.50. An elevator dropping from the 100th floor to the 50th floor is not the bargain basement.'' **********Like many cautious investors, Mr. Rowland said the Nasdaq sell-off was an important lesson for inexperienced investors whose aggressive bets on technology have been rewarded over the last couple of years. They are finally learning that stocks can drop as well as rise, he said. **********''The stock market is an expensive place to go to grad school,'' Mr. Rowland said. ''For the ready-fire-aim crowd, they need to do a little homework.'' **********About the only Wall Street types who were working less than usual this weekend were investment bankers, who suddenly find few buyers for the companies whose shares they underwrite, or sell to the public. Their merger work has also faded, with many corporate executives reluctant to do deals when their share prices are swinging wildly. **********Deal makers who would usually be working spent the weekend playing golf, at church services celebrating Palm Sunday, or soothing clients by telephone. But most bankers were  saying that the merger pace will not slow dramatically unless the sell-off continues. **********''There are certain sectors that will be disrupted but, in general, we are looking to the overall, real economy,'' Steve Munger, co-head of global mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said. And while the downdraft in Internet stock values has to be dealt with, he added, ''it's not like it was unanticipated.'' **********A rapidly declining market can also cause deals that have already been struck to unravel. But few blockbuster deals are pending, and the most notable of this year, January's announced combination of America Online and Time Warner, seems immune to market turmoil. One deal that could hit snags if the stock prices fall further and stay down is MCI/WorldCom's announced acquisition of Sprint, traders said. **********Meanwhile, some money-losing Internet companies are already concerned that they may have difficultly lining up new investments, bankers said. Several companies, have called venture capitalists in search of new capital -- including eToys, according to a person close to that company. **********Larger companies that do have spare cash are meanwhile deciding whether to buy or invest in the Internet companies whose shares have fallen. But few are likely to rush in  today, opting instead to see if prices of Internet companies fall further. Traditional retailers, for instance, have already embarked on plans to build their own Internet sites, and have less need to acquire fledgling Web retailers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/16/world/vatican-and-plo-sign-pact-guaranteeing-the-church-s-rights.html": {"writer_name": "Alessandra Stanley", "pub_date": "2000-02-16", "snippet": "Vatican, seeking to secure rights of Roman Catholic Church in future Palestinian state, signs agreement with Palestine Liberation Organization that will protect freedom of religion and legal status of Christian churches; document is signed by Pale...", "word_count": 525, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Vatican and P.L.O.

And it states that ''unilateral decisions and actions altering the specific character and status of Jerusalem are morally and legally unacceptable,'' addressing one of the most sensitive issues between Israel and the Palestinians. **********The document was signed by the Palestinian and church representatives shortly before Pope John Paul II met with Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, in the Vatican. **********The pope, who plans a pilgrimage to holy sites in Israel and Palestinian-controlled territories in late March, today accepted an invitation from Mr. Arafat to add Jericho to his schedule. That city, like Bethlehem, is under Palestinian control. **********It was Mr. Arafat's ninth visit with the pope, who has never concealed his sympathy for the Palestinian cause. ''John Paul II once again expressed the solidarity of the Holy See for the Palestinian people, who are still waiting to see their legitimate aspirations realized,'' the Vatican spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, said after the meeting. **********The pope will also visit Jerusalem in March.

The Israeli government, which views Jerusalem as its indivisible capital, has ignored such calls. **********The wording in today's document on that issue reads like a reproach to Israel and a reaffirmation of the Vatican's support for a Palestinian state.

The statement said the agreement was a regrettable intervention in the talks between Israel and the Palestinians. **********Church experts say Israel forced the Vatican's hand by making no provisions to safeguard church property and rights when it turned over land to Palestinian control. **********And the Vatican, which established formal diplomatic ties with Israel in 1993, was alarmed and infuriated by a recent Israeli decision to allow Muslim leaders in Nazareth to build a mosque next to the Basilica of the Annunciation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/30/business/company-news-gillette-to-make-new-electric-toothbrushes.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "2000-11-30", "snippet": "Gillette Co will introduce line of three new electric toothbrushes in 2001 (S)", "word_count": 81, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GILLETTE TO MAKE NEW ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSHES", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; GILLETTE TO MAKE NEW ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSHES", "body_text": " **********The Gillette Company said yesterday that it would introduce a line of three Braun Oral-B electric toothbrushes next year and would spend $100 million to market them during their first 12 months.

His wife in South Korea committed suicide. **********The case of Mr. Ko, who South Korean authorities say was abducted in 1990 when he confused the North Korean Embassy in Oslo, Norway, with that of South Korea, is one of hundreds that South Koreans are pursuing in hopes that all such people will have the option of coming home. **********While President Kim Dae Jung has said that the \"humanitarian\" matter of those held in the North can be resolved, critics charge that he is reluctant to press it for fear of altering the mood of rapprochement reached at his June summit meeting in Pyongyang with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il. **********The pressure for demanding return of the South Korean prisoners intensified Tuesday as South Korean negotiators arrived in Pyongyang for two rounds of critical negotiations and as 63 North Koreans held for years as spies in South Korean prisons prepared to go home Saturday. **********The South Korean unification minister, Park Jae Kyu, predicted \"fruitful results,\" but an aide said he preferred to \"avoid\" questions from South Koreans about \"the abductees\" \u2014 454 South Koreans forcibly taken to the North since 1955 \u2014 as well as 25,000 soldiers held there since the Korean War. **********Instead, Mr. Park and the chief North Korean delegate, Jon Kum Jin, were expected to focus on what are officially seen in Seoul as much more pressing issues. One top priority is to broaden this month's brief visits by 100 North Koreans to the South and 100 South Koreans to the North to include visits by several million family members divided by the war. **********As they look back on the highly publicized family visits, however, many South Koreans question whether North Korea is likely to agree to more than token exchanges \u2014 and believe Mr. Kim agreed too quickly to return the North Korean prisoners. **********The opposition Grand National Party, a powerful force that controlled the government before Mr. Kim's election in 1997, has seized upon the issue of the \"forgotten\" South Koreans held in the North as an opportunity to rally support against Mr. Kim and his allies. **********\"It doesn't stand to reason that the government should ignore these people while sending all these spies back,\" said Jeon Jae Wook, a spokesman for the Grand National Party. \"The government's foot-dragging is in stark contrast with North Korea's persistent demand to get back the Communist prisoners in the South.\" **********Observers believe, however, that the government here will soon have to take a stand in defense of its own citizens. **********\"There is such strong public pressure, they are compelled to press this issue,\" said Jang Song Hyon, a longtime consultant in Seoul. **********Mr. Kim's predecessor, Kim Young Sam, charged last week that the president was following the dictates of Kim Jong Il, yielding on key negotiating points. He demanded that the North \"apologize\" for invading the South in 1950 and for \"terrorist acts,\" including assassination plots and the midair bombing of a Korean Air plane over the Indian Ocean in 1987. **********Kim Dae Jung, pursuing rapprochement with the North ever since he narrowly defeated the candidate of Kim Young Sam's party, has avoided rhetoric that he and his advisers believe would serve no purpose other than to reverse whatever progress is made at the summit meeting. **********The issue is complicated by pressure to find out the fate of South Korean soldiers who never returned after the Korean War. A South Korean prisoner of war who escaped from North Korea reported that thousands of POWs were working in mines near the Yalu River frontier. **********Almost all, however, are believed to have been issued North Korean identification cards. **********\"Our Ministry of Unification has said legally they are North Korean and there is no 'unreturned' prisoner of war,\" said the Reverend Yoon Hyun, representative of the Citizens Alliance to Help Political Prisoners in North Korea. \"The same applies to many who were abducted.

In particular, critics complain that economic policies favoring profits over social solidarity have created a society of extreme inequality, where guns are rife and the poor are turned away from hospitals. **********It is true that U.S. social priorities are different. America, it has been said, is a society of opportunity, not of guarantee, while in some European countries it is the other way around. **********Much of the criticism is caricature. Poor people are not dying in the streets, and many social indicators, such as the crime rate and teenage births, have recently shown big improvements.

For the simple fact is that their objectives \u2014 Third World development and environmental protection \u2014 require the generation of wealth, and the despised, trade-promoting \"orthodox\" approach has shown itself the most efficient means of creating wealth, and jobs, in human history. **********One of the reasons for America's global dominance is that it is the only continental-scale economy in which these principles have been given free rein. Europe is now trying to follow suit to catch up with the United States, as are reformers in Japan. **********U.S. success is also due to the fact that American talents and characteristics are especially well suited to benefit from today's globalization. In a world that craves entertainment and constant technological innovation, Americans' individualism, creativity and marketing skills give them a keen edge. **********It is true that Americans have always had a \"civilizing mission\" to export their ideas and values.

The Microsoft Network, the group of Web sites and services which Belluzzo heads, is seen as a kind of testbed for new .NET products. **********Muglia's new group will be responsible for building different kinds of user interfaces with graphics and voice recognition, as well as underlying technologies that the company's other divisions and corporate partners will use to build .NET services. **********\"There's a lot more to .NET than just my division,\" said Muglia, who will have at least 2,000 people working for him. \"We will work closely with people across the company.\" **********Jeff Raikes, Microsoft's top salesman and a group vice president, will take over for Muglia as head of the traditional Office division.

The companies hope to provide one-stop shopping for banking and investment products for so-called mass affluent consumers, individuals and families with investment funds of $100,000 to $500,000 **********\"It's one of those rare times where it makes infinite sense, where you're leveraging each other's respective strengths,\" said Steven Galbraith, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein in New York. **********The deal represents a dramatic turnaround for Merrill, which only last year was criticized for lacking an Internet strategy and lagging behind the strong growth of companies like the discount broker Charles Schwab & Co. But Merrill has gone outside the firm to bring in fresh expertise, including hiring James Gorman, a former partner at the consulting firm McKinsey & Co., as head of marketing, and the deal with HSBC indicates that the new blood is helping to reshape the firm. **********\"Merrill finally gets it,\" Mr. Galbraith said. \"These are younger people who think outside the box.\" **********HSBC, meanwhile, has moved aggressively to bolster its fund management and private banking business, which provide a relatively rich and stable source of fee income. The bank agreed to buy Credit Commercial de France last month for $10.5 billion, and it bought Republic New York for $10 billion last year. **********The two firms see a booming market for investment products as a U.S.-style equity culture spreads across Europe and Asia, fueled by growing numbers of affluent, middle-aged consumers who increasingly rely on private savings rather than underfunded government pensions for their retirement. Merrill and HSBC estimate that the number of online brokerage accounts outside the United States will surge to about 50 million in 2004 from 10 million today. In Europe alone, the number of accounts is expected to grow by 60 percent a year, to 14 million in 2004. **********The deal excludes the United States, where Merrill has some 6 million customers and HSBC has built a sizable banking business around the former Marine Midland bank. **********Executives at HSBC and Merrill said they had deliberately ruled out a merger when they started discussions on the venture in January. Sir John Bond, chairman of HSBC, said the problems of combining HSBC's commercial banking culture with Merrill's investment bank was too daunting. **********\"We're going into this to build a business that doesn't exist today,\" David Komansky, Merrill's chairman and chief executive, said. \"That's the focus.\" But with consolidation racing ahead in financial services, both men acknowledged that \"you can never say never\" about a possible merger. The deal certainly sets the two up for deeper cooperation down the road, and throws down a challenge to other competitors, such as Deutsche Bank AG, Citigroup Inc. and Charles Schwab, that are seeking to build a global retail investment business. **********Shares in Merrill, which reported a 71 percent surge in first-quarter earnings Monday, closed up $9.75 at $100 in New York.

Several new sites, like AccentCare.com and CareThere.com, help families do that and even keep daily or weekly track of the care their relatives are receiving. **********AccentCare.com, of Irvine, Calif., started a Web site in May that helps consumers determine the appropriate care through an online questionnaire about the relative's  medical history, independence in daily activities and mental state. The company offers services only to California and Arizona residents but is forming affiliate agreements with agencies in other states. (The agencies will be listed on the Web site.) If it is determined that the relative can remain at home, AccentCare refers California and Arizona residents to care providers from its own 13 branches or an affiliate agency. **********Although AccentCare does not refer registered nurses, it offers services like grocery shopping, coordinating of doctor visits and keeping track of the client's medication. It's possible to arrange the care online, but most people choose to call a care manager to talk about obtaining references and scheduling hours. **********Once care is arranged, AccentCare sends updates to family members from reports filled out by the care provider. **********''AccentCare is unique in that they own the brick-and-mortar centers,'' said Rachel Terrace, an analyst at Jupiter Communications in New York. ''But the challenge will be maintaining quality control of their staff as they expand into other states.'' AccentCare has 1,300 employees. **********Caryn Jacoby, a sales executive in New York, has hired several AccentCare employees to take care of her mother, who lives in San Francisco and has Alzheimer's disease. (In June, AccentCare acquired the Tammy DeCarlo Agency in San Francisco, the agency Ms. Jacoby had been using since 1997.) **********Ms. Jacoby said she usually talked to her mother once a day and was setting up a family page with AccentCare to keep in touch with the care provider. ''I can't talk to the caregiver without her thinking something is wrong,'' Ms. Jacoby said, ''so this is a way of finding out what's going on directly.'' **********Ms. Jacoby said that because she was often out of the office for many hours each day, staying in contact with the care provider via e-mail would also make her life easier. ''The fact that I can e-mail someone with a question and have it returned that day is wonderful,'' she said. ''I'll be able to do it from home and from work.'' **********Kenneth Kleinberg, a health analyst with the Gartner Group, based in Stamford, Conn., said wireless communications would further help care providers stay in contact with their agency and relatives of their client. ''There's a huge boon to the caregiver with wireless devices, and it's long in coming,'' he said. ''Handheld devices will let them check in on the spot.'' **********But the concept of families keeping tabs on the care their parent's receive, even if they live across the country, will have to be backed by service agreements, Mr. Kleinberg added. ''It should be understood that the caregiver will read an e-mail within a few hours, not after a few days,'' he said. **********AccentCare is also talking with companies that keep electronic medical records about involving doctors in online communications, said Joe Davis, president of AccentCare. The family member viewing updates from the caregiver on his page, for example, could also receive updates from doctors after visits. ''The capability is there, but for whatever privacy or liability reasons, the medical community has so far been slow to adopt,'' Mr. Davis said. **********CareThere.com, a site based in Mountainview, Calif., started in July and offers decision-making help in the form of legal and financial information, and forums where people can exchange information and advice. CareThere offers lists of specific resources, as AccentCare does, but it doesn't own any of the care agencies it lists. **********Dr. George Savage, president and chief executive of CareThere, said the site was designed to let relatives of patients rate the care being given. Elder-care agencies will be able to display their quality ratings in CareThere's directory. **********''The caregiving industry is so fragmented,'' Dr. Savage said, ''and there's such an imbalance with demand and supply that people who aren't that good go from job to job making the same money. This will be a good way to rate individual caregivers.'' **********Dr. Savage said CareThere also serves as a place for care agencies to send e-mail updates to families. ''In the past, it's been nearly impossible to get feedback from an agency because it's so labor intensive,'' he said. ''Now, as the agency types in a report, part of that can be sent as an e-mail message to the family.'' **********Companies like AccentCare that refer care providers from businesses they own or from affiliates might exclude other resources available to consumers, said Kathleen Kelly, executive director of the Family Caregiver Alliance, a nonprofit group in San Francisco that publishes a directory of care resources available in California. ''My observation is that most of the caregiver sites that are trying to create a large-scale national database don't always include state-funded or community-based programs,'' she said. ''They're a good starting place, but they won't meet the needs of everyone.'' **********Such sites should not be the sole resource for finding support, said Suzanne Mintz, president and co-founder of the National Family Caregiver's Association, a nonprofit organization in Kensington, Md. ''Once you get the name of a company, you still need to get references and ask questions about your own particular needs,'' she said. **********At the very least, Ms. Mintz said, the decision-making tools on sites like CareThere and AccentCare help people to think about what kind of care their parents need or may need in the future. **********''People are beginning to understand that at some point, elder care is going to be part of their family's life,'' she said. ''The caregiver sites help you think about planning ahead.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/04/business/novartis-ended-use-of-gene-altered-foods.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "2000-08-04", "snippet": "Novartis AG, one of world's leading agricultural biotechnology companies, acknowledges that it has eliminated genetically engineered ingredients from all of its food products; policy is disclosed in letter to environmental group Greenpeace (S)", "word_count": 523, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Novartis Ended Use of Gene-Altered Foods", "print_headline": "Novartis Ended Use of Gene-Altered Foods", "body_text": " **********Novartis A.G., one of the world's leading agricultural biotechnology companies, acknowledged yesterday that it had eliminated genetically engineered ingredients from all of its food products. **********The policy was disclosed in a letter sent by a company official to the environmental group Greenpeace and later confirmed by the company. Novartis, which makes Ovaltine, Gerber baby foods, Wasa crackers and various health foods, said in the letter that it had basically achieved its goal by June 30. **********Novartis is the first big food company to eliminate genetically modified ingredients from all its foods worldwide, Greenpeace said. Various companies, such as Frito-Lay and McDonald's, are dropping genetically modified corn or potatoes from some of their food in the United States. And many companies are eliminating them in food sold in Europe, where consumer resistance to such products is particularly strong. **********The move could put Novartis in a delicate spot because its agricultural division continues to sell genetically modified seeds, particularly corn seeds with bacterial genes that allow the corn plant to produce a toxin that kills the corn borer. Novartis is a member of a coalition of agricultural biotechnology companies that is spending $50 million to defend the safety of such crops. **********''It will be interesting to see what they are going to be telling farmers now when they're selling biotech seeds,'' said Charles Margulis, the leader of Greenpeace's American campaign against such foods. **********Novartis said last year that it would eliminate genetically modified ingredients from Gerber baby food, not because it had any doubt about the safety of the genetically engineered crops but because buyers seemed to be wary of them. But it had not been known that Novartis was going to take the same steps for its other foods, as well. **********The company said yesterday that its food division, Novartis Consumer Health, had always intended to make this move, so that Greenpeace's announcement was not new. ''For the past year,'' the company said in a statement from its Swiss headquarters, ''Novartis Consumer Health, in light of consumer sentiment toward genetically modified organisms, has taken practical steps to avoid the use of G.M.O. in its nutrition products throughout the world, taking account of local supply options and regulatory requirements.'' **********Mr. Margulis of Greenpeace said the Novartis decision would put pressure on other food companies. **********But Gene Grabowski, a spokesman for the Grocery Manufacturers of America, which represents brand-name food companies, said the Novartis move would have no effect because the company is not a big a food supplier in this country. ''We're talking about a minuscule amount of food,'' he said. ''Greenpeace has taken the letter and trumpeted it as if this is a big announcement.'' **********Novartis's annual food sales in the United States total $1.2 billion, Mr. Grabowski said. More than half of that is in Gerber products, and much of the rest is in special diet food. So the only food affected by the policy with significant sales in the United States to the broad category of consumers is Ovaltine, he said. **********Novartis, principally a pharmaceutical company, plans to merge its agricultural business with that of AstraZeneca of Britain. The combined business will then be spun off into a new company called Syngenta."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/27/technology/l-radio-interference-399906.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-07-27", "snippet": "G Chris Boynton letter on July 20 article on electronic fences for dogs", "word_count": 96, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Radio Interference", "print_headline": "Radio Interference", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********In ''A Dog's Life: Hidden Fences With a Bite Help Keep Rover Home'' (July 20), you point out the problem to strangers approaching the yard.

But he finds himself at the center of a storm over landmark legislation to normalize trade relations with China. **********As one of about 40 undecided House Democrats who will probably control the bill's fate next month, Mr. Phelps is being pulled in opposite directions by the diverse constituency in his sprawling district. **********Corn and soybean farmers hit hard by plunging prices, as well as international agribusiness giants like Caterpillar and Archer Daniels Midland, are urging him to vote yes to help open rich new Chinese markets to American goods. **********But longtime labor allies who work in the district's factories are lobbying hard against the deal, an important step in China's expected entry into the World Trade Organization, saying it would cost hundreds of union jobs here in southern Illinois and reward a repressive Communist government that has cheated on other trade pacts. **********''I've tried to do my homework, but it's just not that easy,'' Mr. Phelps told a group of labor, farm and business leaders here. ''Human rights and environmental concerns are at the top of my list, but I don't want to look back on my first term and feel I hurt the country's prosperity.'' **********Mr. Phelps's silence on how he will vote has catapulted him into a limelight he has not enjoyed since his days as a professional gospel singer and writer of tunes that the Oak Ridge Boys recorded. **********During the last several weeks, labor and business have come calling to Washington and to his seven offices in a district that is one of the largest east of the Mississippi River, stretching more than 200 miles, from the blue-collar city of Decatur in the north to the oil and coal fields of the south, hard by the Kentucky border. **********Teamsters, steelworkers, boilermakers and Chinese human rights advocates have trooped in. (''It seems like there have been hundreds of them,'' he sighed.) Mr. Phelps paid a two-hour visit to the White House to hear President Clinton's pitch for the deal. On Monday, Mr. Phelps and other lawmakers will join Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman on a visit to China to get a firsthand look. It will be his first trip outside the United States. **********''He's got a district that's really tough to balance,'' said Commerce Secretary William Daley, Mr. Clinton's point man on the measure, who recently dropped by Mr. Phelps's Washington office to talk trade. ''It's a microcosm of some of difficulties of trade in the new world economy.'' **********Mr. Phelps, a conservative 52-year-old former Illinois state legislator who opposes abortion and gun control, has been careful not to tip his hand, even to political friends. **********''He's clearly agonizing over this decision,'' said Margaret Blackshere, president of the Illinois A.F.L.-C.I.O., who met with Mr. Phelps last week and considers him a stalwart union supporter worthy of his 89 percent record of voting with labor last year. **********Mr. Phelps is not the only wavering Democrat under political siege at home. **********With the House in a two-week recess and members back in their districts for the last long period before the crucial vote, supporters on both sides are waging an all-out grass-roots war on the airwaves and in rallies and town meetings to pull the fence-sitters their way. **********The Business Roundtable, a major business group, has opened a $4 million national television, radio and print advertising campaign, centered on 50 Congressional districts, including those of Mr. Phelps and other undecided House Democrats like Max Sandlin of Texas, Bud Cramer of Alabama and Tom Allen of Maine. **********The group has also developed ads promoting the benefits to American agriculture, business and high-tech companies, as well as to national security. ''This recess is absolutely critical for solidifying a number of members and putting us over the top,'' said Johanna Schneider, a spokeswoman for the Business Roundtable. **********At the same time, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. on Tuesday will begin focusing on 14 wavering Democrats with its own ad blitz featuring footage of forced Chinese prison laborers and workers toiling in sweatshops. A coalition of labor, environmental and human rights groups is also staging rallies and conducting bus tours through Texas, Florida and the Northeast. **********The arithmetic of the vote explains why suddenly everyone cares what Mr. Phelps thinks about China. About 150 Republicans are expected to favor the measure when it comes up for a vote the week of May 22, leaving Democratic supporters to scrape up the rest to reach the 218 needed for passage. Both sides say the outcome is too close to call. Senate approval is considered certain. **********The problem for Mr. Phelps and his uncommitted colleagues is whether to surrender Congress's annual review of China's trade status, and its leverage over Beijing's behavior on human rights and worker standards, and give China the same trading privileges the United States grants virtually every other nation. **********The decision this week by the House Democratic leader, Richard A. Gephardt, to vote against the measure weighed heavily on Mr. Phelps. ''I won't deny that it has an influence on me, coming from someone of his stature who hopefully will be my next speaker,'' he said. **********At the meeting of labor and farm leaders that Mr. Phelps arranged here, 210 miles south of Chicago, he got an earful from both camps, which sparred from opposite sides of a rectangular table in the town board room. **********Opponents assailed China's human rights records and Beijing's dubious record on previous pacts on matters ranging from textiles to intellectual property. Many said they still felt betrayed by the North American Free Trade Agreement of 1993, another trade accord the administration championed. **********''Everyone watched on TV when China massacred its own students,'' said Mike Shampine, president of the Decatur Trades and Labor Council, a group of 44 trade unions, referring to the crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in 1989. ''China has violated every agreement it ever had with us.'' **********Supporters listed the economic benefits of passage: Tariffs on beef would drop to 12 percent from 45 percent; on poultry, to 10 percent from 20 percent. Hog farmers said  pork demand would increase by $3 million a year. **********And they also answered the human rights criticism. ''We're all horrified by what happened at Tiananmen Square,'' said Julie Moore, president of the Chamber of Commerce for Decatur and Macon County. ''But we have a better chance of helping the Chinese people if we are there.'' **********Passionate personal pleas spilled from speakers. Olin Clayton, 49, a steelworker from Raymond, Ill., recounted that glass and rubber factories where he once worked had closed, the jobs shipped off-shore. ''We're not building a better future here,'' Mr. Clayton said. ''We're not living the American dream.'' **********But Harry Fehrenbacher, 52, a fifth-generation hog farmer from Newton, Ill., said that without the bill's passage and expanded trade with China, small family farms like his could fall victim to the harsh economic realities of globalization. **********''It'll be a slow death,'' Mr. Fehrenbacher said.

Within weeks, Register stock soared from $24 to $116, giving the fledging company a market capitalization of $5 billion. **********It has been downhill from there. First, Internet fever broke. As the Nasdaq plunged, Register shares fell to $30 by mid-June, wiping almost $4 billion off the company's valuation. The shares bounced around the $30's for about a month, until Register's management decided to offer an additional four million shares to investors. Making matters worse, the company was selling only 500,000 of the shares, with the remaining 3.5 million coming from executives and other shareholders. **********At the same time, the company released second-quarter results showing that its share of the market for registering new domain names had fallen from 18 percent to 13 percent in the second quarter, with registrations plunging from 923,000 to 710,000. **********The culprit: an explosion in the number of companies competing to register domain names. Sixty-three companies are now accredited to register names, and 100 more have applied to enter the business, according to Verisign Global Registry Services, which runs the servers that look up names. Many of the new competitors have undercut Register's standard price of $35 to register a name for a year. **********A few months before, Wall Street might have shrugged off the bad news and lapped up the new shares. But not after April's meltdown. In essence, investors said that if Register's management did not want to own its stock, they did not either. In the two weeks after the announcement of the secondary offering, Register shares lost almost half their value. **********The secondary offering created ''a confidence issue,'' said Richard D. Forman, Register's chief executive, who filed to sell more than 800,000 shares. ''People believed that we were prepared to sell even as the stock price continued to drop.'' **********Finally, on Aug. 9, the company withdrew the secondary offering. But the damage had been done. Over the last two months, Register shares have continued to slide. They closed yesterday at $6.75, a new low. At that level, Register's total market valuation is a meager $297 million. **********So why bother with Register? Because at these prices, the company might be worth another look. **********Sure, just because a stock has fallen 94 percent does not mean it is cheap. Faced with mounting losses and questionable business plans, many Internet stocks have lost 90 percent or more of their value in the last few months. **********But Register has a couple of things many Internet companies do not have. Its balance sheet is loaded with cash, about $180 million at the end of the second quarter. Even more important, it is likely to turn slightly profitable in the fourth quarter and be solidly profitable for all of 2001, analysts say. **********After losing about 10 cents a share this year, Register is expected to earn 21 cents a share next year, according to I.B.E.S., which tracks analysts' estimates. As a result, Register can survive without having to raise new cash. ''They have a business model that doesn't have debt, and they don't need access to the capital markets,'' said Todd Weller, an Internet analyst at Legg Mason. **********That gives the company a crucial advantage over money-losing competitors that must overcome investors' current skepticism about Internet companies to raise cash. And if Register's rivals wither, the pressure the company faces on prices and market share may ease. **********The market for new domain names, which rose from 500,000 in the third quarter of 1998 to 1.5 million in the third quarter of 1999 to 5.6 million in the second quarter of this year, is about to get another lift. **********By the end of the year, domain names will be available in non-English characters, greatly widening the international market for new names. And by sometime in 2001, the nonprofit body that supervises the Internet is expected to add two to six new ''top-level domains,'' like .shopping or .bank, to the current group, which includes .com, .org and .net. **********That could lead to an explosion in the number of names that are to be registered, said Chuck Jones, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst. Most analysts predict that about 150 million domain names will be registered over the next several years, but Mr. Jones said the new characters and domains could swell that total to 500 million. **********The ultimate impact of the new top-level domains on Register is hard to quantify. But it will not be negative, said Jordan Rohan, an analyst at Wit Soundview. ''The company is poised for a rebound in the fourth quarter as investors begin to speculate about the impact,'' Mr. Rohan said. **********And with all that cash in the bank, and profits on the near horizon, Register looks much better at $6.75 than it did at $116."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/04/business/economic-view-fortune-telling-for-profit-and-policy.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Stevenson", "pub_date": "2000-06-04", "snippet": "Economic View column predicts Federal Reserve will raise interest rates once or twice by end of summer and will then call a time out; predicts upcoming federal budget surplus projections will rise substantially (M),", "word_count": 760, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fortune Telling For Profit And Policy", "print_headline": "ECONOMIC VIEW; Fortune Telling For Profit And Policy", "body_text": " **********THIS column has been lent a crystal ball for one week. Reception is a bit fuzzy, but here goes. **********The Federal Reserve will raise interest rates once or twice by the end of the summer, and then will call a time out. **********Six rate increases in less than a year, to little obvious effect, have left economists and analysts fretting that monetary policy has lost its punch. But now there are at least tentative signs that the rip-roaring economy is slowing. Moreover, the Fed still has faith in its tools, and after tightening by another quarter-point at the end of this month, and perhaps again in August if its hawks insist, it will pause to reassess the outlook. **********It is clear that technology and globalization have changed the economy in ways that even Alan Greenspan does not fully understand, and slowing its growth may require a bigger dose of interest-rate medicine than in business cycles past. **********But monetary policy seems to be working much the way it always has. Long-term interest rates on corporate debt have risen substantially, and companies are turning away from bond issuance and toward bank loans and commercial paper to avoid being locked into high-cost long-term debt. **********At some point, the cost of borrowing short-term will rise so much that companies will choose to defer plans to expand or modernize -- or they will absorb the higher interest costs in the form of diminished profits. Either way, business activity and the economy will slow. **********Consumer mortgage rates have jumped and the housing market is cooling. Retail spending may have peaked. Stocks are volatile but no longer rising relentlessly. **********Unemployment is still so low, and consumer confidence so high, that Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues are not comfortable holstering their weapons quite yet. But unless the stock market takes off again or unambiguous acceleration in growth and inflation appear, the Fed will show great patience later this year. **********The federal budget surplus will again prove larger than expected, with implications for the presidential race and the bond market. **********Congress and the White House will update their long-term surplus projections over the summer; both will rise substantially, reflecting the strength of tax receipts this year and the spreading consensus that the economy is capable of higher rates of noninflationary growth than in the past. The economy has been so strong that economists now expect a fiscal-2000 surplus of at least $200 billion and perhaps $225 billion; in January the Congressional Budget Office was estimating $176 billion. **********Even if growth slows substantially, the economy will still be bigger than had been forecast, yielding more tax revenue, and the budget office has gradually been raising its estimates of growth potential. **********Economists at Goldman, Sachs recently raised the possibility that this summer's new surplus numbers could allow the federal government to pay off the entire $3.5 trillion national debt held by the public as soon as 2007, six years ahead of the Clinton administration's current schedule. **********More money on the table would give George W. Bush an opportunity to argue that the nation can afford both his big tax cut plan and his proposal to create private investment accounts within Social Security. Vice President Al Gore would get a chance to call both for accelerated reduction of the national debt and for additional spending on Democratic priorities like adding prescription drug coverage to Medicare. **********Defining and nurturing the new economy will emerge as a major political issue. **********In Congress -- especially in the House -- the two parties will continue falling all over each other to prove that they are au courant with the wired world (and happy to receive its campaign contributions). **********Republicans will push through a bill to extend for five years the current moratorium on Internet taxation, and the two parties will reach agreement on granting more visas to skilled workers from abroad to meet demand from technology companies. **********The whole topic of the government's role in the new economy will take center stage when the federal judge presiding over the Microsoft antitrust case orders, perhaps this week, that the company be broken up. **********But even as they maneuver for political advantage, politicians will continue trying to decipher what these issues mean to voters. A recent poll by the centrist Democratic Leadership Council found voters to be optimistic about the new economy's prospects, dubious that it should be regulated like any other industry and willing to endure more frequent job changes but insistent that government support job training and education. **********Full disclosure: This crystal ball appears to be a prototype, and carries no warranty.

Revenue was $270.1 million, exceeding analysts' estimates of $240 million, and up from $128.6 million a year ago. **********Last quarter, the company reported net income of $63.3 million on revenue of $228 million. **********Some investors bet in recent weeks that Yahoo would not meet its target, as analysts warned of weakening revenue growth in the face of reduced advertising spending by some struggling Internet companies. Yahoo's share price was $148 three weeks ago, but has fallen steadily. It fell another $4.50 today, to close at $105.50. But it rebounded  in after-hours trading, rising to $121. **********Industry analysts said they were mildly but pleasantly surprised by the results, but disagreed on how much to read into the earnings report. Some said the quarter suggested that Internet companies like Yahoo that rely on advertising revenue could breathe more easily. But others said the results spoke more directly to the strength of Yahoo's business. **********''This is a respectable and solid quarter given the weakness in online advertising,'' said Jordan E. Rohan, an analyst with Wit Soundview, a New York-based brokerage firm. ''Yahoo came through.'' **********He said the results showed that advertisers were continuing to support major online media companies, like Yahoo and America Online, but that it was unfair to assume that smaller Internet media companies would also enjoy continued support. **********''It is a mistake to apply it more generally,'' he said. **********Yahoo, meanwhile, did not dispute that consolidation in the Internet industry was having an impact on its business. The company said 10 percent of its advertising was coming from ''financially questionable'' companies -- not limited to Internet businesses -- though it declined to provide the dollar figure represented by those contracts. **********Susan L. Decker, Yahoo's new chief financial officer, said the company had taken an ''exhaustive'' look at the impact of struggling companies on its advertising revenue in light of the recent investor concern. **********Paul W.

But he said the bigger players, like Yahoo, were not at particular risk in the event of a shakeout. **********''The leaders in the online ad world are going to fare better than the second-  or third-tier sites that don't get much of a share of online ad dollars in the first place,'' he said. **********He added that Yahoo was also insulated because it had diversified its revenue between advertising and e-commerce sources. **********Timothy A. Koogle, Yahoo's chairman and chief executive, said consolidation in the dot-com industry might wind up helping Yahoo because weaker Internet companies would fall by the wayside, and Yahoo might recoup a larger share of the revenue from a stronger, more reliable advertising base. **********The company reported that it had retained all of its top 50 advertisers and 98 of its top 100 advertisers since the end of the first quarter. **********In a conference call with analysts and journalists, the company continued to hammer home its efforts to grow overseas, with what analysts described as positive results.

Last Thursday, for example, the network finished just a fraction behind Fox for the night in the national ratings and easily won the night outright among those male teenagers. **********That is significant, because young males are a group avidly pursued by advertisers selling everything from soft drinks to video games, who are willing to pay a premium to reach them. **********And now wrestling figures as another tangled subplot to the ownership battle, with CBS and possibly other suitors lining up to try to take the W.W.F. cable programming away from the USA cable network, possibly to link up all the television rights under one corporate roof. **********The W.W.F., which under Mr. McMahon has expanded aggressively in recent years into clothing stores and restaurants, has increasing leverage in television because of the popularity of its programs. On cable, three weekly editions of the W.W.F. events are invariably the highest-rated programs in all of cable every week. **********Mr. McMahon recently informed USA Networks that he planned to open up the cable rights for next season to other bidders. Mr. Diller retains the right to match any competing offer, but several executives close to the deal said the offers might include elements that would be difficult to match, possibly including an equity stake in whatever channel Mr. McMahon chooses as his next partner. **********CBS could be best positioned to negotiate with Mr. McMahon if Viacom winds up acquiring UPN outright, completes the CBS merger agreement, and gets the F.C.C. to waive its prohibition on one company operating two networks. **********Viacom and CBS have asked for the F.C.C. waiver and many of the parties involved say there is a good chance the F.C.C. will agree, mainly to insure UPN's continued survival. One reason: UPN has become the favorite network for black viewers; about 40 percent of its audience are blacks, who watch such shows as ''Moesha'' and ''Malcolm and Eddie.'' Senior executives on both sides of the UPN ownership battle said the F.C.C. would be loath to put a network with that kind of minority following at risk. **********Acquiring UPN could be the path to a wider wrestling deal for CBS. No CBS executive will comment for the record on the network's plans for wrestling. But another CBS unit, the cable channel TNN, is moving aggressively into this form of programming, having already acquired the rights to events like Arena Football League games and Extreme Championship Wrestling bouts. **********Several executives familiar with both the negotiations for UPN's future and CBS's interest in wrestling tied the strategy to Mr. Karmazin. Victor Miller, a broadcast analyst for Bear, Stearns, said, ''Mel Karmazin would be very interested in operating both networks.'' **********He said that UPN fit into Mr. Karmazin's broad strategy for reaching consumers with advertising in multiple media in all parts of their lives. This could be accomplished best by linking CBS assets, like its television network, its Infinity Broadcasting radio stations and its outdoor advertising business, with those of Viacom, like the cable channels Nickelodeon, MTV and VH-1. **********''You start out as a kid, you're watching Nickelodeon,'' Mr. Miller said. ''Then you get acne, you watch MTV; you get a little older, you watch UPN; so then you get married, have a couple of kids and you watch VH-1; finally you get older still and you watch CBS. And it's a fabulous lifestyle play. You start the day listening to radio and that's an Infinity station. You listen to another Infinity station on the drive to work, and while traveling you see billboards owned by Viacom/CBS. At work, you get into some streaming audio, or link into Web sites that CBS may have an interest in. Then you come home and you watch all these TV channels.'' **********Several executives also tied the decision to trigger the buy-sell move over UPN to Mr. Karmazin, who had previously been involved in fruitless negotiations to buy Chris-Craft's broadcast interests outright. **********''This was Karmazin all over,'' one executive said of the deal, citing the pressure put on UPN either to agree to swallow the losses still being incurred by the network by buying out Viacom's share or to sell out for a truly modest price: $5 million. **********But Chris-Craft hopes it will never come to that. The company requested an injunction in the State Supreme Court in New York, seeking to blow up the entire Viacom-CBS merger agreement. Chris-Craft contends that it will be irreparably damaged if it loses either the network or a deep-pocketed partner just as UPN is turning the corner and moving toward success. **********Dean Valentine, UPN's president, said that even with the network's  turnaround this season, ''We're still going to lose money for the next year or two.'' He expressed confidence that the network's recent success can be sustained because the young male viewers it is reaching now supply much of the audience for the stations that make up the UPN network. **********He also said UPN would tailor upcoming programs to young men, but would not limit the appeal to them. That was a mistake that the WB network has made, he said, in aiming its shows exclusively at teenage girls. ''We want to be male friendly, not male exclusive,'' he said. And he intends to retain a skew toward minority viewers. **********''We're not trying to be a broadcaster or a narrow-caster,'' Mr. Valentine said. ''We want to be a midcaster.'' **********He said he expected Chris-Craft to try to retain its interest in UPN. But that may depend on whether a settlement with Viacom can be reached, or another corporate partner can be found. Chris-Craft would not be anxious to swallow the network's continuing losses alone. **********Other suitors may appear -- Mr. Diller and his USA Networks have been mentioned in speculation about UPN's future. But for the moment, Chris-Craft wants the court to force Viacom to remain its tag-team partner. **********Tom Wolzien, a media analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein, said Viacom and CBS would not allow the UPN morass to stand in the way of their deal. ''Nothing is more important to them to get the merger closed, with or without UPN,'' Mr. Wolzien said. ''They would prefer to do it with UPN, but if it has to go away, it goes away.'' **********Mr. Valentine said the network had come too far now to be forced into oblivion, a fate it might have faced had UPN not found its identity. ''Under any scenario, we're now too valuable an asset to disappear,'' Mr. Valentine said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/21/technology/taking-the-mask-off-pseudoscience.html": {"writer_name": "Bonnie Morris", "pub_date": "2000-12-21", "snippet": "Erik Max Francis offers Web domain he constructed, Crank Dot Net, as index of about 1,000 Web sites containing what he considers pseudoscience; these sites espouse bizarre theories closer to science fiction than to science; photo (M)", "word_count": 947, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Taking the Mask Off Pseudoscience", "print_headline": "Taking the Mask Off Pseudoscience", "body_text": " **********ERIK MAX FRANCIS is so passionate about the theory and practice of modern science that in the last year alone he has posted 9,460 messages in scores of online user groups devoted topics like relativity, astronomy and neuroscience. **********Mr. Francis, 29, is not a scientist, and has taken only a handful of classes at a community college, but he is a self-educated computer programmer from San Jose, Calif., who just happens to be comfortable, he says, discussing the theories and applications of mathematical physics, vector algebra and calculus. **********Ten years ago, Mr. Francis started talking online with other people who shared his interests. Along with lively discussions with the other science enthusiasts, Mr. Francis often found himself debating people who espoused bizarre theories that were more science fiction than science. The more Mr. Francis argued with them, the more they dug in their heels. **********Mr. Francis began thinking of these people as cranks, reasoning that science is an ever-evolving process, and scientists change their views as they make new discoveries that tear down old assumptions. On the other hand, ''a crank has already made up his mind, evidence one way or another will not make him change it,'' Mr. Francis said. **********In 1996, Mr. Francis created a separate file in his computer to keep track of the cranks and their Web sites. In 1997, he spun off his quickly sprawling file into a separate domain, and dubbed it Crank Dot Net (www.crank.net). **********Today, Crank Dot Net is an index of about 1,000 of these sites. Through it, Mr. Francis performs the role of vigilante, by ranking and categorizing Web sites propounding pseudoscience that Mr. Francis says is misleading and simply ridiculous. On Crank Dot Net, Mr. Francis pulls a quote from each site that he feels best defines it, then ranks the sites as ''Cranky (Downright strange), Crankiest, (above and beyond the normal call of the crank), and Illucid, (Something so beyond understanding that it defies classification).'' **********Among the sites listed by Mr. Francis are ones espousing time travel, teleportation, alchemy, crop circles and the idea that the Earth is hollow. There are several sites dedicated to an old favorite, cold fusion, which created a sensation when it was announced in 1989 but now is largely dismissed by the scientific community. **********Initially, Mr. Francis said, he kept track of these kinds of sites for his own amusement, in an effort to study their abnormal psychology. What struck him was how television has influenced pseudo-science. ''It's surprising to me how many scientific cranks think pseudoscience and technobabble are really how science gets done,'' wrote Mr. Francis in an e-mail message, blaming the thinking on the influence of ''Star Trek.'' **********Mr. Francis said he had also come to believe that many people create their own scientific theories because they simply don't understand the real ones. Since math is fundamental to science and many people are math illiterate, he said, they simply think words will do. To Mr. Francis, words are simply not enough. **********Crank Dot Net's sorting and filtering function for strange stuff on the Web has taken on a wider import: helping site visitors see fallacy for what it is. To that end, Mr. Francis also lists extreme religions, white supremacists and hatemongers on the site, along with crystal healers and victims of alien abductions. **********Mr. Francis isn't the only Web vigilante out there devoted to pin-pointing fallacy to encourage critical thinking. Phil Plaitt, the Web master of Bad Astronomy started his site (www.badastronomy.com) devoted to exposing myths about astronomy because he was, he says ''full of righteous fury,'' after watching a TV news reader on a national network morning show give a report on the space shuttle then laugh on air that he had no idea what he was talking about. **********''I have a passion for the rightness of science,'' said Mr. Plaitt, an astronomer and a friend of Mr. Francis. ''Science works. It's a pretty good way to describe the universe.'' Mr. Plaitt suggests that sites like Bad Astronomy and Crank Dot Net provide a ''process to separate the rational from the irrational.'' **********As the Internet expands to give every person a platform to say whatever he wants about the way the universe works, (a good thing, in both Mr. Francis's and Mr. Plaitt's view), it behooves people like Mr. Francis, Mr. Plaitt and the Webmaster of similar sites, like Quintessence of the Loon (www.ratbags.com/loon) to put them in context. **********In addition to the pseudoscience sites, Crank Dot Net features an anticrank category that lists sites ''fighting crankism, debunking bad science and promoting logic.'' **********Crank Dot Net also flags sites that are parodies. Sometimes, Mr. Francis admits, it is tough separating the parodies from the real thing. Sometimes, he has ranked a site as cranky, only to be corrected by site visitors. **********''It's really hard to tell the difference,'' Mr. Francis said. ''The crankiest people, literally, they are talking and you are giggling and what they're saying is ridiculous, but they are serious.'' **********Mr. Francis said he received several submissions daily suggesting sites to mention. Many of the submissions come from cranky Webmasters. In fact, Mr. Francis said he rarely gets complaints from the Webmasters he's clearly criticizing on the site. ''Most are quite pleased,'' he said. ''By no means is Crank Dot Net considered a hostile resource by people who are listed there.'' **********Mr. Francis recently listed Greatdreams.com and rated it ''crankiest.'' Almost immediately, he received an e-mail message from Dee Finney, the site's Webmaster, thanking him for the listing. **********''Our main thrust is to educate people to watch their dreams,'' Mrs. Finney said. 'In their dreams you see the future. ''We're tickled to be listed.

Augusto Pinochet and let him return home to Chile, but Belgium held up any final action by lodging an appeal against the ruling. **********Home Secretary Jack Straw had said on Jan. 11 that he was ''minded'' -- inclined -- to set the 84-year-old former Chilean dictator free immediately because of his deteriorating health but would await the outcome of any legal objections before issuing a definitive order. **********In today's ruling, Judge Maurice Kay turned down appeals from six human rights groups and the Belgian government contesting the British government's finding that General Pinochet is medically unfit to be extradicted to Spain to stand trial on torture charges. **********Hopes of Pinochet supporters that Judge Kay's verdict constituted the end of legal moves in the 15-month-old case were dashed by Belgium, which filed its appeal this afternoon. **********It will be heard by a panel of three High Court judges on Monday and Tuesday of next week.

The groups had jointly protested Mr. Straw's refusal to make public records of a medical examination of General Pinochet conducted by four British doctors that was the basis for the findings on the general's infirm physical state. **********Judge Kay found that Mr. Straw acted ''lawfully, fairly and rationally'' in not disclosing the medical documents. Mr. Straw had argued that to do so would violate a pledge of doctor-patient confidentiality made to the general before the Jan. 5 examination. ''In legal, if somewhat peremptory terms,'' the judge said of the complainants' request, ''it is none of their business.'' **********The judge added that he was ''conscious that my decision is unavoidably adverse to, on the one hand, people who have suffered greatly in Chile's recent history, and, in the case of Belgium, to a friendly state and its judicial authorities.'' **********Belgium, France and Switzerland had joined Spain in seeking General Pinochet's extradition on behalf of residents who said they suffered under general's military rule. **********General Pinochet's pursuers denounced today's ruling but did so in a way suggesting that they realized that chances of judicial relief might now be slim. Reed Brody, advocacy director of Human Rights Watch, said: ''We are dismayed by today's decision, which is a setback for Pinochet's thousands of victims in their quest for justice. It is a shame that the attempt to prosecute General Pinochet for the worst international crimes may be halted on the basis of secret medical evidence examined behind closed doors.'' **********Whatever its ultimate conclusion, the case has already resulted in a fundamental change in concepts of international law to allow the prosecution of dictators and leaders of repressive regimes by courts in countries where the alleged abuses did not occur. **********This came about when Britain's highest court, the Law Lords of the House of Lords, turned aside the general's claim that, under the principle of sovereign immunity, he could not be tried for acts committed while he was Chile's head of state, from 1973 to 1990. **********General Pinochet has been under house arrest in England for more than 15 months while complicated legal moves unfolded around a Spanish judge's request that he be extradited to Madrid to stand trial on charges of genocide, torture, kidnapping and murder in connection with the disappearance of more than 3,000 people in the years after he seized power in the 1973 coup that ousted President Salvador Allende. **********The judge, Baltasar Garzon, considered something of a maverick in the Spanish judiciary, had gathered his evidence during an investigation into the so-called dirty wars in Latin America in the 1970's. **********On Oct. 16, 1998, the general was arrested as he lay in a London clinic recuperating from back surgery. **********Twelve days later, General Pinochet won his first legal battle in a ruling by the High Court that upheld his claim to sovereign immunity. But in the judgment that was to create the case's legacy, on Nov. 25, 1998, the Law Lords overturned that decision, saying that being head of state did not excuse crimes against humanity. **********The case returned to the House of Lords after one of the original judges was found to have had an association with Amnesty International, a party to the case. But the second Lords' decision, on March 24, 1999, was even more assertive on the principle than the first one, though it drastically reduced the number of charges and narrowed their scope to torture and conspiracy to torture. **********The case then moved on to the validity of the actual extradition order itself, which was upheld by a London magistrate last October and is under an appeal from General Pinochet's lawyers that is likely to become moot because of Mr. Straw's expected intervention. **********In General Pinochet's one court appearance, on Dec. 11, 1998, he maintained the defiant attitude he adopted from the beginning, saying that he did not recognize the jurisdiction of any court outside Chile to try him and that he was innocent of ''all the lies of Spain.'' **********During the 15 months, there have been boisterous gatherings outside the House of Lords and the downtown magistrate's court, with supporters and opponents behind barricades angrily facing down one another."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/15/business/company-news-dutch-retailer-buys-51-of-online-grocer-peapod.html": {"writer_name": "Bridge News", "pub_date": "2000-04-15", "snippet": "Royal Ahold says it agreed to buy 51 percent of Peapod for $73 million (S)", "word_count": 124, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DUTCH RETAILER BUYS 51% OF ONLINE GROCER PEAPOD", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; DUTCH RETAILER BUYS 51% OF ONLINE GROCER PEAPOD", "body_text": " **********Royal Ahold, the Dutch food retailer, said yesterday that it had agreed to buy 51 percent of Peapod, an online grocer, for $73 million.

Grand Union's chief financial officer, Jeffrey Freimark, said that it had several suitors and that the bankruptcy filing ''does not change at all the sale process or Merrill's role.'' **********Facing a highly competitive market increasingly dominated by national chains like Wal-Mart, Grand Union, based in Wayne, N.J., has struggled in recent years. It filed for bankruptcy protection in 1995 and again in 1998. It emerged from bankruptcy protection in August 1998 but has continued to lose money. For the quarter ended July 22, the company lost $51.7 million and posted sales of $658 million, compared with $687.3 million in the period a year earlier. Sales in stores open at least a year, a standard industry measurement of health, declined 2.7 percent.

''We are in the process of reviewing and identifying those stores,'' Mr. Freimark said. He added, ''it is possible there will be layoffs in conjunction with a limited number of store closings.'' **********In August, the company laid off 170 employees, mostly from its headquarters.

''And the companies likely to buy a Grand Union are much more efficient and have much lower prices on everyday shelf items.'' **********There will be two sets of losers, Mr. Flickinger predicted. ''About 20 percent of the stores need to be closed,'' he said, ''because they are under such pressure from supercenters that they are an uneconomic proposition.'' And union workers would probably lose jobs to chains that were nonunion shops, he said. **********Grand Union also said it had obtained, subject to court approval, a $60 million line of credit from Lehman Commercial Paper Inc., one of its lenders.

Even in college, he regularly brought his laundry home to Mother, and he shunned the stove in favor of the local Burger King or Kentucky Fried Chicken. **********Indeed, he knew so little about what goes on in the kitchen that when he applied for a job at Whirlpool, one of the world's largest makers of household appliances, he checked off the box that indicated the lowest level of cooking expertise: Hamburger Helper. **********But for two months this summer, Mr. Barbee, now 30, and six other young recruits took part in an unusual training program that might be considered the corporate equivalent of reality-based television. **********Hoping to create a better work force, Whirlpool essentially sentenced a group of new hires to live together in a large house, where during the course of their stay they prepared more than 900 plates of food; washed no fewer than 120 bags of laundry; and performed countless hours of loading and reloading of the company's refrigerators, dishwashers and dryers. **********They smear white bags with mustard, relish and other stain-generating condiments, just to see if they can bleach them out; they prepare three times as much pasta as they need, simply to see how cooking in microwave and convection ovens differs from that in traditional ovens. **********With breaks for only a couple of weekend trips home, the learning experience is intense. Who knew, for example, that one of the company's newest dishwashers was so powerful that when an entire carrot cake was set among the dishes -- as it was during an experiment -- the cake would entirely evaporate and the dishes would still come out clean. **********''Company retreats have been around a long time, but two months living in a house, I've never heard of that,'' said Sonia Marciano, who teaches management and strategy at the Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University. ''I guess there are some people who are going to say this is a way cool thing, especially when you're dealing with something as unsexy as appliances.'' **********Company executives, however, insist that the reality-based training program is not a gimmick. Rather, they say, it is a more pragmatic and effective way of preparing its youthful marketing representatives than the lectures and slide shows that make up so many corporate initiations. Forcing the recruits, a diverse group of men and women, to use the full range of Whirlpool products night and day will produce a better informed and more consumer-friendly sales staff, the company says. **********''We want them to have a better appreciation of what a consumer goes through,'' said Jackie Seib, the company's national training manager. **********In a case of life imitating art -- or, at least, television -- Whirlpool modeled its program after ''The Real World,'' the popular MTV series that chronicles the experience of seven young people who live together for five months. Whirlpool's version is called ''The Real Whirled.'' **********The undertaking may be one of the earliest indications of ways that pop culture, already a potent force in the advertising world, is now being mined for new management and training techniques, even at an 89-year-old company not often thought of as trendy. With a tight labor market and workers mindful of more relaxed cultures at dot-coms, some traditional companies are trying to be hip to retain and motivate employees. **********Merrill Lynch and McDonald's, for example, turn training sessions into mock versions of television game shows like ''Jeopardy'' or ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' complete with a cheering section, a host and buzzers. There are also corporate training videos with titles -- ''Alien Encounter'' and ''Hunt for T-Rex,'' for example -- that reflect popular Hollywood movies. **********''These training sessions kind of morph into whatever's popular at the time,'' said David Stampf, a writer at Training magazine, which is based in Minneapolis. **********Two or three times a year, Whirlpool selects seven young people from around the country to live together for eight weeks in a leased, seven-bedroom house not far from its corporate headquarters here in Benton Harbor. The recruits will eventually be dispatched to train sales staffs at retailers like Sears and Lowe's to sell the company's appliances. **********And they had better be good. At the end of August Whirlpool said that weakening demand for home appliances in the United States and Europe was cutting sharply into profit margins. The recent decision by Circuit City stores to stop selling big appliances has also shaken up the company's profit forecasts. Whirlpool's stock has been down sharply, but has recently recovered somewhat, closing yesterday at $40.88. **********The new program is expected to build team spirit at Whirlpool, and also trust. At the house, there are no restrictions on the recruits' relationships with one another, no legal documents laying out guidelines for living together. But the most recent cadre formulated a makeshift list of house rules as they settled into cohabitation early this summer. Among them: ''Say what you feel,'' ''Don't let problems simmer,'' and ''If you make a mess, clean it up.'' **********The participants do, however, have to agree to one important condition. They enter the program -- and accept the approximately $35,000-a-year training jobs -- not knowing until just days before their ''Real Whirled'' stint ends where they will be working. They only know that they will be based near a major American metropolitan center. **********The recruits spend their days mastering the company's household appliances, which are periodically swapped for different models, even that of a competitor, for comparison testing. There are written tests, oral presentations and almost daily quizzes on attributes and idiosyncrasies of washers, dryers and microwave ovens. **********Under the supervision of Kurt Gersonde, a training manager often on site from 7 a.m. until 6 p.m., they visit local stores to determine how well or not so well others are selling the company's appliances. They are sent out on house calls with a repair crew; visit the company's manufacturing plants; and go to research centers, to catch a glimpse of the future. **********But mostly, they stay at home. They cook up dishes to test the new Accubake oven. They splatter food on linens to determine if the Catalyst washing machine really does give clothes ''the whitest whites.'' And they leave pasta sauce and sticky noodles on plates when they load the new Kitchen Aid dishwasher to see how well it cleans away leftover bits of food. **********No other major appliance maker has anything like ''The Real Whirled.'' Maytag, for example, has a more traditional training program in which new employees watch videos, study manuals and are given instructions on using appliances. **********The idea emerged from a brainstorming session with James H. Gilmore, a consultant who has encouraged corporations to ''embrace theater'' in the workplace and create ''unique experiences'' that can transform the work force. Someone mentioned ''The Real World,'' and the idea of Whirlpool's own live-in training program was born. **********It was an ideal way to train new hires, Ms. Seib said, because ''we're hiring kids right out of college, and their expertise is lugging their clothes home to their mother.'' **********The Whirlpool program is set here in the western part of the state, in a big, white clapboard home more Disney than MTV. There are green rooms, candy-colored fixtures, shades painted with butterflies, and lots of nooks and crannies. **********The first group shared a different house in late 1998. The fourth -- four men and three women, racially diverse and in their mid-20's -- finished up its tour late last month. **********There was Lindsey Williams, a 22-year-old graduate of Texas Christian University, who realized after college that her political ambitions would take longer to achieve than she wanted to wait. ''You can't graduate from college at 22 and become a congresswoman,'' she said. Instead, she followed her father, a longtime sales employee at Whirlpool. **********Richard Federico, 25, is the only recruit who is married. He also has two children, one of whom is proudly put on display on the screen saver of his laptop computer. After graduating third in a high school class of 10 people in Maine, he went to Liberty University, the school founded by the Rev. Jerry Falwell in Lynchburg, Va. After graduation, he decided to go into retailing and heard about the program through a friend. **********Salena Barone, a 24-year-old from Philadelphia, was the food expert in the group. She doled out daily advice on how to make the prescribed dishes right. And Tony Barbee, who botched a cake on Day 3, still managed to be a class favorite. **********There were mishaps -- a television on the blink during the video session on sexual harassment, for instance -- and some laughs: about Mr. Federico's ability to consume steaks and the time Ms. Barone became the target of sea gulls on the beach. There was the puerile, like the time Ms. Williams, during preparations for a test, was asked the main advantage of the Catalyst washer. Someone in the room blurted out that it was an aphrodisiac. **********And though there were some minor conflicts, the participants insist that real bonding took place. They studied for tests together, went to the beach, played volleyball and talked about race and culture. **********''Every person brings something to the table,'' said Brian Clark, 22, a recent graduate of the College of the Ozarks in Missouri and one of the participants. **********While there are usually a lot of budding romances on ''The Real World,'' that level of engagement did not take place here. ''I don't need to be sidetracked,'' one recruit said. **********Besides, the bosses at headquarters were not exactly clueless about the goings-on at the house. **********''Everyone's observing us,'' Ms. Barone said. ''I think that's what this is all about.'' **********To the outside observer, the recruits could have been mistaken for ordinary roommates. One day in July, the group huddled in the kitchen to prepare a huge lunch. Ms. Williams chopped cucumbers, Mr. Barbee pulled chocolate chip cookies out of the oven and Ms. Barone prepared pasta. One dish of noodles was placed in the convection oven, another in the microwave. The results surprised even the cook. **********''I don't want to admit it,'' Ms. Barone confessed, '' but the microwave dish tastes better.'' **********After the experience not only of cooking and cleaning but also of building relationships, the raw recruits of two months ago are now ready, they say, to take their ''Real Whirled'' experience to the, well, real world. **********''Business is about relationships anyway,'' Mr. Clark said. ''And being here, living with real people is the genuine article.'' Besides, he added: ''I cooked tangy cauliflower the other night and everybody loved it. My mom's freaking; she's like, 'This is excellent.'

In May, he said, nine groups booked and there were no cancellations. ''We're even getting people walking in off the street without reservations. I can't remember the last time that happened.'' **********Less than a year after peace began settling over the mostly Kurdish east, tourists are starting to return. Their arrival suggests that the tourism industry could become a source of income and stability in a region where unemployment is higher than anywhere else in the country. **********Kars is the nearest town to the spectacular ruined city of Ani, which was a thriving Armenian capital 10 centuries ago. In the 1980's Ani attracted about 35,000 visitors each year. But during the 1990's, when much of the region was under a form of military rule, it lay all but deserted. This spring, tourists have suddenly begun appearing again. Fifteen thousand are expected by the end of the summer. **********Until last year military permits were necessary to visit Ani, and often they were denied. Now a tourism office in Kars issues permits routinely. **********During the 1990's, as Turkish troops battled Kurdish rebels in this region, soldiers were everywhere, and they often treated strangers as likely spies. Violence was common and tourism all but unthinkable. **********Today the Kurdish rebel leader is in jail. His guerrillas have stopped fighting and his Kurdistan Workers Party has stopped calling for a tourist boycott of Turkey. Only a portion of the region remains under emergency rule, and local politicians are urging that it be lifted entirely. **********Conditions in most eastern provinces are more relaxed than they have been in years. The army still maintains some highway checkpoints, but foreigners are generally waved through. At some checkpoints, signs have been erected that say: ''Good-bye, Have a Nice Trip.'' **********''The security situation has improved so radically that people are actually talking about tourism, which even a year ago was almost unimaginable,'' said Stuart Jones, the American consul in Adana, which is on the edge of the former war zone. ''I'm not sure we're at the point where people can feel comfortable driving wherever they want, but a lot is possible now that hasn't been possible for a long time.'' **********Signs of this awakening are palpable throughout the region. On an afternoon in May, a tour bus disgorged three dozen Israelis in front of an imposing tenth-century Georgian church near the town of Yusufeli. And at the Ishak Pasha castle, a spectacular monument in an area where gunfire used to echo every night, several hundred visitors turned up on a spring weekend. **********''This is the first time I've seen anything like this,'' said Ahmet Calayer, a local resident who guides tourists around the castle. ''We're getting more people in a week than we used to get in two or three months.'' **********The region that is now eastern Turkey has been a crossroads of civilization for almost as long as there have been human beings. It is astonishingly rich in monuments and ancient sites, many of which have barely even been discovered. Before war spread through the region in the early 1990's, it seemed on its way to becoming an important tourist destination. **********Although tourists have begun returning here more quickly than anyone had imagined, some places are still not quite ready for them. In cities and towns that have been hotbeds of Kurdish nationalism, police control is still too tight for comfort. Some towns are still off limits to all outsiders. **********''I brought some foreign journalists here, and every time we went in or out of town the police stopped us and checked everyone's papers,'' said Talip Bilen, who owns a hotel in the historic town of Mardin. ''Naturally their impression was negative.  An effort to help our area was turned almost upside-down.'' **********In Van, which lies on the shore of Turkey's largest lake and might benefit from a tourist boom more than any other town in the region, people are hoping for a steady easing of controls. **********One of the few construction projects in Van in recent months has been a renovation and expansion of the town's main hotel. **********''Right now we're 75 percent booked, and we expect this to continue all season,'' said Murat Turkoglu, the hotel owner. ''If this mood continues for another few years, our region will be visited again just like any other beautiful part of the world.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/26/world/german-official-pessimistic-about-far-right-violence.html": {"writer_name": "Roger Cohen", "pub_date": "2000-08-26", "snippet": "Foreign Min Joschka Fischer is pessimistic about eradication of rightist violence in eastern Germany; says it will take more than generation to overcome wounds of area that remains in 'twilight zone' between democracy and authoritarian tradition; ...", "word_count": 811, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "German Official Pessimistic About Far-Right Violence", "print_headline": "German Official Pessimistic About Far-Right Violence", "body_text": " **********Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer is pessimistic about the eradication of rightist extremism in the east of Germany. It will take a ''generation and a half,'' he said, to overcome the wounds of an area that reminds him of his youth ''in the twilight zone'' between democracy and authoritarian tradition. **********In an interview, Mr. Fischer said the anti-immigrant violence that has become the chief focus of German political debate in the last month is not confined to eastern Germany. **********But the fact that the postwar decades saw ''no development of civil society'' in the east when it was under Communist rule left that area more vulnerable to neo-Nazism, he said. **********''I remember growing up in the 1950's and we were in this twilight zone between democracy and the Nazi heritage,'' said the foreign minister, who is from western Germany. ''And now I go to to the east and I feel I am back in my youth. Not only the landscapes, but also the minds. And so there is a potential for neo-Nazi ideas among a small minority, but a very violent one.'' **********A bomb in the western city of Dusseldorf that wounded nine immigrants, six of them Jews, and a spate of anti-immigrant slurs or attacks in the east led Mr. Fischer to a much-noticed statement this month in which he deplored German ''passivity'' in the face of xenophobia. ''We need a reaction,'' he reiterated in the interview. **********Asked if he saw a danger of rightist terrorist groups emerging, a sort of ''Brown Army Faction'' that would parallel the Red Army Faction of the 1970's, Mr. Fischer said such a possibility was being watched ''very carefully.'' **********The foreign minister, a leader of the Green Party and a man who has made a long personal journey from anti-American protester in the 1970's to staunch defender of Atlanticism today, said he was divided about the idea of banning the rightist National Democratic Party, which has been identified with violent extremists. **********''I am split,'' the minister said. ''I am a radical supporter of free speech. But freedom of speech is one thing in America, and another here in Germany.'' **********He explained that in the light of Germany's Nazi past, neo-Nazi movements could not be viewed as they might be in another Western country. Extra severity is needed, he said, as demonstrated by the fact that the selling of Hitler's ''Mein Kampf'' is illegal here but not in the United States. **********Pressed about whether banning the National Democratic Party was appropriate, Mr. Fischer said there was evidence that the youth organization of the party provided ''the organizational cells for many of these violent acts.'' **********He continued, ''Yes, I am split, but if the facts are sufficient, then the ban must be done.'' **********Although the government can recommend a ban, any decision would ultimately be made by the Constitutional Court. Many analysts say barring the party would merely force its supporters into other rightist groups. **********Claus Leggewie, a political scientist close to the Greens, said: ''A ban is not good policy. It is ridiculous and would be counterproductive. What is needed are vigils, demonstrations, by hundreds of thousands of people, like those we had when the first anti-immigrant attacks occurred in the early 1990's.'' **********But since then, Germany seems to have grown used to the occasional racist violence that unification has brought. Overcoming the problem will take time, Mr. Fischer said. ''How long did it take to close the wounds of the Civil War in America?'' he asked. ''Here we certainly need one and a half generations.'' **********The minister said he was appalled that some of the people calling themselves German nationalists could identify with the Nazi movement. ''Every German patriot must hate Hitler,'' he said. ''He destroyed our country, destroyed our culture. Here in Berlin you feel it. He destroyed the Jewish culture that had been very important for our identity and history. He destroyed the German minorities in Eastern Europe.'' **********Mr. Fischer's own family was among those German minorities -- the millions of ethnic Germans in Eastern Europe driven from their homes after World War II. His family fled in 1946 from near Budapest, where they had lived for two centuries. **********Ultimately, Mr. Fischer suggested, Europe's wounds would be healed by the unification of the continent. Comparing Europe's integration with that of the United States, he said, ''We are passing the phase of the Confederation and entering the period of the constitutional process and federalism.'' **********He added: ''Either Europe will have a weak central body and a confederation of independent states, and that will not work. Or we will move ahead to a real European constitution and a new European central body.'' **********Asked what would be governed by the individual nations of the European Union and what by the central body -- in effect, a European government -- Mr. Fischer declined to give details, but said, ''Very important parts of sovereign decisions should be transferred to the central body.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/11/business/us-vs-microsoft-strategy-microsoft-responding-offers-stark-view-future.html": {"writer_name": "Steve Lohr", "pub_date": "2000-05-11", "snippet": "Analysis of Microsoft Corp's alternative to Justice Department's plan to split up company; says Microsoft's legal protest is essay of grim futurism; holds apocalytic passages seem intended to warn Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson that splitting up Mi...", "word_count": 1459, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "An Analysis; News Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Microsoft, Responding, Offers Stark View of the Future", "print_headline": "U.S. VS. MICROSOFT: THE STRATEGY; Microsoft, Responding, Offers Stark View of the Future", "body_text": " **********The legal protest that Microsoft filed yesterday in reply to the government's plan to break up the company is an essay of grim futurism. **********Microsoft calls the government plan a ''draconian'' and ''speculative'' proposal that would bring ''uncertainty and chaos.'' Employees, the company says, would leave in droves. Its business would be destroyed, and the industry and consumers would ''suffer enormous harm.'' **********The apocalyptic passages seem intended to warn Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson that splitting up Microsoft would be a dangerous gamble to take with a company that is a pillar of the nation's high-technology economy. Such a step would be particularly risky, Microsoft insists, because it is ''legally baseless'' -- out of all proportion to the evidence in the antitrust trial and even to Judge Jackson's ruling that Microsoft is a monopoly that illegally used its market power. **********The remedy phase of a Federal antitrust trial is far more art than science. The enforcement provisions say simply that the sanctions should ''prevent and restrain'' the monopolist from violating the law. The court's first task is to restore competition, but the remedies should not entail unacceptable costs. **********Economists, lawyers and technical experts can all offer their views. But in the end, the court must make a difficult judgment -- both about what may happen in the future and about the corporate character of Microsoft. What will it take to restrain the monopolist? Slice it up? Shackle it with harsh curbs on its conduct? Mandate more modest conduct remedies? **********''The judge has to make an informed hunch about how things are likely to play out,'' said Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor at the University of Iowa law school. ''It's not really some exact science.'' **********Microsoft's filing, in a sense, is the latest salvo in its long-running legal battle with the government to define the scope of the antitrust case. Much of Microsoft's future will hinge on whether the courts eventually lean toward the software maker's narrower definition of the case or the government's broader one. **********In Microsoft's view, the case against it is quite limited. The suit, as the company sees it, centers on its product-design decision to fold Internet-browsing software into its Windows operating system, and on some of its contracts with industry partners and rivals. Judge Jackson ruled that Microsoft illegally tied its browser to its monopoly product -- its Windows operating system -- and that some of its contracts were an illegal use of its monopoly muscle. **********The company intends to appeal Judge Jackson's ruling against it. **********In the government's view, the ''browser war'' that pitted Microsoft against the Netscape Communications Corporation, an Internet pioneer now part of America Online, is a central portion of the case yet one episode among many. When the suit was filed by the Justice Department and state attorneys general in May 1998, it spoke of Microsoft's tactics against Netscape as part of a ''pattern of practices.'' **********Before the case went to trial in October 1998, the government added evidence involving dealings with Intel, Apple, Sun Microsystems and others. Microsoft protested that the new evidence should not be admitted, but Judge Jackson allowed it. **********Microsoft, the government asserted, was a repeat offender of the nation's antitrust laws. When the government submitted its proposed remedies two weeks ago, it warned that Microsoft was again on the march. The government said Microsoft was trying to use its monopoly in personal computer desktop operating systems to unfairly gain an advantage in the markets for handheld devices like Palm digital assistants and for big server machines that power computer networks. **********''The government's main argument for a breakup,'' said Eleanor M. Fox, a professor at New York University law school, ''is that we can't trust Microsoft -- that it has squeezed out competitors in the past and it will continue to squeeze out competitors.'' **********Microsoft cried foul again yesterday, saying the government's comments on handheld devices and server computers were beyond the scope of the trial. If the court was going to consider a breakup or severe sanctions on its conduct, the company said it would need months to gather new evidence and testimony. **********Microsoft offered its limited compromise proposal. But it was a selection of items -- and not the complete list -- that the company had offered in its periodic settlement talks with the Justice Department and the states over the last two years. Microsoft proposed to open its contracts with personal computer makers to give them greater freedom to alter the Windows desktop screen; to limit its use of exclusionary contracts, and to share widely with the computer industry the technical information on Windows. **********The Justice Department and the states dismissed the Microsoft offer as less than the company had put on the negotiating table in the past to no avail. ''It's a step back from where we were,'' said Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut attorney general. ''Microsoft is still in denial.'' **********In its filing yesterday, Microsoft warned that consumers and the software industry would suffer if the company was split up and its programmers from various product groups could no longer collaborate freely. The government has proposed breaking Microsoft into two companies -- one with the Windows operating-system business, while the other would get the Office application programs like Word and the Excel spreadsheet software, as well as most other operations including the MSN Internet business. **********Microsoft executives describe a series of examples of teamwork across the Office and Windows divide. The Office group first developed the tool bar feature, the bar at the bottom of the Windows desktop with icons for starting different software applications, in 1991. But the company's executives decided that feature should be on all Windows machines. So the group was transferred to the Windows side of the company. **********In April 1999, 25 programmers from the Office group were moved over to the Windows 2000 development team, after they came up with technology code-named Darwin. The technology reduced the cost of installing and managing software across networks of desktop PC's in corporations and business. **********''That sort of cooperation would be impossible if the government got its way,'' a senior Microsoft official said. ''The result is that the cost to users would be higher.'' **********Some benefits of being an integrated software company, computer experts say, might be lost if Microsoft was split up. But they also note that the company's Windows business has also bought and borrowed freely from non-Microsoft software developers. **********From Internet software to data compression to multimedia, the computer experts note, Microsoft has acquired the basic intellectual property from outside the company and then refined and improved it. Each of the two successor companies proposed by the government would certainly have ample resources to continue to acquire new technology, as they would split Microsoft's $21 billion nest egg of cash. **********''If Office and Windows were separate companies, it's not obvious that there would be huge efficiency losses,'' said Scott Winkler, an independent technology consultant in Fairfield, Conn. **********Indeed, some analysts say Microsoft may have a difficult time in court explaining the case for the overriding benefits of being an integrated company. **********Hal Varian, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, said: ''Microsoft has always said that it is totally open with non-Microsoft developers and does not discriminate in favor of Office. Yet now it is arguing that the two businesses are highly interactive, and we achieve these efficiency gains by close communication. It's hard for Microsoft to have it both ways.'' **********But analysts also question the government argument -- that a breakup is needed because Microsoft, left unchecked, threatens to use its desktop monopoly to capture the markets for servers and handheld devices. Microsoft, they note, has made some inroads into the server market, but it has been unable to compete effectively against Sun, Oracle and I.B.M., whose industrial-strength software is the preferred choice of large companies. **********Similarly, they add, Microsoft has been unable to dent Palm's dominance in handhelds, even though those machines must work smoothly with Windows PC's. **********''Microsoft has proven over and over that owning the desktop does not guarantee success in adjacent markets,'' said Mr. Winkler, the technology consultant. ''Palm, Sun and Oracle are crushing Microsoft in other markets.'' **********What Happens Next **********The proceedings from this point could be simple and short, or long and complex, depending on decisions by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson. A government counterresponse to Microsoft's filing is due next Wednesday. Otherwise, the only scheduled event is a hearing on May 24 at which both sides are to present arguments on the remedy question. **********But Microsoft has requested months for preparation and witness testimony, while the Justice Department says the remedy stage can be wrapped up in a week after the May 24 hearing. The judge, at the hearing or in a chambers conference, will decide how much time he is willing to devote. Previously, he has said he wants to complete the remedy phase by the end of May."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/09/world/iran-persisting-in-drive-closes-last-reformist-paper.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-08-09", "snippet": "Hard-line judiciary closes Iran's last major reformist newspaper; charges its publisher, Saeed Pourazizi, close aide to Pres Mohammad Khatami, with printing 'fake interview' at 'sensitive time;' hundreds of hard-liners demonstrate for second day o...", "word_count": 561, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Iran, Persisting in Drive, Closes Last Reformist Paper", "print_headline": "Iran, Persisting in Drive, Closes Last Reformist Paper", "body_text": " **********Iran's last major reformist newspaper was closed by the hard-line judiciary today, two days after the country's supreme leader intervened to block legislation aimed at restoring a free press. **********Outside Parliament, hundreds of hard-liners demonstrated for a second day, demanding the expulsion of pro-reform deputies who objected to the action by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's top religious leader who has final say in state issues. **********The paper, Bahar, a popular daily, one of 23 publications shut since April, was ordered closed for ''disturbing public opinion.'' Its publisher, Saeed Pourazizi, a close aide to President Mohammad Khatami, a reformist, was charged with printing ''a fake interview at a sensitive time.'' **********Bahar (the name means spring) had lasted less than three months. It appeared after a crackdown on independent newspapers that had helped reformist candidates win the parliamentary elections in February. Reformist politicians promised voters that the new Parliament would overturn the restrictive press and social laws enacted by its predecessor. **********But on Sunday, Ayatollah Khamenei denounced the proposed revision in the press law as a threat to national security and religion. Parliament had to drop the bill. **********Reformists, stunned at the ayatollah's last-minute intervention, held emergency meetings. **********On Monday, Bahar published an interview with Ahamad Pournejati, a member of Parliament, who said the reformers would seek a way to pursue the bill. A hard-line newspaper, Keyan, asserted that Bahar had faked the interview. **********Mr. Pournejati, a leader of the move to revise the press law, resigned today as chairman of Parliament's Commission for Culture, to protest the attacks on the reformers. ''The reason behind the commission's attempt was nothing except fulfilling its lawful and legitimate duty toward honorable people who are the major owners of this system,'' he told Parliament. **********He resigned hours before Bahar was closed and as supporters of Ayatollah Khamenei demonstrated outside Parliament.

But difficulties remain in some important areas. **********The results of the survey, which asked executives at agencies and client companies to evaluate their working relationships, show that tensions have eased, thanks to efforts to bridge the gap between the two sides. ''We're seeing a lot of steps in the right direction,'' said Nancy L. Salz, president at Nancy L. Salz Consulting in New York, who offered a preview of the 2000 Salz Survey of Advertiser-Agency Relations. **********Ms. Salz, who has sponsored the survey annually since 1986, said she was most pleased by this finding: When agency executives were asked for what percentage of their clients were they able to do their ''best advertising,'' the mean percentage was 65.4 -- the highest figure ever in that category. ''We hypothesize that this is related to a renewed appreciation for advertising'' among marketers, Ms. Salz said, generated by the recent spate of extensive campaigns for dot-coms, which ''allowed agencies to feel they were doing better, more creative work.'' **********''Even though there are a lot of opinions that such advertising was not as strong as it should have been in building brands rather than just name awareness,'' she added, ''for better or worse dot-com advertising has created an increased focus on advertising'' and ''how it must be used to work most effectively.'' **********Coincidentally, the 2000 survey sought to determine for the first time whether there were differences in the relationships marketers have with interactive and traditional agencies. The advertisers responding to the survey said there was more tension in their dealings with interactive shops and more focus on money; in addition, they said they provided more strategic direction to their interactive agencies. **********The agency executives, for their part, said working with dot-com clients was more tense and time pressured but offered more teamwork. **********The results of the Salz Consulting survey have seesawed in recent years. In 1996 and 1997, there were strong suggestions of improved relationships, followed by widespread signs of setbacks in 1998 and 1999. **********In working together to create campaigns to turn consumers into customers, ''the agency people are often very focused on using creativity to get attention,'' Ms. Salz said, ''while the advertisers are very focused on hammering home the benefits, making sure the strategic message comes through.'' The resulting tensions are manifested in divergent answers to survey questions. **********For instance, when asked if there has been more teamwork in relationships in the last year, 54 percent of the advertisers responding to the survey said yes, compared with 38 percent of the agency executives. **********When asked if they agreed that there was more focus on money in the last year, 54 percent of the agency executives said yes, compared with 32 percent of the advertisers. **********And when asked if there was more or less focus on how they work with each other, 57 percent of the advertisers said ''more,'' compared with 38 percent of the agency executives. **********Still, there were several indications of better relations. When asked if there were more or fewer hassles -- dude, that's the way the question was worded -- in their dealings with each other, only 12 percent of the agency executives said ''more,'' while 12 percent said ''fewer'' and 73 percent said they saw no change. The results were similar among advertisers as 23 percent said there were more hassles, 20 percent said there were fewer and 57 percent said they saw no change. **********When asked to rate the quality of work from their agencies on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 highest, the mean rating from advertisers was 7.2, an increase from 7.0 in 1999. **********Tellingly, advertisers that compensate their agencies based on performance criteria like sales rather than conventional commission or fee methods ranked the quality of their advertising higher, a mean rating of 7.5 compared with 7.0 for those who use conventional methods. That was the first time advertising created under performance-based compensation plans was deemed superior. **********And after three years of declines, advertisers indicated that advertising was becoming more important to them. When asked how much sales could improve if their agencies were always able to do the best possible work, the mean figure the respondents gave was 26.1 percent. By comparison, last year the mean figure was 21.4 percent, the lowest response since the recession year of 1991. **********Speaking of economic conditions, Ms. Salz was asked if the record boom in ad spending as the American economic expansion enters its 10th year was serving as a lubricant to reduce friction between advertisers and agencies. **********''We're all very happy when budgets are increasing and advertising is driving sales, but I don't think it's the budgets that have affected what the agencies are feeling,'' Ms. Salz replied. ''It's more about the work they're producing.'' **********The survey was conducted in April and May for Salz Consulting by Thurm Marketing and Consulting in Princeton, N.J.

And several PC companies had talked of slower-than-expected sales, which they attributed to corporations deferring purchases until the release of Microsoft's Windows 2000 operating system on Feb. 17. **********In their conference call with securities analysts, Microsoft executives took an at-times defensive, at-times defiant tone, at one point quoting Perseus, to the effect that ''he conquers who endures.'' **********At another point, they chided two competitors, Sun Microsystems and Oracle for lobbying federal regulators to break up Microsoft, a rare reference to the Justice Department's continuing antitrust suit. **********Microsoft executives said they believed that the percentage growth in revenue in fiscal 2001 would slow to the midteens, and suggested that the earnings estimate was too high by about 5 cents. They said fourth-quarter 2000 revenues would be flat to slightly down relative to the third and earnings would be comparable. **********Microsoft reported its results after the close of the market. In Nasdaq trading, Microsoft shares closed at $78.9375, up 25 cents, but they tumbled in after-hours trading, slipping as low as $73.75. **********For the quarter ended March 31, Microsoft reported earnings of $2.39 billion, or 43 cents a diluted share, up 24 percent from $1.92 billion, or 35 cents a share, in the similar quarter last year. Revenue rose 23 percent, to $5.66 billion, from $4.60 billion in the 1999 third quarter. **********Analysts had expected Microsoft to earn 41 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. The so-called whisper number was 44 cents. **********Analysts said Microsoft's disappointing numbers were bound to roil the market. Coming after so many quarters in which the company urged analysts to be conservative in their forecasts only to then blow the numbers away, any kind of slip is a cause for great concern. They noted that the revenue shortfall appeared to be directly related to customers' deferring purchases and said Microsoft's somewhat dour outlook contrasted with a more upbeat conference call with Intel earlier in the week. **********''Each analyst was basically saying, 'Where's the upside here?', looking for some glimmer of hope,'' said William Epifanio II, an analyst with J. P. Morgan. ''I couldn't find one thing to be optimistic about. The next catalyst for this stock is going to be Judge Jackson issuing his final decree, so I think a lot of people might be considering selling first and asking questions later. The tech tape Monday is not going to be pretty.'' He was referring to Thomas Penfield Jackson. **********Although Microsoft had advised analysts last quarter that the adoption rate of Windows 2000, a corporate product, would not be as rapid as that of the consumer-oriented Windows 98, sales fell below even the company's estimates. **********''We had expected business PC's to pick up more in the quarter than they did,'' John Connors, Microsoft's chief financial officer, said in a telephone interview. ''We did see some demand increase in the March time frame, basically in the last three weeks, but not enough to offset the first two months.'' PC manufacturers ''suffered from a shortage of Pentium III chips from Intel,'' he said. **********Revenue from the licensing fees paid Microsoft by PC makers grew by just 5 percent in the quarter, to $1.7 billion. The average revenue per PC declined in the quarter, due to a greater percentage of machines shipped with the lower-cost Windows 98 rather than Windows 2000, the company said. **********Microsoft's unearned income, which is the portion of income that it sets aside to reflect the long-term deployment of many of its products, grew to $4.46 billion from $4.2 billion a year ago, in line with internal expectations. **********Mr. Connors said it was not realistic to expect continued 20 percent growth, but he said the company's growth in absolute terms remained impressive. ''Year to date, we've grown revenues by over $3.1 billion,'' he said.

Yet throughout the president's visit -- as he plunged into crowds, debated Vietnam's conservative elite, and talked this morning with young entrepreneurs for whom the Ho Chi Minh Trail is a highway project -- everyone involved understood exactly what was going on. **********Mr. Clinton was here chiefly to celebrate reconciliation. But it was reconciliation with an edge, because at every turn he argued that the Communist government in Hanoi could not overcome the forces of global economic integration the way it overcame the United States and its allies more than a quarter century ago. Vietnam's plans to flourish economically, he insisted, would only work if the country builds a fair legal system, allows free travel, embraces the Internet, and gradually opens its political system. **********Clearly, many in the streets seemed to get the message, and some who disagreed came out to wave and cheer anyway. But Mr. Clinton left the country's leaders exactly where he found them: bickering, conflicted and wondering how they had won the war and lost the peace. **********In a remarkable moment at the Communist Party headquarters in Hanoi late Saturday afternoon, Mr. Clinton plunged into a spirited exchange with the country's leading hard-liner, Le Kha Phieu, the Communist party chief and the most influential member of the Vietnamese leadership. **********Mr. Phieu had watched President Clinton's nationally broadcast speech to students and seen the reception the President was getting on the streets, and clearly he was fed up. ''We have seen the collapse of the U.S.S.R.,'' Mr. Phieu said of his country's former patron. And yet, he told the President, according to two American participants in the meeting, ''we are still on our feet, we have reaffirmed Socialism.'' He went on to describe how Vietnam had begun to produce enough rice to feed itself and how it was determined to find its own way without surrendering its Socialist principals. **********He argued that the economy could grow, even if it is divided into state sectors, private sectors and foreign sectors, with politically sensitive technologies still controlled by the government. **********One of Mr. Clinton's top advisers, who witnessed the encounter, said his sense was that the Communist party chief was saying in effect: ''There is a line. We kicked you guys out. And now we are going to be friendly but there is only so far we will go.'' **********The two leaders argued, politely, over whether the United States had ''imperialist'' intentions here. Mr. Clinton told CNN today that ''I stoutly disputed that we were an imperialist country'' during the war, insisting that the conflict had been ''over what self-determination for the Vietnamese people really meant.'' **********They were talking about days long past. But the subtext of the discussion was very much about today, about Mr. Phieu's reluctance to let Vietnam plunge into a world and a marketplace dominated by American power. **********Contrast that conversation with the one Mr. Clinton held this afternoon with Vo Viet Thahn, the closest thing Ho Chi Minh City has to a mayor, who came here as a North Vietnamese battalion commander helping to sieze Saigon in 1975. **********''It was like night and day,'' said Samuel R. Berger, President Clinton's national secuirty adviser. ''We could have been talking to any big-city mayor in the United States.'' **********Mr. Thahn talked proudly about all the private sector jobs that have been created in this teeming city of motor scooters and smog, and how a 10 percent growth rate had brought the city's poverty level down. President Clinton asked what the United States might do to help. **********''Low income housing projects,'' Mr. Thahn immediately suggested. That is a long, long way from Mr. Thahn's objective here 25 years ago, which was to wipe out any vestiges of American influence. **********Indeed, the visceral attraction to America was the big surprise of this trip, reminiscent of Japan's fascination with all things American after World War II (the difference, of course, being that America won that war.) **********While many Americans watching snippets of the visit on television were undoubtedly thinking about Bill Clinton's effort to sidestep the draft, the Vietnamese saw a man who had lifted the economic embargo against their counttry, normalized diplomatic relations and arrived here with a backup plane full of potential investors. **********''The last American president we liked was Kennedy,'' said Do Thi La, a 47-year-old shopkeeper here, as she watched Mr. Clinton's motorcade speed past. ''But Clinton may have done more good things for Vietnam.'' **********There is an inevitable tendency during trips like this to overstate American influence, and to assume that just because the crowds were cheering, the outome of the newest Vietnam conflict is preordained. That would be dangerous. **********The debate Mr. Clinton tripped upon in Vietnam closely parallels the one under way in China today. There, too, leaders are caught between the necessity of attracting global capital and the reality that openness will inevitably undercut their power. In both places, it's easier and easier to find great restaurants, and harder and harder to find commited Communists. **********But it is also true that hard-liners like Mr. Phieu appear on the rise in Hanoi, at least for now. For all the talk about the power of globalization, most of Vietnam's 78 million people cannot afford a telephone and have never wandered into one of Saigon's chic Internet cafes. So at moments the optimistic talk among Mr. Clinton's aides about the inevitability of economic and political reform in Vietnam seemed like an eerie echo of the days when Robert McNamara, Mr. Kennedy's defense secretary, declared that ''every quantitative measurement we have shows we are winning the war.'' **********Maybe this time, the leaders in Hanoi have no real choice. They don't have many dominoes to play, they don't have allies willing to prop them up, and to the rest of the world it makes far less difference whether they succeed or fail. But as the author Ward Just wrote in a new forward this year to his 1967 book, ''To What End,'' during the war, ''No one knew the truth of things, whether the tide was in or out or where on the shore we stood.'' **********He could have been writing about Vietnam today."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/17/business/company-news-calpine-to-buy-trigas-canadian-energy-producer.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "2000-10-17", "snippet": "Calpine Corp, builder of steam-fed power plants, agrees to buy TriGas Exploration for 156 million Canadian dollars ($103 million) in cash and assumed debt to secure fuel for its Alberta electricity plant (S)", "word_count": 112, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CALPINE TO BUY TRIGAS, CANADIAN ENERGY PRODUCER", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; CALPINE TO BUY TRIGAS, CANADIAN ENERGY PRODUCER", "body_text": " **********The Calpine Corporation, the builder of steam-fed power plants,  agreed to buy TriGas Exploration for 156 million Canadian dollars, ($103 million), in cash and assumed debt to secure fuel for its Alberta electricity plant.

Faced with his own widespread public impatience with seven years of peace talks, which have produced paltry results in the view of many Palestinians, he will be looking for regional backing for his next moves. **********''Arafat going to the summit is like Barak going to Clinton,'' said Tahseen Bashir, a former Egyptian diplomat and aide to Anwar el-Sadat, the assassinated president. ''When they are cornered, they go to a bigger authority, either to redistribute blame for a failure or to get support and extra money.

''The logic of war is outdated. Matters can only be solved by negotiation and international pressure.'' **********But less moderate leaders could still push the summit meeting to a more extreme response, especially if the situation in the Palestinian territories deteriorates in the days leading up to the meeting. **********One unpredictable factor will be Iraq, which will be represented at a meeting of Arab leaders for the first time in 10 years. Since its invasion of fellow Arab League member Kuwait in 1990, Iraq has not been invited to the group's top-level meetings. It officially condemned Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, and has urged Arab nations to back a full-scale Palestinian war against Israel. **********But another maverick state, Libya, may not show up at all.

Muammar el-Qaddafi, has already called a draft statement presented to Arab League members to be so feeble that he may not bother to come to Cairo. **********''They will make fools of themselves in front of the people because they are so weak,'' he said of his fellow Arab leaders. ''It's as if they are standing naked without a fig leaf. We declare. We condemn. We call for. It's the same old communique.'' **********If the other Arab leaders on their way to Cairo now find themselves caught in a political vise between public anger and temperate diplomacy, it is partly one of their own making. **********Many governments have been playing with fire lately, stoking popular rage against Israel by constantly broadcasting scenes of past Arab-Israeli wars and war songs. State-owned newspapers have excoriated Jews and Judaism, as well as the United States. **********Anti-American and anti-Israeli protests throughout the region have recently been reinforced by open calls for boycotts of American products and denunciation of European and American companies as Israeli fronts. **********The drumbeat of hatred and suspicion has gotten so loud in Egypt that the British grocery chain Sainsbury's has posted signs in its windows proclaiming that it will do nothing to help Israel ''financially or politically.'' **********Arab leaders, without exception, also lionized the Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon, lauding them as a liberation movement that, through force of arms, drove Israel to abandon its occupation of southern Lebanon in May. **********Turning off public anger toward Israel, and calling for negotiations over war, may now prove difficult for moderate Arab leaders. **********''Nobody will have the courage to stand against the lowest common denominator of public opinion,'' said a former American diplomat to the Middle East.

Ballmer slapped his hands together loudly for emphasis. But only once. **********By any account, such a performance is low key for Mr. Ballmer, who on Thursday was named to succeed his longtime business partner and best friend, William H. Gates, as Microsoft's chief executive. Mr. Gates will remain the company's chairman and focus on shaping Microsoft's software strategy. **********Mr. Ballmer, who has been president of Microsoft for a year and a half, is known for his fist-pounding, bellowing, bombastic style. Though some suspect it is one of the most finely honed acts in the industry, no one disputes the passion he brings to his role as the industry's supersalesman. **********And no one disputes his intensity. **********Once in an interview, Mr. Ballmer gesticulated so wildly that he struck his forehead with his fingernail hard enough to draw blood. Apparently unfazed, he continued talking while dabbing at his wound. **********Mr. Ballmer is stepping forward to guide Microsoft's day-to-day business with the company under an array of competitive and legal assaults. It is only the latest challenge Mr. Gates has laid before him in his 20 years at Microsoft, from managing the company's software relationship with I.B.M. in the 1980's to taking responsibility for a ''holy war'' to heighten customer satisfaction over the last three years. **********Because of the special chemistry that has marked the business partnership between Mr. Ballmer, 43, and Mr. Gates, 44, few expect the change in leadership to have a noticeable effect on Microsoft's operations or its strategic direction. **********Central to that chemistry is the complementary nature of the two men's passions. Mr. Ballmer is the consummate business manager, thriving on operational details, while Mr. Gates takes legendary delight in pushing forward new technologies and plunging into arcana. **********''They're two halves of the same person,'' said a Microsoft executive who has worked closely with them for years. ''Together they constitute the finest business executive in the world.'' **********Investors showed no apprehension about the change today, with Microsoft shares rising $4.4375, to $112.25, recouping losses earlier in the week, on a generally strong day for technology stocks. **********Several years ago Mr. Gates and Mr. Ballmer said they had made a ''gut check'' and agreed they were committed to Microsoft at least until they reached 50. On Thursday, both said nothing had changed about that commitment. **********Other Microsoft executives who have spent years with the two men say it is the trust they built first as college friends that has distinguished their collaboration over the years. **********''They're still best friends,'' said Michael Swaine, co-author of ''Fire in the Valley: The Making of the Personal Computer'' (McGraw Hill, 2000). ''These guys were college pals, and after poker games at Harvard, Gates would stay up describing the games to Ballmer. In turn Ballmer got Gates to join a men's club to smoke cigars and wear a tuxedo.'' **********Indeed, unlike the high school friends Steven P. Jobs and Stephen Wozniak, who founded Apple Computer in 1976 but have grown more distant since the 1970's, Mr. Ballmer and Mr. Gates have grown only closer over the years. **********In an interview on Thursday with a small group of reporters after the announcement, they frequently completed each other's thoughts. **********After Mr. Gates said he would probably continue to kibitz by e-mail on day-to-day issues confronting Microsoft, Mr. Ballmer laughed and, sounding a bit like Martha Stewart, said, ''Reading e-mail from Bill is a good thing.'' **********So it is not at all unusual for Mr. Ballmer to step in to help lift the load from Mr. Gates. It has been a troubled time for the software executive and world's richest man. (His 15 percent share of Microsoft is worth about $88 billion, while Mr. Ballmer's 5 percent share is worth about $29 billion.) With the government antitrust case threatening both the company and his own reputation, Mr. Gates has described 1999 as ''the worst year in my life'' to confidants at Microsoft. **********With the company under siege, Mr. Ballmer has often led the counterattack with enthusiasm and gusto. **********Moreover, though Mr. Ballmer has a reputation as ''the sales guy,'' he actually has the technical credentials to match Mr. Gates. He majored in applied mathematics at Harvard, and part of the pair's original bond was that they were both ''math nerds'' who stood out even among the best and brightest. **********Mr. Ballmer loves to tell of how he outscored Mr. Gates in several crucial mathematics and economics tests. (Although Mr. Gates dropped out of Harvard to start Microsoft with his childhood friend Paul Allen, Mr. Ballmer stayed on to graduate and then joined Procter & Gamble, where he began his business career test-marketing cake mixes.) **********Mr. Ballmer's intellectual prowess has made it possible for him to step in and oversee the company's software development efforts at various crucial times. Now, with him as chief executive, even longtime competitors say they believe that the new division of labor will free both men to do what they each do best. **********''This is giving Steve the platform to do what he does really well,'' said Gordon Eubanks, a longtime Microsoft competitor and president and chief executive of Oblix Inc., an electronic-business software company in Cupertino, Calif. ''Until now it was complicated by the fact that Bill still had to do things, and it's very complicated for two people to share the day-to-day management of a company.'' **********One thing that few people believe will change is Microsoft's aggressive nature, which has earned Mr. Ballmer the industry nickname of the Embalmer. He has carried on a particularly spirited public rivalry with the chief executive of Sun Microsystems, Scott McNealy, a fellow Detroit native and Harvard acquaintance with one of the industry's sharpest tongues. **********But whatever his bluster or tactical bombast, Mr. Ballmer embodies the disciplined persistence that has marked Microsoft since its inception, coupled with a sense of humor. **********Many years ago, after a reporter misspelled his last name as ''Bullmer'' in an article about an early version of the company's Windows operating system, Mr. Ballmer highlighted the error in a celebration of the product at a trade show. He noted that it was just one additional bug in a troubled product the company was intent on improving."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/01/business/company-news-pratt-whitney-gets-200-million-jet-engine-order.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "2000-08-01", "snippet": "Pratt & Whitney unit of United Technologies Corp wins $200 million order from International Lease Finance Corp for jet engines for eight Airbus Industrie aircraft; value of deal could climb to $450 million if International Lease exercises options ...", "word_count": 73, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PRATT & WHITNEY GETS $200 MILLION JET ENGINE ORDER", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; PRATT & WHITNEY GETS $200 MILLION JET ENGINE ORDER", "body_text": " **********The Pratt & Whitney unit of the United Technologies Corporation said yesterday that it had won a $200 million order from the International Lease Finance Corporation for jet engines for eight Airbus Industrie aircraft.

In response, Gucci issued shares that diluted LVMH's holding to 20 percent, while allowing Pinault to buy a controlling 42 percent stake for $3 billion. **********Although a Dutch court originally upheld the transaction, the High Court in September ordered a review. As part of that process, LVMH filed a brief on Monday in which it accused Gucci, which operates from Italy but is incorporated in the Netherlands, of secretly granting hundreds of millions of dollars of stock options to Domenico de Sole, its chief executive, and Tom Ford, its head designer, to encourage them to negotiate with Pinault at the expense of LVMH. Pinault, which is controlled by Francois Pinault, is a bitter rival of LVMH, run by Bernard Arnault. **********Mr. de Sole, who has denied the accusations, said he and Mr. Ford planned to join a defamation lawsuit against LVMH that is soon to be filed by Gucci in Paris. **********''This is part of anticompetitive behavior by LVMH to destabilize Gucci,'' he said of LVMH's accusations. **********Specifically, Mr. de Sole said that the options could not have influenced his decision to negotiate with Pinault because they were made after Gucci appealed to Pinault in its bid to frustrate LVMH. It was not until June, or three months after Gucci and Pinault struck their deal, that Gucci began renegotiating Mr. Ford's contract, according to a statement released today. Mr. Ford was ultimately granted four million options in December, which are vested in four equal installments through June 2004 with strike prices beginning at $75 a share and graduating to $135. **********Mr. de Sole was granted a million options in June 2000, vesting through March 2003 with strike prices set in a similar range.

The per share price, 2.6 million yen, represented a premium of 18 percent over Japan Telecom's closing price on Tuesday. **********While the Japanese stock market fell over all today, Japan Telecom's shares jumped 3.64 percent, to 2.28 million yen, capping a gain of almost 40 percent since last week. **********Vodafone's main objective in making the purchase is to increase its role in and sway over Japan Telecom's wireless phone business, J-Phone, in which it currently holds a 26 percent stake. Increasing its share to 34 percent gives it a solid edge over its longtime rival British Telecommunications, which holds a 20 percent interest in the mobile unit. **********But British Telecom, which holds a 15 percent stake in the parent company, may end up buying some or all of AT&T's 15 percent stake in Japan Telecom. NTT DoCoMo Inc., the titan of Japan's mobile phone companies, recently took a 16 percent stake in AT&T Wireless, AT&T's mobile unit, with the understanding that AT&T would sell at least part of its Japan Telecom holding, and British Telecom is reportedly eager to take as much of it as AT&T is willing to sell. DoCoMo dominates Japan's vibrant mobile phone market with 33.56 million subscribers, or 59 percent of the country's cell phone users, as of November, but J-Phone has proved itself capable of thriving alongside the ever-expanding giant. Using eye-catching handsets and offering a full-color Internet browser, J-Phone is popular with young Japanese women, who are the vanguard of mobile phone users here. With 9.3 million subscribers, or 16.3 percent of the market, it is poised to become Japan's second-largest mobile phone operator. The subscriber base of the KDDI Corporation, Japan's second-largest telephone company and second-largest cellular service company, has dwindled to 10.28 million, or 18 percent of the market, from 11 million earlier this year, and analysts say it continues to lose ground. **********''In my mind, DoCoMo is like Toyota, J-Phone is like Honda and KDDI is like Nissan,'' said Mari Matsunaga, who was instrumental in DoCoMo's introduction of a mobile Internet service called i-mode and is now the editorial director of a Web site aimed at women. ''Toyota is steady and dependable, Honda is hip with young people and Nissan, well, Nissan is a little troubled.'' **********J-Phone gives its foreign shareholders a ringside seat at the rollout of third-generation mobile phone technology, which is set to start in Japan next year and will enable users to download video clips, music and other content-rich services. Japan is also far ahead of the rest of the world in terms of mobile Internet usage, with more than 16 million subscribers signing up since the debut in 1998. **********But J-Phone also faces financial pressures. It has had to increase the commission it pays retailers to sell its phones and services, and its Internet service is still a pale shadow of DoCoMo's i-mode. **********The Vodafone purchase provided a welcome windfall for the two railroad companies, which increased their earnings projections today as a result of the deal. Japan Telecom was founded by Japan's railway companies, which laid lines along their tracks. Its largest shareholder remains the largest of the companies, East Japan Railways, which has a 15.1 percent stake. **********While JR Tokai and JR West sold the bulk of their holdings, they were careful to make sure that the railways together maintained the biggest piece of Japan Telecom. ''We gave consideration to the fact that Vodafone's share should not surpass that of JR East, which is the top shareholder,'' said Kosuke Sugiyama, a spokesman for JR West."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/09/technology/amazon-subsidiary-subject-of-ftc-probe-and-two-lawsuits.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-02-09", "snippet": "Amazon Subsidiary Subject of FTC Probe and Two Lawsuits", "word_count": 532, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Amazon Subsidiary Subject of FTC Probe and Two Lawsuits", "print_headline": "Amazon Subsidiary Subject of FTC Probe and Two Lawsuits", "body_text": " **********Amazon Subsidiary Subject of FTC Probe and Two Lawsuits **********February 9, 2000 **********Amazon Subsidiary Subject of FTC Probe and Two Lawsuits By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS EATTLE -- A subsidiary of online retail giant Amazon.com Inc. is under scrutiny by the Federal Trade Commission and is the subject of two lawsuits over its use of private customer data. **********Digital Privacy **********Related Articles **********Ongoing Coverage of Digital Privacy **********Forum **********Can Privacy Be Protected Online? **********In a document filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, Amazon.com said the FTC was engaged in an \"informal\" investigation of Alexa Internet and its software, which tracks where users go on the World Wide Web in order to provide related Web links and other data. **********The FTC would not comment on its investigation. **********The two lawsuits mentioned in the SEC filing allege that Alexa's software, which is downloaded and installed on Web browsers like Netscape's Navigator and Microsoft's Internet Explorer, secretly intercepts personal data and sends that information to third parties, including Alexa's parent company, Amazon.com. **********\"We are cooperating completely with the FTC on an informal, voluntary basis,\" said Alexa spokeswoman Dia Cheney. \"As for the lawsuits, we believe the claims have no merit.\" **********Computer security consultant Richard Smith, who found the possible privacy problems in Alexa's software, said the privacy concern is in the way Alexa tracks Web pages in order to provide related links.

Hutton & Company brokerage firm during its heyday and through the scandal that led to its takeover, died Wednesday at a hospital near his home in Palm Beach, Fla. He was 75. **********Mr. Fomon, who retired as Hutton's chairman in 1987 after 35 years with the firm, died of a heart attack, said Philip Thomas, a former Hutton executive and longtime friend of Mr. Fomon. He had homes in New York and Paris. **********Under Mr. Fomon's leadership in the 1970's and 1980's, E. F. Hutton went public and grew rapidly into a securities firm with a household name. For most of those years, the firm attracted customers with one of the first and most memorable television advertising campaigns for a brokerage firm, using the slogan ''When E. F. Hutton talks, people listen.'' **********Mr. Fomon ordered those ads off the air in 1985 after the firm shocked its customers and competitors by pleading guilty to 2,000 felony counts of fraud stemming from an elaborate scheme to earn interest for itself on its customers' money. The Justice Department contended that Hutton earned as much as $8 million by systematically overdrawing its bank accounts and purposefully delaying clearing of checks from 1980 to 1982. **********Hutton paid $2 million in criminal fines to settle the charges, but Mr. Fomon was never implicated in the crimes. He maintained that he had not known about the practices. In a letter to The New York Times in December 1986, Mr. Fomon wrote that a chief executive should be entitled to rely on his subordinates to perform competently and faithfully. ''But that does not mean that the chief executive is personally liable for all the actions or failures of the other officers and managers,'' he wrote. **********Two months later, Hutton's directors relieved Mr. Fomon of operating control of the firm and handed the reins to Robert P. Rittereiser, who succeeded Mr. Fomon as chief executive. Hutton never recovered from the blow to its reputation. It was acquired by Shearson Lehman Brothers in 1988 for nearly $1 billion and the Hutton name eventually disappeared. **********Mr. Fomon took a loose approach to management but fostered a camaraderie that endured, Mr. Thomas said. Last month, about 200 former Hutton employees, including Mr. Fomon, gathered for a reunion at Chelsea Piers in Manhattan. **********A Chicago native who grew up in Appleton, Wis., as the child of two doctors, Mr. Fomon spent his entire career working at Hutton. He began in the firm's Los Angeles office in 1951, after graduating from the University of Southern California, and learned various aspects of the securities business, even some that Hutton had traditionally avoided, such as investment banking. **********His successful management of the firm's emerging corporate finance department attracted the attention of the firm's senior management in 1970 when three executives were locked in a stalemate over who should get the chief executive's job. Mr. Fomon said at the time that even he was surprised when he was tapped to move to New York and run the entire firm. **********Over the next 15 years, the feisty Mr. Fomon occasionally exchanged harsh words with the head of other major brokerage firms, including Merrill Lynch & Company. When Merrill accused Hutton of stealing its brokers and raiding its customers, Mr. Fomon shot back, ''If they can't hold their employees that's their problem; if they were running their business well, there's no way we could hire their employees.'' **********Mr. Fomon held various positions in the securities industry during his career. He was a governor of the New York Stock Exchange, chairman of the board of governors of the Pacific Stock Exchange and a member of the National Market Advisory Board to the Securities and Exchange Commission. **********He served on the advisory board of the University of Southern California Graduate School of Business Administration, which gave him its Alumni Award for Business Excellence.

Plans were being set out for either leader to come here before the end of this week. **********After a meeting between Mr. Arafat and his advisers today, a senior Palestinian official, Nabil Shaath, told Reuters that the leadership would deliver a letter to the American consulate in Jerusalem on Wednesday detailing its reservations about the proposals. The response would not be ''positive or negative,'' the official said. **********Mr. Barak, who called a cabinet meeting for Wednesday, said today that ''if Arafat says yes, we will not be able to fail to negotiate at this dramatic time for President Clinton.'' Israeli officials said privately that in the end they expected Mr. Barak to say ''yes, but,'' a diplomatic way of showing that he wanted to move ahead despite questions. **********The proposals, which Mr. Clinton made to Israeli and Palestinian negotiators last weekend, call for wrenching concessions by both sides.  At the heart of Mr. Clinton's plan is for Israel to cede sovereignty over the Temple Mount, while the Palestinians giving up the right of their refugees to return to Israel. **********Sovereignty over the Temple Mount, a national symbol for secular and religious Israelis, is an explosive issue in Israel, much as the right of Palestinian refugees to return to Israel has been the driving force of the Palestinian movement. **********President Clinton spoke with the Egyptian leader, Hosni Mubarak, on Monday morning to brief him on the proposal. Mr. Mubarak has been privately urging Mr. Arafat to go along with the Clinton proposals, an administration official said. **********[The Israeli prime minister's office said on Wednesday that Mr. Barak, Mr. Arafat and Mr. Mubarak would meet on Thursday in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el Sheik, Agence France-Presse reported. The meeting was decided upon during an overnight conversation between Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat, Israeli public radio said.] **********As administration officials waited for the formal replies and for continued midlevel contacts with both sides, they also briefed the foreign policy team of President-elect George W. Bush. **********Mr. Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, talked today to Mr. Bush's choice for that job, Condoleezza Rice. The chief Middle East negotiator, Dennis B. Ross, met with Gen. Colin L. Powell, the secretary of state-designate. **********The Bush team has not objected to a down-to-the-wire Middle East deal being completed under Mr. Clinton's watch. But at the same time, a Bush foreign policy adviser said today that the new administration wanted to make sure that any peace agreement was ''sustainable'' on the ground and not a deal between two leaders who were out of touch with their constituents. **********One of the components of the Clinton proposals likely to be of particular concern to the Bush team is the idea of an international force in the Jordan Valley that would, according to officials, include American soldiers. During the election campaign, Mr. Bush said the United States military was overcommitted to peacekeeping operations. **********If the White House plan is to proceed as senior officials hope, Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat would come for separate negotiating sessions that officials here expect to be the extremely tough. **********Mr. Clinton's proposals -- or ''parameters'' and ''options,'' as his advisers call them -- did not cover all issues. ''There is still a lot to be negotiated,'' a Clinton administration official said. **********The discussions between the administration and each leader would be arduous and detailed with no assurance of success because each side still has major questions that need to be clarified, another official said. **********Only if the separate talks with the leaders resolve each issue could a document be drawn up for signing, the officials said. **********The issues that need to be covered in those talks are all the basic ones: the exact size of a Palestinian state; security arrangements between the new state and Israel; the fate of Palestinian refugees now living in third countries; and the complexities of Jerusalem and the Temple Mount, known to Muslims as Haram al Sharif. Among the intricacies that need to be sorted out, according to officials familiar with the Clinton proposals, is the insistence by Israel that it maintain sovereignty below the surface of the Temple Mount, where Jewish archaeological sites remain unearthed, even if it cedes sovereignty above ground. **********On security issues, the Israelis want their air force to have the right to fly over the new Palestinian state, a notion that the Palestinians oppose. **********The Clinton administration is reasoning that the political pressures on both Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat make this an optimal moment for a deal. **********Mr. Barak's only hope of re-election on Feb. 6 is to go to the Israeli public with a peace agreement, and Mr. Arafat is weighing the high possibility that without such an accord he will face the conservative Ariel Sharon as the next Israeli leader. **********One measure of the pressure on Mr. Arafat was expressed by one of his advisers who has been consistently skeptical of the Clinton administration's efforts to date. The most difficult proposal for Mr. Arafat, the adviser said today, would be turning his back on the refugees. ''I don't know whether he can bite the bullet,'' the adviser said. ''But if he says no, it's a lost opportunity, particularly with a new president coming in.'' **********On the ground, the opposition to Mr. Arafat accepting the Clinton proposals was vehement. Marwan Barghouti, a leader of the Palestinian uprising, vowed to ''strongly confront'' a deal based on the proposals. ''Show me one Palestinian who would dare accept these American ideas or even thinks of accepting them,'' a defiant Mr. Barghouti said. **********Similarly, a firestorm of criticism from the Israeli right greeted Mr. Barak today. Mr. Sharon, who will oppose him in the elections as the candidate of the Likud Party, denounced the proposals, saying, ''One must remember that Jerusalem belongs to the entire Jewish people, and we have to be the guardians of the walls that were placed in our hands.'' **********The Likud party has vowed that if it wins the election, its government will not be bound by an agreement signed by Mr. Barak. **********Opposition in the Parliament to a rushed peace deal is also strong, and whether an accord would survive a vote there is very unsure."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/16/business/world-business-briefing-europe-cable-and-wireless-to-raise-cash.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Cowell", "pub_date": "2000-11-16", "snippet": "Cable and Wireless PLC will sell its mobile and residential phone businesses in Australia to amass cash for future acquisitions (S)", "word_count": 102, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CABLE AND WIRELESS TO RAISE CASH", "print_headline": "WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: EUROPE; CABLE AND WIRELESS TO RAISE CASH", "body_text": " **********Mobile and residential phone businesses in Australia are next on the block for Cable and Wireless P.L.C. of Britain, which is amassing cash for future acquisitions to expand its role as a global Internet service provider.

Of those, it found that 19 had begun taking payments for order flow, and had directed orders to specialists that were paying for it. One other firm had established reciprocal relationships that amounted to the same thing, while four firms have so far refused to accept the payments. **********The S.E.C. study did not identify the firms that were refusing to accept the payments. But it noted that while virtually all the brokerage firms said they tried to send orders to the best markets, the firms that took payments tended to choose markets that were different from the ones that did not have an economic stake in where the order was sent. **********An executive of one options exchange, speaking on the condition he not be identified, said the four not taking payments for order flow were Merrill Lynch, Salomon Smith Barney, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and PaineWebber. **********The commission found that from November 1999 through September 2000 the options specialists paid $33 million to retail brokerage firms for directing their orders, with one brokerage firm collecting $6 million and six others getting more than $2 million each. None of the large recipients passed those payments on to customers, either through reduced commissions or rebates. **********''In fact,'' the report said, ''only one firm has significantly reduced retail commissions for executing listed options orders, and another maintains a policy to rebate payments received for order flow to customers.'' **********But while the payment for order flow has clearly made money for brokerage firms, it is not clear if it has cost customers money. Those costs would show up in the spreads -- the difference between what a customer would have to pay for an option and what he could get by selling it at the same time. **********The S.E.C. measured such spreads three ways. By the first measure, the quoted spread, it appears that spreads fell when competition began, but have since risen back to the previous levels. The same picture emerges if one looks at another measure, which the S.E.C. called the realized spread, which compares the price a customer gets with the price at a later point in time, and thus takes into effect the informational value of a customers' trade. **********But by the third measure, the effective spread, which simply measures the difference between prices of actual customer buys and sells, the spread fell after competition came in and has remained around the lower level ever since. By that measure, which may be the best one, it appears that the costs of payments to brokers are being borne by the specialists, not passed on to customers in higher trading costs. Some at the commission say they believe that situation will not endure, and that realized spreads will widen as well. **********''The ultimate effect on investors remains to be seen,'' said Arthur Levitt, the S.E.C. chairman, in an interview yesterday. ''The case for continued vigilance is clear.'' **********Until August 1999, the options exchanges had generally observed a nonaggression policy, in which the exchanges did not try to trade options that historically had been traded at another exchange. But then, with a new options exchange on the horizon and the threat of antitrust action, they began to list one another's options, often relying on specialist firms that dominated the trading to bring in customer orders. **********But regulators did not make sure that the competition would arrive in a way that necessarily benefited customers. There was no electronic link between exchanges to allow an order to be sent to a market offering a better price, and there were no rules governing where orders were sent. **********In October 1999, Susquehanna, a large specialist operating in different options on various exchanges, began paying for order flow. Others soon followed, and business began moving toward those specialists. **********The Chicago Board Options Exchange, long the dominant exchange, found itself losing business and feared that its specialists, many of whom were not national firms, would be unable to compete effectively to purchase order flow. So it instituted a policy of imposing what amounted to a tax of 40 cents a contract on each trade, with that money paid by the specialist or floor trader that made the trade and being available to be paid for order flow. Other exchanges soon followed with similar plans, although nearly all of them decried the practice. **********Another way that competition could have gone would have been a strict time-price priority, in which the exchange that first posted a price would get the first order at that price. But the S.E.C. did not require that, and without electronic links it would have been difficult to enforce. **********In the current system ''specialists on the competing options exchanges typically will promise to match the displayed prices of other exchanges,'' the S.E.C. report said. ''These passive 'price matching' practices may weaken the incentive to display competitive quotes, because displaying a superior quote does not necessarily ensure attracting additional order flow. Over time, therefore, the quotes being matched may become wider, increasing execution costs to investors.'' **********Reaction from the options exchanges was muted. ''I'm happy the S.E.C. is going to continue to look at it, especially in the area of best execution,'' said Peter Quick, the president of the American Stock Exchange. Similarly, Meyer S. Frucher, the chairman of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, said ''payment for order flow is an abomination if it does not come with absolute best-execution requirements.'' They referred to the obligation of a broker to get the best price for a customer. **********Unfortunately, as the report noted, it is not easy to determine how good execution is. All the exchanges, and some of the specialists, are putting out information to show they provide quality executions, but the report noted that the reports are not comparable and that only the American Stock Exchange has been willing to provide information needed by an independent firm hired by some institutional investors to try to compile statistics."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/18/technology/military-spends-billions-to-ensure-us-battlefield-supremacy.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-09-18", "snippet": "FOR more than 40 years, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency has had the daunting assignment of making sure that no enemy \u2014 or, for that matter, any current friend \u2014 has access to tomorrow's technology faster than does the Defense Departm...", "word_count": 962, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Military Spends Billions to Ensure U.S. Battlefield Supremacy", "print_headline": "Military Spends Billions to Ensure U.S. Battlefield Supremacy", "body_text": " **********FOR more than 40 years, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency has had the daunting assignment of making sure that no enemy \u2014 or, for that matter, any current friend \u2014 has access to tomorrow's technology faster than does the Defense Department. **********Darpa, as the agency is known, has parceled out billions of dollars for research projects that can often seem risky, even far- fetched. But the agency assumes that the really disruptive innovations are rarely obvious in their early stages. **********\"Anytime you propose something that's clearly achievable, they say it's not a Darpa problem,\" said Jon Sherbeck, vice president for engineering at Mdot Aerospace , a Phoenix-based start-up company that won a small-business award from the agency recently for designing a gas turbine the size of a D-cell battery. **********Much of what turns out to be feasible never makes it beyond demonstration projects. Military and Congressional politics create some roadblocks and changing military priorities throw up others. **********And yet, no other organization has so frequently if unintentionally served as midwife to the technologies of today's information- driven economy. Darpa gave birth to the Internet in the late 1960's. Other projects helped create many of the nation's most impressive computers, the chips used in cellular phones and vital networking technologies like the ability to send simultaneous signals of many wavelengths down a single fiber optic cable. **********What's next? Well, as the agency told more than 1,000 engineers and high-technology executives who recently attended a three-day symposium in Dallas that summarized its current agenda, the next decade or two is likely to see extremes in miniaturization like molecule-size computers and six-inch spy planes. Machines, men and, perhaps, other living organisms like insects fitted with sensors will be joined in information networks of bewildering complexity for all sorts of military uses. The torrent of information could make today's network flow seem like a slow trickle. **********Breakthroughs in biology and new materials could also create surprising new possibilities. The new materials include amorphous metals that resist corrosion and, unlike normal crystalline metals, become harder under stress. **********For a relatively simple example of the agency's perspective, consider one of today's military mainstays, the Abrams tank. These battlefield wonders are more maneuverable and lethal than any other tank in operation. Their ability to accurately aim at enemy objects and fire on the move is unprecedented. With twice the range of Iraq's Russian-designed tanks, they played a major role in NATO's total domination of Iraq's larger army in the Persian Gulf war. **********But to the advanced projects agency and some Army officials thinking about combat in the future, such large tanks are probably at an evolutionary dead end. Seen through the lens of the information age, the functions of a tank would be scattered across a combat network. A variety of robotic cannons and missile launchers could deliver the firepower, supplementing their built-in intelligence with help from a distant, manned command center. Smaller, quicker armored vehicles with single, large guns and just one or two crew members might also have a role. **********A variety of heat, light and motion sensors on the ground and in the air could be networked to provide a much better picture of fighting conditions. Data would pour in not just from the ground vehicles but from satellites, low-flying miniature aircraft and, perhaps, thousands of pollen-size sensors floating like dust or attached to insects. **********With military budgets shrinking and private-sector information technology development growing at an explosive pace, the advanced projects agency is increasingly looking for ways to repackage civilian technology for the military as a cost-effective alternative to sponsoring novel projects. Unfortunately, the networks and information systems the private sector is promoting look disturbingly brittle, threadbare and unsuitable for military purposes. **********\"B2B and enterprise software are low- hanging fruit technically compared to defense needs,\" said Shankar Sastry, director of the agency's Information Technology Office, referring to products that allow businesses to interact with each other over the Internet and software that allows many parts of an enterprise from finance to production to marketing to share data. **********Darpa studies are looking at how to create and manage networks of up to 100,000 components that must be quickly able to shift how they communicate. Some components may periodically change functions \u2014 a device, for instance, might be monitoring radio signals at one moment and jamming them the next. **********Similarly, the agency is financing research on networks of information users. It wants the Defense Department to be able to set up coalitions of up to 100 allies capable of sharing secure information and coordinating logistics within minutes. Just as important, it wants to be able to cut a party off a network instantly and notify all other members. **********In both cases, the need for artificial intelligence is obvious. Even if the ability of humans to interact easily with computers were vastly improved by, say, flawless voice recognition software, the amount of information flooding in would be overwhelming. The agency's response includes research on software that can screen widely diverse data sources for relevant trends, automatically reshape networks and write new programs to respond rapidly to emerging needs. **********One project partly addressing such concerns is the effort to develop so-called Darpa agent markup language. D.A.M.L., as the language is known in technical circles, would would create a universal format for telling computers what kind of information is in a data source. It would allow Internet search machines to extract data not just from the World Wide Web but from computer programs, sensors and other machines. **********The computer language embodies one of the major changes the agency has confronted in adapting to the information age. While much of the agency's work still focuses on technology that it would just as soon see stay in American military hands, there are a growing number of developments that will go nowhere unless they also permeate civilian life."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/07/business/world-business-briefing-europe-france-mobile-phone-permits.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "2000-06-07", "snippet": "Franc to charge total of $19 billion for four new mobile phone licenses and invites companies to bid; France's three existing cellular companies, France Telecom, Cegetel's SFR unit and Bouygues Telecom, have said they will participate (S)", "word_count": 104, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FRANCE MOBILE-PHONE PERMITS", "print_headline": "WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: EUROPE; FRANCE MOBILE-PHONE PERMITS", "body_text": " **********France will charge a total of $19 billion for four new mobile phone licenses and invite companies to show why they should provide the next generation of wireless Internet services.

Whispering hosannas and desperate entreaties, they fasted and prayed for their sacrifices to bring peace to their battered country. **********They have followed this ritual --  with much fervor but little success --  for 27 years now. **********In Haiti, where ''hope'' is a word spoken more in relation to leaving the island than healing it, and many go hungry by fate and not faith, hundreds of men and women journey three times a week to Jesus of Miracles, a prayer center founded in 1973 by Marie-Louise Jeanvier. **********She died five years ago, a prophet who went back to be with her maker, her followers say. But the crowds still come to hear her son Billy preach words of comfort and confidence. **********The pilgrims who come have endured rain, hot sun or flaming barricades and rioting on the streets. They keep coming because they, like many Haitians, want change. **********''We believe and we want peace for our country,'' said Madame Jean-Charles, a short woman with a no-nonsense glare. ''God created us to eat, to sleep and to live in peace. We pray for God to deliver this country.'' **********But should that fail, she said with a gleam in her eyes, she'll settle for another delivery: that of a visa. **********''We pray to find a little money to go live in another country,'' she said. ''New York or Miami. That's a small thing for Jesus of Miracles.'' **********The faithful recall that Marie-Louise was a preacher's niece who became popular singing in a Port-au-Prince church in the early 1970's, even before she embarked on her mission, which is unaffiliated to any formal religious denomination. **********Like a prophet in the wilderness, they said, she took to the mountains up by the sanitarium in Carrefour Feuilles with a dozen followers. They said she could look at you and tell what was wrong, and with a touch, she could heal. **********Her son Billy, who put aside his dream of becoming a doctor at his mother's request so he could follow her in her ministry, said her following grew with her reputation. **********''My mother said everyone who wanted to glorify Jesus, if they wanted something -- money or a house -- they had to climb up a tree they had on the mountain and shake it to give God glory,'' he said. **********Some dollars might have fallen off the tree, at least for Marie-Louise, since thankful pilgrims often gave her money. Among the crowd outside the Delmas house, people talked about the houses and four cars she once owned. **********Her son, who said he lived a much simpler life, said he was not one to judge. **********''This changed her life because when she started out she was nothing,'' he said. ''That was her standard of living. She was a servant of God, like King David. God blesses you. King David had land, rubies and jewels. These days, like with preachers in the States, you can't have these things. But if God blesses you, you should be able to do what you want.'' **********She came down from the mountain in 1986, right after the dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled the country, which soon was swept up in looting and revenge. She had been targeted, her followers said, because she had once prayed for him and peace in Haiti. **********The peace she sought has been elusive. She died of a respiratory illness in 1995, and her son David, then 19, found himself leading prayers in the courtyard of the Delmas home, where he sat before the crowds in the same high-backed dining-room table his mother had used. **********Her son knows that praying for peace seems futile in a country that has known precious little of it. But he said the merest glimmer of hope was enough to keep him going. **********''We have faith,'' he said. ''God can change something today if He wants. We have faith. That's why people feel there is something peaceful here.'' **********People trudge to the house early in the morning, the women wrapping their heads in red and white prayer cloths and dropping a few cents into the collection box. Even before the six-hour service began, some women swayed gently with their eyes closed and their arms spread wide in conversation with the drawing of a Creole-featured Christ that announces over the gate: ''Jesus of Miracles, Comforter of the Afflicted.'' **********The afflictions are large and small. Soon after the songs fade, the worshipers lay flat on the rocky, dirt road and bury their heads in prayers. Their chests heave as their sobs fill the air. One woman clutched a photograph of the man who got her daughter pregnant. **********''Jesus of Miracles, I am tired,'' she said. ''Jesus of Miracles, make him come back. Jesus of Miracles, make him take care of the baby he left. Give me strength.'' **********Willeur Fleury, himself a preacher, stood nearby and rested his head against the wall in front of the house. While he leads another congregation, he still comes by when he can. **********''We come and pray so that some special doors will open for our country,'' he said. ''All kinds of doors. We do not want any more political problems. We pray that God will stop those people with bad spirits.'' **********Many people who grow tired waiting decades for the door to peace to be finally opened opt to just leave. But in sermons peppered with rapid-fire ''Amens,'' Billy reminded them it is the easy way out. **********''Don't think about your problems,'' he said during the service. ''Stop thinking about immigration. This is with you 24 hours a day. Haiti has to change.'' **********By the end of the afternoon, the worshipers hugged one another and filed out into the street, singing as their footsteps kicked up small clouds of dirt. **********''You are my consolation,'' they sang. ''You are my best friend. Of all, you are the one who never changes. You are the rock.'' **********Billy sat in the now-empty courtyard, tired. A smile creased his face. **********''One day, God will give us a government with five or six people with a good heart,'' he said. ''That's the only way something will change.

In the afternoons, he helped his parents plant crops in the rugged mountains outside this city in northeastern Colombia. **********But Juan's simple world changed four months ago, just weeks after he turned 12, when rebels from Colombia's largest guerrilla group offered him a life of adventure he never could have found in his town, Pamplona. **********''They said they'd give me a gun, that they'd pay me,'' Juan recounted during an interview. ''I thought, 'This is good.' I wanted to earn some money.'' **********But instead of new opportunities, Juan, a wavy-haired boy with a precocious grin and spindly arms, spent weeks learning how to disassemble, clean and fire AK-47's and Galil assault rifles for the rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. Two months ago, he used those weapons in combat, and recalled proudly that eight enemy fighters had been killed. **********The use of child fighters in Colombia's 36-year-old guerrilla conflict is nothing new. But international and Colombian agencies that track the use of child fighters say FARC might rely on children to a larger degree than thought. **********A month-long series of skirmishes between the Colombian Army and a rebel column in the high mountains above Bucaramanga has opened a new window onto the use of teenage warriors in the intensifying conflict: Thirty-two of the 77 rebel fighters captured by army troops have been below the age of 18, and 19 of those were 15 and under, including Juan. Of the 46 killed, 20 were children. **********Colombian military officials say they believe that as many as half the FARC fighters who comprised the original 360-member column were under 18. **********''If this is representative of the proportion of kids in the groups, then the figures are much bigger than the 6,000 that we've talked about in the past,'' said Carel De Rooy, Unicef representative in Colombia. ''What this could mean is, the proportion of children could be twice what we thought, or they're throwing kids to the front as cannon fodder.'' **********Indeed, the Colombian military has long contended that FARC employs children on the front lines. Gen. Martin Carreno, commander of the Fifth Brigade here, said soldiers under his command in other regions have often fought against children. **********''They said that the first wave of fighters that they'd launch were children, 12, 13, 15 years old,'' said the general, who is overseeing the campaign against FARC outside Bucaramanga. ''The child doesn't have that sense of danger. Even when there's firing, they don't have that vision that they're going to get shot.'' **********Analysts who have tracked the use of child guerrillas confirm that children are often placed in harm's way for strategic purposes. **********''They might be using them for intelligence gathering or to see if the path is clear,'' said Rachel Stohl, a senior analyst with the Center for Defense Information, a Washington-based organization that follows military issues. **********Ms. Stohl said the use of under-age fighters persists in 30 conflicts, with international agencies estimating the number of child warriors at 300,000, with 50 governments recruiting teenagers into their armies. **********''What they'll do -- and this is not just the Colombians -- they'll put the child soldiers in the front lines to test the ground, to clear the area of land mines,'' she said, ''and those who make it make it and those who don't, oh well.'' **********Teenagers who recently surrendered to the army outside Bucaramanga described a disorienting experience with FARC. **********Most of them -- children of peasant farmers from poor regions -- said they were recruited with promises of good pay and social status. **********After three months of training in the southern jungles, they were told they would form part of an important column of fighters who would travel 700 miles north to reinforce a rebel front in the Middle Magdalena River Valley, in north-central Colombia. **********''They told us that we would complete a mission and then they'd send us back,'' said Hector Sosa, 13, a FARC deserter interviewed in the presence of a Colombian army major hours after he surrendered. ''One side of me was afraid. On the other side, I wasn't. But I was afraid that I would get killed.'' **********The column began its arduous journey in July but never reached its objective. Instead, for four weeks, 1,500 Colombian army troops have hounded rebels of the so-called Arturo Ruiz Column since they were discovered crossing the high Andes. **********At a private home for delinquent children near here, 14 boys -- all of them rebels captured in recent days in the fighting outside Bucaramanga -- described a variety of reasons for joining FARC, from promises of glory to facing threats if they did not. **********The children, dressed in red shorts and blue T-shirts of the private organization caring for them, seemed relaxed and content, joking with each other as they spoke with a reporter. They have been told that, with the help of the government's Family Welfare Institute, they will be resettled with their families. Two army officials who helped organize the encounter were also present. **********''I wanted to join because I liked it,'' said one boy, 15, who like others interviewed was not allowed to give his name. ''They had reunions, and they said the best group was FARC. I liked the things we did: standing guard, the weapons course, the training.'' **********Another talkative boy, 13, said he joined two years ago after the rebels recruited him to help pave a road. After days of tiring work, he was offered a chance to join, with the promise that he would no longer work on the road. **********''They told us to join the guerrillas, that it was good, that we wouldn't have to carry rocks anymore,'' recalled the boy, who giggled as he recounted his experiences. **********He was also told about FARC's reason for fighting. ''I was told that we would have an offensive to take the power,'' he said. ''We were told that we would have a government like Cuba's.'' **********But all the boys, even those who said they had joined the group freely, said they quickly lost enthusiasm as they journeyed north in the Arturo Ruiz Column. By the time they reached the high mountains outside Bucaramanga, army patrols were in pursuit and helicopters were firing at them. **********''I was told by one guerrilla, who had been in five years, that we would be killed if we turned ourselves in,'' said one boy, age 17. ''So I was afraid.'' **********Juan, the boy from Pamplona, said he was not able to carry his food pack or weapon during the march. He had lost all enthusiasm, but he said he could not escape. **********''When they said they wouldn't pay me, I said, 'Let me out,' and they said I'd have to stay until the day I died,'' he said.

The move would take another multigeneration newspaper family, the Pulliams, out of the business. **********A few hours later, a second announcement confirmed that the Gannett Company and Community Newspaper Holdings Inc. were growing bigger by buying the bulk of the 49 newspapers the Thomson Corporation had put on the block four months ago. **********Gannett is paying $1.13 billion for 21 daily newspapers in Louisiana, Maryland, Ohio, Wisconsin and Utah. With the acquisition, the company enhances its dominance in the daily circulation division. It will now own 94 newspapers, including its flagship, USA Today, with a combined circulation of about seven million. The 31 newspapers of No. 2 Knight Ridder have a combined daily circulation of just under four million. **********Community Newspaper Holdings, which is financed by the resources of the Retirement Systems of Alabama, paid $455 million for 17 papers in Indiana, southern Georgia and the Appalachian region of West Virginia and western Maryland. After the purchase, the company will own 112 daily newspapers with a combined circulation of almost 1.1 1 million. **********Owen Van Essen, the president of Dirks, Van Essen & Murray, the newspaper brokerage firm based in New Mexico, said yesterday that these deals, coupled with the $8 billion purchase of Times Mirror by the Tribune Company and a variety of other pending agreements were likely to push the total amount of money spent on newspaper purchases to $15 billion by the end of the year. **********For the newspaper industry, that is a breathtaking number, 150 percent higher than ever before. As Mr. Van Essen said, ''The previous record was $6.2 billion in 1997, and we blew through that with the Tribune deal alone.'' **********''Relative to other media segments, the amounts are still very, very small,'' Mr. Van Essen said. ''There's going to be $40 billion of TV that sells and $30 billion of radio and probably $50 billion of cable. By newspaper standards, this is a lot of activity. But the consolidation frenzy is just catching on with newspapers.'' **********The announcement of Central Newspapers -- whose stock symbol, ECP, mirrors its founder's initials -- powered its stock to a 65 percent gain yesterday; the share price increased by $20.50, to $52. **********But with all the mergers, the vestiges of hometown newspapering are fewer and fewer. The conservative Pulliam family -- one of whose members is Dan Quayle, the former vice president -- was strongly identified with Indianapolis, where it published two newspapers until The Indianapolis News folded last fall. **********Gregory Favre, a vice president of the McClatchy Company whose tour in newspapering has given him a close view of a generation's worth of changes in the industry, said yesterday that the Pulliam family, ''meant a tremendous amount in Indianapolis -- like any great publishing family.'' He added, ''It's a loss to any community to lose a family like that.'' **********The proposed sale is the second instance this year of a multigeneration newspaper family deciding to sell the business it created. **********And, as with the Chandlers in Los Angeles, the controlling shares of the company -- in Central's case, the Class B shares -- were held in trust for the Pulliam descendants. As with the Chandler trusts, the Eugene C. Pulliam trust contained language that posed a barrier to any sale. **********According to the trust document, the limitations on the trustees' power to sell their Central stock ''shall become void'' if they determine that remaining independent would ''seriously threaten'' to cause ''substantially complete loss'' of the shares' value. **********But Central's dropping stock price -- before yesterday, it had lost 20 percent of its value this year -- and the very high valuations that newspapers have commanded recently helped create a climate in which the three trustees -- the former chief executive, Frank E. Russell; the current chief executive, Louis H. Weil; and Myrta J. Pulliam, a granddaughter of the company's founder -- decided to sell. **********Neither Mr. Weil nor Ms. Pulliam would comment on the decision when contacted yesterday. **********Stuart Garner, the president of Thomson Newspapers, kept his comments brief, saying that he was ''very pleased'' with the prices the two companies paid for the 38 newspapers. Someone else who knew the terms of the deal said that Gannett and Community Newspaper Holdings paid prices that averaged about 12.8 times 12-month earnings before interest and taxes. The sale of the remaining 11 daily newspapers in the United States is expected to be completed within days. One source said there were four potential buyers, including Media General, which is based in Richmond, Va. **********Also out for bid are a large group of newspapers currently owned by Hollinger International Inc., the company of Conrad Black, as well as some smaller-circulation newspapers owned by The New York Times Company. None of these match the size of The Republic, which has a daily circulation of 482,000. The Republic's daily circulation dipped slightly in the last reporting period, but not as much as that of The Star, which dropped more than 8 percent, to 247,000. **********Nonetheless, although no executives of likely buyers like Knight Ridder and McClatchy would talk on the record about the prospects, one who spoke on condition of anonymity said: ''Phoenix is a great market.

Apart from the fact that it was the first event of its kind in half a century, the meeting aroused their fascination for a tangible reason: Kim Jong Il owes them money. **********Mr. Adams runs the Aberdeen Exotic Debt Fund, which specializes in paper issued by five countries \u2014 Cuba, Iraq, North Korea, Serbia and Sudan \u2014 that have become disconnected from the rest of global society, but not before running up debt to foreign banks that they cannot repay. Mr. Booth is a fund manager at Ashmore Investment Management, which has a broader emerging-market fund that holds some of the pariah states' debt. **********It is hard to imagine a reason for wanting to own such stuff, which is, perversely, why somebody might want to take a chance on it. **********The economic and political backdrops in these countries are extremely poor and the prospects of repayment \u2014 of interest, let alone principal \u2014 are seen by the market as remote at best, Mr. Adams explained. The result is that prices have fallen to levels that factor in just about every further bad thing that may happen but not any potential good news. Even the best of the debt trades at 10 percent of face value, and Sudan's can be bought for 3.5 cents on the dollar. **********Aside from the Korean summit meeting, Mr. Adams cited a number of promising developments that could give the pariah debt a boost. The increase in crude oil prices is bringing desperately needed foreign currency to Sudan, for instance, and the U.S. Congress, in the aftermath of the saga of the Cuban schoolboy Elian Gonzalez, is considering easing the embargo of the island. **********\"It is a tiny part of the market, but there is a lot going on with the countries involved,\" Mr. Adams said. \"Prices are historically at virtually all-time lows.\" **********But that is the problem: As heartening as these developments may be, they have done virtually nothing to lift prices. In the days after the summit meeting, Mr. Booth said, the price of North Korean debt was only \"moving up a little.\" **********North Korean and Cuban debt are trading near 10 cents on the dollar, far from the highs two or three years ago of 59 cents and 28 cents, respectively. As is often true of beaten-down assets, it is easier to make the case that the debt was a bad investment then than a good one now. But in the past few days, North Korean debt has been rallying. **********Mr. Booth contended that investor interest has yet to filter down to the world's worst credit risks because higher-quality, less obscure debt is still appealingly priced. **********\"There are a lot of other opportunities out there,\" he observed. \"Always the last stuff to go up is at the exotic end. No market is perfect, but emerging markets are particularly imperfect.\" **********The market in exotic debt is the least perfect. Being extremely thin, with cavernous spreads between buying and selling prices, trading can be expensive and volatile. That means that investors in Aberdeen Exotic should be prepared for a long and bumpy ride. **********Bill Blevins, managing director of Blevins Franks International Ltd., a British company that manages money for wealthy private clients, said he thought the fund deserved a place in the portfolio of sufficiently well-off investors willing to accept the potential pitfalls. **********\"I think as a small part of a well diversified portfolio, it is likely to produce decent returns, despite volatility, over time,\" Mr. Blevins said. **********\"The team looking after the decision-making at Aberdeen,\" he added, \"are a very good bunch of debt researchers. The name of the fund will attract interest, but investors should not be deluded into thinking this will be a necessarily smooth ride. I would think this a worthwhile long-term investment, so long as the client understands the risks.\" **********In its short life, Aberdeen Exotic has turned in mediocre performance, rising 8.9 percent between Jan. 31 and June 9, compared with a 12.5 percent gain for the average offshore emerging-market debt fund tracked by Lipper Inc. Mr. Adams attributed the weak return \u2014 28th best out of 38 funds \u2014 to such factors as the debt's wide buy-sell spreads, but he was unconcerned about small day-to-day movements.

Putin today told Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain that he was willing to give human rights organizations more access to the war zone in Chechnya. **********But with Russian troops fighting some of the bloodiest battles of the five-month war, Mr. Putin, the certain favorite in Russia's March 26 presidential elections, gave no ground as Mr. Blair pressed for peace talks with Chechen rebels. **********The two men, both lawyers by training and of the same generation, met for the first time in the imperial splendor of Petrodvorets, the seaside palace built by Peter the Great, the czar whose portrait hangs in Mr. Putin's office in homage to his role as state builder and Westernizer. **********Mr. Blair, who was accompanied by his wife, Cherie, was later given a whirlwind cultural tour of the old imperial capital, which also happens to be Mr. Putin's hometown. **********The setting added symbolism to a visit that Mr. Putin clearly hopes will set the tone for relations with Western counterparts as he establishes his identity in the club of world leaders. **********The newspaper Segodnya today recalled Boris Yeltsin's penchant for no-tie get-togethers and habit of meeting world leaders in sweaters and slacks, commenting that Mr. Putin prefers a more imperial style. **********Facing down criticism at home for meeting a leader responsible for a war notable for its brutality, Mr. Blair seemed set today to establish a working relationship with Russia's new leader, and to keep the dialogue with Moscow open. **********''I'd like to say how much I enjoyed the dialogue, which was a very good omen for the future,'' Mr. Blair said after his first meeting with the Russian acting president, in a comment that seemed to take for granted Mr. Putin's victory in the upcoming election. **********Mr. Putin today acknowledged Mr. Blair's concerns about the Russian military campaign, which has been repeatedly criticized in the West for its violence, particularly against the civilian population. **********Mr. Putin said, ''The Russian leadership, and I personally, must understand what lies behind this position'' of Mr. Blair. ''I must admit that Russia is making adjustments after such meetings. Russia is paying particular attention to the opinion of its foreign partners, especially such esteemed politicians as Tony Blair.'' **********Sergei Prikhodko, a top Kremlin foreign policy adviser, described the meetings between Mr. Blair and Mr. Putin today as a very energetic and open conversation between two very energetic and open leaders. **********Later, Mr. Putin gave Mr. Blair a tour of the Hermitage, the art museum in the czars' Winter Palace, and in the evening, both men and their wives, as well as James Wolfensohn, chairman of the World Bank, attended a gala premiere of ''War and Peace,'' an opera by Prokofiev based on the Tolstoy novel, at the legendary Mariinsky Opera House, known in Soviet times as the Kirov. **********Mr. Putin also held talks with Mr. Wolfensohn today on the coming release of two loans from the World Bank. **********Russia hopes to get $100 million under a so-called coal loan around this month and $250 million of a social protection adjustment Loan in April. Both loans go directly to the budget and are conditional on Russia meeting certain requirements, including closing unprofitable mines and managing state subsidies better. **********In his role as presidential host, Mr. Putin set a sharp contrast with Mr. Yeltsin, who in his last years in office often stumbled at public ceremonies, or made gaffes that made Russians wince in shame. **********But, as several Russian commentators noted today, both men seem interested in adding a personal touch to the Russian-British relationship that in recent years has lagged behind Moscow's rapport with other European capitals. **********In 1984, the year before he became the Soviet Communist Party's general secretary, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, then a member of the Politburo, traveled to Britain with his wife, Raisa, for an informal meeting with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. **********Mrs. Thatcher afterward proclaimed Mr. Gorbachev to be a man she could do business with, a comment that set the tone for the new Soviet leader's reception abroad. **********The Chechen war and Mr. Putin's past as a K.G.B. agent have raised concerns both in the West and among members of Russia's small liberal elite about his commitments to a free press, political pluralism and other democratic standards. **********So far, Mr. Putin's administration has sent mixed signals. **********Yesterday, a top military official, meeting with representatives of Human Rights Watch, an organization that has documented cases of atrocities committed by the Russian troops in Chechnya, did not dispute their facts and agreed that the mentality of the Russian military must be changed. **********At the same time, Russia's top military prosecutor today told reporters that the crime rate among troops fighting in Chechnya was only one-fourth of that among troops posted elsewhere, because soldiers are too busy fighting to commit crimes. **********In Chechnya today, battles raged in the villages in the foothills of the Caucasus mountains, as Russian troops fought to push out rebel guerrillas who have held on to their positions, defying Russian predictions of victory. **********Russian officials yesterday acknowledged that 156 servicemen had been killed in the past week, making it one of the bloodiest of the war. **********-------------------- **********Panel Decries Devastation **********GROZNY, Russia, March 11 (Agence France-Presse) -- A European parliamentary delegation expressed shock today at the scale of devastation here in Chechnya's capital as it visited the republic to investigate reports of human rights abuses by Russian forces. **********Lord Judd, the British head of the delegation from the Council of Europe, a 41-nation body that has come to assume a watchdog human rights role since the fall of Communism, deplored the civilian suffering during Russia's five-month crackdown in the rebel territory. He spoke after an hour-long guided tour of the city's shattered ruins by a Russian general, Gennady Troshev. **********''It seems to me terrible that at the beginning of the 21st century, on the continent of Europe itself, you can see large-scale destruction and consequent suffering,'' the British politician told journalists. **********''It seems to be that ordinary innocent people are the ones who have paid the highest price,'' he added. **********The 10-member European team interviewed two young women in a Grozny street, amid a mass of bomb craters and destroyed buildings  pockmarked by bullets. **********Russian forces seized the rebel capital at the beginning of February after weeks of relentless bombardment and fierce street clashes that reportedly caused widespread civilian casualties. **********The European delegation also visited Russia's Chernokozovo detention center, which has been the focus of several reports of rape, beatings and other human rights abuses by Russian troops. During a hasty 35-minute visit to the camp, the delegation interviewed two Chechen men and four women, the latter complaining that they had not been granted access to a lawyer. **********Upon return to the Council of Europe's headquarters in Strasbourg, France, the delegation will report on their findings, which will be central to determining whether Russia retains its membership in the body. Moscow joined in 1996. **********Membership in the Council of Europe is seen as a badge a post-Communist nation should earn to be considered a full democracy allowed to seek membership in the European Union and NATO."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/16/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-devito-verdi-tops-new-york-addys.html": {"writer_name": "Patricia Lauro", "pub_date": "2000-03-16", "snippet": "DeVito/Verdi takes top honors at annual presentation of New York Abbys, formerly known as Best of New York American Advertising Awards, which are sponsored by American Advertising Federation (S)", "word_count": 125, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DeVito/Verdi Tops New York Addys", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; DeVito/Verdi Tops New York Addys", "body_text": " **********DeVito/Verdi in New York took top honors at the 15th annual presentation of the New York Addys, formerly known as the Best of New York American Advertising Awards, which are sponsored by the American Advertising Federation. **********At a ceremony last week, DeVito/ Verdi received 12 awards, followed by Cliff Freeman & Partners in New York with nine and Ogilvy & Mather New York, part of the Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide unit of the WPP Group, with seven.

And even though he is an ethnic Tatar, a people often derided here -- a millennium after the fact, to boot -- as Attila the Hun's henchmen. And even though he and his family left Russia four years ago to live and play tennis in the sunnier climes of Valencia, Spain. **********Mr. Safin's accomplishment far outweighed any imagined negatives. On Sunday, he became the first Russian ever to win the United States Open. Better still, he did it by demolishing the reigning American champion of world tennis, Pete Sampras, in straight sets. **********It would be wrong to say Russians bear the average American any great ill will. On the other hand, it would be just as wrong to say Russians have not been itching for the opportunity to show that they are as good as the so-called sole remaining superpower, particularly after a devastating August of submarine sinkings, flaming television towers and stage whispers that the Russian bear can no longer manage his own affairs, much less the world's. **********And so President Vladimir V. Putin hailed ''a bright new star'' in the tennis firmament, and added, ''we are pound that today's victor is a Russian.'' Reporters trailed Mr. Safin to a New York nightclub to chronicle his early-morning victory celebration. And this evening, the young tennis star's New York triumph -- and his $800,000 first prize -- led all three network newscasts. **********''On behalf of all Russians, we will be your fans,'' cooed an anchorwoman on ORT, Russian Public Television, at the end of a telephone interview on the 8 p.m. news. **********''We're happy to have such young men being so optimistic,'' chimed her male co-anchor. **********A reporter for NTV, a competing network, cheered, ''The first Russian who is the U.S. champion!'' and then deadpanned, ''Nobody heard anything from Marat that he wanted to change citizenship.'' **********Although his parents moved him to Spain in 1996, where he established a base for his tennis career, there seems little doubt in Mr. Safin's mind today of where his roots lie. He is no stranger to Moscow, his hometown, where he has occasionally been spotted at stylish nightclubs. **********When a reporter for the newspaper  Izvestia tracked him down before sunrise on Monday in a New York disco -- drinking celebratory beer, not vodka -- the new Open champion credited much of his victory to the counsel of Aleksandr V. Volkov, the Russian tennis star who had earlier made it to the Open semifinals. **********And he made it clear that his next stop, before flying to Sydney and a spot on the Russian tennis team in the summer Olympics, would be Tashkent, Uzbekistan, a former Soviet country where he had committed himself to friends to play in a decidedly lower-rung tournament. **********The nation seemed to return the embrace. From the top down, Russia -- and its Soviet predecessor -- have long pigeonholed people by religion and ethnicity beyond what most Westerners would consider acceptable. Tatars and Caucasians, usually Muslim, usually darker-skinned people, have borne the brunt of discrimination, and Mr. Safin's name marks him as being of Tatar descent. **********But today, news accounts did not identify the new tennis sensation as a ''Rusian,'' the term applied to Russian citizens who are not necessarily Slavs, but instead as a ''Russki,'' the label usually reserved for Russia's majority Slavic population. **********At least one Russian Internet chat site noted sarcastically tonight that the Soviet government once conferred the same appellation on another Tatar who gained world-class status in his field, Rudolf Nureyev. **********But in an age when Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan have made race an afterthought in sports, it was unclear whether Russians were appropriating a Tatar achievement or the achiever himself as their own. **********Or perhaps, as Labor Minister Aleksandr Pochinok observed, all Russia has a more powerful reason to celebrate Mr. Safin's victory. Not only has a major new force in tennis surfaced in Russia, he told the newsradio station Echo Moskvy -- but ''a major new taxpayer'' has arrived, too."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/25/business/world-business-briefing-world-trade-ilo-reports-union-repression.html": {"writer_name": "Elizabeth Olson", "pub_date": "2000-05-25", "snippet": "International Labor Organization report says workers trying to organize face increased risk of intimidation, threats and murder around the world; says trade unions are barred in Oman, Saudi Arabia and United Emirates, and governments restrict such...", "word_count": 90, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "I.L.O.

Nikolai N. Urakov, pledged to open the ''curtain of secrecy'' that enshrouded the 25-year-old complex and to dispel the ''lack of trust'' in its conversion from military to peaceful research. **********General Urakov said he wanted to expand cooperation with the United States, European nations and other countries that have forsworn germ weapons. **********He said although the institute had shrunk by half, to 1,125 employees, and the lab had not overcome the economic crisis caused by the Soviet Union's collapse a decade ago, the staff was stabilizing, and some scientists had even returned after working abroad or in business. **********Western officials said international aid to Obolensk provided the means to employ more than half the scientists here. **********The United States assistance and other foreign aid, which is administered through an international group that audits grants to insure that they are spent on designated research, has given more than $3.4 million to Obolensk. **********Only Vector, the country's other leading former germ warfare center, has received more assistance from the international group, the International Science and Technology Center. Vector once specialized in turning viruses into weapons. **********Today, conference participants were given a tour of the complex and its infamous Building No. 1, an austere nine-story glass and metal structure where the most top secret weapons research was once conducted. **********Roaming through the labs and chatting informally with their Russian counterparts in areas that were once off limits to anyone not wearing special suits, the scientists discussed the research into peaceful goals, including tuberculosis, anthrax vaccines and molecular genetics. **********Floyd P. Horn, director of the United States Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service, called the quality of the presentations superb. **********Scientific cooperation between Russian and American scientists would ''clearly benefit both parties,'' he said. **********Dr. Horn's agency is providing $325,000 this year for research into pig diseases, along with computer equipment that will give this remote center access to the American National Agricultural Library. **********A Defense Department official said the meetings, the tour and the growing American and international access ''dispels the suspicion that Obolensk is still conducting offensive germ research.'' **********Several conservative legislators and intelligence experts contend that Moscow is continuing to pursue such research. But a recent report by the General Accounting Office found no evidence of such research here or at Vector. **********In interviews this week, Russian scientists said that they were determined to relegate the past work in such areas to history. **********''We still are not permitted to discuss the past,'' a scientist said. ''But we know our future lies in fighting the terrorism and diseases that threaten all mankind.'' **********Several scientists said privately they were delighted by their growing contacts with Western counterparts and the end of the isolation that they had once endured as germ warriors. **********Life remains difficult in Obolensk, where many top scientists, paid less than $100 a month, are required to have second jobs to make ends meet. **********But many scientists said they were encouraged to remain in science not only by the prestige that such employment still brings in this society, but also by new exchanges with American colleagues. **********Last month, two senior Obolensk scientists delivered two rare anthrax strains to centers in Atlanta and Fort Detrick, Md., as part of an exchange program negotiated this year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/10/technology/news-watch-interviews-with-the-stars-past-and-present.html": {"writer_name": "Shelly Freierman", "pub_date": "2000-08-10", "snippet": "Museum of Television and Radio in New York has begun project to interview people from television and radio about their work; several of videotaped interviews are on museum's Web site; some highlights noted; photo (S)", "word_count": 323, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Interviews With the Stars, Past and Present", "print_headline": "NEWS WATCH; Interviews With the Stars, Past and Present", "body_text": " **********The Museum of Television and Radio in New York has begun a project to interview people from television and radio about their work.

Morgan was the first modern American commercial bank to break out of the restrictions imposed on banking in the 1930's during the Depression, becoming a contender on Wall Street by underwriting stock offerings and advising on gigantic mergers. **********But as much as the company strained to reclaim its former glory, it was not able to find a comfortable position in the modern financial world. So Morgan put itself on the block, talking with a number of banks around the world before reaching a deal to be acquired by the Chase Manhattan Bank for about $31 billion. **********In the end, analysts said, Morgan's downfall may be that it tried too hard to remain what its founder had built \u2014 a behind-the-scenes adviser to the richest and most powerful, with a driven but insular culture. It shied away from the wave of banking mergers so prevalent in recent years. And Morgan found it had become an anachronism in a financial world dominated by mass rather than class. **********\"Nobody like them is succeeding,\" said Alden Toevs, an executive vice president of the First Manhattan Consulting Group. \"The companies they are competing with are just much bigger in terms of capital and product lines.\" **********Morgan is not alone. In just the last two months, two other midsize Wall Street firms \u2014 Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette and PaineWebber \u2014 also agreed to be bought, both by huge diversified Swiss banks. **********Paradoxically, J. P. Morgan is giving up its independence only a year after its biggest regulatory burden \u2014 the Glass- Steagall Act \u2014 was lifted. Passed in 1933, the law separated commercial and investment banking and forced the Morgan Stanley brokerage firm to be split from J. P. Morgan. **********Through the 1970's, the Morgan bank was content to lend money to big governments and corporations and to manage the assets of the heirs to the fortunes of the turn-of-the-century robber barons and other wealthy individuals. But as its big corporate borrowers were able to raise money directly by issuing stocks and bonds, the company realized its traditional business was wasting away. **********Given the choice of changing its clients or changing its products, declared its former chairman, Lewis Preston, in the 1980's, J. P. Morgan should offer its existing clients the ability to trade securities and agree to underwrite their financial offerings. This set in motion a 20-year game of cat and mouse with Congress and the banking regulators as Morgan found more and more regulatory loopholes that allowed it to act more and more like a brokerage firm. Indeed, when Congress finally repealed Glass-Steagall last year, Morgan had already become much more like its old partner, Morgan Stanley, than a traditional commercial bank. **********But repeal freed Morgan's competitors to go after its business, even as it accelerated the mergers among its rivals. Morgan executives, in the bank's exhaustively deliberate style, studied and stewed over myriad possible combinations, but never were willing to dilute what they saw as the company's unique culture and heritage. **********\"This was the last bank on Wall Street that wanted to surrender its independence, and in retrospect this proved to be a real handicap,\" said Ron Chernow, the author of \"The House of Morgan,\" the definitive history of the bank. \"The other commercial banks weren't hampered by a sense of tradition and were able to grow at greater speed.\" **********Ten years ago, Mr. Chernow noted, Morgan had the highest stock market value of any bank in the country. Now its value is one-tenth of the biggest, Citigroup. **********The financial world is increasingly dominated by two kinds of institutions. On one side are investment banking powerhouses \u2014 Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Merrill Lynch, perhaps Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank \u2014 that manage the raising of capital, brokering of mergers and trading of anything with a price. Competition in this business is so intense that even successful second-tier players are choosing to sell to larger rivals. **********The second sort of giant that has evolved out of the commercial banks are financial conglomerates that sell all manner of investments, loans, deposits and insurance. The archetype of this company is now Citigroup, which incorporates Morgan's longtime rival Citibank, along with the Salomon Brothers and Smith Barney brokerage firms and the Travelers Insurance company. And the corporate ancestor of the entire conglomerate is the antithesis of everything Morgan: the Commercial Credit Corporation, which began by lending money to lower-income people before it was transformed into a global leader by the driven deal making of its leader, Sanford I. Weill. **********While Morgan has managed to crack the the top 10 in annual score cards of underwriting and advisory deals, it has never been able to climb to the very top where the bulk of the profits are earned. **********Morgan in some ways was trapped by its earlier success doing business with tycoons and Fortune 500 companies, Mr. Chernow said, and could not take advantage of the burgeoning markets managing the money of main street America. **********\"They felt their competitive advantage was to trade on the romanticism and illustrious tradition that no one could match,\" Mr. Chernow said. \"But when the entire world of Wall Street was going down market, they felt that by lessening their standards they would water down their mystique.\" **********Similarly, Morgan's focus on the very largest corporate customers left it with little involvement in the most dynamic sector of the economy recently, small technology companies. **********In recent years, Morgan has tried to address these flaws with modest efforts. It started an Internet business meant to serve the affluent rather than the truly wealthy. And it tried to get involved in financing Internet companies. But the results have been mixed. One of Morgan's most prominent Internet deals was the financing of Boo.com, an ambitious attempt to create a global Web site selling women's sportswear. Morgan helped Boo gain investments from some of the most wealthy families in Europe, but after running through $135 million, Boo was liquidated earlier this year. **********Morgan is now likely to see itself become a part of Chase, an agglomeration of banks that had hardly been in its league. To be sure, some of the ancestors of the current Chase have their own storied histories. The Bank of Manhattan Company, after all, was founded in 1799 as a water company. And Chase in the 1970's, run by David Rockefeller, was a leading banker to the Arab world. But the institution now using the Chase name was formed when two underperforming New York banks \u2014 Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover \u2014 merged in 1991 as a way to preserve capital drained by a decade of overindulgent lending. In 1995, what was then called Chemical bought Chase, which itself was struggling to meet profit goals. Chemical was clearly in control but took the more prestigious name. **********\"They have a history of making acquisitions and integrating them successfully; that is enviable in an industry that has not done this well,\" Mr. Toevs said. Still, Chase, with its extensive branches and wide-ranging clientele, relies on a corporate culture drawn more from the streets of New York than of the rarefied air breathed by those at Morgan. **********\"The Morgan folks are always wearing their elite status on their sleeves,\" Mr. Toevs said. \"That's got to help the Chase franchise.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/07/business/technology-briefing-internet-amazon-to-offer-consumer-reports.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "2000-12-07", "snippet": "Amazon.com Inc reaches agreement with Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports magazine, to distribute its product reports and advice to Amazon.com customers on its Web site (S)", "word_count": 58, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AMAZON TO OFFER CONSUMER REPORTS", "print_headline": "TECHNOLOGY BRIEFING: INTERNET; AMAZON TO OFFER CONSUMER REPORTS", "body_text": " **********Amazon.com Inc. said it had reached an agreement with Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports magazine, to distribute product reports and advice to Amazon.com customers.

But unlike them, Mr. Augustin earned a college degree, at Notre Dame, and later a doctorate, at Stanford. **********And so he comes across as less the entrepreneur from birth than the nerd's nerd, never happier than when up to his eyes in bits and bytes and the esoterica of hardware and software. He proudly asserts that he was a charter subscriber to Sys Admin, a trade magazine devoted to systems administrators, the unsung heroes who keep computer systems running. ''I've been a systems administrator for every operating system created in the last 20 years,'' he said. **********Mr. Augustin's company, VA Linux Systems, a maker of computer systems in Sunnyvale, Calif., does not yet have billions of dollars in revenue. But it does have a multibillion-dollar market capitalization, thanks to an initial public offering in December that set records for first-day gains. And the stock provided most of the $1 billion that VA Linux agreed to pay last week for Andover.Net, an owner of Web sites offering technology news. **********From a high of $320, VA Linux shares have dropped, closing at $125 on Friday. But at age 37, Mr. Augustin still has a net worth of about $825 million. **********VA Linux is a standard-bearer for the Linux operating system and the Open Source movement. Mr. Augustin and other founders of the company, and the movement, contend that by making computer code underlying a program freely available, and readily modified by anyone,  a stronger system with fewer crashes results,  ending the domination of operating systems owned by one company, especially Microsoft Windows. **********Linux is named for Linus Torvalds, a Finnish programmer who wrote a key component, though he has no connection with the company beyond his friendship with Mr. Augustin. In the hands of Mr. Torvalds and Mr. Augustin, Linux has practically become a cult, although one with a sense of humor. Mr. Augustin breaks out in high-pitched bursts of laughter as he describes an esoteric online parody of slashdot.com, a Linux news site (''News for nerds. Stuff that matters.'') owned by Andover.Net that doesn't take itself too seriously to begin with. **********But go back to the late 80's and early 90's. Mr. Augustin had gone to Stanford after three years  at AT&T Bell Laboratories, where he worked on high-speed digital switching. He ultimately wrote his Ph.D. thesis on electronic automated design tools, the software used to create new chips. **********He also played scavenger -- collecting, among other things, cast-off disk drives, in the days when 30 megabytes filled a refrigerator-sized box. He used these castoffs to create a giant site, in a Stanford basement, that allowed the rapid exchange of information over the Internet before the days of the World Wide Web. **********He also collected early workstations made by Sun Microsystems. His goal was to build a machine at his home that could use Unix, a sophisticated operating system widely found in academia and industry. **********In 1993, Mr. Torvald released Linux on the Internet. Using this software, Mr. Augustin said,  ''I was able to put together my own computer for $2,000, and it was one and a half to two times faster than these old Suns, which cost about $7,000. Other people saw what I had and wanted one, so in November '93, I put up a Web page and said, 'I will sell people these systems.' I got my first check at the end of the month from someone I didn't know. I consider that the start of the business.'' **********A couple of dozen companies have joined  the Linux cause, on the  premise that there is money to be made selling an operating system anyone can obtain for free. VA Linux is unusual in that it sells complete computer systems that come loaded with Linux (but not Windows). **********''We're designing from the ground up for Linux,'' he declared. ''And what we offer to our customers is not just a system. It's full service, a single point of contact, service and support for building their entire infrastructure.'' **********SO far, VA Linux's major customers are all Web start-ups themselves, companies like Akamai Technologies and eToys, and most are less than two years old. But Mr. Augustin, whose buttoned-down shirts, neatly creased khakis and well-trimmed hair may qualify as the height of formality among Linux users, has positioned himself as the person to take the Linux  message to corporate America. **********''I make the argument that the current model of software development is just economically inefficient,'' he said. ''I think this is the next big revolution in the software industry.'' **********Stoking the revolution means long hours. He described his previous day, which began in New York and ended in Silicon Valley. ''Yesterday I got up at 3 a.m. California time, went into a set of meetings, got on an airplane, got back here at 3 in the afternoon and worked in the office until 7 p.m. when my wife started calling.'' **********Balancing work and family can mean taking his wife, Alice Kitsuta Augustin, and daughter, Andrea, to industry gatherings like last week's Linux World in New York. ''That's fine because we get together with Linus and the kids can play,'' he said, alluding to the fact that both men have 3-year-old daughters. **********Mr. Augustin tells employees not to think about VA Linux's share price, and he tries to take his own advice. ''I didn't start this thing to cash in and get out,'' he said. ''I started this to build a real company.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/10/business/world-business-briefing-asia-resignation-in-manila.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "2000-03-10", "snippet": "Philippines Pres Joseph Estrada accepts resignation of Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Perfecto Yasay Jr; resignation, which was submitted several weeks ago, takes effect March 25; photo (S)", "word_count": 92, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "RESIGNATION IN MANILA", "print_headline": "WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: ASIA; RESIGNATION IN MANILA", "body_text": " **********President Joseph Estrada of the Philippines, left, accepted the resignation of the Securities and Exchange Commission chairman, Perfecto Yasay.

The NPD report says the Internet share of adult book purchases jumped from 1.9 percent in 1998 to 5.4 percent last year. **********At the same time, the shares for book clubs and \"bricks and mortar\" sellers, both independents and superstores, declined. Book clubs fell from 18 percent to 17.7. The chains' percentage dropped from 25.3 to 24.6, although Rappaport blamed that mostly on the closing of Lauriat's and financial problems at Crown Books. The independents fell from 16.6 to 15.2, less than half their share 10 years ago. **********The Internet also seems to affect what kinds of books are being bought. Reference sales, for instance, fell 10 percent in 1999, which Rappaport said is probably because more and more people get such information from computers. **********Internet sales have grown from just under 20 million two years ago to just over 57 million in 1999. Overall, the number of adult trade titles purchased last year increased 3 percent, from nearly 1.04 billion to 1.07 billion, making up for a comparable decline in 1998. **********Rappaport said the million-selling Harry Potter series failed to stem a decline in books purchased for readers aged 14 and under. The total dropped by 50 million between 1997 and 1999, down to 481 million. Rappaport blames a smaller juvenile population and the fact that 43 percent of the Potter books were actually bought for adults. **********\"I know someone who just recently saw four different adults reading a Potter book,\" he said. \"There's a big market for adults between the ages of 35 and 49.\" **********The Book Industry Study Group released preliminary statistics Friday on what it calls the first in-depth survey of the book-buying market among black readers. Again, there was good news for the online industry: More than 3 out 4 black respondents said they had Internet access and 29 percent said they purchased at least one book off the Internet. **********Final figures are expected in July. **********The NPD report was based on data from 16,000 households. It was commissioned by the American Booksellers Association, which represents the country's thousands of independent stores, and BISG, a not-for-profit research organization. **********Home | Site Index | Site Search | Forums | Archives | Marketplace **********Quick News | Page One Plus | International | National/N.Y. | Business | Technology | Science | Sports | Weather | Editorial | Op-Ed | Arts | Automobiles | Books | Diversions | Job Market | Real Estate | Travel **********Help/Feedback | Classifieds | Services | New York Today **********Copyright 2000 The New York Times Company"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/15/business/microsoft-says-it-licensed-its-media-player-to-a-rival.html": {"writer_name": "John Markoff", "pub_date": "2000-03-15", "snippet": "Microsoft Corp has licensed its Windows Media Player technology, without charge, to its main competitor, RealNetworks; Microsoft uses occasion to asset that its digital media effort--producing software for Internet users to listen to audio and wat...", "word_count": 442, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Microsoft Says It Licensed Its Media Player to a Rival", "print_headline": "Microsoft Says It Licensed Its Media Player to a Rival", "body_text": " **********The Microsoft Corporation said today that it had licensed its Windows Media Player technology, without charge, to its main competitor, RealNetworks. **********Microsoft used the occasion to assert that its digital media effort -- producing software for Internet users to listen to audio and watch video -- is moving ahead rapidly. **********''Today's news is significant for the future of digital media,'' said Will Poole, general manager of Microsoft's Digital Media Division.

She will ask whom the flowers are for and how much you want to spend. She will also ask whether there is a special reason for the purchase and will go so far as to ask if you are sending flowers because you are ''in the doghouse.'' Then she will suggest a few arrangements from the inventory and warn you if you have ordered too late for delivery on a particular date. **********Yet if Emily is the picture of helpfulness, she is also literally a picture. Down deep, she is a complex assortment of logic exercises, HTML code and market research. She is the Web's equivalent of a department store's personal shopper -- a cybercreation that can assist you in your buying, recall your preferences and notify you when something goes on sale. She is an electronic agent who performs what analysts call ''guided selling,'' or ''directed selling,'' in which a Web site answers questions and advises buyers on a purchase. If this were software, it might be called ''Salesman in a Box.'' **********The Internet has evolved into an effective hunting guide for online shoppers. In addition to obtaining prices, shoppers can learn whether an item is in stock, immediately available and comparable to other items on the site or on the Web. In short, the Web is maturing as an adviser, not just a bargain finder. **********Emily is the creation of Kana Communications of Manchester, N.H., a company that focuses on ways to link customers and companies on the Web. ''People want to buy from people,'' explained Stefania Nappi, a Kana vice president. ''The question they want answered is, 'Tell me why.' If you didn't need help, you wouldn't be looking for information.'' **********Besides wanting their questions answered in a nuanced and detailed way, customers want to associate purchases with a seller. The reasons range from a basic desire for personal attention to the option of after-sales contact and follow-up. The electronic adviser could be a fictional character like the bearded Dudley caricature who dispenses technical advice for Dell Computer, or it could be identified with a photo of an actual sales clerk whom shoppers could also call or visit. **********Proflowers.com has seen sales soar to double or even triple the usual average when a significant number of visitors consult the adviser, Ms. Nappi said. **********The electronic advisers can only suggest purchases based on each company's inventory, Ms. Nappi said. In the future, though, she envisions sellers, and even third-party sites, that will be able to offer advice about products whether they offer them or not. The goal, she said, is to win customers and loyalty by offering service comparable to that provided by the fabled retailer Nordstrom. Sites like BizRate.com already offer advice on which shopping sites different types of users might prefer, so extending that knowledge to the products is the logical next step. **********''Personalization'' is the term that is preferred by Matthew W. Calkins, the chief executive of the Appian Corporation of Falls Church, Va., a consulting firm that advises companies on the systems that facilitate personal interaction online. Some examples are filters that can ask users which books or movies people like and correlate the results to create profiles. Mr. Calkins points out, however, that for less frequent purchases,  like vehicles, homes or appliances, a consumer's needs or circumstances play a greater role than their tastes. **********Simple electronic systems exist that can, for example, identify buyers of computer printers at the point of purchase. But they cannot yet persuade a customer to buy a more expensive model or make a related purchase, like a savvy, experienced salesman who might offer deals on paper, ink cartridges or cables. Nor have these electronic systems made the leap into decisions like helping users choose which type of paper or length of cable is best for their needs. **********''Personalization as a technology is not yet where people hoped it would be,'' Mr. Calkins said. ''Assumptions made from data mining or other review of sales data can be misleading. Price is just not the sine qua non of Internet retailing. There's so much more contextual information.'' **********While still in its infancy, personalization is more useful to buyers than to sellers, counters Chris Selland, vice president for e-business strategies at the Yankee Group, a telecommunications research and consulting firm in Boston. ''It is important and it does add value, but it's being overhyped,'' Mr. Selland said. ''When a customer is on your Web site in a buying mood, you're not selling. They're buying. The Internet was built for research, not for commerce, and that's how people are using it.'' **********Just as the shortcomings of voice mail versus live receptionists took time to determine, Web retailers are trying to find the ideal combination of automated and live assistants. Retailers are adding features like ''click to chat'' with a live person or ''click to talk'' to schedule a call from a sales agent. And the debate over which personalization tools to use is as robust as the different methods for achieving it. **********Kana's software uses several basic questions to elicit some information about each buyer. Using logic devised by an English mathematician, Thomas Bayes, in the 18th century, it links those responses to a larger database of profiles to intuit details to questions that have not been asked. **********Bayes's logic exercises are being rediscovered by companies like Microsoft as a way to bridge the chasm between having too much information about a customer, like the entire transaction history, and not enough useful details. Bayes's theorem is the mathematical law governing logical inference. It determines what degree of confidence to have in possible conclusions based on limited evidence. **********Other companies are using natural-language search tools, hoping to humanize shopping. Through Soliloquy, based in New York, Web users can speak, through voice or keyboard, with electronic ''experts'' to help them select items. **********There are also combination efforts like the one used by the Calico Corporation, which teams search engines with adviser software. Another strategy personalizes transactions by using shared information from a company's disparate divisions or product lines, bringing together credit limits, past transactions, preferences and other details to create a custom transaction that can be delivered by e-mail, phone or personal digital assistant. **********For example, www.oneswoop.com helps buyers in the United Kingdom compare, choose, order and finance cars from other European countries online. **********As with any data trail, assumptions made from data mining or past sales can be misleading. Merchants do not want to know what was bought, they want to know why. And personalization, like customer service, is interpreted differently by everyone who experiences it. **********''People are realizing there are commodity markets, but even in commodities there are quality concerns,'' said Christopher Meyer, the director of the Cap Gemini-Ernst & Young Center for Business Innovation. ''The ability to start the conversation online, where buyers and sellers can express their wants, needs, budgets and other concerns, will expand the attention that can be paid to even the most routine transaction.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/03/business/connecticut-holding-inquiry-into-priceline.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-10-03", "snippet": "HARTFORD, Oct. 2 \u2014 The Connecticut state attorney general is investigating Priceline.com , the Internet name-your-own-price company, after receiving more than 100 complaints from consumers.", "word_count": 141, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Connecticut Holding Inquiry Into Priceline", "print_headline": "Connecticut Holding Inquiry Into Priceline", "body_text": " **********HARTFORD, Oct. 2 \u2014 The Connecticut state attorney general is investigating Priceline.com , the Internet name-your-own-price company, after receiving more than 100 complaints from consumers. **********Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said last week that most of the complaints were from people who bought gasoline and airline tickets from the company, which is based in Norwalk. **********Some customers bought gas at a certain price from Priceline, only to find out later that it was not available at that price at participating gas stations, Mr. Blumenthal said. **********He also said many consumers bought airline tickets for trips on certain days, but discovered afterward that Priceline had restrictions on what days people could fly. **********Mr. Blumenthal said the investigation began about three weeks ago, and he expected a preliminary finding within a few weeks.

And, of course, the site would use the most advanced technology. Boo.com bragged of its ability to let users view products in three dimensions from 360 degrees, giving them a true sense of how a garment looked. **********Investors were so taken with the idea and its two founders -- Ms. Leander had been an Elite model and both had started an online bookstore called Bokus.com -- that Boo.com was able raise $125 million almost immediately from an elite roster of the extremely wealthy. Before even starting Boo.com, the founders promoted the site in trade journals and glossy fashion magazines. **********But it was also clear that the founders were excessively ambitious. The company established its headquarters on swanky Carnaby Street in London, with satellite offices in New York, Paris, Stockholm, Amsterdam and Munich. The staff expanded from 40 initially to more than 400. Employees routinely flew first class and stayed in five-star hotels, according to a former staff member. Many were given laptops and Palm Pilots for home use, according to this person, and the company used Federal Express to send regular mail. **********''They had very little spending restraint, to put it mildly,'' said Noah Yasskin, an analyst at the London office of Jupiter Communications, an Internet research firm. **********The site itself was also plagued by technical problems and delays, and took twice as long as anticipated to develop. **********Once up and running, it became clear that users without fast connections to the Internet could not use the site, a point Boo.com boasted about. That e-snobbery alienated customers with more modest modem speeds, which happened to be most of Europe and the United States, Boo.com's two most important markets. **********''Ninety-nine percent of European and 98 percent of U.S. homes lack the bandwidth needed to easily access such animation,'' Therese Torris, an analyst at Forrester Research in Amsterdam, wrote in a report. And anyone with a Macintosh computer could not use the site. **********While Boo.com later adjusted itself to allow users with slower connections and Macs to gain access, the changes came too late. **********Sales for the first three months of the site's operation were $680,000, while the company was blowing through more than $1 million a month. **********The end came as Boo.com's founders, with only $500,000 left, struggled in vain to find backers to plow more money into the site. **********''We are deeply disappointed that it has been necessary to ask KPMG to become liquidators of the company,'' the co-founders and investors said in a joint statement. ''The senior management of Boo.com has made strenuous efforts over the last few weeks to raise the additional funds which would have allowed the company to go forward with a clear plan.'' **********Over the last several weeks, Mr. Malmsten and Ms. Leander, who together own about 40 percent of the company, had been pleading with investors to ante up more. **********According to a spokesman for Mr. Arnault: ''He didn't want to take the risk. He would have been willing to stay involved if he could have had more control.'' In fact, in an interview in Paris several weeks ago about his Internet holdings, Mr. Arnault refused to discuss Boo.com. **********Whether Boo.com's failure presages further problems for clothing e-tailers is unclear. But some Internet analysts said Boo.com's rise and fall reflect a problem that goes beyond just selling clothes. . **********''The market has woken up to the fact that the amount of business e-tailers like Boo.com generate is a lot lower than we anticipated,'' said Tony Shiret, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in London. ''A key turning point was what happened in the U.S. over Christmas,'' he added, referring to many online retailers that reported missed sales projections. ''It's been disappointing.'' **********On Wednesday, PricewaterhouseCoopers released a report predicting that 25 percent of all Internet companies in Britain could exhaust their cash within six months. **********Still, the problems at Boo.com problems were somewhat self-inflicted, Mr. Yasskin said. ''They tried to do too much,'' he said. ''Opening up in multiple countries simultaneously is impossible.'' **********One major stumbling block for Boo.com may simply have been the type of merchandise it was trying to sell. ''If you look at successful sites, they are driven by price,'' Mr. Shiret said. ''It is very hard to sell clothing at a cost base that makes sense without the scale.'' **********Indeed, Boo.com never competed on price like most other retailers; it hoped to woo customers with its interactive services and convenience. **********Nonetheless, Boo.com might be worth something, even if it is only a fraction of the $400 million value its founders once ascribed to the company. KPMG, which is managing the liquidation process, said today that it had received more than 30 inquiries.  In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph earlier this month, Mr. Malmsten admitted he might have made missteps. ''We have made some mistakes and we were late with our launch, yes,'' he said. ''But people are welcome to come 'round here into our offices and see what is going on now.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/21/world/shunyi-journal-blinded-by-poverty-the-dark-side-of-capitalism.html": {"writer_name": "Elisabeth Rosenthal", "pub_date": "2000-11-21", "snippet": "Medical care in China, which 20 years ago boasted broadest public health system in world that offered free health care to all, has become almost entirely matter of cash from individual patients, and there is no public health insurance for poor; co...", "word_count": 971, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Shunyi Journal; Blinded by Poverty: The Dark Side of Capitalism", "print_headline": "Shunyi Journal; Blinded by Poverty: The Dark Side of Capitalism", "body_text": " **********In 15 minutes, Dr. Jiang Lijuan broke up the dense cataract that had long covered Liang Xingwang's eye, removed the debris and slipped a new tiny plastic lens under his cornea. She squirted in a few drops of antibiotic and prepared a heavy gauze bandage. **********Before the gauze was applied, Mr. Liang caught a fleeting glimpse of the operating room light, his first glimpse of anything from his right eye in years. ''I think I could see things!'' Mr. Liang, 17, said with wonderment as he moved to a bed in an adjoining room. **********But there is both a happy and a sad story behind the recent surgery in a small operating room at a community hospital here near Beijing. **********Mr. Liang is one of 1.1 million poor Chinese who have had their sight restored through free cataract surgery in the last four years under the Sight First project, sponsored jointly by Lions Clubs International and the China Disabled Persons Federation. **********As China has opened its economy and developed its own philanthropically minded middle class, such charity projects are increasingly common. That's the happy part. **********The sad part is that Mr. Liang, who suffers from an inherited condition that can be remedied by simple outpatient surgery, spent so much of his childhood nearly blind, even though the technology to cure him was widely available in China. **********In Beijing's clinics, 40 miles from Mr. Liang's home, people with enough cash can get top-flight eye surgery for about $500 an eye. But those clinics might as well be on Mars for people like Mr. Liang. Today, medical care in China is almost entirely a matter of cash from individual patients, and there is no public health insurance for the poor. **********Twenty years ago, China boasted the broadest public health system in the world, offering free (if basic) health care to all. But the country's shift to a market economy has upended that balance, allowing entry of more advanced medical techniques but also making even simple procedures widely unaffordable. **********The World Health Organization now rates China last among developing countries in terms of equal access to medical care. (The United States is last among developed countries.) **********Yang Liqun, a government researcher who has studied social services on the outskirts of Beijing, found that only 9.9 percent of people in Shunyi County had any kind of medical coverage. ''During the process of reform, the old system of cooperative medical care has suffered devastating damage,'' he wrote in the journal Beijing Social Sciences. **********And so, when Mr. Liang's vision began clouding over eight years ago, he did what rural Chinese often do when they fall ill: he endured. As cataracts from a congenital condition marched over first his left eye, then his right, he tried his best to help out in the family fields and was determined to keep going to school. **********Last year, while in the ninth grade, he dropped out of school because he could no longer see his books. But treatment was not an option. **********''I never visited a doctor for this until Oct. 1 this year,'' he said from his bed in the recovery room, referring to the day health workers came to his village looking for patients who might benefit from the Sight First project. ''I knew it could be corrected, but we had no money to see a doctor, much less have surgery. So what was the point?'' **********It is a jarring admission in a country once so committed to egalitarian health care. But during the last decade, as central government financing for hospitals has plummeted, free medical care has given way to hefty patient charges for doctors' visits, surgery and tests. **********In China today, treatment is often an economic rather than a medical decision. And charitable donations, often organized by the state, are unable to cover the huge tab that the government has dropped. Cataract surgery, done on an outpatient basis, costs about $50 at the township hospital in Shunyi, about half as much as in hospitals in Beijing. **********That is still two to three months' earnings for poor families, money that is in any case consumed by day-to-day subsistence. Mr. Liang's mother also suffers from cataracts and his father lost his arms in an industrial accident. So he lives with his grandfather, who has taken care of him as he has become progressively disabled. **********The Lions Clubs program has helped reduce the cost and improve the quality of cataract surgery in China. The group has trained 4,000 doctors in surgical techniques, many in outlying areas, and it has donated some of the latest equipment to diagnose and treat eye disease. **********The project helped a factory in Suzhou to gear up to make the little plastic lenses that are the key to the operation's success. Before late 1998, when the plant started production, Chinese-made lenses were of very low quality and imported ones were prohibitively expensive. **********But the main contribution at this hospital is, plain and simple, financial. The program pays for the surgery for patients who cannot afford it, and covers the costs of hospitals that say they cannot afford to treat patients free. **********''Even though the technology exists here, these people just don't have the money,'' Dr. Jiang said. **********Zhang Bofang, a farmer from nearby Huairou who also had surgery in Shunyi recently, said his vision started ''clouding over'' in 1997. For the last year he has been unable to tend his field or even walk down the street alone. **********With his children grown and gone, his wife tended the family's wheat, peanut and corn fields alone. ''It has really been a struggle,'' said Mr. Zhang, wrapped in the tattered brown sweater he wore for his surgery. ''I went to the hospital in Huairou to try to get treatment a few times, but I didn't have the money, so I just had to go home. **********''This time it was free.

His five-page handwritten letter makes sad, and damning, reading. **********The four men Mr. Levar suspected of plotting to kill him were men he had been accusing since 1997 of committing war crimes against the Serbs of Gospic, a hardscrabble town of 5,000 set in the thick forests and craggy white mountains of a region that was notorious even in World War II for being the home of hard-line Croat nationalism. **********Mr. Levar said these four men were responsible for killing dozens of Gospic Serbs in 1991 and 1992, during and after the six-month war the Croats waged against rebel Serbs and the Yugoslav Army after Croatia declared independence. **********But it took the killing of Mr. Levar, a former military intelligence officer in his mid-40's, to push the government to act on his information. Two weeks after his death, special policemen in khaki uniforms and berets surrounded buildings in the town and detained several men in connection with crimes committed against civilians during the war and with Mr. Levar's death. **********In a parallel raid in Zagreb, the police also arrested Gen. Tihomir Oreskovic, long accused by Mr. Levar of leading the killings of Serbs in Gospic, and brought him to Gospic to join the other detainees. The general headed Mr. Levar's list of people who he believed wanted him dead. **********Gospic still bears the scars of war, but exudes a calm that masks a violent past and enduring hatred and fear. **********Deep gashes from mortar shrapnel still scar the walls of buildings, a result of shelling by Serbian forces in 1991. The former Serbian quarter was devastated, each house methodically demolished with explosives, the work of vengeful Croats. Serbian forces seized control of part of the town in 1991, but within weeks were repulsed by the Croats, who held the town for the rest of the war. **********Milica Majic, 68, a Serbian widow dressed in black, still lives on her farm in Smiljansko Polje, just on the edge of Gospic. Her husband was beaten and shot beside his tractor in the fields behind the house in 1992. ''I don't know who killed him,'' she said. ''I am a Serb, and he was. That's why they killed him.'' **********Over 100 Serbs are missing from the area around Gospic, the site of the first death camp established for Jews and Serbs by the Ustasha who ruled the Nazi puppet state of Croatia during World War II. **********Mr. Levar collected evidence of the atrocities committed here by Croatian troops and paramilitary units in 1991 and 1992, witnessed some events here himself and said, in an interview just 12 days before his death, that up to 500 civilian victims might be buried in this area. When he started speaking out in 1997, the Croatian government refused to accept that Croats did any of the killing, which both sides carried out. **********In the interview, Mr. Levar said he was speaking out because the truth had to be told. ''They killed my people, my friends,'' he said. ''It is my business to say something of what happened.'' **********In the smashed Serbian suburb on the south side of town lies a small enclosed orchard. Plum trees heavy with fruit bowed over what appeared to be graves marked with simple wooden crosses. On a visit here with Mr. Levar in August, it appeared that someone had been digging, opening graves. The grass was young and the soil loose underfoot. **********''We are walking on top of a morgue here,'' Mr. Levar said. **********The cemetery was one of several mass graves Mr. Levar said he knew of. A bulldozer had broken through the fence of the orchard, and there could be as many as 100 bodies in a pit between the trees, he said. **********Even he was nervous and did not stay long in the place. The victims may not have all been Serbs. Croats who objected or got in the way were also killed, he said. ''And the same people are still in power,'' he remarked, alluding to local authorities, most of whom are still dominated by the hard-line nationalist party of the late President Franjo Tudjman. **********Mr. Tudjman, who died in December, resisted almost all requests for cooperation with the United Nations war crimes tribunal in The Hague. However, the new government, led by Prime Minister Ivica Racan, and the new president, Stjepan Mesic, have allowed investigators from the tribunal into Croatia. Earlier this year, they performed their first exhumation in the country, digging up 10 bodies from a septic tank near the orchard cemetery in Gospic. **********''He felt it was a personal victory that they came,'' said his widow, Vesna Levar, sitting in their kitchen surrounded by photographs of her husband and candles. Nevertheless, it made their situation more precarious, she said, and her husband had finally decided to take her and their 10-year-old son, Leon, abroad. **********''In the last two months leading up to his death, he was intensively seeking to leave the country,'' she said. He spent hours assembling documents and depositing them with friends. **********The new government's policy of cooperating with The Hague has alarmed many Croats, in particular members of the Croatian Army and of Mr. Tudjman's party, the Croatian Democratic Union. **********''Those responsible have begun to feel endangered now,'' said Dobro slav Paraga, the leader of the Croatian Party of Rights and the friend to whom Mr. Levar entrusted the list of those he suspected would kill him. ''If Tudjman were alive, there would be no chance that The Hague would be walking around Gospic.'' **********Mr. Paraga said he suspected that Mr. Levar was killed not only because he was a witness, but also to scare future witnesses and deter the government from pursuing war criminals. ''The intention was to scare the democratic movement in Croatia, to shut people up, and if not block, then drastically reduce, cooperation with The Hague,'' he said. **********In Gospic, the issue raises charged emotions. Before his death, a waitress seethed at the mention of Mr. Levar. ''What do you want with that traitor?'' she snarled. Mr. Levar said people knew deep down that he was telling the truth. ''I know my people and I know they want to find out what happened,'' he said. **********There was a miserable turnout at his funeral, with barely 60 people and few locals. ''The entire circumstances were terrible,'' Mrs. Levar said bitterly. ''It could not have been worse had an animal died.'' A government delegation came from Zagreb, but the mayor, Milan Kolic, declined to attend. **********''Mr. Levar is not a person who has done anything more or less for this town, and I do not see why the mayor should attend the funeral,'' he said in an interview. **********Fear kept most townspeople away, said one resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''Sixty to 70 percent of the town would have gone to the funeral if it were not for fear,'' he said. Everyone had been shocked by the murder, he said. **********''Whatever he used to say, to kill a man in his own backyard, in front of his child, that's a crime and must be punished.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/24/business/media-market-and-lawsuit-test-new-philadelphia-paper.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Sorkin", "pub_date": "2000-01-24", "snippet": "Metro Philadelphia, daily tabloid that is to be distributed free throughout public transit system, will begin publishing Jan 24, and has already come under legal attack from several American newspaper companies; lawsuit contends that new publicati...", "word_count": 986, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market and Lawsuit Test New Philadelphia Paper", "print_headline": "MEDIA; Market and Lawsuit Test New Philadelphia Paper", "body_text": " **********A new breed of daily newspaper that has had phenomenal success here and throughout Europe is about to face its first test in the United States when Metro Philadelphia begins publishing on Monday. **********Already, Metro Philadelphia, a daily tabloid that is to be distributed free throughout the public transit system, has come under legal attack from several American newspaper companies. **********A lawsuit, filed Friday in Philadelphia, contends that the new publication has made an unfair, exclusive distribution arrangement with Philadelphia transit officials. The suit also argues that because transit officials have authority to oversee the editorial content of the publication, the publication violates First Amendment rights to a free press. **********The suit was filed by Philadelphia Newspapers Inc., the unit of Knight Ridder which publishes The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Philadelphia Daily News; The New York Times Company, and the Gannett Company, which publishes USA Today. **********A judge refused to grant an injunction against publication but agreed to hear the case on Monday. Pending that hearing, Metro Philadelphia agreed temporarily not to distribute copies of its paper anywhere within the transit system that is barred to the other newspapers. **********Metro Philadelphia, published by a unit of the Swedish media company Modern Times Group, will be the first version of Metro published in the United States. It hopes to match the success of more than a dozen other versions in Europe -- as well as a copycat, Metro London, that has no business ties to Modern Times. **********Papers like Metro London are part of a new phenomenon -- the free daily newspaper -- that is sweeping European cities and is swiftly challenging the assumption that the Internet generation has all but given up on reading newspapers. **********Introduced in March, the Metro London tabloid is distributed each morning inside subway stations though a contract with the London Underground transit authority. The paper has increased its circulation more than threefold in less than a year -- to 350,000 daily copies, up from an initial 100,000. And 50 percent of its readers apparently never read newspapers before, according to its publisher, Associated Newspapers Ltd. **********Metro Philadelphia has a similar arrangement with a local transit agency, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, or Septa -- the distribution deal now being challenged in court. Under the Philadelphia pact, the publisher will pay Septa a minimum of $45,000 a month for access to distribute the paper within the confines of its subway system and at its bus stops. Septa will also receive one page of free advertising each day and have at least nominal editorial control over the paper -- though Metro officials said that the transportation agencies it works with have never exercised this editorial power. **********Metro Philadelphia will have an editorial staff of 16, whose work will mainly involve revising news stories from The Associated Press and other news services to fit the paper's summary-style format. The paper plans to include some original local reporting as well. **********Initial plans call for a print run of 150,000 copies daily. The paper will compete with The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Philadelphia Daily News, which have struggled lately. **********Jack Roberts, the managing director and publisher of Metro Philadelphia, said he hoped his paper did not succeed at the expense of his competitors. **********''Sure, the easy thing to say is that I'm going to try rip the heart of The Daily News and put them out of business. But that's not what I'm after,'' he said, noting that he was once the city editor at The Philadelphia Daily News. **********Free newspapers are nothing new here in Europe, or in the United States. Most big cities have at least one widely distributed free weekly. In Manhattan, for instance, the alternative weekly Village Voice sits in street-corner news boxes for any passerby to pick up, along with New York Press and numerous imitators. **********The first version of Metro was started in Stockholm in 1995 by Transit Publications Inc., a unit of Modern Times. The company negotiated a deal with local officials to be the exclusive newspaper publisher for Stockholm's subway system. **********Modern Times soon rolled out versions of the paper in other European cities. After it announced plans to start a Metro in Britain about 18 months ago, Associated Newspapers, publishers of The Daily Mail and The Evening Standard pay tabloids, set out to pre-empt the Swedish company. Associated introduced a similar paper with the same name. **********''When we first looked at the concept and considered if it would work in London, our first thought was a bit defensive about our own papers,'' said Kevin Beatty, managing director of Associated Newspapers. ''But when we did the analysis, our research showed that over 50 percent of tube riders don't buy newspapers. And that's what fascinated us.'' **********With Associated getting to the market first, Modern Times has since tabled its plans to produce a London version. **********At a time when newspaper readership among younger people continues to dwindle at traditional newspapers in Europe and the United States, the Metro genre is demonstrating that young people may be interested in reading the news on paper -- provided it is written for attention spans honed on MTV and surfing the Net. According to Sifo, a media-consulting company in Stockholm, more than half of Metro's audience there is younger than 40. **********Whether the format will do as well in the United States is an open question, of course. The papers already in Philadelphia are concerned. ''The issue is preferential treatment to Metro that no other newspapers have,'' said Pamela Browner, a spokeswoman for Philadelphia Newspapers. **********George Freeman, a lawyer for The New York Times, said, ''It's dangerous to have the government involved in a relationship with a newspaper.'' **********On Friday, Metro Philadelphia put out a release defending its deal with Septa and quoting Mr. Roberts: ''As a journalist with more than 25 years' experience, I can assure you that  Metro will publish a totally independent, objective and fair journalistic product. Read our newspaper on Monday and judge for yourself.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/27/business/company-news-dupont-approves-1.8-billion-stock-buyback-program.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "2000-07-27", "snippet": "E I du Pont de Nemours & Co is expanding its share repurchase program by $1.8 billion; second-quarter profits rise 7 percent, to $949 million (S)", "word_count": 95, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DUPONT APPROVES $1.8 BILLION STOCK BUYBACK PROGRAM", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; DUPONT APPROVES $1.8 BILLION STOCK BUYBACK PROGRAM", "body_text": " **********E.

Margie Backstrom, one partygoer, told of a gathering weeks earlier to celebrate the vesting of a friend's stock options. While such events usually have a festive air, Ms. Backstrom said, the woman bemoaned the fact that her options amounted to far less than expected. Another friend has watched his company's stock plummet more than 60 percent since Jan. 1; his options are now worthless, his prospects unclear. **********''People are questioning whether they made a mistake by giving up the security of a big salary for all those options that aren't worth much anymore,'' said Ms. Backstrom, who is immune to market gyrations so far because the Internet company she works for is still private. Her friends, she added, wonder ''whether it was such a good idea to not go to the Morgan Stanleys of the world.'' **********In the much-heralded exodus from old-line companies to dot-com start-ups in recent years, while some voyagers have found great wealth, others are finding the promised land does not offer the riches or satisfaction they had expected. Not everyone finds it easy to adjust to bosses who will not focus, work spaces that double as kennels and a culture in which self-conscious jollity comes at the expense of real work. Others are recognizing that part of the challenge these days is turning traditional concerns into new-economy companies. Those who stay can help their employers think like dot-coms. **********And some, in the end, decide the toll they were asked to pay for Internet riches is too high. **********''The downdraft in the market, if it continues, will cause people to move away from the new economy to more stable companies,'' said James Citrin, a headhunter at Spencer Stuart in Stamford, Conn. Severance packages have already become a hot topic, he said. And last week, with a prospective employer's preoffering valuation down, one client requested more options before taking a job. ''The stock market and the talent market are inexorably linked,'' Mr. Citrin added. **********Already anecdotal evidence suggests that the dot-com luster is fading. Consider Tsan Merritt-Poree. She was general counsel for a new Web site but left in January after repeated problems with computers and fax machines. Or Allison Johnson, who stayed at Hewlett-Packard because she thought she could have a bigger impact there. **********Isaac Lasky, a 55-year-old consultant in Denver, said he was burned by a telecommunications start-up in December. This week, he said, ''I would much rather be unemployed than involved with a shaky dot-com.'' **********To be sure, it is too soon to say there is a clear exodus from companies that have built the new economy. Investment banking firms cannot seem to give employees enough casual-dress days and free cappuccinos to keep them at their desks. And for many who have jumped to dot-coms already, it has become a way of life, said Daniel DiCaro, a veteran of many technology start-ups and now managing director of Gray Drake Partners, a consulting firm in Mount Prospect, Ill. **********''Most people, when they get that fever, it's hard to shake,'' he said. ''It may burn people out, but you just can't get that when you're in a more traditional job.'' **********But if the Internet generation, whose rewards rise and fall on options, faces many more weeks like this, with the Nasdaq index plunging 17 percent in four days, all that could change. Many dot-com deserters -- particularly those who join the ranks of newly public companies which continue to lose money -- are lured back to established companies, mainly in technology. **********At Cisco Systems, which rivals Microsoft in size, resumes for certain marketing jobs from dot-com defectors are up 10 to 20 percent in the past three months, said Larry Lang, a vice president. Just two weeks ago, after a spate of new hires from a few volatile start-ups, Mr. Lang thought to himself, ''Aha, there is a pattern emerging here.'' **********In the end, it may have been the dogs that ended Carla De Luca's dot-com career. **********A year ago, Ms. De Luca, a former CNN producer, moved from Atlanta to California and took a job at Beyond.com, an e-commerce services provider which was based in Sunnyvale but has since moved to Santa Clara. She quickly put together an ambitious plan for hiring people to write about the site's wares. But she grew frustrated at the time it was taking to put it into action. ''It seemed indefinite to me when it would materialize,'' she said. **********Top executives, she said, spent a lot of time spinning their wheels in endless meetings. But what really bothered her was the atmosphere of mandatory fun. Employees were told that if they wanted to have a meeting over a game of Ping-Pong, they should. And a ''dogs welcome'' policy turned the office into a near-kennel. **********Ms. De Luca lasted four months, leaving behind a pile of stock options when she quit in May. **********''There was certainly an emphasis on camaraderie and fun and a lot of team building and bonding, which I'm all for,'' Ms. De Luca said. ''But often I felt that it was at the expense of some good work getting done.'' **********Many people do just fine in dot-com land, she said, but she prefers the stability and the ample resources at her new job. ''The corporate culture and the right fit for me is really important,'' she said. **********A Beyond.com spokeswoman, Laura Fulda, would not address Ms. De Luca's comments but did say, ''When you go to an Internet start-up you can expect the unexpected, that's for sure.'' **********The company has gone through hard times. In January, the chief executive quit and 20 percent of the staff was laid off in a restructuring. In the fall, the company moved. And the dogs were banished. Yesterday, the company's stock price ended at $2.8125, an all-time low closing price. **********A common argument among the dot-com cognoscenti is that employees can have a greater impact at a start-up. **********But resources at small companies are slim, and this can wreak havoc with those used to an army of secretaries and support staff. Ms. Merritt-Poree, a 37-year-old lawyer, took a job late last year as general counsel with NetNoir.com. It did not take long to realize the fit was less than ideal. She complained that the fax machine was always busy and, when she asked for her own printer to receive faxes, did not get it. Instead she brought one from home and kept it on her desk to guard confidential faxes regarding company financings. **********Her e-mail at times did not work, she said, so she got a private account. But the final straw was when her computer broke down in December and she could not get access to the Internet for nearly a week. She left the office, telling a colleague to keep tabs on the repair: ''Here's my cell phone number. Call me when it is done.'' **********Ms. Merritt-Poree talked to her old boss at Cooley Godward, a San Francisco law firm, and asked if she could come back. She did in January. **********E. David Ellington, who founded NetNoir in January 1995, said the problems Ms. Merritt-Poree had were resolved, and her successor  had thrived. Some of the problems, he said, were because the company was moving to different offices. ''It was a very bumpy two-month period over a five-year history,'' he added. ''I understand her frustrations, but they were frustrations expressed by others, too. The others have stayed.'' **********Ms. Merritt-Poree does not regret leaving, or giving up a generous options package. ''My resolve is strengthened that you should do this for love, not money,'' she said. **********Some executives stay behind, comforted by the security of a large organization and attracted to helping it transform into a new-economy player. **********In September, Allison Johnson, a 39-year-old Hewlett-Packard vice-president, was offered a rare opportunity: becoming a founding partner -- employee No. 6 -- at Loudcloud Inc., which helps speed the growth of Internet start-ups by managing all their computing needs. **********Loudcloud is the brainchild of Marc Andreessen and a few others from Netscape. Ms. Johnson resigned from Hewlett-Packard within two weeks of being asked. But the day before she was to leave, Hewlett-Packard announced a major restructuring, and she had second thoughts. **********While deciding, she said, she ''took the money issue off the table.'' Staying at Hewlett-Packard meant living comfortably, while going to Loudcloud could bring great riches. **********But Ms. Johnson said it came down to this: ''Where do you have the opportunity to have a giant impact?'' The answer, she decided, was at Hewlett-Packard, which is strengthening its Internet presence. **********Money was not the issue in talks with Hewlett-Packard, she said. ''It was more the sense that, 'Look, this is what we're going to do, and we want you to be part of this team.' '' **********Ms. Johnson says she has not regretted her decision for one minute, though she does wonder how she will feel the day Loudcloud goes public. **********For the most part, employers are only too happy to take defectors back. ''We welcome returnees with open arms,'' said Katie Cotton, spokeswoman at Apple Computer. **********So eager is Autodesk, a large software company in San Rafael, Calif., that it even sends a postcard to former employees a few months after they leave, asking if the grass is really greener. **********''We want to send the message that good employees are always welcome back,'' said Fred Kohler, a manager of human resources at Autodesk, which has started giving out more frequent bonuses and options. **********Wall Street may be the exception. Publicly, most companies say returnees are welcome. But privately executives bristle at the notion of watching high-priced talent waltz out the door only to return if things go sour. ''We cannot send the message that you can leave at no cost,'' one executive said. ''People have to feel that if they leave they are toast.'' **********The new model for those who want both stability and the charge of a dot-com is a dot-com linked to an old-economy corporation. James Breyer, a partner at the venture firm of Accel Partners in Palo Alto, Calif., said he had received several inquiries lately from employees interested in Walmart.com, the partnership between Wal-Mart Stores and Accel. **********The decision may rest with where employees can be most content. Just ask Ms. De Luca. Many people she knows are still chasing the dot-com dream, but she's not convinced they are terribly happy. ''When you're working all the time you really have to love what you're doing,'' she said. ''I don't feel that everyone I'm talking to is necessarily loving all the time they're putting in.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/15/technology/nyt-article-2000011593452662685.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-01-15", "snippet": "I.B.M. to Acquire Accessible Software", "word_count": 225, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NYT Article", "print_headline": "NYT Article", "body_text": " **********I.B.M. to Acquire Accessible Software **********January 15, 2000 **********I.B.M. to Acquire Accessible Software By BLOOMBERG NEWS **********RMONK, N.Y,, Jan. 14 -- The International Business Machines Corporation agreed to day to buy Accessible Software Inc. for more than $75 million so that I.B.M., the No. 1computer maker can improve links between mainframes and other computers. **********I.B.M. will pay $7.10 for each share of Accessible Software, which is based in Whippany, N.J.

His spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said: ''Israel has made a decision here; they took into account our security concerns. We appreciate that.'' **********The cancellation was unlikely to have any direct effect on the workings of the summit meeting, where talks continued in what was described as an informal atmosphere of casual dress and simple gatherings at mealtime between Israeli and Palestinian negotiators. Despite the carefree atmosphere, Mr. Lockhart said that reaching a positive outcome was still going to be a struggle. **********Mr. Clinton spent his second day with Mr. Barak and the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, but was scheduled to take a break for a speech on Thursday before an N.A.A.C.P. meeting in Baltimore. **********Pressure on Israel to cancel the Phalcon airborne radar had been building for weeks as senior members of Congress, including some considered sympathetic to Israel, publicly criticized the deal. The planned sale of military technology to China was particularly irritating, they said, given the strong military relationship between Israel and the United States. **********Israel's assurances that it was not providing American technology to the Chinese did not mollify critics. **********In announcing the cancellation, the Israelis avoided what could have been an embarrassing debate on the floor of the House of Representatives today, where the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, Representative Sonny Callahan, Republican of Alabama, was preparing to bring up an amendment holding back $250 million in assistance to Israel. **********Mr. Callahan said he was glad that ''for the sake of United States national security interests and, in fact, in the national security interests of all our allies, such as Israel'' that the sale had been canceled. **********Mr. Callahan's proposal to hold back the money had already failed in his subcommittee. And the amendment was not expected to pass the House either. But each airing of the legislation provoked negative remarks against Israel at a time when the Barak government has been seeking more assistance. **********One of Mr. Barak's objectives at Camp David is that Israel should come away with an upgraded military relationship with the United States as compensation for any risks it might encounter in compromising with the Palestinians. If a full peace accord is reached at Camp David, Israel expects to get a significant increase in its defense capabilities from the United States, including radar to detect missiles from Iran and Iraq. This year, of a $2.8 billion aid package to Israel, $1.98 billion was for military assistance. **********Until quite recently, the Israeli government had tried to modify the sale with the Chinese to calm the increasing opposition in Congress. Israel has earned billions of dollars in arms sales to China in recent years, according to arms experts, and was reluctant to cut off the relationship. **********In a letter to the Chinese president, Jiang Zemin, laying out the cancellation, Mr. Barak expressed the hope that there might be room for future cooperation, an Israeli official said today. **********The letter was delivered on Monday in Beijing by the director general of the Ministry of Defense, Amos Yaron. **********The Pentagon began protesting to the Israeli government late last year after a subsidiary of Israel Aircraft Industries mounted the radar system on a Russian-made cargo plane destined for the Chinese Air Force. The subsidiary, known as Elta, designed the Phalcon system for the Israeli Air Force. A Chinese-owned Ilyushin-76 outfitted with the radar has been parked at Ben-Gurion International Airport. **********The Clinton administration said it was most concerned because the system would significantly increase the capabilities of the Chinese to track warplanes in and around the Taiwan Strait. **********The Israeli argument that a closer relationship with the Chinese military would allow Israel to dissuade Beijing from supplying weaponry to Iran and Iraq did not win many converts in the United States. **********In Congress today, there was wide support for the cancellation, but still caution. ''This is not a note of victory,'' said Fred Downey, a legislative aide to Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut. ''It's the Israelis coming to the right decision so we can discuss the upgraded security arrangement'' that would come with a successful summit meeting. **********Members of Congress were informed of the decision this morning by the Israeli ambassador to Washington, David Ivri, a former Israeli Air Force commander and a main architect of Israel's weapons sales to China since the mid-1990's."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/22/technology/jiang-zemin-says-ecommerce-will-transform-china.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-08-22", "snippet": "August 22, 2000", "word_count": 523, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Jiang Zemin Says E-Commerce Will Transform China", "print_headline": "Jiang Zemin Says E-Commerce Will Transform China", "body_text": " **********August 22, 2000 **********&nbsp; Jiang Zemin Says E-Commerce Will Transform China By REUTERS EIJING -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin offered a ringing endorsement of the Internet on Monday, saying e-mail, e-commerce, distance learning and medicine would transform China. **********In enthusiastic comments to an international computer conference, Jiang made only passing references to political concerns that have dogged the Internet's development in China. **********He said ``virtual reality is profoundly changing the way people produce, learn and live.'' **********``We should deeply recognize the tremendous power of information technology and vigorously promote its development,'' the official Xinhua news agency quoted him as saying. **********Jiang's comments were a clear indication that China's Communist government recognizes the positive benefits of the Internet, despite its fears that the unrestricted spread of knowledge and ideas could undermine its rule. **********Indeed, Jiang appeared to accept the inevitability of free information flows. **********``The speed and scope of its transmission have created a borderless information space around the world,'' Jiang said. **********``The melding of the traditional economy and information technology will provide the engine for the development of the economy and society in the 21st century,'' he said. **********Tv Plays Up Speech **********Jiang's speech was delivered to a largely foreign audience at the World Computer Congress, a gathering of Internet entrepreneurs and regulators from 70 countries. **********But it was carried prominently on the domestic evening television news, a clear boost to China's infant Internet industry, which has struggled with politically-inspired content restrictions, a lack of venture capital, slow communications and low level of computer ownership. **********Jiang highlighted the need to protect privacy on the Internet, a concern of governments around the world, and warned against what he called ``a flood of trash.'' **********And he made a veiled reference to the government's attempts to crack down on use of the Internet by its political foes. **********``The Internet also brings problems that make people uneasy: anti-science, false science and information that is unhealthy to the point of being downright harmful,'' he said. **********China is waging an all-out war against two quasi-religious movements -- Falun Gong and Zhong Gong -- that it says are trying to overthrow the Communist state.

Final judgment will be entered contemporaneously herewith. No further proceedings will be required. **********The Court has been presented by plaintiffs with a proposed form of final judgment that would mandate both conduct modification and structural reorganization by the defendant when fully implemented. Microsoft has responded with a motion for summary rejection of structural reorganization and a request for months of additional time to oppose the relief sought in all other respects. Microsoft claims, in effect, to have been surprised by the \"draconian\" and \"unprecedented\" remedy the plaintiffs recommend. What it proposes is yet another round of discovery, to be followed by a second trial - in essence an ex post and de facto bifurcation of the case already considered and rejected by the Court. **********Microsoft's profession of surprise is not credible. (1) From the inception of this case Microsoft knew, from well-established Supreme Court precedents dating from the beginning of the last century, that a mandated divestiture was a possibility, if not a probability, in the event of an adverse result at trial. At the conclusion of the trial the Court's Findings of Fact gave clear warning to Microsoft that the result would likely be adverse, yet the Court delayed entry of its Conclusions of Law for five months, and enlisted the services of a distinguished mediator, to assist Microsoft and the plaintiffs in reaching agreement on a remedy of some description that Microsoft knew was inevitable. Even assuming that Microsoft negotiated in utmost good faith in the course of mediation, it had to have in contemplation the prospect that, were mediation to fail, the prevailing plaintiffs would propose to the Court a remedy most to their liking and least likely to be acceptable to Microsoft. Its failure to anticipate and to prepare to meet such an eventuality gives no reason to afford it an opportunity to do so now. **********These cases have been before the Court, and have occupied much of its attention, for the past two years, not counting the antecedent proceedings. Following a full trial Microsoft has been found guilty of antitrust violations, notwithstanding its protests to this day that it has committed none. The Court is convinced for several reasons that a final - and appealable - judgment should be entered quickly. It has also reluctantly come to the conclusion, for the same reasons, that a structural remedy has become imperative: Microsoft as it is presently organized and led is unwilling to accept the notion that it broke the law or accede to an order amending its conduct. **********First, despite the Court's Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, Microsoft does not yet concede that any of its business practices violated the Sherman Act. Microsoft officials have recently been quoted publicly to the effect that the company has \"done nothing wrong\" and that it will be vindicated on appeal. The Court is well aware that there is a substantial body of public opinion, some of it rational, that holds to a similar view. It is time to put that assertion to the test. If true, then an appellate tribunal should be given early opportunity to confirm it as promptly as possible, and to abort any remedial measures before they have become irreversible as a practical matter. **********Second, there is credible evidence in the record to suggest that Microsoft, convinced of its innocence, continues to do business as it has in the past, and may yet do to other markets what it has already done in the PC operating system and browser markets. Microsoft has shown no disposition to voluntarily alter its business protocol in any significant respect. Indeed, it has announced its intention to appeal even the imposition of the modest conduct remedies it has itself proposed as an alternative to the non-structural remedies sought by the plaintiffs. **********Third, Microsoft has proved untrustworthy in the past. In earlier proceedings in which a preliminary injunction was entered, Microsoft's purported compliance with that injunction while it was on appeal was illusory and its explanation disingenuous. If it responds in similar fashion to an injunctive remedy in this case, the earlier the need for enforcement measures becomes apparent the more effective they are likely to be. **********Finally, the Court believes that extended proceedings on the form a remedy should take are unlikely to give any significantly greater assurance that it will be able to identify what might be generally regarded as an optimum remedy. As has been the case with regard to Microsoft's culpability, opinion as to an appropriate remedy is sharply divided. There is little chance that those divergent opinions will be reconciled by anything short of actual experience. The declarations (and the \"offers of proof\") from numerous potential witnesses now before the Court provide some insight as to how its various provisions might operate, but for the most part they are merely the predictions of purportedly knowledgeable people as to effects which may or may not ensue if the proposed final judgment is entered. In its experience the Court has found testimonial predictions of future events generally less reliable even than testimony as to historical fact, and cross-examination to be of little use in enhancing or detracting from their accuracy. **********In addition to its substantive objections, the proposed final judgment is also criticized by Microsoft as being vague and ambiguous. Plaintiffs respond that, to the extent it may be lacking in detail, it is purposely so to allow Microsoft itself to propose such detail as will be least disruptive of its business, failing which plaintiffs will ask the Court to supply it as the need appears. **********Plaintiffs won the case, and for that reason alone have some entitlement to a remedy of their choice. Moreover, plaintiffs' proposed final judgment is the collective work product of senior antitrust law enforcement officials of the United States Department of Justice and the Attorneys General of 19 states, in conjunction with multiple consultants. (2) These officials are by reason of office obliged and expected to consider - and to act in - the public interest; Microsoft is not. The proposed final judgment is represented to the Court as incorporating provisions employed successfully in the past, and it appears to the Court to address all the principal objectives of relief in such cases, namely, to terminate the unlawful conduct, to prevent its repetition in the future, and to revive competition in the relevant markets. Microsoft's alternative decree is plainly inadequate in all three respects. **********The final judgment proposed by plaintiffs is perhaps more radical than might have resulted had mediation been successful and terminated in a consent decree. It is less so than that advocated by four disinterested amici curiae . It is designed, moreover, to take force in stages, so that the effects can be gauged while the appeal progresses and before it has been fully implemented. And, of course, the Court will retain jurisdiction following appeal, and can modify the judgment as necessary in accordance with instructions from an appellate court or to accommodate conditions changed with the passage of time. **********It is, therefore, this _____ day of June, 2000, **********ORDERED, that the motion of defendant Microsoft Corporation for summary rejection of the plaintiffs' proposed structural reorganization is denied; and it is **********FURTHER ORDERED, that defendant Microsoft Corporation's \"position\" as to future proceedings on the issue of remedy is rejected; and it is **********FURTHER ORDERED, that plaintiffs' proposed final judgment, as revised in accordance with the proceedings of May 24, 2000 and Microsoft's comments thereon, be entered as a Final Judgment herein. **********______________________ **********Thomas Penfield Jackson **********U.S. District Judge **********1. Despite their surprise, compounded no doubt by the Court's refusal on May 24 th to allow discovery and take testimony on the issue, Microsoft's attorneys were promptly able to tender a 35-page \"Offer of Proof,\" summarizing in detail the testimony 16 witnesses would give to explain why plaintiffs' proposed remedy, in its entirety, is a bad idea. Within a week they added seven more. **********2. Two states dissented from the imposition of structural remedies but fully supported the remainder of the relief proposed. The absence of total unanimity merely confirms the collaborative character of the process by which the proposed final judgment was formulated."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/05/world/un-aide-in-chechnya-urges-study-of-abuses.html": {"writer_name": "Patrick Tyler", "pub_date": "2000-04-05", "snippet": "UN human rights commissioner Mary Robinson tours ruined Chechen capital of Grozny and, despite curbs on her movements, reports seeing and hearing 'shocking' evidence of extensive atrocities by Russian military forces; she also reports 'constructiv...", "word_count": 272, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.N.

Several hundred club members, wearing identical beige T-shirts emblazoned with images of the Angkor Wat temple, and black kepis to ward off the sun, trooped into the courtyards of Banteay Srei, led by guides with megaphones. **********Until a few years ago, a trip to this outlying shrine was a risky undertaking. The Khmer Rouge was still active in the area and there were minefields and bandits. **********Today, it is a \"must-see\" item on the itinerary of the rapidly increasing number of tourists, both foreign and Cambodian, who visit the Angkor archeological park in the northwestern Cambodian province of Siem Reap, a couple of hundred kilometers by road from the border with Thailand. **********The forested park covers about 400 square kilometers (160 square miles) and contains some 70 monuments built between the 9th and 13th centuries when the Khmer kingdom of Angkor ruled much of mainland Southeast Asia. **********The temple complex is Cambodia's premier tourist attraction and was listed as a World Cultural Heritage site by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in 1992. **********But it is only in the past couple of years, as peace and political stability have returned to Cambodia, that tourism has taken off. It is happening so quickly that some officials and conservation experts are worried that the flood of visitors may damage the fragile temples and destroy their tranquil surroundings. **********\"The Siem Reap region is not yet really prepared to handle a flow of a million or more tourists per year,\" said Vann Molyvann, head of the Apsara authority, which was established by the government in 1995 to protect the Angkor complex. \"The 'open skies' policy is beneficial for the overall economy of the country, but it is accompanied by a certain risk, such as pollution or irreparable damage to the Angkor World Heritage site due to an uncontrolled explosion of tourist arrivals.\" **********Prime Minister Hun Sen declared the \"open skies\" policy in December to increase the number of foreign visitors to Angkor by allowing more direct international flights to land at Siem Reap town, a few kilometers from the temples, rather than having to go through the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh. **********The government sees tourism as a major potential earner of foreign exchange and source of growth and employment. **********Tourist officials expect as many as 400,000 foreign visitors to arrive in Cambodia by air this year, up from 263,000 in 1999. Many flock to Angkor. There were nearly 84,000 arrivals in Siem Reap by air alone in 1999, more than double the number in 1998. Many visitors come by road or ferry across Cambodia's great central lake of Tonle Sap from Phnom Penh. **********The government said in May that dollars 3 million would be spent to expand Siem Reap's airport passenger terminal and upgrade the roads that run through the Angkor park. New hotels, guest houses, restaurants, night clubs, bars, and karaoke lounges are mushrooming in Siem Reap, which has the atmosphere of a boom town, even though most roads are in poor repair and sewerage, waste disposal, water supply and other infrastructure are primitive in many parts. **********\"You haven't seen anything yet in this country,\" said Cambodia's tourism minister, Veng Sereyvuth. \"Cambodia can handle millions of tourists, if we do it in the right way.\" **********Some experts believe Angkor is better placed than many smaller cultural sites in other parts of the world to receive large numbers of visitors, provided proper infrastructure and controls are in place. **********\"A unique feature of Angkor is that it is vast and diversified enough to accommodate many tourists while at the same time offering a tranquil environment amidst jungle and rice fields,\" said Dawn Rooney, an art history researcher who has written a guide to the Angkor temples. **********So far, it appears that efforts of the government and the international community to protect Angkor from the ravages of looting, the harsh tropical climate and years of conservation neglect during the fighting far outweigh any damage caused by mass tourism. \"Protection of the site is very important, but so is tourism because it can help pay for the protection and improve it,\" said Teruo Jinnai, a cultural officer at Unesco's office in Phnom Penh. \"I strongly believe that Angkor is in better condition than before.\" **********Teams of specialists from Cambodia, France, Japan, Italy, Germany, the United States and China are working to reconstruct and repair various temples. **********Fees paid by foreign tourists to visit the complex, ranging from dollars 20 per person for a one-day entry pass to dollars 60 for a five-day pass, help pay for better protection, maintenance and control of the site. **********For example, there are now around 400 heritage police employed by the Apsara authority to preventing thefts from the monuments. **********\"There is still some looting,\" said Ang Choulean, director of the authority's department of culture and monuments. \"But we are now quite well protected. Compared to the rest of the country, this is a privileged place.\" **********Still, the authority could and should be better funded in the view of many of the 30 foreign governments and organizations that are members of the international coordinating committee formed to help Cambodia safeguard Angkor after it was given World Heritage status. **********They reportedly objected at their last meeting in Phnom Penh in June to the way in which the government awarded a five-year concession to collect the Angkor foreign tourist fees to the Sokha Hotel company, a unit of the politically well-connected Sokimex oil and gas firm. **********The contract was awarded in April 1999 without a public tender. Sokha reported that in the year to April 2000, nearly 125,000 foreign tourists paid for passes to visit Angkor, yielding a total income of dollars 3.8 million, more than double the projected revenue. **********Yet under the terms of the contract, the company only had to give the government dollars 1 million of its revenue"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/30/business/world-business-briefing-americas-newspaper-brawl-in-toronto.html": {"writer_name": "James Brooke", "pub_date": "2000-06-30", "snippet": "Modern Times Group of Stockholm is coming out with free tabloid aimed at commuters in Toronto; two of Canada's largest media groups, Quebecor Inc and Torstar Corp, decide to publish competing weekday tabloids (S)", "word_count": 78, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NEWSPAPER BRAWL IN TORONTO", "print_headline": "WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: AMERICAS; NEWSPAPER BRAWL IN TORONTO", "body_text": " **********Bus and train commuters in Toronto now have a choice of three free tabloid newspapers.

Augusto Pinochet was medically unfit to stand trial in Spain and that it was now inclined to abandon the extradition case against him. **********The statement opens the way for the former Chilean dictator to avoid charges of crimes against humanity and to return to his homeland. **********Home Secretary Jack Straw released the results of a Jan. 5 examination of the 84-year-old general by four British specialists and said he was ''minded'' to ''take the view that no purpose would be served by continuing'' the extradition proceedings. **********The medical report and Mr. Straw's reaction to it appeared to mark the closing stages of a case that has shaken international law, galvanized human rights and exile groups, and stirred passionate old antagonisms in Chile. **********General Pinochet has been under house arrest in England for nearly 15 months awaiting the outcome of  complicated legal and judicial moves surrounding a Spanish judge's request to send him to Madrid, where he would face 35 charges of torture and conspiracy to torture dating from the days of his strongman rule in Chile. **********Mr. Straw did not make clear how soon he might exercise his power to end the extradition proceedings, on compassionate grounds of age and health. But he said he was writing to various rights groups that have been party to the case and to Spain, Chile and countries like France, Belgium and Switzerland that have made extradition requests of their own. He is asking for answers back within a week. **********Patrick Robertson, a spokesman for General Pinochet, said he was delighted at the announcement. The general's principal lawyer, Michael Caplan, said only that it was ''a very important development in the case at this stage.'' **********England's highest court, the Law Lords of the House of Lords, fundamentally altered the law of sovereign immunity when it threw out the general's claim that he could not be tried for acts during the time that he was a head of state. The court also established new international powers for people seeking redress of rights abuses, even in courts outside the country where crimes were alleged to have been committed. **********The point was reflected in the response of Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, who said today, ''Heads of state no longer enjoy impunity for crimes against humanity.'' **********The medical tests held last week were scheduled after the Chilean Embassy submitted evidence in October from General Pinochet's doctors that his health had declined markedly. He was said to have suffered a series of small strokes in September. **********Mr. Straw then asked General Pinochet to consent to an independent examination, and his office selected the four doctors, specialists respectively in gerontology, geriatric medicine, neurology and neuropsychology. The seven-hour examination was conducted in Spanish -- General Pinochet does not speak English -- and two of the physicians, Mr. Straw said, were fluent in the language. **********He said that it was the ''unequivocal and unanimous'' conclusion ''that following recent deterioration in the state of Senator Pinochet's health, which seems to have occurred principally during September and October 1999, he is at present unfit to stand trial, and that no change to that position can be expected.'' **********The general was originally arrested on Oct. 16, 1998, as he lay in a London clinic recuperating from back surgery. The British police made their surprise move in response to an application from a Spanish judge, Baltasar Garzon. He asked for General Pinochet's extradition to Madrid to stand trial on charges of genocide, torture, kidnapping and murder in connection with the disappearance of more than 3,000 people in the 17 years after he seized power in a 1973 coup. **********Judge Garzon, considered something of a maverick in the Spanish judiciary, had gathered his evidence during an investigation into the so-called dirty wars in Latin America in the 1970's. The Spanish Government, forced by circumstance to pursue the case, has shown little enthusiasm for it and tonight Spain's Foreign Ministry said it would ''respect the decisions of the British Government.'' **********General Pinochet won his first legal battle to overcome the charges when the High Court upheld his claim to sovereign immunity. But in a ruling that was to create the case's legacy, the Law Lords overturned that decision, saying that being a head of state did not excuse crimes against humanity. **********The case returned to the House of Lords after one of the original judges was found to have had an association with Amnesty International, a party to the case. But the second Lords' decision was even more emphatic on the principle than the first one, though it reduced the number of charges and narrowed the scope to torture and conspiracy to torture. **********The case then moved on to the validity of the extradition order itself. It was upheld by a London magistrate last October and then appealed, leading to a plan for another hearing on March 20. **********In the one appearance in court that General Pinochet has been obliged to make, he maintained the defiant attitude he adopted from the beginning, saying he did not recognize the jurisdiction of any court outside of one in Chile to try him and saying he was innocent of ''all the lies of Spain.'' **********Every hearing and court date has seen crowds of supporters and opponents hurling taunts and jeers and holding aloft flags and placards with accusatory slogans and pictures of missing friends and relatives. **********For the last 13 months, the general has been living under house arrest with his wife, Lucia, in a rented mansion in one of London's exclusive southern suburbs. He had periodic visits from Chilean supporters and backers of his in this country, the most visible of whom has been former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Her office said tonight that she was delighted with the doctors' report and that she expected Mr. Straw to be a ''very fair man'' and order the general's freedom. **********Carlos Reyes, a former journalist imprisoned by the Pinochet government who speaks for a group representing Chileans abroad, said, ''It's unbelievable that a criminal should escape justice because perhaps he is ill.'' **********But other opponents of General  Pinochet were more resigned to the apparent inconclusive end of the case. ''I am not surprised to hear this, and much as I regard Pinochet as a blood-soaked tyrant, if the doctors say he is unfit to stand trial then he is unfit to stand trial,'' said George Galloway, a Labor member of Parliament. ''It would be reducing ourselves to Pinochet's level if we pursued the matter vindictively in the teeth of medical evidence.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/27/business/technology-briefing-hardware-pmc-sierra-to-acquire-switchon.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "2000-09-27", "snippet": "PMC-Sierra, which designs chips for telecommunications equipment, plans to acquire SwitchOn Networks for $450 million in stock to gain semiconductors that direct Web traffic (S)", "word_count": 44, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PMC-SIERRA TO ACQUIRE SWITCHON", "print_headline": "TECHNOLOGY BRIEFING: HARDWARE; PMC-SIERRA TO ACQUIRE SWITCHON", "body_text": " **********PMC-Sierra, which designs chips for telecommunications equipment, said it planned to acquire the closely held SwitchOn Networks for $450 million in stock to gain semiconductors that direct Web traffic.

Following a 78-day trial, Judge Jackson found that Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, had repeatedly violated Federal antitrust law, bullied rivals and stifled competition and innovation. **********Microsoft had opposed the government's request for immediate Supreme Court review, saying it \"would impose an extraordinary burden on the court\" and that there was no reason to depart from the normal procedure of using the appeals court to narrow the complex legal issues and voluminous trial record. **********Today the Supreme Court, in a perfunctory three-sentence order, agreed. By refusing to review the case, it now proceeds to a seven-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which has indicated its intent to move quickly. Within hours of the Supreme Court's announcement, the Court of Appeals asked the Justice Department and Microsoft to submit proposed schedules for proceeding by next Monday. **********Dissenting from today's Supreme Court decision, Justice Stephen G. Breyer said he had voted to hear the appeal because the case \"significantly affects an important sector of the economy.\" **********\"Speed in reaching a final decision may help create legal certainty,\" Justice Breyer wrote. \"That certainty, in turn, may further the economic development of that sector so important to our Nation's prosperity.\" **********For now, though, the Court's decision dramatically reshapes the contours of the case and is a big legal win for Microsoft on several levels. Foremost among them is the timing of the case. **********For both Microsoft and the government, the timeline is crucial. Experts have raised concerns that fast-paced changes in both the technology and the marketplace may make the proposed remedy of splitting up Microsoft both irrelevant and unnecessary. **********The case now goes to an appeals panel that includes two judges who had earlier handed a legal victory to Microsoft on a related issue. After it deliberates over the next few months, the panel has a wide range of options, including sending the case back to Judge Jackson for further proceedings, a process that can further delay a final resolution. Moreover, since the Supreme Court is under no obligation to review the decision of the appeals panel, that panel could have the last word. **********Finally, today's decision virtually assures that the government's case will wind up under the control of a new Administration which could, if it wants, either drop the Federal lawsuit or seek to rekindle settlement negotiations on less onerous terms than those offered by officials in the Clinton Administration.

Most of the deaths cited in complaints to regulators have occurred in Explorers, and almost all of them involved a rollover after a tire shed its tread during high-speed driving. **********As the inquiry continued, Continental A.G., Germany's leading tire maker, announced today that it would replace 160,000 tires mounted mostly on Lincoln Navigator sport utility vehicles, but would do so as part of a ''customer satisfaction program'' and not a safety recall. **********Bernd Frangenberg, the chief executive and president of Continental General Tire Inc., the American unit of Continental A.G., said that the company had received only one report of a tire-related injury, which he described as a ''minor injury'' in Florida two weeks ago that was still being reviewed. **********Continental announced the tire replacement program after meeting with regulators this morning at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is part of the Transportation Department.

A problem in some tires can cause the vehicles to vibrate and sometimes cause pieces of the tread to break off, but the entire tread does not peel off, he added. **********Treads that peel off entirely and without warning during highway driving have been blamed for dozens of deaths in Ford Explorers equipped with Firestone tires. **********A spokesman for Representative Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican leading a House Commerce Committee inquiry on the Firestone problem, accused Firestone today of having known since 1996 about quality problems with the tires now being recalled. The spokesman, Ken Johnson, said that investigators poring through tire test data submitted by Firestone had found a high rate of test failures during routine quality control tests conducted in 1996, and a notation that a tire manufacturing process was changed in 1997 as a result. **********Julia Sutherland, a Firestone spokeswoman, said the company had found in 1996 that the sidewalls of some tires had failed in tests.

It operates from imposing offices in Johannesburg and London and, in the first half of this year, sold diamonds that totaled $3.4 billion in value. **********Global Witness, a seven-year-old not-for-profit advocacy group, employs 14 people in two countries. It operates from offices cluttered with computers and the odd bicycle in what used to be a spectacles factory on a nondescript residential street in North London. It runs on a budget of about $800,000 a year. **********On the surface, the two organizations might seem unequal foes. Yet, in the last two years, Global Witness, a member of a fast-growing network of bodies known as nongovernmental organizations, has been at the forefront of a largely successful campaign to turn De Beers' corporate strategy around, pressing the multinational colossus into a reversal of its attitude toward so-called conflict diamonds to cast itself these days as the champion of a cleaned-up world diamond trade. **********Indeed, for the first time this year, De Beers began certifying the provenance of its diamonds, offering a written guarantee that they do not come from areas where they fuel insurrection. **********The campaign and its fruits, though, go beyond diamonds, because they reinforce one of the most striking effects of the globalization that has been under way since the end of the cold war. Increasingly, with multinational corporations gathering unparalleled power as the standard-bearers of freewheeling capitalism -- in many countries, more powerful than the governments themselves -- they are being held to account by shoestring advocacy groups like Global Witness that have filled the vacuum created by the end of the ideological contest between East and West, between capitalism and socialism. **********De Beers is not alone in acknowledging the power of the nongovernmental organizations. This year, both the United Nations and the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, recognized the organizations' role, conferring a new legitimacy as many corporations move from confrontation to at least the appearance of cooperation with them. **********De Beers, for instance, has given one board-level executive, Andrew Coxon, responsibility for dealing with the organizations. And significantly, the World Economic Forum has increased the number of nongovernmental organizations -- known as NGO's -- that are invited to next year's glittery gathering in Davos. There, a central theme will be ''bridging the global divide,'' a debate that acknowledges the role of the NGO's as champions of the world's have-nots as they press their case onto the global corporate agenda. **********The issues they are championing vary from the environment to food safety, from the oil business to mining to financial services. But for many companies, the clamor of nongovernmental organizations' pressing businesses to assume social and other responsibilities as part of their corporate mission can seem almost deafening. ''They are part of the 21st-century economic landscape,'' said Andrew Lamont, a spokesman for De Beers. **********Indeed, businesses like BP Amoco, the world's third-largest oil company, have taken those demands a step further, weaving them into the corporate image of an environmental pioneer. **********Of course, for many casual observers, nongovernmental organizations are associated with the rowdy protests at the gatherings of such international institutions as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization over the last year in Seattle and Prague. **********Far from projecting an image of noble intentions, the protesters have seemed to some to be more intent on wrecking McDonald's or Starbucks outlets, venting their rage at the perceived emblems of globalized business and subordinating private property rights to the dictates of direct action. One group, Friends of the Earth, routinely tears up fields of experimental genetically modified crops. Another, Greenpeace, developed the hallmark tactic of boarding vessels at sea to advertise its protests. **********But beyond that, linked by the Internet and a sense of shared objectives, nongovernmental organizations are building networks of influence as the representatives of what they term the ''civil society,'' acting essentially as self-appointed watchdogs on dubious corporate behavior. **********''We look for the white underbelly of the dragon,'' said Patrick Alley, the director of Global Witness. **********Once that ''underbelly'' has been identified -- be it to establish the role of diamonds in fueling African conflict or the status of oil companies in the same conflicts -- ''we use the media as a tool to illuminate the target so that the company, decision makers and the public know that there's an issue,'' he said. **********Similar tactics have been used to protest the labor practices involved in the manufacture of Nike shoes and the environmental impact of Royal/Dutch Shell's oil operations in Nigeria, forcing both companies into reappraisals of their public posture on labor rights and the environment. **********Indeed, as corporations consolidate in quest of economies of scale, there is some evidence that advocacy groups are seeking the same sort of power through the politics of scale. **********Just last month, 263 consumer advocacy groups, grouped as Consumers International, gathered in Durban, South Africa, to press for changes in the World Trade Organization, the World Bank and other international financial groups and to advocate ''social justice and consumer protection in the global market.'' **********The sectors and issues selected as targets, according to a statement, included e-commerce, food safety, corporate responsibility, pharmaceuticals, tobacco, financial markets and health care. **********And while corporations are generally able to deploy vastly greater resources in public relations, litigation, lobbying and advertising and are often skilled at co-opting adversaries, ''it's not such an unequal power relationship,'' an executive from a London-based international mining corporation said. **********''You can be an $8 billion company or whatever,'' he continued. ''But in the court of public opinion, the nongovernmental organizations start with more credibility than businesses.'' **********Not only that, the push for corporate responsibility has received the imprimatur of the United Nations -- the biggest nongovernmental organization of them all. Almost two years ago, Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general, warned that suspicion of the globalized economy made it ''fragile and vulnerable to backlash from all the -isms of our post-cold-war world: protectionism, populism, ethnic chauvinism, fanaticism and terrorism.'' **********And in July, more than 50 corporations -- very few of them American -- joined with nongovernmental organizations to sign a United Nations global compact to promote high standards on human rights, the environment and labor practices among transnational corporations. **********''Business has to accept that it has to demonstrate that it can deliver responsibly,'' Mark Moody-Stuart, the head of Royal Dutch/Shell, a signer of the compact, said in remarks published at the end of the meeting. **********Yet the relationship between these organizations and business is less evident. **********In using the term ''civil society'' to denote their purported following, nongovernmental organizations, as some see it, are assuming a mandate that has not been granted by any democratic or representative process of accountability. **********In parts of Africa, nongovernmental organizations involved in relief work have been accused of prolonging rather than ending wars and of acting as surrogates for their governments back home . **********The question of legitimacy is important because, as not-for-profit organizations, many of these groups need to promote their own credentials in seeking financing from foundations and charitable trusts. **********''If people think you are a charlatan,'' said Mr. Alley at Global Witness, ''then your life expectancy is short, and rightly so.'' **********But the question arises: who watches the watchdogs? **********That question has not been adequately answered. Activists like Mr. Alley, for instance, say that NGO's themselves should be as accountable to the public as corporations are to their shareholders. **********But such is the breadth and complexity of the NGO's -- ranging from local, village-level groups in the developing world to well-financed groups like Oxfam, one of the best-endowed charities -- that there are no general standards of transparency. **********Even tactically, the NGO umbrella covers movements from politically active advocacy groups to the looser and sometimes violence-prone organizations that staged the protests in Seattle and Prague -- groups that might lose most of their impact and support by accepting restraints. **********Similarly, though, the NGO's themselves face a quandary: their strength lies, essentially, in their freedom to act outside formal strictures. And, as soon as they are drawn into formal alliances with more strait-laced, formal bodies, they risk being enfeebled. **********And corporations can be adept at manipulating what some of them depict as a new partnership -- using advocacy groups to shield themselves from the protests against globalization. When the United Nations global compact was signed, some nonparticipating advocacy groups accused the United Nations of providing organizations with a kind of political cover without being able to force them to change corporate practices. **********Some nongovernmental organizations remain wary of the corporations they deal with, sensing that their interlocutors may be only too ready to use private dialogue as a means of stifling public debate, or of co-opting their adversaries. **********Yet, whether the assessment is cynical or not, the publicly offered wisdom among some executives these days is that in a globalized era, the range of stakeholders in any corporate venture has broadened far beyond just the stockholders to encompass advocates for a range of human rights and environmental and labor issues. **********Profit, therefore, these executives argue, must be coupled to corporate responsibility to avoid protests that would do far more damage to business. **********That may be no more than lip service, but it also acknowledges a shift in the way that labor unions, advocacy groups and grass-roots organizations are able to articulate demands and grievances. **********''Businesses do not do this sort of thing out of a lack of self-interest, but perhaps out of philanthropic self-interest,'' a mining company executive said. And sometimes, corporate interests overlap with those of their challengers. **********By publicly supporting the campaign against conflict diamonds, for instance, De Beers strengthened its position in the far more valuable market for clean diamonds. ''They used the campaign to their advantage,'' Mr. Alley at Global Witness said. ''If business can operate more responsibly, and make more money, that's ideal.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/19/business/technology-briefing-internet-trading-in-stan-lee-halted.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-12-19", "snippet": "Nasdaq officials halt trading in Stan Lee Media, creator of animated programs for Internet, television and movies, when stock price falls to 13 cents a share; exchange says it stopped trading until company meets its request for additional informat...", "word_count": 105, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TRADING IN STAN LEE HALTED", "print_headline": "TECHNOLOGY BRIEFING: INTERNET; TRADING IN STAN LEE HALTED", "body_text": " **********Nasdaq officials halted trading in Stan Lee Media, a creator of animated programs for the Internet, television and movies, when the stock price fell to 13 cents a share.

The goal is to demonstrate ''how advertising can manipulate the public,'' said Ann Cooper, curator of the exhibit, ''both for and against a cause.'' **********More than 100 cigarette ads and antismoking pitches, from the 1880's to the present, cover the walls of the club's office on East 21st Street. There is also a reel of about 20 television commercials -- half for cigarettes, from the days when such spots were permitted, and half devoted to antismoking messages. **********''It's about the power of persuasive advertising,'' said Mary Warlick, executive director of the club. **********On one side of the room are the cigarette ads, for brands that are defunct (Duke), contemporary (Marlboro) and being reintroduced (Lucky Strike). Ms. Cooper clustered some of the more recent pitches according to themes, like relaxation, celebrities and women. **********On the opposite side are the ads meant to encourage people to stop smoking, from organizations like the American Legacy Foundation, the California Department of Health Services and the Arizona Tobacco Education and Prevention Program. **********The earliest antismoking ad in the exhibit, from the American Cancer Society, is at least 30 years old. The print ad shows a pregnant woman smoking; the headline reads, ''Why start a life under a cloud?'' **********Posted next to the ads are comments that try to place the campaigns in a historical perspective, which include mentions of legal action against tobacco companies. **********The idea for the exhibit, Ms. Warlick said, came from a discussion among members of the club's board, who noticed that ''a striking number'' of public service campaigns discouraging smoking were winning awards in the annual One Shows. They said that was particularly noteworthy, she recalled, because of the small amounts spent on the ''anti'' side compared with the huge sums spent by the tobacco marketers. **********Most of the ads featured in the exhibit came from Duke University in Durham, N.C., private collections and the club's archives. There were problems in trying to get ads from the agencies that created them or their tobacco clients, Ms. Cooper said, except for a handful of shops in Britain. **********Some agencies offered cash donations but declined to send ads, Ms. Cooper said. In some instances, she added, agencies and tobacco marketers said they did not want the ads to be displayed in the same gallery as antismoking ads. **********Mark Smith, a spokesman for the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation in Louisville, Ky., a unit of British American Tobacco that sells brands like Capri, Kool and Lucky Strike, said, ''It's not unusual that we would not participate.'' He said he did not think ''anybody here was really aware'' of the requests for ads. **********Cheri Carpenter, a spokeswoman for the longtime Marlboro agency, Leo Burnett USA in Chicago, said the Marlboro brand team at Burnett ''had questions they wanted clarified with the One Club.'' She said that ''the deadline came and went'' without the questions being answered. Burnett is part of Leo Burnett Worldwide, a unit of the Bcom3 Group. **********Even without being able to receive work directly from the agencies or cigarette companies, the club was  able to assemble an exhibit that shows remarkable ads on both sides of the tobacco issue. **********''The original idea was to just show how the view of cigarettes has changed in our culture,'' Ms. Cooper said, ''and how it has sort of created advertising both for and against.'' **********Two ads symbolize that striking opposition. A Marlboro ad by Burnett from 1958 depicts a rugged-looking cowboy, complete with a tattooed hand and a Western hat, and carries the theme: ''Where there's a man . . . there's a Marlboro.'' **********Across the room is a 1997 ad by Asher & Partners in Los Angeles, now Asher/Gal & Partners, for the California health department. That ad, deliberately imitating the look of the Marlboro cowboy campaign, shows two cowboys on horseback. In the headline, ones says to the other: ''Bob, I've got emphysema.'' **********The exhibit will be open through Nov. 30 at 32 East 21st Street, between Park Avenue and Broadway; the hours are 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday except Thanksgiving Day and the day after.

With CD-ROM's, early days means 1994, the heyday of the point-and-click adventure epitomized by Myst. **********Amerzone is one of those worlds. The game begins on a desolate coast (like neutron bomb sites, these worlds contain plenty of buildings with no signs of human habitation). A lighthouse looms ahead. Inside it, you find lots of switches in the basement and a 5 1/4-inch floppy disk beside an old computer. Upstairs, a naturalist's study contains dozens of objects you can't pick up. An old man sits at the desk, oblivious to your presence until you click on him. **********''The egg,'' he says, wheezing. ''The egg. It's still alive! Yes. But now, it's all over. I have no strength left. You must go for me. Take the egg, take the egg of the white birds back to Amerzone -- I beg you, please!'' **********He dies. **********Leaving him slumped over the desk, you climb a spiral staircase to the attic, where you find (get ready, this is a shocker) a journal containing the professor's curriculum vitae and a detailed account of a tropical expedition in which he pilots a hydrofloat upriver, encounters Indians and teaches them the wonders of mechanical devices (the schematics are artfully sketched in pencil) and finds the white birds of native mythology circling above a sacred volcano. **********A letter on the bookshelf explains how, possessed by ambition and greed, he stole the birds' only egg, containing the entire future of the species, only to be ridiculed by the Parisian scientific establishment. Meanwhile, Amerzone has been overtaken by a military despot. The egg, however, remains intact, and inside, ''slow, continuous heartbeats'' can be heard with a stethoscope, some 50 years later. The professor kept it in a climate-controlled storage area while he was building a new hydrofloat. **********''But, as I have already told you, I am now an old man,'' he wrote, with prescient knowledge that he would expire just before the letter was read. ''So it is up to you.'' **********Thus begins a paint-by-numbers Myst-like adventure of lush scenery and lever-pulling. It's beautiful on its own terms. But it's hard to play that kind of game anymore, having ranged freely in three-dimensional worlds where every object can be freely examined, destroyed, pocketed or used, and where there is more than one way to solve a problem. **********In 2000, Amerzone's tightly scripted sequences are constrictive -- the illusion of choice doesn't hold up because the old illusions have been rendered obsolete. For someone accustomed to deeper and more seamless virtual worlds, Amerzone's game play feels like a straitjacket. **********The prospect of 20 hours of knobs and cogs and compass readings seemed purgatorial. The audio environment was gorgeous, however, and after an hour of game play I decided it would be more fun to play the sound files than the game itself. **********Remember Choose Your Own Adventure? Anyone who grew up in the 80's remembers that book series -- it was the first interactive fiction to sell in huge quantities. You were supposed to carve alternative pathways through the story by making choices and flipping to different page numbers. But it was generally more fun to read the books from cover to cover, abandoning the linear narrative for a cubist collage of decision points and consequences and a better understanding of all possible solutions. **********Amerzone is best experienced in this fashion. The game consists of four CD-ROM's, each containing dozens of audio snippets, and if you play all the sound files in alphabetical order, you get a pretty good idea of what's going on. **********On the first disc, there's the sound of pages flipping (from the journal), switches being thrown, water running through pipes and plinking into buckets, a message from the director of the Museum of Natural History warning you in a high nasal voice not to venture into the Amerzone under any circumstances and lots of squeaky doors. There's water splashing against a dock, bubbling lab equipment and the unmistakable sound of hydraulic machinery. **********On later discs, you hear gulls and the sound of a large object splashing into water. ''It's coming back to me now,'' a grizzled sea codger says. ''Happened a long time ago, 1932, '33 maybe. There were three of them. They had a machine just like yours, the same thing. They never managed to restart it. They eventually left on a freighter that was passing through. The machine remained in the lagoon for some time. Then, in time, it sank. They also left a chest behind somewhere. Look, here's the key.'' **********You find the chest. A key turns in the lock. You haul something heavy out of the water. There are rapid-fire machine noises, gunfire perhaps, and an engine being fired from a standstill into high gear. **********Further into the heart of WAV file darkness, there are jungle sounds and animal snorts. Ferried across the marshes by the web-footed giraffe described in the professor's journal, you reach a temple at the base of the sacred volcano, where hot lava bubbles in close proximity to a sliding stone wall. A heavy plate shifts into place. The egg is deposited in its proper place. The white birds are restored to life, and Amerzone is redeemed. The End. **********I spent several hours delving into Amerzone's audio files. It wasn't a rich media experience. But it was immersive in a way that the panoramic vistas were not because it was an unfettered exploration, with room for competing theories and imaginative solutions. As a game, Amerzone is too shallow to be interesting. But it's fun to draw back the curtain, play with the stage rigging and fill in the blanks with sheer speculation. It also makes for wonderful moments of deja vu later, when you go back into the game and recognize a creaky bridge from your audio safari. **********Try it sometime. Dig up a vintage CD-ROM and just play the audio files. A 40-hour puzzle saga probably contains a pretty decent 40-minute audio sampler (a sonic scrapbook of your adventures, if nothing else). The games aren't worth replaying, but the sounds might be worth dragging back onto your hard drive. I would never suggest any kind of MP3 naughtiness with copyrighted material, but if you're sick of standard computer noises, tropical insects and mystical machines are a change of pace. **********There's gold in them there coasters. **********Amerzone, published by Microids; CD-ROM for Windows 95 and 98; $37.95; for all ages."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/08/technology/plan-for-free-access-in-britain.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-03-08", "snippet": "March 7, 2000", "word_count": 866, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Plan for Free Access in Britain", "print_headline": "Plan for Free Access in Britain", "body_text": " **********March 7, 2000 **********Plan for Free Access in Britain By JANE BLACK UBLIN -- In a major sign that the high cost of Web access in Britain may soon be doomed, NTL , an American communications group, announced on Tuesday that it would offer free and unlimited access to the Internet beginning April 17. **********The move came following pressure from the British government to lower the cost of getting online. In a speech to business and trade union leaders on Tuesday, Prime Minister Tony Blair praised the plan \"as a significant new offer\" that he hoped would help his reach his goal of allowing every British citizen unhampered access to the Web in the next five years. **********It also comes on the heels of a similar announcement on Monday from AltaVista . AltaVista, however, has set no date for the launch of its free service. **********The NTL plan is expected to shake up the already volatile Internet service provider market in Britain, which is currently led by Freeserve , a homegrown ISP. After the NTL announcement, Freeserve's stock fell sharply. Analysts say it may also hurt other players like America Online and British Telecom . **********Some Call It 'Free' **********AltaVista: There is a one-time charge of &#163;30 to &#163;50, then &#163;10 to &#163;20 a year. Users get access 24 hours a day without telephone charge. **********AOL: For &#163;9.99 a month, users get Internet access at all times for a telephone charge of 1 pound per minute. **********BT Click: No subscription charge. Users get Internet access at all times for the price of local phone calls. **********BT Internet: For &#163;9.99 a month subscription, users get access with no call charges between 6 p.m. and midnight and from midnight on Friday to midnight on Sunday. There are local call rates at other times. **********Freeserve: No subscription charge. Internet access 24 hours a day for the price of a local phone call. **********Freeserve originally introduced the concept of \"free\" Internet access to the British market. But despite the name, surfing the Web was never really free. Although consumers pay nothing for a Freeserve account, they do pay for each minute they are online for using the local phone line, which can cost up to about 10 cents per minute during peak hours. Freeserve takes a cut of the local phone charge. A new study from the Boston Consultant Group estimates that using such \"free\" services costs twice as much as using an Internet service provider in the United States. **********A Freeserve spokesman played down the NTL offer, saying Freeserve was always aware that the opportunity for making money on telephone revenues would diminish over time. He added that Freeserve's strategy is to grow by increasing advertising revenues and directing its 1.6 million registered users to e-commerce initiatives. **********NTL's plan, called ntlworld, will offer its service to anyone with a PC and a modem -- even if they live outside the reach of the company's cable networks. NTL, which did not say how it plans to make money from the new venture, will provide dail-up service by buying local phone access from British Telecom. **********But even this new \"free\" plan has a catch for consumers. Users who are outside NTL's reach will have to sign up with NTL for their voice telephone calls and spend at least \u015310 per month on calls to be eligible for the offer. NTL's networks only reach 5.6 million consumers. **********While the plan is undoubtedly a boon for consumers, the fight for unlimited access is only part of NTL's battle. Last year, it announced plans to merge with Cable and Wireless, one of Britain's biggest telecom operators. The planned merger is currently being reviewed by the government. NTL hopes that by boosting Internet use, one of the government's crusades, the government in turn will look favorably on the merger. **********Regardless of other motives, the offer is a giant step forward for the already-booming Internet market in Britain. Until the end of last year, British Telecom's lock on the phone market had made the future look grim. With the price of international calls falling, the telecom giant was reluctant to offer unlimited access because the growing volume of Internet-related calls was one of its most profitable activities. **********This month, British Telecom launched its own unlimited access plan. But the charges are still high -- &#163;35 per month, or almost $60, for full access. Last year, AOL, too, was forced to change its tack. It now offers a monthly subscription of &#163;9.99 and each minute online costs just one British penny, about 1.6 cents. **********Related Article **********America Online Unit to Reduce Subscription Costs in Britain **********(September 28, 1999) \"We are three-quarters of the way through the battle for unmetered Internet access,\" said Erol Ziya, spokesman for the nonprofit group Campaign for Unmetered Access . \"But in the end, it all really comes down to BT, which still has the only wires into about 80 percent of British homes. The competition can put on the pressure and subsidize unmetered programs but they are still paying a per-minute rate if they use the BT local loop.

Now all consumers are starting to take such treatment for granted. **********Online merchants and their brick-and-mortar rivals have seized on that trend. Seeking a competitive advantage, they are increasingly focusing on personal service, enhanced by the Internet, to win customers' loyalty. For online merchants, it can mean combining a physical component with their business. For other companies, even in hands-on industries like auto repair and dry cleaning, it can mean integrating Web and e-mail functions into the operations. That is, adding services to their services. **********Empori.com is a good example. The company is a spinoff of Oxford Properties Group, a Canadian office developer, which was seeking a new tenant amenity. Many buildings and companies offer concierge services, said David Bowden, Empori's managing director, but Empori.com uses the Internet to extend the relationship from buyer to seller through a new type of middleman. **********For example, Empori customers, who  join the service on the Internet, can order and pay for books, prescriptions, office supplies and other goods online from participating merchants. These merchants then deliver the orders to an Empori.com depot, where they are stored in lockers. When the order is complete, the buyer receives an e-mail message with a locker number and a code to unlock the door. **********For merchants, who give Empori a percentage of each sale, the service lowers delivery costs by meeting buyers halfway between the storefront and the homefront. It allows buyers to make free returns, which can be collected by Empori staff members and shipped back, Mr. Bowden said. Indeed, Empori.com workers become extensions of the merchants' customer service desk. **********''This started as a way to provide better value services to tenants in the buildings and their employees,'' Mr. Bowden said. ''But restricting it to the occupants of one address was not enough. The Internet is all about 'What you want, when you want it and how you want it.' This is a way to fix the problem with fulfillment.'' **********Crescent Real Estate Equities, a United States office developer, plans to introduce the drop-off concept in some Texas cities (names yet to be announced), and Mr. Bowden envisions a drive-through model or depots at busy places like hospitals or universities. The idea is not new, but the ways of reaching the customer are. **********And ever-rising customer expectations are demanding that there be a single provider of everything from groceries to dry cleaning, videos and snacks, said Christopher M. Kelley, an analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. **********''Time-saving convenience is what consumers come back to again and again as the biggest benefit,'' he said. ''But how can these companies offer so many options and still make money as they turn to proactive service? The line is becoming blurred between products and services.'' **********The desire for personal assistance has prompted some companies to use the Internet and e-mail messages to improve customer service. **********At JoeAuto.com, an auto repair company in Houston, customers can monitor repairs on their cars by watching a digital camera on the Web or, when they drop off their vehicle, borrow a cellular phone to discuss and approve repairs with the mechanics. **********The Simon Property Group, a developer of shopping malls, is working with Found Inc. to integrate clicks with bricks-and-mortar entities. Customers can check inventory in local stores and order online, but they must pick up and pay for their purchases at the store. Some merchants use the data they collect from these online transactions to balance seasonal spikes, promote off-season special offers by e-mail message or remind customers that it is time to clean the gutters. In return, Web-educated consumers demand more of wired merchants. **********Increasingly, consumers are doing so through the keyboard. A survey by Forrester last year found that 37 percent of all online buyers had requested customer service online. And given their choice of phone, in person, fax and mail, 70 percent of online buyers who sought customer service reported they used only one method during their last interaction: 71 percent of those people turned to e-mail and 51 percent used the phone. **********''Retailers think of using customer service to resolve consumers' post-purchase problems,'' Mr. Kelley of Forrester said. ''However, online shoppers expect Web stores to provide customer service from the moment they log on until the product is delivered.'' **********Another business tailored for the new economy is Zoots -- a three-year-old dry-cleaning venture begun outside Boston by Thomas Stemberg, who created Staples, the office-products giant. Using keycards to enter secured portions of retail stores, customers can have 24-hour access to drop off or pick up clothes. They can schedule home pickup and delivery and even change ''light starch'' to ''no starch'' online through a password-protected customer profile, said Todd Krasnow, the chief executive of Zoots, which has 36 stores in 9 states. **********Sales have grown to $30 million this year from $6 million last year -- and the company has expanded into tailoring, shoe repair and even private-label dry cleaning for companies that want to offer it to employees. **********''We found customers wanted more service from us, so we started offering pickup and delivery,'' Mr. Krasnow said. ''People sent us e-mails, and now we're working on other enhancements. The Internet is great for instant feedback, and we get lots of feedback that helps us improve what we offer.'' **********For many customers, e-mail message is the fastest way to relay compliments or complaints, he said.

Dirksen, the late senator from Illinois, reportedly  said, ''A billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon you're talking real money,'' it was the 1960's, and he was talking about the federal budget. **********In the 90's, the standard was ratcheted up a tad. Consider the technology-laden Nasdaq stock market: Last year, the capitalization for the market's stocks doubled from the end of 1998, to $5.2 trillion. **********The dollar number ran up so fast -- particularly in December -- that few people actually thought of it as real. But the billions that were cashed out or lost in Nasdaq's 4.6 percent slide last week were not funny money. **********Kevin Landis, a portfolio manager for Firsthand Funds, which invests exclusively in technology, has seen Nasdaq sell-offs before. He took some time last week from his office in San Jose, Calif., to talk about what he sees in this one. Following are excerpts from the conversation: **********Q. Most observers were expecting a sell-off in technology stocks early this year, after the huge run-up in 1999. Has its magnitude surprised you? **********A. I look at this as mood swings: I can't predict mood swings, but I am not surprised by them. I don't try to time market sell-offs, but when I see one I try to take advantage of it. Last year, we had three different dips in the Nasdaq of between 8 percent and 10 percent, and each time it was down for only a brief period. **********We have a fair amount of cash on hand, and a bunch of companies we like are more affordable now than they were a week ago. We intend to go shopping. **********Q. What would give you cause for concern that this is something more serious? **********A. If we had fundamental bad news about the technology industry in general or any of these companies in particular, then you could argue that there is a lot more room to fall. But there is not a lot of fundamental news that is driving the sell-off. It is psychology. Some investors have been trying to pick the point where they are going to take their profits. And a number were holding on for dear life. Now that they think they have seen the near-term peak, they want to get out. As usual, they all want to do it at once. **********Q. Still, many have referred to what happened last year as a mania, or a speculative bubble. Is that a fair assessment? **********A. Every time stocks go up aggressively, people come out of the woodwork to say it is a bubble, but nobody really knows. **********Look at the Cisco Systems and Microsoft bubbles that weren't bubbles. Look at the eBay bubble that so far hasn't been a bubble. Most of this is real. It's not tulip bulbs. **********Q. Does the Lucent Technologies earnings warning on Thursday qualify as a fundamentally bad development? **********A. Companies miss their numbers. Big companies can have a bad mile and still run a great race. This is nothing more than that. **********Q. Can you give some past examples of bad fundamental developments? **********A. Think what happened to personal computer stocks over the last few years, where price elasticity turned pretty unfavorable in that market and price pressure intensified. Think about all the wireless companies during the Asian financial crisis, when rollouts in those markets were postponed. **********Downward revisions of basic demand would be bad. That is not happening here. In fact, there are a number of interesting catalysts that could be spurring demand. **********For example, the time and effort corporate America has been putting into testing systems for Y2K is going to be used in the e-commerce transformation, and I think that will lead to some fairly aggressive spending in that area. **********Q. Where can investors look to see if demand has materialized? **********A. In a couple of quarters it will show up in results from companies like Exodus Communications, which provides Internet system and network management solutions to business, or at Commerce One or BroadVision, which are e-commerce software companies. **********Q. Are you among the many folks who worry about the threat that rising interest rates seem to pose to technology stocks? **********A. Whenever interest rates become an issue,  it lasts for a few days, and then it is back to buying. What would worry me in terms of a big compression in price-earnings multiples is if there were a lot of other really compelling investment alternatives for people. Absent that, I don't worry too much. **********Q. What sorts of companies do you like now? **********A. The types of companies we have been most interested in lately are those that provide underlying e-commerce technology and photonics companies, those who make equipment to move data on lasers. In general, we have avoided the dot-com names. That has made us a little less volatile and allowed me to sleep better at night. I think we will continue that way."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/14/your-money/IHT-from-doughnuts-to-driveins-hot-ideas-mean-sweet-investments.html": {"writer_name": "Sharon Reier", "pub_date": "2000-10-14", "snippet": "FOR AN ILLUSTRATION of how a franchise company with a hot product can fuel investor enthusiasm, look no further than Krispy Kreme Doughnut Co., one of the most successful new stocks of the year.

On April 5, the 63-year-old North Carolina doughnut chain went public at $21 per share. On Thursday, its stock closed at $81. **********If Krispy Kreme's retro-look shops, with \"doughnut theaters\" that permit customers to watch the baking process, are exciting to consumers and investors, the concept also has proven alluring to a selective group of franchisees, who are providing the capital to expand the chain exponentially. **********While Krispy Kreme had only 90 franchised units at mid-year, it is expected to have more than 500 in the foreseeable future. **********\"You have to be a big boy and commit yourself to opening an entire area,\" said Richard Sheldon, a Harvard Business School graduate who owns several quick-service restaurants in Hartford, Connecticut. **********Such big boys include the Florida-based crooner Jimmy Buffett, whose Margaritaville Restaurant chain will be rolling out Krispy Kreme units in the Palm Beach area. In the Denver, Milwaukee and Minneapolis areas, the business will be franchised by the officers of AmeriKing Corp., the largest franchisee of Burger Kings in the United States, with 368 stores. **********So far this year, Krispy Kreme's franchised sales increased by 47.8 percent over the previous year. The company said comparable-store sales \u2014 those at outlets that were open in 2000 and in 1999 \u2014 were up more than 14 percent. **********That contrasts with McDonald's Corp., which is probably the most successful franchise story ever. Since 1954, when Ray Kroc convinced the McDonald brothers to franchise their burger stand in San Berandino, California, McDonald's has become the poster child for globalization, with more than 25,000 outlets in 119 countries. **********But globalization is not necessarily a welcome development these days. From Seattle to southern France, protesters bash McDonald's restaurants to make a statement against international economic integration. Investors have been bashing the stock, too: From a high of just below $50 in November, the shares have tanked to $28.375 on Thursday **********McDonald's has had three strikes against it this year, according to Peter Oakes, restaurant analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co. **********The euro has contributed to the worst currency loss in the history of the company. In the United States, which is a mature market for McDonald's, same-store sales fell between 1 and 2 percent during the second quarter, albeit off a high figure for 1999. Finally, investors believe units in Latin America and Asia have not recovered sufficiently after the emerging-markets crisis that began in 1997. **********The lesson is that a good brand name or good product and even a well-run chain may not mean a consistently good stock price. **********\"McDonald's is the closest thing we have to a Microsoft in this industry,\" Mr. Oakes said. **********But this industry leader's stock is currently valued by investors at only about 20 times its expected earnings per share in the coming year, while little Krispy Kreme has a price-to-earnings ratio of 81. **********Krispy Kreme is exceptional, however, with most franchise stocks having been drubbed over the past year. Bargain hunters can look at others with prices so low, but they ought to be careful. **********\"The first thing an investor should investigate when he buys a franchise company is the product the company offers the public,\" said Michael Smith, restaurant analyst at Fahnestock & Co. in Kansas City, Missouri. **********\"You have to get the consumer to go there and buy and come back,\" he added. \"You have to ask, 'What is the product?' and in restaurants it is more than food. It is the experience, the particular ambiance.\" **********Ambiance can be a pivotal factor. One stock Mr. Smith is recommending is Sonic Corp., which franchises the Sonic Drive-In restaurant chain. Based in Oklahoma City, Sonic has a menu that appeals to the typical American fast-food palate: hamburgers, hot dogs, chicken-fried steak and soft ice-cream desserts. But what makes Sonic shine is its ambiance. **********\"The Sonic Drive-In's schtick is that they are a throwback to the 1950s,\" Mr. Smith said. \"They give you a fantasy world where there are still carhops.\" **********Customers drive into the parking lot and order off a menu board. Minutes later, a carhop arrives at the customer's car window with a trayful of food. **********The company has 1,807 franchised outlets and 306 company-owned units, primarily in Southern and Western states, where the absence of inclement weather makes the carhop service possible year-round. **********Mr. Smith likes the company because comparable-store sales are growing. Comparable-store sales are considered critical in predicting the success of a franchisor because a rising number means the brand is still pulling in customers. **********\"Higher comp sales generally means that the market values a company higher,\" Mr. Smith said. \"If you have increased comp store sales, it means that you don't have to worry that the concept is deteriorating.\" **********It also generally means higher margins, since there are many fixed costs in running a franchise operation, and the higher the per-store revenue, the more return the company is earning on those costs. **********Sonic closed Thursday at $31 per share. With earnings estimated at $1.74 per share this year and $2.11 for next year, it means the stock is selling at about 19 times earnings, just under the P/E ratio for McDonald's. **********Another up-and-coming restaurant franchise that Mr. Smith recommended was Papa John's International Inc., which is based in Louisville, Kentucky, and recently became the third-largest pizza chain in the United States. **********Mr. Smith suggested that in order to evaluate the potential of a franchise company, investors put themselves in the shoes of a franchisee. **********\"In a really successful restaurant franchise concept, the return on investment should be north of 30 percent,\" he said. **********He defined the return on investment as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, known as EBITDA or cash flow, divided by the amount of cash invested. **********Papa John's, which recently acquired Perfect Pizza Holdings Ltd. in Britain, offers franchisees a 60 percent return on investment, Mr. Smith said. **********Other industry observers noted that the cash flow over cash calculations can be difficult to do with precision, and even high returns are no insurance that a concept will not fail. **********\"In our industry, 40 percent of all initial public offers eventually,\" Mr. Oakes said. **********Even when they do not end up in the graveyard, some franchise companies stumble and are taken private or acquired. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. acquired International Dairy Queen Inc. early in 1998 after its stock showed little appreciation during the bull market that began early in the decade. Although it is alive, the ice-cream retailer has never fully regained its former stature. **********There is a better outcome for Dunkin Donuts Inc., a U.S. chain with a far-flung franchise network in Asia. Dunkin Donuts was in a tailspin when it was purchased by Allied Domecq PLC in 1989. But the franchise has since been rejuvenated. The chain now sells upscale coffees along with its old-line doughnuts and new bagel products. **********Franchisees are buying again, and the units are being married to Baskin-Robbins ice-cream shops and Togo sandwich shops, all owned by Allied Domecq. **********While a franchise concept may seem to have a lot of promise, some analysts warn that the accounting can be a Pandora's box. For instance, the Schlotzsky's Inc. delicatessen chain was buying land and developing restaurants before selling them to franchisees, and then booking the real estate profit. **********The company was more of a land developer than a franchisor, and it was hardly successful in real estate: It came public in 1995 at $11 per share, had a secondary offering at $18.38 and closed Thursday at $4.50 **********Analysts also take issue with franchise companies that buy back franchises from retiring or discontented franchisees, since that can manipulate earnings upward in the short run. **********The beaten down stocks of former franchising stars, however, offer an opportunity to investors. **********In 1998, the Bear Stearns & Co. analyst David Nadel downgraded the stock of Sylvan Learning Systems Inc. The company franchises tutoring programs for elementary and middle-school pupils. It also franchises English-language learning centers with branches throughout Europe and Latin America, and it is venturing into Asia and the Middle East. **********At the time, Mr. Nadel recommended selling Sylvan because, he said, \"the business had grown over-complex.\" **********\"We felt they were spending too much time on acquisition and not enough time running their own business,\" he added. **********In January, when Sylvan's stock was oscillating between $11 and $12, Mr. Nadel re-rated it as \"attractive.' **********The shares, he said, had \"become very cheap.\" Moreover, Sylvan sold a testing business for much more money than investors had expected. Mr. Nadel noted that the stock market values the company at about $627 million, with a Thursday closing price of $14.84. That is not much more than the $421 million cash horde the company reported on its June 30 balance sheet and less than twice its net current assets of $362 million **********In Japan, believers in the franchise business could choose to invest in the stocks of Venture Link Co. and thus benefit from Japan's proliferation of franchise ventures. Venture Link identifies a potential franchisor, forms a joint venture with it and draws profits from the growth of that franchise chain. **********Ultimately aiming to list stocks of that franchise company, Venture Link has successfully incubated Gulliver International Co., a chain of used-car retailers, and Saint Marc Co., a bakery restaurant chain, both of which are listed on Japan's over-the-counter market, known as Jasdaq. Nikko Salomon Smith Barney Ltd. gives Venture Link's stock an outperform rating, with a target price of 10,000 yen ($92) **********TO READ a Money Report article about Krispy Kreme's initial public offering, see the Web page at www.iht.com/IHT/MONEY/052700/my052700e.html **********[Not to be reproduced without the permission of the author.]"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/10/world/protestant-protests-in-ulster-begin-peacefully-but-turn-violent.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-07-10", "snippet": "Demonstration by Orange Order, Protestant organization, over ban against its march through Catholic neighborhood in Portadown, Northern Ireland, begins peacefully but later turns violent, with clashes with soldiers (M)", "word_count": 505, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Protestant Protests in Ulster Begin Peacefully but Turn Violent", "print_headline": "Protestant Protests in Ulster Begin Peacefully but Turn Violent", "body_text": " **********A demonstration by the Orange Order, a traditional Protestant organization, over a ban on the group's marching route through a Catholic neighborhood began peacefully today, but was marked by violent protests and clashes with soldiers in the evening. **********Accompanied by bands of accordion players and drummers, Orangemen in ceremonial bowler hats and orange sashes marched from the center of Portadown to the Drumcree church before they were stopped by a barricade.

Despite pouring rain, hundreds of supporters remained at the scene after the rally. **********Later, the crowd grew again, to about 1,000 demonstrators, who clashed with the soldiers, throwing bottles and stones and trying to break through the barricade. **********''We are here this morning with one aim: to have our civil and religious liberties restored,'' said the Portadown Orangemen's leader, Harold Gracey, who called for province-wide protests on Monday. **********Protestant parades throughout July commemorate ancient victories over Catholics.

The actions began in Belfast last Sunday and continued through the week. **********Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, accused Protestant paramilitary organizations of hijacking the Portadown Orange Order's cause for their own ends.

''I'm not in the business of condemning violence,'' he said. **********The protests did not go uncriticized by Protestants, though.

But a Turkish bath is more than spa treatment. It provides a glimpse of an almost extinct and much romanticized tradition, passed on from the Byzantine era to the Ottomans to the modern-day Turks. **********In the heart of the city is the Cemberlitas Hamam, an easy walk from the mosque and the Grand Bazaar. This gray marble 16th-century building was designed by Mimar Sinan, the legendary architect of Istanbul's Blue Mosque. **********In the women's section of Cemberlitas, the only reminders of modernity are a lightbulb dangling from the ceiling and a plastic sign forbidding women to walk without sandals or without a towel wrapped around their waist. Women of all shapes and ages ignore the sign and lounge on a circular platform that seems to float in the middle of the bath chamber. In place of modern showers are knee-high marble sinks over which women bend and ladle up small buckets of water to rinse their hair. **********Other traditional baths restrict their opening hours for women. Cemberlitas is open from dawn to midnight. Women massage women and men scrub men, each in their separate sections of the bath. My husband described his massage as \"forced molting.\" **********The rubdown I received from a corpulent Turkish woman in a black bikini bottom was gentler. On entering the Cemberlitas bath, you undress and store your belongings in a locker, then carry soap and your massage ticket into an austere and beautiful marble chamber. Light streams through a honeycomb of small glass polka dots in the dome above. The reward of a bath may be physical rather than spiritual, but when entering Cemberlitas I find my senses tingling with an almost religious mix of mystery, anticipation and aesthetic pleasure. **********On my first visit, I laid awkwardly on the heated platform and waited nervously. I tried to avoid eye contact with the various odalisques reclining nearby and felt neglected by the bath attendant sauntering by in her flip-flops. Patience! Nothing is left to chance. As I later realized, the masseuse gave me 15 minutes to mellow down and warm up in contact with the hot marble. **********On subsequent visits, I got the recipe down. First the masseuse comes with a bucket full of luminous foam. She motions me to lie on my stomach and covers me from head to toe in a billowing cloud of suds squeezed out of a pillow case. She scrubs my back with an abrasive mitt and then, after flipping me like an omelet, works on the front. Forging on silently, she banishes stress from my limbs and rejuvenates the soles of my feet. The session ends in one of several small alcoves separated from the central chamber by finely carved arches. There, I am shampooed and rinsed profusely. **********Then I am free to rest an hour or so on the platform. As sounds echo dimly from the street and other parts of the hamam, it is easy to forget time. **********If you have more than a couple of hours to spare in Istanbul, stroll through the old Sultanhamet district before going to the hamam. Both the Cemberlitas and the Cagaloglu baths (a competing and equally good hamam founded in the 18th century) are just a few minutes' walk from some of Istanbul's architectural musts: the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia Basilica and the Basilica Cistern. The baths stay open much later than tourist sites. **********The Sultanhamet district, on the European side of Istanbul, is about a 20-minute taxi ride from major hotels. Cab fares are cheap and Turkish addresses, since Kemal Ataturk's reform, are spelled in Latin letters. The drive across the Galata bridge, lined at all hours with amateur fishermen, offers terrific views of the Golden Horn, a busy estuary crisscrossed by ferries and crowned by the feathery silhouettes of minarets. **********Cemberlitas Hamam, 8 Vezirhan Caddesi, tel: (90-212) 522-7974. The bath is off Divan Yolu, a street with tramway tracks that shoots west from the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia area toward the Grand Bazaar.

But as he has done repeatedly during this crisis, he sent seemingly mixed signals about his attitude toward the white farmers and the direction he intends to take in dealing with them. **********Striking a conciliatory tone in his speech, which commemorated two decades of independence and black majority rule, Mr. Mugabe said he appreciates ''the pressures facing the farmers.'' **********But later today, in an interview with state television, he adopted a more confrontational stance, saying that the farmers have ''behaved as enemies of Zimbabwe'' in ''coercing'' their workers to support the new opposition party and in contesting a constitutional amendment giving the government the right to seize white-owned land without compensation. ''They are definite enemies in the sense of wanting to reverse our revolution and our independence,'' Mr. Mugabe said. **********If either message is taking hold among the masses occupying the farms, it would appear to be the latter. The mayhem today made it the worst so far in the protracted political standoff that has turned increasingly menacing. **********In the Christon Bank area, north of here, a farmer was abducted and brutally beaten before being rescued by the authorities several hours later, said Richard Amyot, a deputy director of the farmers union. **********Mr. Amyot also said that in another confrontation between a band of loyal farm workers and squatters on a farm, the squatters abducted the farm owner's adult son and then burned several buildings, even after receiving 2,000 Zimbabwe dollars in exchange for the son's release. **********''This is horrifying,'' Mr. Amyot said as he rushed to the airport for a flight to the scene of the killing. **********The violence around the country came on a day that the farmers had hoped would yield the breakthrough that has so far proved elusive. **********[The United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, spoke with Mr. Mugabe, and urged the president to defuse tensions, The Associated Press reported. In response, Mr. Mugabe said he would meet with leaders of the squatters and farmers on Wednesday, said Fred Eckhard, Mr. Annan's spokesman.] **********On Monday, the president called the leaders of the farmers union to his office here in the capital for a surprise meeting. After listening to their concerns and pressing his own, Mr. Mugabe told them that he hoped to have the farmers sit down with war veterans who have been spearheading the farm raids and broker an end to the occupations. **********Despite today's developments, the farmers' union said it plans to continue talks, but its leaders were astonished that the killing could have happened when it did. ''We're in the middle of discussions with the highest authority in the land and then the next morning this happens?'' Mr. Amyot asked rhetorically. **********In addition to the two white farmers killed in the last week, two black supporters of the new opposition party were killed when their car was firebombed, apparently by supporters of the president's governing party, ZANU-PF. **********A delegation of top government ministers is to leave this week for Britain for a meeting aimed at renewing British commitments to help Zimbabwe, its former colony, redistribute land. ''It's a make-or-break week,'' said the president's spokesman, George Charamba. **********The countries have been sniping for months, but the invitation by the British foreign secretary, Robin Cook, to talk may be the beginning of a thaw that would go a long way toward stabilizing Zimbabwe.  ''We're moving from conflict to a convergence of ideas and that is the basis for the president's optimism,'' Mr. Charamba said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/24/world/germans-plan-to-trim-army-and-rely-less-on-the-draft.html": {"writer_name": "Roger Cohen", "pub_date": "2000-05-24", "snippet": "Defense Min Rudolph Scharping accepts recommendations of government-appointed independent commission to drastically reform and shrink draft-based army still set up to fight cold war; stops short of endorsing all-professional army; apparently plans...", "word_count": 725, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Germans Plan To Trim Army And Rely Less On the Draft", "print_headline": "Germans Plan To Trim Army And Rely Less On the Draft", "body_text": " **********Germany's defense minister accepted a recommendation today to drastically reform and shrink a draft-based army that is still set up to fight the cold war. But he stopped short of endorsing an all-professional army similar to those of other European countries. **********''The army is too big, ill-composed and increasingly out of step with the times,'' a government-appointed independent commission headed by Richard von Weizsacker, a former president, said in a report published today. ''The Bundeswehr has no future in its current structure.'' **********The Bundeswehr, as the German armed forces are called, was formed in 1955 with an initial force of 101 volunteers. It has always reflected important principles of the postwar republic, among them allegiance to NATO and the rejection through a citizens' army of Prussian officer-caste militarism. So its reform is particularly sensitive. **********The defense minister, Rudolf Scharping, said in receiving the report: ''The Bundeswehr will become smaller. It will be cut by around 100,000 over the next five years.'' The size of the armed forces, including more than 100,000 civilian staff members, is 460,000, suggesting an overall reduction of about 22 percent. **********That falls short of the commission's proposal to cut the force by 30 percent. But Mr. Scharping, a Social Democrat, is aware of fierce resistance to wholesale reform among the officer corps, veterans and conservative Germans inclined to view change as dangerous. **********The discussion comes at a sensitive time, with a cash-strapped government committed to providing a substantial contribution to a new European rapid reaction corps of 60,000 troops supposed to be in place by 2002. It would operate within NATO but would be able to take on missions that the United States declined. **********NATO has for some time been pressing Germany -- now surrounded by allies for the first time in its modern history -- to follow other European countries like France and Britain in scrapping the draft, streamlining its operations and adopting an all-professional army largely set up for rapid deployment in trouble spots. **********Responding to those calls, the commission's report proposes slashing the scope of the draft so that just 30,000 people are conscripted each year instead of 130,000 -- an awkward attempt at compromise between the evident need for professionalization and enduring support for the draft, particularly among older Germans. **********The attempted compromise reflects the fact that Germany remains a special case. The history of the army's state-within-a-state militarism in the years between the two world wars has made the country deeply wary of completely abandoning the draft. **********The notion that service is part of a young person's education remains popular. And the still unstable east of the continent is much closer to Berlin than to Paris or London. **********''Our geographic position is special, and we do not yet have the long-term perspective of stability in the whole of Europe,'' said Lt. Col. Rudiger Trapp, an armed forces spokesman. ''That is one reason to keep some conscription.'' **********An internal report prepared by Gen. Hans-Peter von Kirchbach, the armed forces chief of staff, favors a much smaller cut in conscription to about 80,000 a year, and Mr. Scharping is widely expected to favor this less radical proposal. **********He is also likely to settle for keeping troop levels at about 290,000, rather than the 240,000 suggested in the report, military officials said. **********The minister will face opposition from the Social Democrats' coalition partners, the Greens, who favor ending conscription. ''We again call for an end to mandatory conscription, a move that is legally correct and politically sound,'' said Angelika Beer, a defense expert for the Greens. **********It appears possible that selective conscription could prompt legal complaints of discrimination from those called up. **********Overall, the report amounts to a sweeping proposal to create a highly mobile, more professional army adapted to crisis management missions beyond Germany's borders rather than the former static role of defense against Soviet divisions. **********Germany's experience in Kosovo, where it has 7,300 peacekeeping troops, has provided ample evidence of the need for mobility. The commission proposes increasing the number of troops prepared for rapid deployment to 140,000 from 60,000. **********Germany spends 1.5 percent of its total output on defense, compared with 2.8 percent in Britain and France and more than 3 percent in the United States. Mr. Scharping faces heated debates within the cabinet in the next few weeks as he seeks to maintain the current military budget at a time when all departments are being asked for cuts."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/23/business/sotheby-s-head-says-setbacks-will-be-costly-but-not-fatal.html": {"writer_name": "Carol Vogel", "pub_date": "2000-02-23", "snippet": "Michael I Sovern, new chairman of Sotheby's predicts extensive federal antitrust investigation and various class-action suits will be expensive but not life-threatening for company; Sotheby's and Christie's are at center of criminal investigation ...", "word_count": 888, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sotheby's Head Says Setbacks Will Be Costly But Not Fatal", "print_headline": "Sotheby's Head Says Setbacks Will Be Costly But Not Fatal", "body_text": " **********As its stock took another beating yesterday, the new chairman of Sotheby's, the beleaguered international auction house, predicted that an extensive federal antitrust investigation and various class-action lawsuits would be ''expensive but not life-threatening'' for the 256-year-old company. **********''The message has to be that the company is in sound shape and that the management team is intact except for the two top people,'' Michael I. Sovern, the former president of Columbia University, said in a phone interview. Mr. Sovern, who has frequently stepped into trouble-shooting situations, was named to replace Sotheby's largest shareholder, A. Alfred Taubman, as chairman at a board meeting Monday. Resigning with Mr. Taubman was the company's president and chief executive, Diana D. Brooks, who was replaced by William F. Ruprecht, formerly in charge of the company's North and South American operations. **********The company and its archrival Christie's are at the center of a criminal investigation of a possible conspiracy to fix the commissions they charge buyers and sellers. The two companies, with imposing presences in New York, London and other cities, control 95 percent of the $4 billion worldwide auction business, meaning any collusion on commission rates could have easily cost their customers in the tens of millions of dollars. **********Mr. Sovern, virtually unknown in the art world, said he had been approached by two old friends less than a week ago to take over the chairmanship. One was Ira Milstein, a senior partner at Weil Gotschal & Manges, the Fifth Avenue law firm that Sotheby's hired to represent it in the federal investigation. The other was Henry R. Kravis, the leveraged buyout specialist, who is a Sotheby's board member and a Columbia alumnus. Mr. Sovern said he had had little time to educate himself about either Sotheby's or the art world and had not met with prosecutors. **********''I know the difference between a Serra and a Stella,'' he said.''But I'm more of a museumgoer and window shopper than art buyer.'' The fact that his late wife, Joan Sovern, was a sculptor gave him ''at least one toe in the art world,'' he added. **********In the interview, he did mention some policy directions. He said there would be no further shake-up of management, and, he said, that while it was too early to discuss commission changes, Sotheby's ''will not be underbid by Christie's.'' Christie's, which has turned over to prosecutors information about possible conduct relevant to the investigation, recently changed its commission structure to make it more attractive for sellers to deal with it rather than Sotheby's. **********The stock market did not respond well to the continuing investigation or the appointments of Mr. Sovern and Mr. Ruprecht, whose direct sales experience involved objects like expensive rugs rather than art. Sotheby's shares closed at $15.625, down 12 percent from the Friday close of $17.75. The stock had traded as high as $42 last spring. **********''I don't know whether investors will be inspired by the new team,'' said James M. Meyer, director of research at Janney Montgomery Scott, the Philadelphia-based investment firm. ''Nobody's got experience running an auction house. This is a business of relationships, and they have to make sure they don't lose their expertise.'' **********Several analysts said it would be better for Sotheby's if Mr. Taubman, who is still on the board and who owns 22.5 percent of the outstanding shares of the company and has 63 percent of voting power on the board, sold his position in the company. Despite rumors even before the investigation heated up that he was looking to sell, Mr. Taubman denied any intention of doing so. He did not return phone calls yesterday. **********Some analysts said, however, that such a sale would not be easy to do. ''Sotheby's has a big cloud hanging over it,'' said one analyst who would talk only on condition of anonymity. **********Mr. Meyer said that the chances of Sotheby's being sold to a public company were ''slim, '' but that a leveraged buyout specialist might be interested in buying it on the cheap. **********In addition to the investigation and the lawsuits filed by buyers, sellers and shareholders, Sotheby's $40 million investment in its Internet business has been another problem for the company. Last year it started two Web sites, one with Amazon.com and the other independently, and neither one has been popular with buyers, sellers or Wall Street. But Mr. Sovern was upbeat about the investment yesterday, calling it ''solid'' and something that ''would pay off.'' **********More pressing to art dealers who were stunned by this week's events was how the climate will affect the important spring auctions in New York and London and art prices in general, which have been robust over the last few years. ''If I were a seller with a $5 million Picasso I think I might say that given the tumult and the lack of buyer's confidence I'd sit tight for another six months before I'd sell,'' Mr. Meyer said. ''As things stand now with the investigation, it's hard to believe this is the end of the story.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/31/business/credit-offerings-planned-during-the-week.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-01-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 226, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Credit Offerings Planned During the Week", "print_headline": "Credit Offerings Planned During the Week", "body_text": " **********The Treasury's schedule of financing this week is confined to today's regular weekly auction of three-  and six-month bills and a two-year note to be auctioned on Wednesday.

Nacchio, and its biggest investor, Philip P. Anschutz, are highly interested in selling their company, even as they explore renegotiating Qwest's agreement to acquire U S West Inc., executives close to the company said yesterday. **********The leading candidate to acquire Qwest, an upstart long-distance company based in Denver, has been Deutsche Telekom of Germany, Europe's largest communications carrier. But around the middle of this week, Deutsche Telekom cooled its negotiations with Qwest as the German company became newly aware of the many factors that would complicate such a deal, executives close to the talks said. **********So over the last 72 hours, Deutsche Telekom has re-invigorated acquisition talks with other companies, including Global Crossing Ltd. of Bermuda, which is building undersea communications systems around the world, executives close to those discussions said. **********The consensus estimate of many executives close to the negotiations is that the chance of Deutsche Telekom's consummating a deal with Qwest -- a process that in any case could take weeks -- is now less than 50 percent. **********In just a few years, Qwest has transformed itself from an obscure construction operation digging ditches for fiber optic cables into a muscular newcomer with a market value of more than $40 billion. Mr. Anschutz, an oil and railroad magnate, has always been seen as an investor rather than as someone committed to running a communications company for the long term, and people close to the company say that he and Mr. Nacchio, a former executive at AT&T, now believe that the time is ripe to lock in some of their spectacular gains. **********Qwest agreed to acquire U S West, the smallest of the Bell local phone companies, just last summer. But that deal has not gone smoothly. **********Apparently unaware that Qwest was in merger discussions with Deutsche Telekom, U S West's chairman, Solomon D. Trujillo, announced earlier this week that he would not join a combined Qwest-U S West. Executives close to the companies said that Mr. Nacchio had devised a management structure that would have minimized Mr. Trujillo's authority. **********An underlying source of tension in the Qwest-U S West relationship is that it would be far easier for Qwest to sell itself to Deutsche Telekom, or indeed to just about any other company, had Qwest not already agreed to acquire U S West. **********Qwest says that it is still committed to the U S West deal. But it struck some analysts as telling that this week Mr. Nacchio, Qwest's chairman, made his first strong comments suggesting that Qwest was considering ways to back out of the U S West deal. **********''This is not like at any costs,'' Mr. Nacchio said in an interview with The Denver Post. ''I want the merger to go through, but I'm not going to get blackmailed to do dumb business things to make it go through.'' **********Qwest could argue that significant regulatory delays in acquiring U S West would allow it to walk away from the deal after paying U S West an $800 million breakup fee. **********But yesterday, U S West went on the offensive against that potential outcome. In a letter to Qwest's general counsel, Drake Tempest, his counterpart at U S West, Mark Roellig, wrote, ''As a lawyer, I am certain that you are aware that any damages in no way will be limited by the breakup fee.'' **********Ominously, he added, ''Such damages would very likely make the Pennzoil judgment pale in comparison.'' In 1985, Texaco, the oil giant, was ordered to pay Pennzoil $10.5 billion for enticing Getty Oil to back out of a previous deal to merge with Pennzoil in favor of a bid from Texaco. After filing for protection under the bankruptcy laws, Texaco agreed to pay Pennzoil $3 billion. **********For Deutsche Telekom, the prospect of trying to acquire only Qwest and being sued by U S West appears highly discouraging. **********The quandary is that acquiring both U S West and Qwest would not be a simple matter either. As a Bell company that emerged from AT&T in 1984, U S West is regulated far more strictly than is Qwest. Were Deutsche Telekom to try to acquire both Qwest and U S West, the Qwest portion of the deal could sail through in months while the U S West portion would be subject to regulatory reviews that could take more than a year and could even entail Deutsche Telekom's making further concessions to open its systems in Germany. **********Deeply embarrassed after he was left at the altar by Telecom Italia last year, Ron Sommer, Deutsche Telekom's chairman, is said by people close to the company to be searching for a sure thing. **********Moreover, Deutsche Telekom does not appear to have nearly as much interest in becoming the local phone company in states including Idaho and North Dakota, which are served by U S West, as it does in acquiring Qwest's modern national fiber optic network. **********Whatever happens with Deutsche Telekom, Qwest still appears to be spoiling to convince U S West to renegotiate their deal so that Qwest would control more of their combined company, executives close to Qwest said yesterday. **********As for Deutsche Telekom, its trans-Atlantic ambitions are well known. The German company has repeatedly said it wants to create a global network and is keen to find a partner in the United States. **********Deutsche Telekom has been circling potential prey in the United States for at least a year, putting out feelers to communications carriers of every size and description. Ever since Deutsche Telekom lost the opportunity to acquire the Sprint Corporation, its partner in the ill-fated Global One alliance, the German company has stepped up its search for potential partners. Sprint agreed to be acquired by MCI Worldcom last October. **********Among the possible targets is Global Crossing, which has its operational headquarters in Los Angeles. Executives close to Deutsche Telekom said Global Crossing might even be a better match than Qwest and U S West because Global Crossing's ambitions were already truly global. **********Deutsche Telekom has also made preliminary contact with Bell Atlantic, SBC Communications and BellSouth, though none of those talks have gone beyond preliminary stages, executives close to Deutsche Telekom said. Deutsche Telekom has also cast an eye at PSINet Inc., the Internet backbone carrier, though no talks are under way, the executives said. **********Outside the United States, Deutsche Telekom has also held exploratory discussions with Telefonica of Spain and Cable and Wireless of Britain."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/30/business/the-markets-key-rates.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-06-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 118, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "THE MARKETS; Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/16/business/world-business-briefing-europe-basf-net-rises-82.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "2000-03-16", "snippet": "BASF AG says fourth-quarter profit rose 82 percent; net income rose to 696 million euros, or $674 million, from 382 million euros a year earlier; sales rose 27 percent (S)", "word_count": 109, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BASF NET RISES 82%", "print_headline": "WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: EUROPE; BASF NET RISES 82%", "body_text": " **********Europe's biggest chemical maker, BASF A.G. of Germany, said that its fourth-quarter profit rose 82 percent as it posted gains from the sales of businesses.

Instead, they said, it was time to deliver on a pledge to reward the Serbian people if they ousted Mr. Milosevic in an election. **********''We had a promise to the Serbian people'' said the French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, who chaired the meeting. ''Today we kept that promise. The E.U. has radically revised its policy toward Yugoslavia.'' **********The ministers agreed not only to lift some sanctions but also to free up about $300 million a year in aid during the next seven years. **********The ministers said that, as part of their possible assistance, they would study ways to reopen the Danube River quickly. It has been clogged with tons of debris left over from NATO's 78-day bombardment last year. **********The union also plans to invite Yugoslavia into a network of Balkan assistance programs, including a trade agreement that should allow duty-free access to European markets for most of Yugoslavia's exports. **********''We have to help the people of Serbia as soon as possible,'' said  Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer of Germany. ''We have waited long enough for democracy to prevail in Belgrade. We should not hesitate now, but intensify aid at all levels.'' **********The Union decided to lift immediately an oil blockade and flight ban imposed on Yugoslavia last year as Mr. Milosevic's troops were in Kosovo purging the province of its Albanians. To some degree, the move is symbolic -- the flight ban had already been suspended and the oil embargo had badly eroded. European officials said the paperwork should be completed in a few days and the removal of the remaining restrictions should help lower the price of oil in Yugoslavia. **********But the foreign ministers said that the restrictions on moving financial assets out of Yugoslavia and a ban on visas for Mr. Milosevic, his family and his close associates would remain in place a while longer to make sure that Milosevic-linked elite did not flee the country with looted wealth. **********American officials say Washington will take comparable steps in coming days, but United States officials have also said that they intend to make sure that Mr. Kostunica is ready to adhere to all elements of the Dayton peace accords, which ended the Bosnian war, before Yugoslavia is completely welcomed back into the international community. **********Mr. Vedrine is scheduled to fly to Belgrade on Tuesday to discuss  with President Vojislav Kostunicathe details of the aid offered. France, which currently holds the rotating European presidency, has already invited Mr. Kostunica to join European leaders at their next summit meeting, to be held in Biarritz. **********Mr. Milosevic, who was indicted by the United Nations tribunal for war crimes in Kosovo, has said he plans to stay in Yugoslavia and to try to rebuild his political party. Mr. Kostunica, who like many Serbs regards the tribunal as a political tool of the West, has said he will not send his adversary to The Hague for trial. **********But the ministers appeared unanimous in not wanting to press the issue today.

The system is in use at Hyland Hills Water World, a large water park near Denver. It consists of small transmitters that strap to users\u2019 wrists, an array of antennas, a computer that calculates locations and electronic maps that display the information. **********The wrist devices are rented for $2 to $3 per day, depending on the size of the group, officials at the water park said. A tracking device can be removed from someone\u2019s wrist (or from an ankle or a bathing suit) only by cutting the fiber band that was used to attach it. While a number of companies are working on other kinds of systems for tracking people, here is how the electronic locator system works at Hyland Hills. **********A TRANSMITTER ON THE WRIST **********At the heart of the system is a watch-size waterproof transmitter worn by each member of a family or group. Each transmitter emits a signal with a unique identifying code. **********Frank O\u2019Connell/The New York Times **********Sources: ParkWatch; WhereNet **********PUTTING YOURSELF ON THE MAP **********A ParkWatch user who wants to locate other family or group members goes to a kiosk that includes a scanner and an electronic map of the park. The scanner reads the bar code off the user\u2019s device, and then the locations of the other members of the party pop up on the screen. Park employees carry wireless portable units that can also be used to track group members. **********THE PROCEDURE **********Families are issued devices with linked I.D. numbers. Devices send pulses to antennas around the park. The computer uses triangulation to determine locations. At a kiosk, a group member scans in the bar code from a wrist device. The names and locations of all group members pop up on a map. **********Home | Site Index | Site Search | Forums | Archives | Marketplace **********Quick News | Page One Plus | International | National/N.Y. | Business | Technology | Science | Sports | Weather | Editorial | Op-Ed | Arts | Automobiles | Books | Diversions | Job Market | Real Estate | Travel **********Help/Feedback | Classifieds | Services | New York Today **********Copyright 2000 The New York Times Company"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/06/business/some-other-contenders-for-rich-emi-repertory.html": {"writer_name": "Suzanne Kapner", "pub_date": "2000-10-06", "snippet": "Decision by EMI Group and Time Warner to withdraw plan to merge their music businesses may open door to new partner for EMI; chart (M)", "word_count": 381, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Some Other Contenders For Rich EMI Repertory", "print_headline": "Some Other Contenders For Rich EMI Repertory", "body_text": " **********The decision by the EMI Group and Time Warner to withdraw a plan to merge their music businesses may open the door to a new partner for EMI. **********While Time Warner and EMI said today that they would continue to explore ways to combine their huge music units, any new deal would have to be approved by EMI shareholders. That creates an opportunity for several companies interested in acquiring music content, people close to the companies said yesterday. **********Pacific Century CyberWorks of Hong Kong, which had taken a strong interest in EMI before Time Warner proposed merging the company with its Warner Music Group, is back for another look, two people close to the company said. And BMG Entertainment, a unit of Bertelsmann, the closely held German media giant, is understood to be watching the situation with renewed interest. **********EMI, the world's third-largest music company, has a current market value of more than $6 billion. **********Executives from EMI of London, Pacific Century CyberWorks and BMG did not return calls seeking comment. **********Most of these would-be partners, however, come with their own baggage. As a telecommunications operator, Pacific Century would presumably be unable to wring as much in cost savings and efficiency from such a deal as would a company in the music or entertainment business. **********Moreover, Pacific Century lacks the cash to complete a merger of this size on its own, people close to the company said. **********That may apply with Bertelsmann, too. ''Everyone and their brother tried to structure a deal for Bertelsmann and it wasn't happening,'' a person close to the company said. ''They lack the equity currency and would have to raise a lot of cash.'' **********Some of that cash will come as Bertelsmann gives up its 50 percent stake in America Online Europe. But the company would still face antitrust issues similar to those that EMI and Time Warner confronted. **********In the end, EMI, home to such labels as Virgin, Capitol and EMI Classics, could well remain independent as antitrust uncertainties and questions related to piracy and downloadable music cloud the industry's future. **********The News Corporation, for instance, has in the past looked at EMI and Universal Music, part of Seagram, which is merging with Vivendi, but would now be reluctant to enter the music business given these mounting concerns, an executive said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/09/business/the-markets-market-place-all-tech-all-the-time-tells-only-one-side-of-the-story.html": {"writer_name": "Gretchen Morgenson", "pub_date": "2000-03-09", "snippet": "Gains in current stock market are being made in technology stocks alone with most shares in overall market currently trading at bear market levels; Salomon Smith Barney says while Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is down about 7 percent for the y...", "word_count": 1116, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MARKETS: Market Place; All Tech All the Time Tells Only One Side of the Story", "print_headline": "THE MARKETS: Market Place; All Tech All the Time Tells Only One Side of the Story", "body_text": " **********Is it still a bull market if it is running on only one leg? **********That is the question investors are asking today as they ponder a badly bifurcated stock market, where a handful of strong stocks are surrounded by a mass of the weak. **********While most bull markets are built on strong performance from a wide swath of industries, gains in the current market are being made in technology stocks alone. Procter & Gamble's profit warning on Tuesday only served to cement the view among investors that anything nontech is a nonstarter. **********Although it is not immediately evident from the behavior of the broad market indexes, most shares are currently trading at bear market levels. While the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is down about 7 percent for the year, more than three-quarters of the stocks in the index are down 20 percent or more from their recent highs, according to Salomon Smith Barney. **********Even more surprising is data compiled by James Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis. Mr. Paulsen found that if he excises the 66 technology and telecommunications stocks from the S.& P. index, the 434 companies that remain are currently trading at the same low levels seen during the Russian debt crisis of 1998. With technology and telecommunications back in the index, it is up approximately 40 percent since then. **********In addition, Mr. Paulsen removed technology stocks from the S.& P. index and found that the price-to-earnings ratio on the median stock in the index currently stood at around 12. That is the same depressed level reached on the entire index during the recession of 1990. With technology stocks included, the index's price-earnings ratio is 43. **********''The story here is not just how well tech is doing,'' Mr. Paulsen said. ''The story is equally that most everything else is doing so poorly. I think it would surprise people that outside of technology, the United States' blue chip stock market may break down below the lowest point of the Asian crisis.'' **********This lopsided action in stocks is both unusual and confusing. For example, stocks in many sectors -- banks, consumer durables and basic materials -- are trading at depressed levels that historically have foretold a recession. But the economy is so hot, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, is threatening to raise interest rates again later this month. **********Technology stocks, meanwhile, behave as though they are completely immune to the ill effects of rising interest rates, hardly a realistic assessment. **********Because the strength in technology shares masks the weakness in everything else, the divided stock market also poses problems for Mr. Greenspan. In recent speeches and testimony, the Fed chairman has singled out the wealth effect created by rising portfolio values as an engine driving the currently hot economy. And he has threatened to raise rates as far as he must to cool the economy and the stock market. But so far, his rate increases have only damaged stocks that were already down, not the highfliers he may have hoped to rein in. And that only pushes more investors into the already hot stocks, driving their prices ever higher. **********''Greenspan is mistaken about the wealth effect,'' said Stefan D. Abrams, chief investment officer for asset allocation at Trust Company of the West. ''He's missing the bifurcation. While 50 stocks are racing, the other 450 S.& P. stocks are losers. Every time he plays the Cassandra, he has the effect of accelerating the boom in the hot stocks.'' **********In recent weeks, investors have characterized this tale of two stock markets as a divide between the Old Economy stocks, which are hit hard by rising interest rates, and the new, super-charged technology stocks, which are not. But many economists say this view will be proved wrong. **********''The problem I see with the tech sector is it ultimately has cyclicality to it,'' said William Dudley, chief United States economist at Goldman, Sachs. ''People may be a little bit too optimistic thinking that tech is insulated from what happens elsewhere in the economy.'' **********Mr. Paulsen agrees. He says that the Fed will succeed in slowing the economy down and that this will bring the bull market in young technology companies to a screeching halt. ''A slower economy would raise the risks inherent in venture capital financing,'' he said. ''It would dry up equity capital flows and kill off these companies' method of financing their operations. I think that is likely over the course of this year.'' **********Today's all-tech all-the-time stock market looks a lot like the 1970's when commodity stocks were the only gainers. What began in the 1960's as an all-inclusive stock market was transformed in the 1970's by inflation. Only those companies, like steel makers and oil producers, that could pass along higher prices to customers, were hot. Everything else faded and ultimately, the entire market did as well. **********The current situation, while similar in its narrow focus, is driven by disinflation. While the early years of the current bull market rewarded the majority of companies, now only those companies, like technology concerns that are able to produce goods at ever-cheaper prices, are faring well. **********Now, however, Mr. Paulsen is worried that many companies have reached the zenith of productivity and will no longer be able to reduce prices. This would threaten their power status in the market. ''What I see now are a lot of companies saying we might be reaching the limit of being able to produce more with less,'' he said. ''Price competition is becoming too extreme in many parts of the economy, and more companies are reporting margin problems.'' **********Procter & Gamble is the most recent victim of this, but the market darlings Dell Computer, Wal-Mart Stores and Compaq Computer have also warned about margin pressures recently. **********Some strategists think the extreme stock market disparities of today will soon ease and that beaten-down stocks will recover. ''My own personal opinion is the disparity between these two areas has gotten awfully wide,'' Mr. Dudley said. A result: investors will find some stocks too cheap to pass up. Companies with depressed stock prices may also take themselves private. **********What about technology stocks? ''Whenever you have momentum investing it's hard to say when it's going to peter out,'' Mr. Dudley said. ''I don't see anything near term that will puncture that bubble.'' Longer term, however, he doubts that earnings among technology companies can continue to grow at 25 percent or more while the economy is growing at a much slower pace. **********Mr. Paulsen thinks that if the economy slows, the broader market will rebound. ''Technology would no longer be the big deal,'' he said. ''The inflation scares go away and interest-rate sensitive parts of the stock market will pick up. So will big consumer companies with good unit growth.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/27/technology/sorting-out-all-those-ports-on-the-back-of-the-computer.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-01-27", "snippet": "Q&A: Sorting Out All Those Ports on the Back of the Computer", "word_count": 801, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sorting Out All Those Ports on the Back of the Computer", "print_headline": "Sorting Out All Those Ports on the Back of the Computer", "body_text": " **********Q&A: Sorting Out All Those Ports on the Back of the Computer **********January 27, 2000 **********Sorting Out All Those Ports on the Back of the Computer **********Q. I see where the mouse and keyboard are plugged in, but can you explain what the different ports on the back of a computer are for? Are they different between PC's and Macintoshes? **********A. Yes, there are some differences, although the Universal Serial Bus, or U.S.B., is closing the gap between the two hardware types. **********The types of ports may vary from machine to machine, but here are some general types and purposes. **********The standard PC ports, which have been around for a while, are the parallel and serial ports. The parallel port is most commonly used to attach the computer to a printer, and it has a wide, 25-pin connector on the end of the cable. **********The serial port, which usually has a smaller, 9-pin connector (although serial ports can also have 25-pin connectors), can be used to plug in several different kinds of devices, like modems, mice and joysticks. To free the serial port for other uses, though, most computers have a PS/2 port, which has a round, 6-pin connector. Most computers made in the past few years also have at least two rectangular U.S.B. ports as well. **********U.S.B. is now the most common way to connect devices to iMacs and newer Macintosh models as well. Older Macs will have a SCSI port (pronounced \"scuzzy\" and sometimes used on PC's as well) on the back; it is a wide, 25-pin connector that serves as the parallel interface for Macs. For attaching the keyboard, older Macs also had a round, five-pin Apple Desktop Bus, or A.D.B., port, and personal printers and modems were usually connected through either of the Mac's round 9-pin serial ports. **********Q. What exactly does the term cellular mean in regard to phones? Are all portable phones cell phones? **********A. Cellular phones were named that because they use a series of cells, or transmission sites, that are spread out to cover each service area. Early cellular phones transmitted low-power analog radio signals on an 800-megahertz frequency. (Analog refers to the process of sending an audio signal in a continuous wave.) Analog cellular networks, which are much older than the digital networks that are currently gaining ground, also offer wider coverage. **********Although any type of mobile telephone is often referred to as a cell phone, some people differentiate between phones that use the old analog cellular networks and ones that don't. Phones that don't are often just referred to as wireless. Phones labeled as wireless usually use digital signals to send and receive calls. Digital phones also have their own type of networks, which were built after the old analog networks. Unlike analog phones, which send a continuous sound wave, digital phones work by sampling just parts of the sound wave and then transmitting pieces of data quickly in bursts. **********Digital networks may not cover as much territory as analog ones, but they boast (in theory) better sound and clearer, more secure signals that are harder to decode by people who may be listening in on phone calls. (You should note that no type of cellular or wireless phone call is completely secure from eavesdroppers.) **********Roaming -- making calls outside the normal coverage area offered by your service provider's calling plan -- is often easier on an analog network because of the wider coverage area. A dual-band mobile telephone can work with either system. **********Most large metropolitan areas are covered by digital networks already, and the networks are continuing to expand. If you have a question about coverage in your area, most wireless service providers offer network maps and coverage options right on their Web sites. **********Many PCS phones (Personal Communications Services) are based on digital technology and usually operate on a frequency of 1900 megahertz. Because of the faster speeds that a digital network can provide for transmitting data, digital phone networks are able to handle such mobile treats as wireless Internet services. Nextel is another type of digital wireless phone technology that can combine telephone functions with two-way radio capability. **********J. D.

Today's layoffs amount to a quarter of the factory's work force. **********While Firestone's parent, the Bridgestone Corporation of Japan, mentioned last month the possibility of closing the Decatur factory, John Lampe, Firestone's new chairman and chief executive, said today that the company had no plans to do so. But Mr. Lampe also raised the prospect today of further retrenchment if demand continued to erode, although he did not provide specifics. **********''We will continue to inform our people at the earliest possible time if further cutbacks are necessary,'' he said. **********Mr. Lampe said that although sales of Firestone-brand tires to automakers remained strong, sales of Firestone replacement tires to consumers had dropped. He declined to provide figures. Mr. Lampe said that the company was reducing its overall production by a fifth for the next two months, even though Firestone-brand tires only account for half the company's sales. **********Firestone also sells Bridgestone tires, which go mainly on Japanese-brand automobiles, and other brands. **********Firestone's inventory of unsold tires is 50 percent larger than usual now, partly because of the slower sales but also because the company stockpiled tires this summer in preparation for a possible strike by union workers that did not take place, Mr. Lampe said. In addition, the company has found itself with large numbers of tires in smaller sizes as more Americans choose vehicles that use larger tires. **********The three factories cutting back production -- the Decatur factory plus factories in La Vergne, Tenn., and in Oklahoma City -- make a high proportion of Firestone-brand tires and tires in smaller sizes and had particularly large inventories accumulated before a labor agreement was reached on Sept. 4, Mr. Lampe said. All three factories will be closed for the second half of December, and the Oklahoma City and La Vergne factories will also be closed from Oct. 29 to Nov. 11. **********Laid-off workers and workers furloughed for two to four weeks will be entitled to unemployment benefits. Unionized workers with at least two years of seniority will receive additional payments from the company for up to 6 to 12 months, raising their overall benefits to 80 percent of previous income. **********Ford and Firestone dealers have been besieged by angry Ford Explorer owners, many of whom have been unable to find replacements for their tires since the recall was announced on Aug. 9. But Mr. Lampe said that Firestone and other tire makers had replaced 4.2 million of the 6.5 million recalled tires, and he predicted that all of the tires would be replaced by the end of next month. Firestone's production of replacement tires will not be affected by today's announcement, because most of the production is taking place at other factories, Mr. Lampe said. **********Stephen Garman, the city manager in Decatur, said that many of the laid-off workers should be able to find other jobs, although some might not have skills that closely match the available openings. The local economy is at full employment and the city has just hired an advertising firm to try to attract people from other cities to fill vacancies in a wide range of occupations, he said. **********''Our economy is in a position to absorb a great number of these employees,'' Mr. Garman said. ''If you're going to have this kind of problem, now is the time to have it.'' **********The layoffs and reductions in production came as regulators continued to be flooded with complaints about the recalled 15-inch Firestone ATX and Wilderness tires mounted mainly on Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said today that it had received more than 3,500 complaints linking the tires to 119 deaths and more than 500 injuries. **********The previous time the agency provided figures on complaints, on Sept. 19, there were 2,200 complaints involving 103 deaths and more than 400 injuries. But the agency subsequently said that two of those deaths were a German shepherd dog and a black Persian cat, not people. **********The agency, which is part of the Department of Transportation, accepts complaints from the public, lawyers and law enforcement officials but does little to check their veracity. Instead, regulators are focusing now on an engineering analysis of the tires to learn why they are failing, an agency official said. **********The traffic safety agency recently opened a separate investigation into Firestone Steeltex tires after receiving 169 complaints about them, involving two deaths. The Steeltex tires are mounted on the largest sport utility vehicles and pickups, notably the Chevrolet and GMC Suburban. **********An expert retained by Firestone to seek the cause of the problem, Sanjay Govindjee, said in a letter released by the company on Monday night that he was focusing on the materials that Firestone had used. The steel-belted tires slowly develop cracks inside between the rubber and the steel belts, and eventually fail as a result, he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/22/business/technology-briefing-deals-time-warner-to-buy-gst-for-690-million.html": {"writer_name": "Simon Romero", "pub_date": "2000-09-22", "snippet": "Time Warner Telecom receives bankruptcy court approval to buy rival, GST Telecommunications, for $690 million (S)", "word_count": 95, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TIME WARNER TO BUY GST FOR $690 MILLION", "print_headline": "TECHNOLOGY BRIEFING: DEALS; TIME WARNER TO BUY GST FOR $690 MILLION", "body_text": " **********Time Warner Telecom said yesterday that it had received bankruptcy court approval to buy a rival, GST Telecommunications, for $690 million.

It also plans to create separate units for its businesses, catching up with the likes of Deutsche Telekom AG. **********Like other former monopolies, Swisscom wants to raise money as Switzerland prepares to auction new wireless licenses that allow audio, video and Internet access on mobile phones. In Germany, six companies paid a combined $46 billion for similar licenses. In the first quarter, Swisscom's profit from operations fell 28 percent, hurt by increased competition in fixed lines. **********\"Swisscom didn't make any progress with fixed lines, and the company simply doesn't have the critical mass,\" said Sven Bucher, an analyst at Zuercher Kantonalbank. **********Shares of Swisscom, which have lost about a fifth of their value this year, rose as much as 2 percent to 529 Swiss francs while the benchmark Swiss Market Index was little changed. **********Divestments **********Swisscom also plans to sell shares in UTA Telekom AG, an Austrian company in which it owns 50 percent, is selling its stake in Estel, based in France's Alsace region, and is looking for a partner for Swisscom SpA, its Italian subsidiary, based in Milan. It didn't say how much money it will raise from the sales. **********The company said in April it may sell shares in its domestic mobile-phone unit to fund expansion, and is preparing to sell shares in its Internet unit in the second half. The mobile unit had sales of 2.3 billion Swiss francs ($1.3 billion) last year. **********In what could be the first step to such a sale, Swisscom today said it created a separate company for its mobile business, which will be called Mobile Com AG. **********\"The reorganization sets the stage\" for future expansion, said Swisscom Chairman Markus Rauh. **********British Telecommunications Plc, the largest phone company in the U.K., earlier this year rearranged its business into four divisions so it could sell shares in them, raising money for expansion. France Telecom SA will sell shares in Orange, its mobile phone unit, later this year. Telefonica SA, Spain's top phone company, is expected to sell shares in Telefonica Moviles SA, its mobile unit and most profitable business, in November. **********Buy, Buy, Buy **********Money from the share sales will help companies mop up some of the 75 permits being offered by Europe. The licenses are expected to cost about $100 billion in total. Switzerland expects to generate about 6 billion francs from selling such licenses. **********Swisscom has already been crippled by the high cost and the lack of funds. Debitel AG, the mobile-phone company it controls, dropped out of the German auction, highlighting its lack of financial muscle. **********Swisscom Chief Executive Jens Alder said Debitel could proceed with a capital increase in the future. He added that all of the six winners of a German license are interested in Debitel. \"We will take an active role in third-generation services in all countries where we are present, either to get a license or as a partner,\" he said. **********Swisscom, which sold shares to the public in 1998, is still government controlled. It's counting on its wireless business to drive future growth as prices continue to fall in fixed services. **********Swisscom's valuation shows investors' concerns. It trades at 22 times expected 2001 earnings, compared with Deutsche Telekom's 42 times and France Telecom SA's 43 times. Its valuation is about the same as Tele Danmark A/S, Denmark's top telecommunications firm, which this week announced plans to split into five units. **********Swisscom controlled about 75 percent of the domestic mobile- phone market last year and has about 2.5 million mobile-phone customers. Its lead is under pressure as companies such as BT expand in one of Europe's richest countries. The average Swiss salary amounts to about $40,000, according to the World Bank. **********Swisscom's revamp also includes cost cuts. The company said in March it will slash an additional 3,000 jobs at home over two years, citing fierce competition and falling prices. Prices for regular calls fell about 70 percent in the past years, and Switzerland's phone market is worth about 12 billion francs. **********Asian Debacle **********The sale of the fixed-line units in Europe comes a year after the Swiss company gave up stakes in Malaysia and India after spending billions of Swiss francs on expansion there. **********Swisscom shares were sold at 340 Swiss francs each in October 1998 and yesterday closed at 518 francs in Zurich. The company has a market value of about 38 billion francs (34 billion euros), about a quarter of Deutsche Telekom's value. France Telecom SA was worth 146 billion euros at yesterday's close. **********Swisscom also said Dominik Koechlin, the head of its international unit, will leave at the end of the year.

The deputy director of the Civil Aviation Agency, Chang Kuo-chen, said both runways were lighted, but in highly distinctive ways that should have been immediately recognizable. The intended runway had bright white lights and an initial area of intense illumination, he said, the standard lighting for runways in active use. **********The clear section of the right runway, he said, was lighted with only green lights, an international signal that it can be used for taxiing but not for takeoffs.

He focused instead on economic and security issues whose resolution both countries say could bring them closer together. **********In a statement on his arrival on  Thursday, Mr. Zhu said that cooperation between China and Japan was vital for the ''peace, stability and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region,'' adding that he sought to ''promote mutual understanding and trust'' between them. **********There had been a nervous drumroll of speculation here for weeks about how Mr. Zhu would handle the  subject of Japan's brutal colonial occupation. Many officials openly expressed hope that after the last bitter experience -- President Jiang Zemin's visit two years ago is still vividly recalled here -- the perennial sore point would not come up. **********Since Mr. Jiang's visit, a senior Japanese diplomat said, there had been a growing perception in Tokyo that China was using the war issue as a diplomatic weapon to cow Japan. ''They want us to do something to put this matter definitively behind us,'' the diplomat said. ''But we cannot put the issue to rest as long as it is being wielded against us.'' **********In the end, though, if Mr. Zhu let his hosts down by discussing the past, he did it so delicately as to all but remove the sting. **********In a long meeting with Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori, Mr. Zhu told him  that China did not hold the Japanese people responsible for the war. ''Japanese people were also victims of Japanese militarism,'' he said. **********Later, at a town hall type meeting with about 100 carefully chosen Japanese citizens, a relaxed and confident looking Mr. Zhu said China still felt that Japan had never properly apologized for its war atrocities. But instead of scolding the audience, he said it was ''Japan's problem'' to decide how -- or indeed whether -- to atone for its past. ''But I hope you will consider it,'' he said. **********The Chinese prime minister further disarmed his audience by saying that he had already faced questions at home for not raising the wartime issue with his hosts, or for not being sufficiently forthright about it. ''Am I weak?'' he asked. **********After the meeting, many Japanese participants said they had been  deeply impressed. **********''I imagined that he was really stern before I met him,'' said Kyosuke Kutrita, 27, an economics major at Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo. ''But talking with him, that image has gone away. He is so friendly and flexible, and he answered questions directly.'' **********If it is true that China feels genuine pain over Japan's wartime brutality, it is also true that the question has  become a major feature of the diplomatic code language used during friction between two countries. **********One sure motive for China's friendlier face during the visit is the country's continuing need for economic aid and investment from Japan. Tokyo has provided about $24 billion in aid to China over the last two decades, according to the Japanese Government. Japan, however, has grown increasingly uneasy over the rising power of China's armed forces, which consume a large and growing part of the state budget as China continues to seek aid from richer countries. **********Japan's anxiety about China's military ambitions has only been heightened in recent months by repeated incursions by Chinese surveillance ships into Japanese waters, and by the reluctance of China to engage in negotiations to delineate the territorial waters between the two countries clearly. **********''If China becomes a major military power, the meaning of Japan's development assistance to China will surely come into question,'' the Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest daily newspaper, said in an editorial about Mr. Zhu's visit. **********Japanese legislators, meanwhile, have cited the incursions and the specter of an increasingly menacing neighbor while threatening to block a pending $158 million aid package. **********Mr. Zhu sought to calm those concerns on his visit, saying that his country's ships had no hostile intent and agreeing to set up a ''hot line'' between the two governments and a system of prior notification of ship movements into sensitive areas. **********Japanese diplomats say China's military assertiveness is not the only threat to economic aid. China has been unusually stingy, they say, in publicizing the details of Japan's aid to the Chinese people, raising suspicions that public opinion was being manipulated to sustain long-held Chinese suspicions toward Japan. On that score, too, Mr. Zhu promised to do better."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/09/business/the-markets-commodities.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-11-09", "snippet": "Natural gas rises on expectations that wintry weather will move into Midwest, bolstering demand; in New York, natural gas for December delivery rises 25.7 cents, to $5.338 per million BTU's; graph; chart (S)", "word_count": 34, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MARKETS: COMMODITIES", "print_headline": "THE MARKETS: COMMODITIES", "body_text": " **********NATURAL GAS CLIMBS.

Wood of the National Partnership for Reinventing Government, a White House project to improve efficiency in government. ''Citizens can't find what they don't know to look for.'' **********In all, the government has about 20,000 Web sites with 100 million pages, but many are arranged in hierarchies that mirror the bureaucratic structures of agencies, rather than by functions that citizens and businesses are most interested in. **********Information and activities are often duplicated on different sites, which probably should be expected from a government that has 12 agencies overseeing food safety under 35 different laws. **********So the explosion of dot-gov activities, which used to be little more than a way of publishing government documents but has become a way of doing business with the government, seems to be creating business models -- and opportunities. **********There are at least three models for providing government services via the Web. **********One simply turns paperwork into interactive Web pages, letting users go online to obtain and fill out forms. **********A second model is creating opportunities for consultants, software designers and other private companies that consult and often join as partners with government entities to offer online services. **********The third model, not yet common but seen by many as the ideal, would let users choose the most convenient way to gain access to government Web sites. For example, a person could go to a preferred portal -- Yahoo, for instance -- and find both government and other information. **********No matter which model prevails, it already seems clear that the public is demanding more and more government services online. At least two out of three adults with online access have conducted an electronic transaction with the government at least once, according to a recent study commissioned by the National Information Consortium, which provides government agencies with services like managing online portals and software applications. Almost one in five adults who use the Internet have conducted an online transaction with the government in the last 30 days. **********''Citizens and businesses are more satisfied with their e-government experience than with traditional government service delivery,'' according to the consortium's report, which was conducted by the Momentum Research Group of Cunningham Communication in Austin, Tex. **********Some of the ways people work with the government online are obvious, others less so. **********This year, about 33 million taxpayers filed their 1999 returns online. The office of student financial aid at the Department of Education processed more than 670,000 applications online during the 1998-99 application cycle. And about 34,000 people filled out census forms online. **********Other examples are less well known. **********Nine federal district and bankruptcy courts allow people to initiate cases or file pleadings electronically. And the Geological Survey recently became the first federal agency to fully automate its hiring process. **********On the Small Business Administration's ''business adviser'' Web page, companies and employees can obtain a Bureau of Export Administration application for licenses to export certain computers, register trademarks with the Patent and Trademark Office, apply for citizenship with the Immigration and Naturalization Service, apply for financing from the Export-Import Bank, apply for a pilot's license from the Federal Aviation Administration or register with Selective Service. **********Even people without access to the Internet at their homes and offices are able to find government services online, often using kiosks set up in places like shopping malls. **********A terminal at a Safeway store in northeast Washington -- one of thousands of kiosks planned for communities, both rural and urban, where Internet access has been slow in coming -- provides more than 150 federal, state and local government services in a touch-screen format. An organization called the Urban Cool Network plans to put up more than 3,200 kiosks in shopping malls in urban areas where there are few home computers. GS Planet, another private organization, plans to put them in train and bus stations. **********Government agencies are also setting up kiosks. An Immigration and Naturalization Service kiosk at a supermarket in East Dallas logged more than 22,000 uses in its first month, according to the National Partnership for Reinventing Government. **********But there are concerns. At least two-thirds of Internet users doubt that the government will keep records confidential. ''Trust is the most critical issue facing the adoption of e-government,'' the report for the information consortium said. **********Researchers at Brown University who surveyed more than 1,800 government Web sites, most of them operated by the states, found that only 5 percent of them display information about their security policy, and only 7 percent have a statement of privacy policy. **********Even so, a survey by Dell Computer found that 90 percent of the public would like to obtain their driver's licenses and license plates online, and 70 percent would like to pay traffic tickets that way. **********In Virginia, the Department of Motor Vehicles is moving in that direction. Six hundred pages on its Web site allow people to do almost anything they used to complain about standing in line to do. **********THAT is a classic example of the first model of online government: simply replacing a line at the motor vehicles agency with an online experience. But what about a more complex interaction, like dealing with the Environmental Protection Agency? There are ways to file reports online, but it is never going to be as simple as renewing a driver's license. **********This is where the private companies have stepped in. EHSmanager.com, a new company based in Overland Park, Kan., is a model of that approach. The company calls itself the first online, one-stop shop for environmental, health and safety information and management services. **********In some cases, states have joined with private companies to provide online services. The National Information Consortium, for example, typically sets up local subsidiaries to contract with a state, develop an Internet portal and make information, applications and other transactions available. In return, the company takes a share of the fees charged for certain transactions. **********In another case, FirstGov, a federal government Web portal, is being financed through a foundation created by Eric Brewer, one of the founders of the search engine company Inktomi. It is supposed to allow users to search every federal Web page. **********But FirstGov also plans to allow other Web pages to use and display its content, as long as they post a certification on their sites and adhere to a set of conditions, like publishing the data ''as is,'' eschewing advertising on the pages that contain federal information and protecting users' privacy. **********That is a sign that the third model of e-government is taking hold: letting Web users go to their favorite portal, whether Yahoo, their college Web page, America Online or their stockbroker's page, and keeping government and personal information together in one place. **********''Here's where the lines between government and the private sector begin to blur,'' according to a report by Tom Unruh, an  analyst at the National Governors Association. ''From the citizen's point of view, it's not important to go to the state Web site to handle their business with the government.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/12/business/soros-concedes-goof-in-book-global-economy-didn-t-collapse.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-08-12", "snippet": "George Soros takes back grave global economic forecasts he made in 1998 book; photo (M)", "word_count": 1095, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Soros Concedes Goof in Book.

Global Economy Didn't Collapse.", "body_text": " **********George Soros, one of the world's most successful speculators and richest men, has come as close as anyone to personifying the spread of global capitalism and the power of international financial markets. So, in 1998, when he wrote a book predicting the imminent ''disintegration of the global capitalist system,'' his views caused quite a stir. **********Two years later, the global economy is still kicking, and, in a new book, Mr. Soros, who turns 70 years old today, is taking back his grave forecasts. **********''Basically, I got carried away in thinking that the system might actually collapse,'' he said, in an interview. ''I goofed.'' **********His reversal is a highly unusual public about-face. Most incorrect prognosticators simply let their mistakes drift quietly through remainder piles and into the dustbin of history. But his turnabout is also a barometer of how fast the world has changed. In an unlikely coda to his career, Mr. Soros was one of the few prominent voices since the cold war to question the longevity of global capitalism. **********The shift by Mr. Soros also reflects the dangerously fickle nature of contemporary international financial markets, one of his favorite themes. In the fall of 1998, he was far from alone in worrying that the global economy might plunge into a depression. But just a few months after his book went to press that possibility seemed remote. **********In his new book, ''Open Society: From Global Capitalism to Global Democracy'' (PublicAffairs Press), Mr. Soros explains that he was wrong to worry that international capitalism might soon destroy itself. But he stands by his admonition that unchecked capitalism threatens freedom and democracy around the world. And he is sticking with the delicate philosophical distinction that enables him in good conscience to continue exploiting the same financial markets he vilifies. **********Mr. Soros intended his previous book as the summation of his lifetime of experience as a World War II refugee, global investor and philanthropist. But in August 1998, his work on the book was interrupted by a looming financial crisis in Russia, where he was active as both investor and philanthropist. After Russia defaulted on its debts, sending convulsions through financial markets from London to Sao Paulo, the growing crisis convinced Mr. Soros that his conclusions were too timely to hold back. **********He decided to rush the book to press. His intended publisher, Random House, declined to accelerate the timetable, so he decamped to PublicAffairs Press, whose founder,  Peter Osnos, was happy to oblige. Entitled ''The Crisis of Global Capitalism: Open Society Endangered,'' it was published in November, weeks after the manuscript was completed. **********Mr. Soros might have saved himself some embarrassment if he had waited for Random House, giving the markets time to recover. ''I have some egg on my face,'' Mr. Soros admits in a preface to his new book. He decided to write another volume after he set out this year to revise the first for a paperback, and realized his thinking had changed drastically. **********Mr. Soros writes that his dire predictions rested on two errors. First, he underestimated the ability of key officials in New York and Washington to intervene at the last second when trouble in far-off markets threatened prosperity and stability at home. When investors' skittishness threatened a global credit crisis, the United States financial regulators quickly lowered interest rates and orchestrated a pivotal bail-out of the mammoth Long-Term Capital Management fund in time to head off a panic. ''We almost had a collapse,'' Mr. Soros said, ''but life is lived on the edge of chaos.'' **********Mr. Soros writes that his second error was underestimating the impact of new technology. ''There was an Internet boom concurrent to the bust in emerging markets,'' Mr. Soros writes in his new preface. ''How could I ignore that?'' The advent of new technologies bolstered productivity growth in the United States, helping to withstand a slowdown abroad, he said. **********The Soros fund management company stumbled in technology, too. Soros Fund Management first bet against the boom in high-tech stocks and then was surprised again by their collapse this spring. The funds suffered losses of about 20 percent. Mr. Soros announced that he was shifting his funds' focus toward safer, less lucrative investments to support his philanthropy. **********Mr. Soros left the day-to-day management of his fund company in 1989 to focus on his philanthropy. ''What has happened there has happened to someone else and not to me,'' he said. ''The fact that I had a bearish bias in 1998 maybe prevented us from participating in the upside, but, really, it is unrelated.'' **********Mr. Soros notes that his funds still delivered investors a return of more than 30 percent a year since 1969, including the recent losses. ''I make mistakes, but when you add it all up, I come out ahead,'' he said. **********Mr. Soros said that an enthusiasm for exposing errors in his own thinking had been the key to his success as a financier, as he explains in both books. It is not as easy to recant in public, he said, but he sees the new book as ''my life's work, in a way.'' **********Mr. Soros said his motivation was to leave his mark on posterity. This book, he said, ''means more to me than the billions that I have made.'' **********The heart of both books is the idea of an open society, a term popularized by the philosopher Karl Popper, who was the undergraduate tutor of Mr. Soros. He has been refining his ideas about it ever since. **********Mr. Soros argues for shunning absolute truths, including what he calls ''market fundamentalism'' -- an absolute belief in the values of the free marketplace. He recommends strong multilateral regulation of international finance to protect other social values, like equality and economic development. **********The public criticism of his work has been trying at times, he said, especially the skeptical reception of the distinction he draws between ''making the rules'' and ''playing by the rules.'' He argues in both books that policy makers should worry about morality and the social good, but not fund managers, because markets are inherently amoral. ''That is why you can't leave everything to markets,'' he said. It is also why his fund management company continues trying to seize opportunities to profit off other market participants whenever it can -- after all, somebody else would. **********His distinction between making the rules and playing by them ''is not flying,'' he acknowledged. **********''There are people who regard markets as immoral, who say, 'He made a fortune in the stock market, he has a bad conscience, so he is trying to excuse himself.' But if we could get that idea across, it would actually make a better world.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/24/business/technology-briefing-people-incyte-president-leaves-to-head-start-up.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "2000-08-24", "snippet": "Technology Briefing: Incyte President Leaves To Head Start-F", "word_count": 125, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INCYTE PRESIDENT LEAVES TO HEAD START-UP", "print_headline": "TECHNOLOGY BRIEFING: PEOPLE; INCYTE PRESIDENT LEAVES TO HEAD START-UP", "body_text": " **********Incyte Genomics said that Randy Scott, its president and chief scientific officer, will leave day-to-day operations to start an e-health company that is expected to be affiliated with Incyte.

Galotti, to what is known at Talk as ''Tina's hot list'' -- a few hundred people who, apart from those in the news media, include demicelebrities and so-called A-list people who can usually be depended upon to talk about the magazine on the party circuit. **********Mr. Galotti's letter last week asserted that ''a magazine of Talk's caliber can only come together through valuable partnerships'' and pointed out how, for example, Talk has ''embraced its multimedia partnership with Miramax Films.'' **********And as of August, Mr. Galotti's letter went on, Talk magazine will have a yet another corporate ''association.'' This one is not with a company that is an owner of the magazine, nor is it even with a media company; it is with Bacara, a resort hotel in California that is not yet open. Mr. Galotti's letter was accompanied by a pamphlet promoting the creature comforts of the resort. (''In-room spa services. Bathrobes and slippers. Luxurious bathroom amenities.'') **********It is not unusual for magazine publishers to alert select readers that a new advertiser has bought pages in the magazine. But it is rare for the publisher to compare the new advertiser to one of its owners in terms of importance. In this instance, a hotel does not offer the synergistic opportunities for film-making, screenwriting or developing young talent that Miramax, a unit of Walt Disney,  does. **********Staff members at Talk say that Bacara, as an incentive to advertise, was offered the sweetener that the publisher would promote the hotel to a select group of Hollywood heavyweights.

Va., effectively sets out the opening position of each side on the central issues under discussion, including borders and security arrangements. **********The text was leaked to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, which published it today, along with photographs of the document. **********Under an introductory disclaimer that it is meant to serve as ''a tool in discussions'' and ''does not necessarily reflect the views of any party,'' the draft treaty includes two passages that could be interpreted as an attempt by Israel to retain its settlements in the Golan Heights after a military withdrawal. **********The document also notes the Syrian position that Israel must withdraw both its soldiers and civilians from the entire strategic plateau, which was captured from Syria in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. **********Though Israelis familiar with the Israeli-Syrian issue saw no change in the widely held perception that Israel will have to cede at least most of the Golan Heights -- and withdraw its settlers -- as the price of a peace agreement, the leaked document seemed to serve efforts to convince the Israeli public that its government was not selling out. On Monday, about 100,000 Israelis demonstrated against giving up the Golan Heights as Prime Minister Ehud Barak returned from Shepherdstown. **********The negotiations are scheduled to resume next week in Washington, and President Clinton discussed the next round of talks today in a long phone conversation with President Hafez al-Assad of Syria. **********What attracted attention in Israel were two references in the draft document. One referred to the withdrawal of Israeli armed forces ''and civilians'' from the Golan Heights as solely a Syrian position. The other cited an Israeli position that there would be ''arrangements concerning the Israelis and Israeli communities in areas from which Israeli forces will be relocated'' -- a reference to the 17,000 Golan settlers. **********These items created the impression that Mr. Barak was bargaining to keep the settlers in place, even though the notion that Israeli settlers would remain under Syrian sovereignty has been rejected by both the Syrians and the settlers themselves. **********''I think this is a clever maneuver by the prime minister,'' said Ariel Sharon, the leader of the opposition Likud Party. ''The prime minister knows that it will be impossible to live under Syrian rule. He's perhaps trying to soften up the hard core that is struggling today against a withdrawal from the Golan Heights. I know that the prime minister frequently studies the writings of Machiavelli. This is a perfect example.'' **********Education Minister Yossi Sarid, of the leftist Meretz Party, affirmed that keeping the settlers in the Golan Heights ''is an Israeli position.'' But he added, ''I would be very happy if this position were accepted by the Syrians, but the chances of a positive response are slight to nonexistent.'' **********Uri Savir, a lawmaker who served on the Israeli delegation during talks with Syria that collapsed nearly four years ago, said that leaks like the disclosure of the American draft might serve domestic political aims  but would not help the negotiations. **********''Usually every leak has its purpose,'' Mr. Savir said. ''From the point of view of the negotiations, I don't think such publications are helpful. The minute the three sides keep a secret, it's a test of the seriousness of their intentions.'' **********In Washington, James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said the publication of the document was ''damaging.'' **********''It harms the cause of peace,'' he said. ''It makes it harder for the kind of confidentiality that's necessary to make decisions.'' **********A Syrian account of the American draft was published on Sunday by the influential London-based newspaper Al-Hayat, this one emphasizing Syria's demand for the removal of Israeli settlements and its insistence on a full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan to lines held before the 1967 war. **********Key members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, who ended a two-day visit to Israel today, said that the United States could provide substantial money and peacekeeping troops to bolster an Israeli-Syrian treaty, but that the burden had to be shared by other nations. **********''I'm certain we can meet whatever objectives the administration and Congress agree to,'' said Senator Ted Stevens, an Alaska Republican and the committee chairman. ''We don't know what those will be yet, but we assume they'll be substantial.'' **********The five committee members toured the Golan Heights and Israel's border with Lebanon on Wednesday, meeting later with Mr. Barak. **********The prime minister has promised the Israeli public that Israel will receive sophisticated defense and early warning systems to offset the risks of a withdrawal from the Golan. However, Mr. Stevens said that no financial sums were discussed in the meeting with the prime minister. **********''We heard no numbers, and we didn't expect to hear any numbers,'' he said.

Some leaders, they suggest, have mounted the dung heaps of corruption scandals and neo-Nazi incidents in their own countries and suddenly shouted that they have the moral high ground. **********To be sure, there are others who feel just the opposite. **********''I, as an Austrian, I enjoy this,'' said Georg Hofmann-Ostenhof, a columnist for Profil magazine.  ''Why shouldn't the E.U. say we don't want an extremist in your government? It's not good manners to have racists in government. We don't do that.'' **********Interviews in the Alps, where Mr. Haider comes from, and in the streets of liberal Vienna, where hostility to him is strongest, produce a range of musings -- not just about the diplomatic crisis, but also about Mr. Haider's unpredictable personality and Austria's complex self-image as the one-time seat of a vast empire later reduced to a Nazi state and now to an Alpine chalet on Western Europe's frontier. **********Mr. Haider often says what some other Austrians feel but dare not say. Sometimes, it is complaints normal to a democracy: The government is full of tired old men who divide the spoils. The economy would be stronger if they dared privatize. Civil servants are lazy and rude. **********In Carinthia, as a lawyer who inherited wealth, Mr. Haider is seen as above corruption, pro-business and a leader who made the civil servants smile on time. **********Sometimes, what he says is unpleasant but true: Immigrants are responsible for a disproportionate amount of the small crime rate. Some cheat on the generous welfare system. **********Sometimes it is wacky: immigrants use state-paid fertility treatment to out-breed Austrians. **********And sometimes, it is over the line: The Waffen SS deserves the same respect as any military unit. **********Mr. Haider's style has been called ''defamation followed by halfhearted excuse,'' and he used it again last week, calling the Belgian government corrupt protectors of pedophiles and implying that France's president, Jacques Chirac, was a doddering failure. Senior politicians say such language cannot be used in international relations. **********Alexander van der Bellen, leader of the Green Party, called him a ''persistent offender.'' **********Some Haider backers enjoy his forthrightness; some worry. **********''He's a good man, but when he opens his mouth, it's a catastrophe,'' said Willy Klima, 53, a Vienna cabbie. **********Manfred Spahn, 32, a casino floor manager, said: ''I admit I did think of voting for Haider as a protest, because he exposed corruption. But I have an aunt who died recently at 93. She lived through two world wars, and she compared Haider to Hitler and said it might be possible to happen again, so she decided to vote for the reds, even though she'd voted black all her life. I listened to what she said.'' **********In Austrian politics, the Social Democrats are known as the reds; black is the color of the conservative People's Party, which has signed an agreement on a coalition government with Mr. Haidar's party. **********Michael Chik, 19, who was to join an evening anti-Haider demonstration, is part of the tiny Chinese minority, born here of parents who immigrated to open a restaurant.  ''I know some people in the Freedom Party, and they are quite racist,'' he said. ''And it's the members who make the party.'' **********He said he had been teased as a child. ''They did this,'' he said, pushing his eyes up into slits. ''But it's the Turkish people who get beaten up and face discrimination.'' **********Others who are, by Austrian law, ''foreigners,'' say they do not feel threatened. **********''I'm not a supporter, not at all, but Haider's not against anyone like me who's been here 30 years and does his work properly,'' said Milan Lakobria, 50, an electrician originally from Yugoslavia. ''He's against those who don't work.'' **********Mr. Lakobria is still not a citizen, nor are most of his children born here. But they could be if they wanted, he said, ''and anyway, it's better here than in my country.'' **********Anna Krailler, 75, a retired cashier walking her small white dog through a middle-income Vienna shopping center, made no secret of her feelings. ''Yes, I am for Haider,'' she said. ''It's time that all those foreigners who steal cars were out.'' **********''Over there,'' she said, pointing to a residential district, ''there are blocks with only one or two Austrians. You get no peace, there are so many children running around. In summer, the foreigners take over the parks. And it's not only them.  My generation helped rebuild Austria, and I don't get enough pension to live on. I think things will be better under Haider.'' **********Asked about the diplomatic isolation, she said: ''Well, the German criticism wasn't so bad. The worst was the Jews. They're afraid. I don't know why -- no Austrian would ever harm a Jew.  And their ambassador should just go home. How are we supposed to react? Suddenly everyone's against us, but no one has the right to condemn Austria.'' **********But Elisabeth Sickl, a minor official of Mr. Haider's party in Carinthia who is likely to be the social minister in the new government, denied that xenophobia and racism are characteristic of Haider supporters. ''Humanism is my aim,'' she said. ''I feel treated very unjustly. We are no Nazis.'' **********A theme coming up repeatedly was fear of the ''jetzt erst recht'' backlash. The phrase is literally ''now first right,'' but is translated as ''now more than ever,'' meaning that if you push an Austrian, he will get his back up and do exactly what you wanted him not to do. **********''We're afraid of new elections, because Haider will get more votes,'' said Susanne Fromwald, 31, a social worker who spent the night sleeping on a sidewalk in an all-night demonstration against the proposed government. ''People here who don't like people from other countries telling us who to vote for will vote for Haider.'' She said she preferred European ''concern'' to isolation, but her companions liked the stronger course. **********But Simon Wiesenthal, the Nazi-hunter based in Vienna, opposes isolation, fearing that the tiny country's lifeline -- tourism and trade -- will shut down. He prefers new elections, even knowing that they could strengthen Mr. Haider. **********''Nobody can say he's a Nazi,'' Mr. Wiesenthal said, ''but when Jews call me and say, 'We're not against Haider because he never said something against the Jews,' I ask: 'Is that the best you can say about him?' '' **********But many Austrians, regardless of their political sympathies, said the European Union had gone too far by condemning Austria before Mr. Haider spent a day in office. **********''If Haider is a problem -- O.K., I can cry,'' said Mr. Klima, the ebullient taxi driver.

An editor for the magazine said the document was not included in its report through ''an oversight.'' **********In addition, The Associated Press released full-length quotations from two former servicemen who said in the pages of U.S. News that The Associated Press had misquoted them. In both cases, the full quotations tended to refute that claim. **********The dueling documents and interviews are part of a controversy that is being closely watched by journalists, military observers and diplomats, because the outcome of the debate over the report could affect United States-South Korean relations. If a Pentagon-authorized commission that is investigating the case determines that the soldiers had been given orders to fire, that could mean that a war crime had been committed. **********Defense Department officials told The New York Times last week that they had confirmed the central element of the report, that United States troops had fired on unarmed civilians, killing hundreds. But on the crucial question of whether the troops were acting under orders, the evidence provided in the dueling journalistic accounts is both ambiguous and contradictory. **********Under the headline ''Doubts about a Korean 'Massacre,' '' a U.S. News reporter, Joseph L. Galloway, wrote, ''There is little doubt that something terrible happened there.'' But the article offered evidence from military documents that indicated that three witnesses quoted by The Associated Press -- Edward Daily, Delos Flint and Eugene Hesselman -- were not at the scene at No Gun Ri at the time. **********The Associated Press rebuttal reported that the magazine, in its suggestion about Mr. Flint, relied on a ''war diary'' written days later at the regimental level and ignored a ''morning report'' filed daily from the front. The morning report, indicating the location and status of G.I.'s, indicates that Mr. Flint was wounded on July 26th, the day of the reported shooting, and could have been there to witness it. **********The executive editor of the magazine, Brian Duffy, said last night, ''We should have cited the morning report that said he was wounded on the 26th, and on our part it was an oversight.'' **********Another veteran who served in one of the units said to be involved in the killings gave conflicting accounts to the reporters for The Associated Press and Mr. Galloway, The A.P. released the full text of his remarks to them yesterday. **********The text indicates that when the veteran, Herman Patterson, said, ''It was just wholesale slaughter,'' he was speaking of the events at No Gun Ri, not another battle. Mr. Patterson told U.S. News that those remarks were taken out of context. **********A second witness who is being challenged, Edward Daily, told The Associated Press and other news organizations, including NBC News, The Washington Post, The New York Times and U.S. News, that he was a machine gunner at No Gun Ri and that he fired, under orders, into the refugees huddled under the stone bridge there. **********But Mr. Daily's service records, obtained by U.S. News, ''show that Daily was not at No Gun Ri on July 26, 1950; nor was he a machine gunner,'' the magazine reported. **********The wire service account acknowledges the discrepancy in the records.

The wire service also said Mr. Daily had showed them a variety of documents attesting to his service in H Company, one of the units involved, in the months before the attack. Those papers included a driver's license and a menu from a dinner held by H Company at Christmas in 1949 that lists him with the company. **********The executive editor of The Associated Press, Jon Wolman, said in a statement yesterday: ''The Associated Press stands behind its carefully researched report of events in the early days of the Korean War near the village of No Gun Ri. **********''Even as we review discrepancies between several records and eyewitness accounts, we are confident of the accuracy and fairness of the central finding that Korean civilians were killed by U.S. forces.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/10/world/whose-holy-land-arabs-mubarak-meets-arafat-avoids-publicly-pressing-him-meet.html": {"writer_name": "John Burns", "pub_date": "2000-10-10", "snippet": "Meeting in Cairo between Egyptian Pres Hosni Mubarak and Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat ends with Mubarak's conspicuously avoiding any public appeal for Arafat to bow to Israeli demands to end Palestinian violence; caught between US and Israeli d...", "word_count": 1210, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mubarak Meets Arafat and Avoids Publicly Pressing Him to Meet Demands of Israel", "print_headline": "WHOSE HOLY LAND? THE ARABS; Mubarak Meets Arafat and Avoids Publicly Pressing Him to Meet Demands of Israel", "body_text": " **********A two-hour meeting here today between the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, ended with Mr. Mubarak's conspicuously avoiding any public appeal for Mr. Arafat to bow to Israeli demands  to end Palestinian violence. **********Caught between American and Israeli demands that Egypt restrain the Palestinians and boiling anger across the Arab world at the heavy Palestinian casualties in 12 days of confrontation with Israeli troops and policemen in Gaza and the West Bank, Mr. Mubarak acted like a man walking a tightrope. Behind the scenes, he worked feverishly to promote diplomatic solutions. In public, he gave solid support to Mr. Arafat and the Palestinians, and blamed the Israelis for the violence. **********But in all his actions, Mr. Mubarak left no doubt that he, like President Clinton and indeed virtually all the leading figures in the crisis, sees the clashes between the Israelis and the Palestinians as threatening a wider conflagration, one that could erupt into a new Arab-Israeli war. He spent much of the day on the telephone with other Arab leaders and Mr. Clinton, discussing possible diplomatic moves that could help head off a wider conflict. **********One of these, a meeting in Egypt between Mr. Clinton, Mr. Mubarak and the two principal antagonists, Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat, appeared to hang in the balance. Although Mr. Clinton appealed to Mr. Mubarak to host the meeting in a telephone call on Sunday, and suggested that it be held as early as the middle of the week, Egypt's foreign minister, Amr Mussa, said today that calling the meeting would be premature unless Israel gave assurances that it would end attacks on Palestinians -- a condition that appeared to turn Mr. Barak's demand for an end to Palestinian violence back on the Israeli leader. **********''There has to be a commitment that what happened in Gaza and the West Bank will not be repeated,'' he said. **********There were also signs that Mr. Mubarak was still smarting from events last week, when Mr. Barak boycotted a meeting between Mr. Mubarak, Mr. Arafat and Secretary of State Madeleine G. Albright in the Egypian resort of Sharm El-Sheikh that was held hours after Mr. Arafat had stormed out of a meeting with Mr. Barak and Dr. Albright at the American Embassy in Paris. For the moment, the Egyptian leader appeared to be investing much of his energy in arranging another meeting, of Arab leaders, that he has called for in Cairo on October 21 and 22. According to current plans, it will be the first Arab summit meeting since 1996, and the first since the Persian Gulf war a decade ago to be attended by Iraq, a pariah in most pan-Arab meetings for a decade. **********But even as Mr. Mubarak worked on diplomatic approaches, other Arab leaders continued to issue statements today that hinted at the possibility of war. Ominously, some of the harshest statements came from nations that have strong ties to the United States and had backed the American-led drive for peace. **********Saudi Arabia's crown prince, Abdullah bin Abdel Aziz, was quoted by the Saudi Press Agency as saying that Mr. Barak should not assume that Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations would stand by if Israel attacked Lebanon or Syria. That possibility arises from a confrontation over three Israeli soldiers who were seized on Saturday by the Lebanon-based militant Islamic movement Hezbollah. **********''Barak must think carefully before making the slightest intolerable step,'' Prince Abdullah was quoted as saying in Riyadh, the Saudi capital. **********In the decades since Israel was founded, Arab nations, especially those that have avoided getting drawn directly into the four wars that have erupted since 1948, have often indulged in impassioned statements against Israel, then done little of practical significance. This time, too, there has been an amplitude of angry polemics, but no rush to get directly involved. **********Several Arab nations -- including Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia -- have pledged to fly emergency medical supplies to the Palestinians and to evacuate Palestinian wounded. But even that effort has foundered in the face of an Israeli decision on Sunday to bar the flights by closing Gaza airport. **********Mr. Mubarak has steered a course that appears to have been deeply influenced by past Arab experience of confrontations with Israel, almost all of which have ended with the Arab nations worse off. In his public statements, he has sought to ride, and perhaps calm, the wave of Arab anger, by associating himself with the outrage against Israel's actions. But on the diplomatic front, he has set himself firmly against any widening of the conflict, certainly one that would involve Egyptian forces. **********After the meeting with Mr. Arafat today, for example, Mr. Mubarak's spokesman summarized the discussion in a way that had the Egyptian leader laying all the blame for the violence on Israel, saying Mr. Mubarak had spoken of the need for ''intensive efforts'' to end Israeli attacks. There was no mention of Mr. Mubarak's having taken up Mr. Barak's request to help persuade Mr. Arafat to take actions that would ''restore complete calm in Israel and the West Bank as quickly as possible.'' **********Publicly, at least, Mr. Mubarak also sided with Lebanon in the dispute over the captured Israeli soldiers. In an official transcript made available today of remarks Mr. Mubarak made to reporters on Sunday, he laid the blame for the incident on Israel. He said that when Israel ended its military occupation of southern Lebanon in May, ''it was agreed'' that 17 Lebanese citizens, apparently members of Hezbollah and other militant Islamic groups, would be released from Israeli prisons. **********Mr. Mubarak has also continued solidly backing Mr. Arafat in his refusal to accept American and Israeli proposals that would leave most of Jerusalem under Israeli sovereignty in a final peace agreement, the issue that sparked the current crisis. On Sunday, he said that ''not a single Arab country'' would accept Israeli sovereignty over Muslim holy sites in East Jerusalem, and he suggested that the problem could be solved with the concept of ''divine sovereignty'' over the Muslim and Jewish holy sites, with Palestinians being ''deputized'' to exercise the sovereignty. **********But he mocked suggestions that Arab nations have a military option, saying, ''Neither Israel nor its neighbors can afford a continuation of the drain of war.'' **********Judging by some of the other political posturing during the day, the crisis appeared in some ways to have thrown the Middle East back to the period before 1978, when Egypt's decision to make peace with Israel began to recast the geo-political map.

KAPLAN Judge Says Recording of Electronic Chats Is Legal n 12 states, it is illegal to record your own telephone conversations without the consent of the person at the other end of the line. Now a judge in Washington, one of those privacy-conscious states, has ruled that the state's law does not apply to the new world of e-mail and online chats. **********Digital Privacy **********Related Articles **********Ongoing Coverage of Digital Privacy **********Forum **********Can Privacy Be Protected Online? **********That decision, which appears to be the first of its kind, represents a bad precedent for online privacy, some legal experts say. But others argue that e-mail messages by their nature are forwarded and stored on a recipient's computer, so e-mail users automatically agree to the recording of their messages when they choose the medium. **********The novel legal issue of how to characterize e-mail communication arose in a recent criminal case in Washington's Spokane County. The police there said they received information that 26-year-old Donald Townsend was seeking sex with minors that he met online. Setting up a sting operation on the Internet, Detective Jerry Keller pretended to be a 13-year-old girl named Amber with a Hotmail e-mail account and a screen name of \"ambergirl87,\" according to legal papers. **********Detective Keller, in the role of Amber, sent messages to Townsend, kicking off an e-mail exchange between the two parties -- about seven messages in all, said Deputy County Prosecutor Patti Walker. In addition, \"Amber\" and Townsend had a series of electronic conversations on ICQ , an Internet chat network owned by America Online that allows users to communicate in real time. While ICQ can be used to create a public chat room, the conversations that took place between Keller and Townsend were private chats that were inaccessible to others, the legal papers say. **********Over three days last June, Townsend sent 86 ICQ messages to Keller, Walker said in a telephone interview. In some of them, he \"was setting up a date with a fictitious 13-year-old and trying to have sex with her,\" she said. **********Keller saved the ICQ communications on his computer and later printed them out for use as potential evidence in the case, after Townsend tried to meet \"Amber\" in a bar. Keller also stored and printed out the e-mail messages he received from Townsend. Townsend was eventually arrested and charged with attempted rape of a minor, possession of child pornography and other crimes. **********Before trial, three Spokane County public defenders made a clever motion: they sought to suppress the use of the police print-outs of the e-mail messages and ICQ chats. **********Under the Washington Privacy Act , argued Mark Hannibal, Kathleen Moran and David Blair-Loy, there is a very strong prohibition on the interception or recording of private communications by phone, radio, telegraph or other device between two or more people without the consent of all of the parties. This \"all-party consent\" rule makes Washington different than most other states, where recording of a private conversation is lawful if just one party consents. **********In the Townsend case, the lawyers said, Washington's privacy law clearly applied to private communications via a computer, which should be regarded as a \"device\" under the law. Also, since Kelly did not have a special court order allowing him to record Townsend's online messages, and because Townsend never gave his consent, the messages could not be used in a trial, they said. **********In a ruling last month, Judge Kathleen M. O'Connor of Spokane County Superior Court rejected those arguments. She reckoned that the Washington privacy law does not apply to computer communications because the words of the statute do not specifically mention computers as a covered device. **********Judge O'Connor went on to conclude that even if the act applied in this case, it could be said that the defendant implicitly consented to Keller's recording of his e-mail and ICQ chat. After all, the judge said, Townsend chose to \"communicate via e-mail and/or ICQ . . . with the knowledge that the computer itself is a transmission and recording device. **********\"From that knowledge, it may be presumed that the defendant knew that the intended recipients of the conversation may retain and/or disseminate messages received from the defendant,\" the judge wrote. \"In an age where millions of e-mails are sent daily, it is unreasonable for a user to expect that a recipient will not save, transmit and/or copy an e-mail or an ICQ (chat) communication.\" **********Hannibal, one of the defense lawyers, said that if his client was convicted after trial next month, he would appeal the denial of the move to suppress the evidence. **********Online chat is by its nature a very unguarded kind of discussion. **********Walker, the deputy county prosecutor, said she was pleased by the decision. She added that she argued before the judge that if the all-party consent privacy act applied to e-mail, it would \"wreak havoc\" with e-commerce in the state. **********\"Just think: If you and I communicated by e-mail or ICQ, once I received your message I couldn't copy or forward it without your permission,\" she said. \"If I e-mailed a purchase order to you, you couldn't print it out unless I gave you permission.\" **********Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a civil liberties group in Washington, said he believed the court's ruling was slippery. **********\"Obviously, from a privacy viewpoint, the principle underlying the two-party consent rule should be applied on a technologically neutral basis,\" he said. \"There is a fairly clear line of federal cases that points to the continued protection of personal communications, regardless of the technology at issue.\" **********Internet links of interest to Cyber Law Journal readers **********But other experts disagreed. Andrew Grosso, a Washington lawyer who specializes in Internet-related matters and who was once an assistant federal prosecutor, said that as a matter of common sense, e-mail messages are not the same as a telephone call. \"The [e-mail] medium automatically records what is being communicated,\" he said. **********Clifford Fishman, a law professor at the Catholic University of America in Washington and an expert on eavesdropping and wiretapping laws, said he thought Judge O'Connor's decision was a good one. **********\"If I were the judge, and assuming the statute let me, I would rule that what a person says on e-mail is like what a person says on a telephone answering machine,\" Fishman said. \"In both cases, the person knows that the message is being preserved in a permanent form, and he can have no expectation that what he has recorded will stay private.\" **********One lawyer who was familiar with the court's decision took issue with Judge O'Connor's lumping together of e-mail and chat communications. **********Jeffry K. Finer, a criminal defense lawyer and a visiting professor at Gonzaga Law School in Spokane, said he agreed with the court that Townsend implicitly consented to the recording of his e-mail, because e-mail messages have to be stored on a hard drive. But chat messages, he added, may or may not be recorded, depending on the software. Consequently, he said, Townsend could not have given implied consent to Keller's storage of the ICQ notes. **********Moreover, said Finer, online chat is by its nature a very unguarded kind of discussion, not at all like a deliberative e-mail or a message left on a phone answering machine. **********\"It's a spontaneous, back-and-forth, written conversation, like a private conversation at a party,\" he said. \"That's exactly the kind of private conversation the privacy law in Washington was designed to protect -- spontaneous utterances that are nobody's business.\" **********CYBER LAW JOURNAL is published weekly, on Fridays.

Kellogg's cereal sales have declined roughly 2 percent this year, weighing on the company's earnings and testing investors' patience. **********While Quaker Oats, a Kellogg rival, owns Gatorade, a dominant brand in the rapidly growing category of noncarbonated beverages, Kellogg has had little outside of its cereal business to propel it forward. Sales of its Pop-Tarts have increased about 8 percent in recent years, but the company has been unable to eke out enough momentum from its secondary products to generate the double-digit earnings growth many investors expect from food companies. **********Acquiring Keebler gives Kellogg a foothold in the fast-growing snack foods category, potentially easing the company's problem of being the dominant player in a dwindling segment of the food business. **********''This is transformational,'' Carlos M. Gutierrez, Kellogg's chairman and chief executive, said in an interview. With the addition of Keebler, Mr. Gutierrez said, cereals would represent no more than 25 percent of the company's total business. **********Sales of cookies and crackers, by contrast, have been increasing more than 5 percent a year, benefiting from the quest for convenience and a growing consumer realization that low-fat snacks do not always have fewer calories than the indulgent treats they are meant to replace. Keebler's stock has risen from a 52-week low of $21.75, reached in February, to a high of $46.19 last month. **********Under the agreement, Kellogg will pay $42 for each Keebler share, a slight premium over Wednesday's closing price of $39.38, and assume $550 million of the company's debt. Kellogg's stock rose $1.56, to $24.31. **********That is significantly lower than the price company officials had hoped to receive. Flowers Industries, which owns 55 percent of Keebler, put the cookie company up for sale last July, when it was struggling with mounting losses at its Mrs. Smith's pie business. At the time, a flurry of acquisitions in the food industry was under way, including the $10.5 billion purchase of Pillsbury by Diageo, a British conglomerate, and the $14.9 billion sale of Nabisco, the leading snack foods maker, by Philip Morris, the owner of Kraft Foods. **********Amid the consolidation craze, Keebler officials set a sales target of $48 to $52 a share, sources close to the deal say. But given the company's second place position in the market, its limited overseas presence, and the tremendous resources that Philip Morris can bring to bear in marketing Nabisco, many potential suitors sat out the bidding, leaving Kellogg as the sole contestant. **********Even as it announced the Keebler acquisition, Kellogg officials lowered their earnings forecasts for the fourth quarter and the coming year, advising investors that the company will have to spend heavily to revive its listless marketing campaigns. After cutting back on expenses to meet analysts' earnings expectations, Kellogg's advertising spending is at its lowest point in nearly 10 years. **********''That's exactly the cycle we're trying to break,'' Mr. Gutierrez said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/24/business/fedex-income-up-37-as-it-lifts-fuel-fees.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "2000-03-24", "snippet": "Fedex Corp says earnings in fiscal third-quarter ended Feb 29 rose 37 percent, exceeding forecasts; profit from operations increased to $107.1 million compared with $78 million in period a year earlier; international shipments grew 14 percent, whi...", "word_count": 287, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FedEx Income Up 37% as It Lifts Fuel Fees", "print_headline": "FedEx Income Up 37% as It Lifts Fuel Fees", "body_text": " **********The FedEx Corporation, parent of Federal Express, the big overnight-delivery company, said today that its fiscal third-quarter earnings rose 37 percent, exceeding forecasts, on growth in international shipments. **********In the quarter ending on Feb. 29, profit from operations increased to $107.1 million, or 37 cents a diluted share, compared with $78 million, or 26 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.

Cutler, a money manager at Brandywine Asset Management. He has been scooping up beleaguered shares of Micron Technology, a semiconductor maker; New Focus, a fiber optics equipment maker; and Lucent Technologies. **********That would not be a big deal, except that Mr. Cutler is a traditional value manager, more at home hunting for underpriced stocks among oil companies, electric utilities and providers of financial services. **********Granted, in the information economy, the border between growth and value stocks has inevitably become more porous. So-called new-value managers like William H. Miller III of Legg Mason and Bill Nygren of Oakmark have routinely bought high-priced, volatile technology stocks, if they had correspondingly strong growth prospects. **********But with warnings and announcements of  disappointing earnings causing scores of technology and telecommunications stocks to tumble, the purchase of such volatile issues may seem a stretch for value managers, who contend that their style is less risky than buying growth stocks. Several, in fact, acknowledge that they may be jumping into these stocks before they have hit bottom. **********Where growth investors look for earnings and stock price momentum, value investors favor stolid but unloved companies selling at low multiples to earnings, revenue or other figures. Value investors, in other words, love shopping the sales. **********Peter Canelo, a Morgan Stanley Dean Witter market strategist, says technology stocks have indeed moved onto bargain terrain. By his calculation, the technology component of the Standard & Poor's 500 traded at a price-to-earnings-growth ratio of 2.5 in March, a premium to the 1.7 multiple for the entire index. The tech multiple has since dropped to 1.4, a slight discount to the current 1.5 of the broader market. ''Tech is very conservatively priced,'' he concluded. **********Barbara G. Marcin, manager of Gabelli Blue Chip Value, agreed. Ms. Marcin has increased technology to 20 percent of her portfolio, from just 6 percent a year ago. ''For the last couple of years, it's been tough to own tech,'' she said. ''Now, we're taking advantage of the flip side of the mania.'' **********Ms. Marcin recently added shares of Compaq Computer at $18 to $23, well below their 52-week high of $35. She applauds the company's management for moving into servers, or heavy-duty central computers, that have higher margins. At $16 a share, Compaq trades at less than 14 times the earnings she projects for next year, a multiple far lower than the approximately 25 of the S.& P. **********Another undervalued stock, she said, is Motorola, the No. 2 maker of wireless handsets, behind Nokia. The consensus of earnings expectations among analysts for next year, she said, has declined from $1.43 a share to a more realistic 83 cents a share. ''The stock was too high at 60, but 20 is too low,'' she added. The shares closed on Friday at $19.44. **********Timothy M. Ghriskey, manager of the value-oriented Dreyfus Fund, has also been buying former technology stars. Last month, he added Dell Computer shares at $25.50; they had traded as high as $59.69 in March. ''Dell hasn't been a value stock for a while,'' Mr. Ghriskey said, with distinct understatement. He predicted that by mid-2001, Dell would benefit from a new wave of corporate buying to replace outmoded computers. He expects Dell to earn $1 a share  for the year ending in January 2002. It closed on Friday at $18.38. **********Mr. Ghriskey called Unisys, the computer mainframe company, his most compelling, if riskiest, new holding. He said sales of the company's higher-end servers, which doubled in the third quarter from the previous quarter, were continuing to show strong momentum, while an industrywide recovery in computer services added stability to the company's outlook. **********He recently added Unisys stock to the Dreyfus Aggressive Value fund at $12, or  less than nine times estimated 2001 earnings of $1.40 a share. ''Wall Street is not on top of the story,'' he said. **********David A. Katz a money manager at Matrix Asset Advisors, a value-oriented investment firm in New York, sees little risk in having bought shares of Adaptec at $10, down from their high of $63.56, reached in January. He said the company, whose software speeds data transfers, is cheap compared with the value of its operations plus the $3 a share it has in cash. He predicted  the stock would hit $25 within 18 months. **********He has also bought Hewlett-Packard at $33 a share, and is buying more. Though he acknowledges that he may be early, he says that investors have historically made money when the shares traded at price-to-earnings ratios in the mid-teens. At their current $32.19, the shares trade at about 17 times projected 2001 earnings of $1.90 a share. **********Mr. Cutler of Brandywine Asset Management said that until recently, popular sectors like fiber optics were outside the firm's price range. But after Thanksgiving, he took advantage of the downdraft in that sector to add shares of New Focus at $20, off sharply from a high of $165 in July. ''They're on the leading edge of fiber optics systems manufacturing and testing,'' he said. **********The company is free of debt, he said, and has $14 a share in cash. He added that the shares, less the cash, trade at less than twice projected 2001 revenues of $200 million, a small fraction of the multiple for the industry leaders, JDS Uniphase and Corning. New Focus now trades at $28.94.. **********MR. CUTLER has also been buying shares of Lucent Technologies at about $18, off substantially from their 52-week high of $78.51. The company is worth $32 a share, he said, after trimming his estimate from $35 last week in the wake of the company's downbeat sales and earnings forecasts. It closed on Friday at $13.63  He values Lucent's microelectronics unit, which Lucent plans to spin off to its shareholders early next year, at $15 a share. He assigns a ''conservative'' multiple of 2.0 to Lucent's remaining revenue, for an additional $17 a share. The kicker, he said, is Lucent's leadership in foreign markets, where demand is growing most rapidly. **********Even though Micron Technology's shares fell sharply after a disappointing earnings report last week, Mr. Cutler believes that either demand for the company's chips will revive next year or that weak prices will drive many competitors out of the market. **********But let others lament their tech stock fever. Ms. Marcin of Gabelli said money managers like her could now profit from others' excesses. ''The core philosophy of value managers,'' she said, ''is that we take advantage of the market's emotion.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/14/business/the-markets-key-rates.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-11-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 117, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "THE MARKETS; Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/11/business/world-business-briefing-europe-reprieve-for-titanic-shipyard.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Cowell", "pub_date": "2000-05-11", "snippet": "Harland & Wolff, Northern Ireland shipyard that launched Titanic in 1912 and seemed in danger of closing two months ago, wins surprising reprieve with $480 million order to build four passenger ships; deal by shipyard, with Seamasters Internationa...", "word_count": 67, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "REPRIEVE FOR TITANIC SHIPYARD", "print_headline": "WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: EUROPE; REPRIEVE FOR TITANIC SHIPYARD", "body_text": " **********The Northern Ireland shipyard that launched the Titanic in 1912 and seemed in danger of closing just two months ago won a surprising reprieve with a $480 million order to build four passenger ships.

What has been seen so far is not the Net's Armageddon, they say, but only an alert. **********''There are nightmare scenarios that are real, but that's not where we are,'' said David Clark, an M.I.T. professor who was one of the Internet's original designers. **********Even so, finding ways to contain anti-social acts in such a system -- one that by its very design permits anonymous behavior -- without compromising its openness is proving increasingly thorny for network designers, law enforcement officials and civil libertarians. **********''We have run into a situation where the attackers are coordinated and organized but the people who have to respond -- both companies, Internet service providers, and most particularly law enforcement agencies -- are fragmented,'' said Mark Rasch, a former federal prosecutor who is now a vice president at Global Integrity, a computer security consulting firm based in Reston, Va. **********This week's attacks have exploited a set of software programs developed over the last year, computer security experts said today. Known variously as Tribe Flood Network, Trin00 and Stacheldraht (German for ''barbed wire''), the programs first identify individual computers on the Internet with specific security flaws, then use those computers as launching pads for an orchestrated attack. **********Like the sorcerer's apprentice, the programs let a small group or even an individual pour buckets of data at one or many targets, inundating a Web site's computers with data. **********Moreover, it is not easy to identify the person carrying the bucket. In some cases, the malicious programs systematically falsify the network addresses from which the data is sent. **********But while the consequences of these programs are harmful, it is just this kind of novel intervention that the Internet was designed to make possible. **********In the early 1980's, Mr. Clark and two other M.I.T. computer network researchers, Jerry Salzer and David P. Reed, first described one of the Internet's most powerful aspects: it was a simple network -- or even a ''stupid'' one, as it was later described by David Isenberg, then an A.T.& T. Bell Labs researcher -- in contrast to the more centralized, or ''intelligent,'' and tightly controlled telephone network. **********The very simplicity of the Internet, they wrote, made it a platform for innovation in ways that a more centralized and tightly controlled network could never become. **********In the last decade the Internet has served as a virtual petri dish for new ideas -- from low-cost communications systems that have redefined telephone, radio and television, to business methods that have remade industries like stock trading, auctions and bookselling. **********But that same power for innovation can be redirected upon the data network in a way that makes it remarkably resilient but extremely vulnerable. **********''If an owner of a specific network wants to add some kind of cool feature it doesn't matter in an internetworked world,'' said Mr. Isenberg. Because there is no central point of control, as on other networks, ''you have the control way out on the edges, and anyone can do anything,'' he added. **********Other Internet pioneers are concerned that incidents like this week's attacks may lead to increasing calls for government and law enforcement intervention into the structure of the Internet. **********Last July, for example, the Clinton administration began circulating a plan for an extensive software system monitoring government computers, and possibly those of private industry, to protect data networks from intruders. **********The network, known as the Federal Intrusion Detection Network, or Fidnet, alarmed civil libertarians who said it could be used to curtail privacy in the Internet age. **********''The real danger of any terrorism is not so much in the act itself as the overreaction,'' said Robert Frankston, a computer researcher who is the co-inventor of the spreadsheet. ''The Internet has enabled rapid economic growth because it has made it difficult to prevent disruptive innovation.'' **********And he suggested that the Internet becomes more secure as it experiences attacks and its administrators reconfigure it to repel invaders -- ''just as our immune system is strengthened by exposure to disease.'' **********In any case, some longtime law enforcement officials said that there was no simple centralized solution to these kinds of attack. **********''The problem is that if you're smart about this there is no trail for law enforcement to follow,'' said Scott Charney, who until recently was the Justice Department's top computer crime official and who is now a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers. ''There are obvious privacy implications. The real question is how strong a response do you want.'' **********The best response, several computer security experts said, would be to strengthen the security of individual computers on the Internet. That would make it more difficult for the automated programs that now take over many systems to find systems to exploit."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/20/business/arthur-goldberg-builder-of-casino-empire-dies-at-58.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "2000-10-20", "snippet": "Arthur M Goldberg, who built Park Place Entertainment casino empire, dies at age 58; photo (M)", "word_count": 946, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Obituary; Biography", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Arthur Goldberg, Builder of Casino Empire, Dies at 58", "print_headline": "Arthur Goldberg, Builder of Casino Empire, Dies at 58", "body_text": " **********Arthur M. Goldberg, who parlayed a small stake in a struggling gambling company into control of the nation's largest casino operator, died yesterday at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. He was 58. **********The cause was complications from bone marrow failure, according to Michael W. Kempner, a spokesman for Mr. Goldberg's company. **********Mr. Goldberg was the president and chief executive of Park Place Entertainment, which operates more than two dozen casinos under the brand names Bally's, Caesars, Hilton, Paris and Grand. **********He built his empire through acquisitions and a devotion to cost-cutting, eschewing the opulent theme hotels built by some other casino moguls. **********''You've all heard me say that we don't like to gamble with our company's money, even though we're in the gambling business,'' Mr. Goldberg told securities analysts last year in announcing the acquisition of Caesars casinos. **********Rumors that Mr. Goldberg was in failing health had circulated around the gambling industry for more than a year, but Mr. Goldberg and Park Place always dismissed them. He was hospitalized for more than a month last year for reasons the company at first declined to disclose, but later said was pneumonia. **********Park Place said the death was ''unexpected.'' Its board met in New York to begin the search for a new chief executive, whom the company expects to name soon. **********The death occurred as much of the gambling industry was gathered in Las Vegas for the World Gaming Congress and Expo, the industry's largest trade show. Some speakers at the show preceded their prepared remarks with tributes to Mr. Goldberg. **********In an interview, Donald J. Trump, a usually friendly rival of Mr. Goldberg's in Atlantic City, said, ''Arthur had a great vision.'' Steve Wynn, who often had strained relations with Mr. Goldberg, issued a statement yesterday calling him ''a man of extraordinary energy and courage.'' **********Mr. Goldberg, a former trucking company owner, began his ascent in the gambling business 10 years ago this month. A small-time corporate raider at the time, he spent about $14 million to buy a little more than 5 percent of the Bally Manufacturing Corporation, a struggling operator of casinos and health clubs and a maker of gambling machines. With the company in financial trouble, Mr. Goldberg demanded to be put in charge at a board meeting in October 1990. With few alternatives, the board agreed, even though Mr. Goldberg had no casino business experience. **********Mr. Goldberg restored Bally to health through aggressive cost-cutting and spun off the health clubs into Bally Total Fitness, a separate company of which he was chairman. In 1996, the gambling company was acquired for $2 billion by Hilton Hotels, and Mr. Goldberg became chief of  Hilton's casino operations. **********At the end of 1998, Hilton spun off the gambling business into a separate company called Park Place, with Mr. Goldberg at the helm. At the same time, Park Place bought Grand Casinos, the largest casino operator in Mississippi. A few months later, it paid $3 billion to purchase the Caesars casinos from Starwood Hotels and Resorts, becoming the largest casino company. **********Mr. Goldberg could be charismatic, but let little stand in his way, and controversy surrounded some of his deals. While other Atlantic City gambling executives tried to prevent gambling from coming to the Catskill Mountains, Mr. Goldberg surprised people by striking a deal this year with the St. Regis Mohawk Indian tribe to build a casino at Kutsher's resort. That undercut another casino project that had already received federal approval. Rivals speculated that Mr. Goldberg's real intention was to prevent new competition to Atlantic City. Mr. Goldberg denied it. **********Mr. Goldberg paid attention to costs and minor details. He would call up the cook, for instance, if he received a room service meal that was cold. **********Stephen F. Bollenbach, the chief executive of Hilton and chairman of Park Place, said that Mr. Goldberg carried in his pocket a report on all the checks written for more than $5,000, so he could question managers about their spending. ''The key to his success was that he worked real hard,'' Mr. Bollenbach said. **********Mr. Goldberg's philosophy was the opposite of that of Steve Wynn, who built his own casinos rather than buy from others and tried to make his properties the splashiest. Mr. Goldberg's Paris casino in Las Vegas, which opened in 1999, cost $785 million, less than half the cost of Mr. Wynn's Bellagio resort. **********''He was probably the most shareholder-oriented leader in the casino industry,'' said Jason N. Ader, a gambling industry analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company. **********Mr. Goldberg, whose father ran a small trucking company, grew up in and around Newark. He graduated from Rutgers University and Villanova University School of Law and practiced law for a couple of years. **********But when his father suffered a heart attack in the late 1960's, Mr. Goldberg quit law to run the trucking company, which he built into a big operation before selling it in the mid-1980's. **********Throughout that decade, he invested in companies. Sometimes, the company paid bought back his stock for a higher price. In other cases, he actually ran the company and then sold it. **********In addition to running Park Place, Mr. Goldberg was chief executive of the Di Giorgio Corporation, a privately owned food distributor in Carteret, N.J. **********A physical fitness buff, Mr. Goldberg ran marathons, lifted weights and until a few years ago worked out with the Rutgers football team. **********He was also a big contributor to politicians, particularly Democrats. He served as a commissioner of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey from 1991 to 1994. **********Mr. Goldberg, who lived in New Jersey, is survived by his wife, Veronica; four children; six grandchildren; and a brother, according to Mr. Kempner, the spokesman. He said the names of the survivors would not be released."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/12/technology/l-wincing-squinting-618284.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-10-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 111, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Wincing, Squinting", "print_headline": "Wincing, Squinting", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********When I read the headline ''Windows Without Wincing'' (State of the Art, Oct. 5), I thought that it might touch upon an issue I have come into direct contact with.

Consider Vermont Yankee, on the banks of the Connecticut River here. **********For years many people thought that the plant was at death's door. It is one of the oldest nuclear reactors that is still operating in the United States. The core shroud, a crucial internal part that holds the fuel in place and channels cooling water, is showing damage from age. The owners are short of money. **********But now a bidding war is brewing among three eager buyers, and financial analysts say the winner is likely to invest even more to seek to extend its operating license for decades and possibly to raise its power output. **********Similar decisions have quietly transformed dozens of plants around the country. While no one expects any American utility to order a new nuclear plant in the foreseeable future, the overall effect is a much-improved prospect for the long-battered industry. **********Several factors are helping to turn nuclear white elephants into valuable heirlooms. The price of natural gas, the main source for new generation, has quadrupled in the last year. The market price of electricity has soared under deregulation, and the growing economy has led to shortages of generating capacity. **********''Suddenly people realize that you can actually make money with these plants,'' said Ted Marston, the chief nuclear officer at the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit research consortium in Palo Alto, Calif., that has helped utilities obtain license renewals beyond the initial 40 years for which they were approved. **********In March, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved a 20-year extension on a twin-reactor plant in Maryland, Calvert Cliffs, which is now owned by the Constellation Energy Group. Two months later, it did the same for the three-reactor Oconee plant, owned by Duke Energy, in South Carolina. **********Since then, Mr. Marston said, the market value of nuclear reactors has increased tenfold. **********The effect is visible here. In October 1999, the AmerGen Energy Company, a partnership between the PECO Energy Company, the parent of Philadelphia Electric and itself a unit of the Exelon Corporation, and British Energy, made a $23.5 million bid in a battle for Vermont Yankee. **********But the state Department of Public Service, which represents the interests of energy consumers, said the price was too low, helping kill the deal. AmerGen is now offering more than $93 million, but a second company, the Entergy Corporation, based in New Orleans, has indicated it will offer more. Entergy recently announced a merger with the FPL Group, parent company of Florida Power and Light, which would create the nation's largest electric utility. **********The Vermont Public Service board has told Entergy to file a bid by Jan. 12, and told the plant to cooperate with the company in due diligence. The board also told two other companies, Dominion, based in Virginia, which has expressed interest, and Constellation Nuclear, a subsidiary of Constellation Energy, that it would offer them similar accommodations. **********The companies say they want to buy up reactors around the country, and through economies of scale and their extensive nuclear experience, run them better and make more money from their operations. AmerGen has already bought Three Mile Island 1, the undamaged twin of the reactor near Harrisburg, Pa., that experienced the nation's worst nuclear accident. It has also acquired Clinton, in southern Illinois, and Oyster Creek, in Toms River, N.J. Entergy has a deal to buy Nine Mile Point 2 and James A. FitzPatrick, near Scriba, N.Y., and Indian Point 3, in Buchanan, N.Y. **********While Vermont Yankee has not yet applied for a license extension -- its license is good until 2012, and the sellers are leaving that to a new owner -- applications have been approved or submitted for about a third of the nation's 103 surviving reactors. In addition, in the last decade, 57 reactors have quietly received the commission's permission to increase heat output and thus electric production, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute, a trade association in Washington. Some did it more than once. The capacity increase totals 2,200 megawatts, which is the equivalent of adding two huge reactors. **********The independent company that owns Vermont Yankee says output could probably be raised by 15 percent at a cost of about $200 for every kilowatt of additional capacity, which is far cheaper than a kilowatt of capacity at a new natural gas plant. Making the investment only makes sense, though, if the owner believes that the plant will run for more than a few years. **********The higher prices for reactors have pushed them roughly into the range of prices for fossil fuel plants, and do not approach a level that would lead to new nuclear construction. Still, it is a sharp turnaround from the idea that nuclear power would be phased out almost entirely over the next 10 or 15 years. **********The recovery is visible not only on the balance sheet but in improved operations. Vermont Yankee, for example, now shuts for refueling once every 18 months, and finished the job in 1999 in 34 days. In the 1970's and 1980's, it would shut down every year, for 60 or 70 days. **********''We did it under budget, under dose and under days,'' said Joseph P. Cox, who schedules engineering work at the plant, meaning that money, radiation exposure and time are all carefully watched. **********And 28 years into its lifetime, ''we're hitting the top of our game,'' said Michael Balduzzi, vice president for operations. **********In the early days, emergency shut-downs came every couple of months or so; now they are so infrequent plant managers remember each one, and every manual shutdown. The last shutdown was in August. Before that, Vermont Yankee ran 285 days uninterrupted. The run before that was 372 days, a plant record. **********The result of more powerful plants running more days of the year is that a reduced number of reactors is producing more and more power; in 1999, the 103 reactors produced more power than the whole industry did in the early 1990's, when the number of plants peaked at 110. **********The turnaround has stunned opponents, like Debbie Katz, who lives in Rowe, Mass., near the now closed Yankee Rowe plant. Yankee Rowe was one of the four Yankee reactors built by New England utilities, with overlapping ownership and some shared engineering services; she expected them all to close. The other three did. And she pointed out that in 1992, Shearson Lehman Brothers predicted that within 10 years, 25 reactors could face closing because they were not economically viable. **********Ms. Katz now tours Vermont with a camper emblazoned with the words, ''No Nukes,'' and painted with the propeller-shaped logo that is the international symbol of radiation. In a reference to AmerGen's British partner, the sign also has a silhouette of Paul Revere on his midnight ride of warning. **********Like many nuclear opponents, she was counting on nuclear power to fail  the economic test. But deregulation, combined with the recent electricity shortage, has given the industry new life instead. ''These reactors they are selling would have closed,'' she said. Speaking of the wild price swings, she said, ''This is such a destabilized situation, it's like being in the Wild West all over again.'' **********Ms. Katz and others say the sales of old plants are putting the job of decommissioning -- for which money has already been set aside -- into the hands of companies focused on profit, not safety; she likened it to an unscrupulous fortune-hunter marrying a rich widow and soon burying her cheaply. **********Critics say the idea of a 60-year-old reactor makes them nervous. Vermont Yankee's shroud, a barrel-shaped structure around the fuel that directs the flow of water being boiled into steam, shows damage in places that were heated during welding.  Metallurgists have diagnosed something called intergranular stress corrosion cracking, a process not understood when the part was made in the 1960's. They have added reinforcing rods around it. **********But engineers, managers and operators insist that simple age is no barrier to performance. **********''They have B-52's flying around that were flown by the pilots' grandfathers,'' said Michael G. Laporte, a work management supervisor here. A 20-year extension might make the same true for Yankee Rowe. **********The owners have spent tens of millions of dollars modernizing and re-analyzing in order to address safety concerns. The control room is now full of digital readouts and a monitoring system that runs on Gateway personal computers, undreamed of in 1966, when work here began. **********But Vermont Yankee and other plants still face problems, such as how to store the spent fuel, which is kept in a pool that will be full in 2008. **********Immediate neighbors like the plant. ''We've always been careful to watch it, but it is very, very well run, and a safe plant,'' said Patricia O'Donnell, who represents Vernon in the state House of Representatives and is also one of the five members of the Board of Selectmen, the town's executive body. Mrs. O'Donnell expressed her confidence from behind the counter at the clerk's office in town hall, a solid brick building that also houses a spacious library, less than a mile from the reactor that paid for it. The plant is 73 percent of the local property tax base. It is comforting to many here that the goose that lays the golden eggs may not, in fact, be getting too old yet. **********In Brattleboro, William L. Morse saw it a little differently. His brother-in-law has worked at Vermont Yankee, Mr. Morse said, and in general, nuclear power ''doesn't bother me any.'' Mr. Morse is the proprietor of Earth's Treasures, which sells Native American arts and crafts to tourists, and the shop is adjacent to one gasoline station and across the street from another, probably more of a hazard than the reactor down the road, he said. **********But pondering the idea of running it for 20 years beyond its 40-year license, he said that they ''better have a big shutdown and go through it really carefully.'' **********''You hear people say, 'They closed those other plants down,' '' he said. ''Why run this one?''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/29/technology/spectrasite-to-purchase-leasing-rights-to-sbc-towers.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-08-29", "snippet": "August 29, 2000", "word_count": 311, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SpectraSite to Purchase Leasing Rights to SBC Towers", "print_headline": "SpectraSite to Purchase Leasing Rights to SBC Towers", "body_text": " **********August 29, 2000 **********&nbsp; SpectraSite to Purchase Leasing Rights to SBC Towers By JAMIE PATON **********NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com pectraSite Communications said Monday that it would pay SBC Communications, of San Antonio, Texas, roughly $1.3 billion in cash and stock for lease rights to 3,900 wireless communications towers. **********SpectraSite will gain lease rights to the SBC towers for $983 million in cash and $325 million in stock, and will get rights to an additional 800 new towers under a five-year agreement.

With a mere dress, you can transform yourself into a businesswoman, a carpooling mom, an Audrey Hepburn wannabe or a princess. **********Although I personally favor the royalty option (I like to wear bottle-green velvet and carry a scepter to Waldbaum's) I have found that owning just the right casual dress is more directly applicable to my lifestyle. **********But which dress is the right dress? I sought advice from Dr. Jane Hegland, an assistant professor of clothing, textiles and fashion merchandising at New Mexico State University. **********I figured that since her doctoral dissertation had explored the ritualistic aspects of dressing for the prom, she should have no trouble advising someone who just wanted an incentive to get out of pajamas on Monday. **********Early in the conversation, I established a baseline. ''I don't want the same one everyone else is wearing,'' I said. **********''Of course not,'' Dr. Hegland said. ''But getting dressed is a constant tension between conformity and individuality. You don't want to go too far to the edge and somehow communicate that you don't understand the rules, but you want to add your own individual flair.'' **********We agreed that maybe what I wanted was a vintage dress, a well-sewn vestige of an earlier era that would clearly label me as an individual of superior taste. I wouldn't know a Bonnie Cashin coat from a turn-of-the century opera cloak. But thanks to a recent surge in the popularity of vintage clothing, I should have no trouble getting an education online, where a simple search for ''vintage clothing'' turned up 92,400 matches on the Google search engine. **********Considering that both Hollywood starlets and the woman sitting next to me at last week's PTA meeting are snagging vintage Pucci on e-Bay,  why shouldn't I get lucky, too? **********But when I found myself squinting dubiously at thumbnail photos of dresses like the ''late 1940's swing dress with ruffled collar and cuffs'' for sale for $22 at Vintagevixen.com, all I could think was, I'd look like Ma Walton in that. **********Then another source gave me a lead. ''Do you remember a dress, back in the 1970's -- it was universally flattering, it tied at the shoulder, with a band that went over the top of the bosom and then smocked under it?'' asked Christina Lindholm, a fashion historian who heads the department of fashion design and merchandising at Virginia Commonwealth University. ''I had one in navy.'' **********Although my notes indicate that Ms. Lindholm continued to describe this once-popular style in great detail, the last words I heard clearly were ''universally flattering.'' It was vaguely familiar. Didn't my childhood neighbor, Mrs. Nilles, wear that dress to a block party when I was in junior high? **********It was a tantalizing enough lead to send me to a couple of dozen more online shops, with merchandise that ranged from vintage couture to frowsy flowered housedresses that even Ma Walton would have torn up to make cleaning rags. **********I was intrigued by items like the men's polyblend white disco shirt, $19.50 at Rustyzipper.com, the 1920's kidskin flapper shoes, $125 at Hemlockvintage.com, and the Dolce and Gabbana satin purse for $85 at Buffaloexchange.com. But no 1970's sundress that always came in a solid color, with three contrasting bands of color across the bottom and an applique of a lotus flower. **********Not everyone recalls that particular dress. As Anne Hollander, a dress historian and author of ''Feeding the Eye: Essays'' (Farrar Straus & Giroux, 1999) told me: ''Universally flattering comes and goes.'' **********That made me wonder whether the dress would look hopelessly dated even if I did find it. The problem, Ms. Hollander said, was that I wouldn't be able to examine it closely online, much less try it on. **********''I think buying vintage items online could really be a mistake,'' she said, ''because it's very hard to figure out the general flavor, how it well it wore,'' she said.

And jargon. H.M.O., P.P.O., co-pay. **********More likely, it is because the $1.2 trillion health care business is dealing with so many of us that things cannot help but be complicated. **********For much of the 1990's, health maintenance organizations were viewed as a way to combat complexity and keep medical costs under control. No longer. Health insurance premiums are rising, and big corporate clients are turning away from managed-care plans. **********James A. Lane, health benefit analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, took some time last week to discuss recent changes and trends in the business. Following are excerpts from the conversation. **********Q. Health insurance stocks over the last year have certainly been good investments. Would you review the recent record? **********A. Financial results since the beginning of 1999 have been very strong, but before that there were three years of erratic performance. That erratic performance probably ended with Humana's significantly disappointing 1999 results. Those followed a $900 million charge taken by UnitedHealth Group in August 1998, and that followed Oxford Health's implosion in 1997. **********Another reason the sector may be viewed as a tough area is that even with good financial results, over the last year there have been more than 30 class action lawsuits filed against these companies. Those cases are in various stages of litigation. **********Despite that, an index of the 12 stocks we follow is up about 35 percent so far this year. **********Q. After a number of years when costs were under control, health insurance premiums are again rising at double-digit rates. Aside from higher drug costs, what is driving up prices? **********A. Outside of Medicare or Medicaid, underlying cost trends are accelerating for several reasons. **********First, as a result of the Balanced Budget Act, which reduced Medicare hospital reimbursements, hospitals are getting less money from the government. They had to get the money from someone. **********Also, the expanding definition of disease is driving up costs. Employees are demanding coverage for more things today. Products that once were considered lifestyle drugs are now mandated as having to be covered. **********A lot of state governments have put through mandated benefits, like mandatory 48-hour hospital stays for vaginal births, and 72-hour stays for Caesarean births. Those are important to have, but they are inflationary. **********Finally, litigation, which in some cases is warranted, is inflationary. **********Q. Many big companies are reacting to premium increases by turning away from H.M.O.'s and toward their own self-funded plans. Will that trend continue? **********A. We believe there is a secular trend of employer groups contracting with fewer and fewer vendors for all human resource functions, from health insurance to payroll, workers' compensation and disability. And we strongly believe that on the health insurance side there will be a convergence over the next five years of those players. **********Q. Which companies do you like as long-term investments? **********A. Cigna is the company we think is best positioned to take advantage of employer groups dealing with fewer health benefit vendors. It is trading at around $95 now. A year from now we think it will be a $130 to $135 stock. **********UnitedHealth Group, which has had outstanding financial results the last several quarters, is well positioned for the same secular trend. However, a lot of the good news is priced into the stock. **********And our top pick for the year was First Health Group, a midcap stock which is virtually unknown but has great operating margins and a blue-chip client base. **********Q. We haven't talked about Aetna, the country's biggest health insurance company. Last week, the company chose Dr. John W. Rowe, chief executive of Mount Sinai N.Y.U. Medical Center and Health System, to run Aetna. Can a hospital administrator be expected to turn around a business? **********A. Jack Rowe is a national health care figure, which Aetna needs because it is a national whipping boy. **********But one person didn't create the problems that Aetna has, and one person isn't going to solve them. His success or failure at Aetna will be based on his ability to attract more talented people to the Aetna organization and blend them in with those who stay. **********Aetna has a lot of upside potential, but this is going to be a two-year workout period.

That deal was scuttled at the 11th hour when a divided Coke board decided it would be paying too much for Quaker, the maker of Rice-A-Roni, Aunt Jemima and Cap'n Crunch. **********The boards of Pepsi, based in Purchase, N.Y., and Quaker Oats, in Chicago, are expected to meet separately over the weekend to decide whether to proceed with the deal, the executives said. A takeover could be announced as early as Monday, the executives added. **********Because two sets of takeover negotiations have already fallen apart, one executive said that the deal was not yet certain and could collapse. **********Neither Pepsi nor Quaker would comment. **********According to the executives, PepsiCo has offered to pay Quaker shareholders the same 2.3 PepsiCo shares -- or $104.65 a share -- it offered before for every share of Quaker. That represents a premium of 20 percent over Quaker's stock price, which closed yesterday at $86.94, down 69 cents. Shares of PepsiCo rose 13 cents, to $45.50. **********As such, the deal would be worth about the same as Pepsi's original bid. An agreement would end a monthlong drama that included public and private machinations by PepsiCo and by Coke, as well as by a third suitor, the Danone Group of France, for control of Quaker. **********For all three companies, Quaker represents a chance to own the Gatorade sports drink brand, which has proven itself to be a growth machine in an industry that has remained relatively stagnant, especially the once-celebrated carbonated drink brands. Gatorade represents 38 percent of Quaker's total revenue of about $4.7 billion. **********If the deal proceeds, PepsiCo would gain a commanding stake in the noncarbonated beverage industry, a fast-growing frontier that soft drink makers had been slow to explore but have been forced to take seriously in recent years. **********PepsiCo's return to the bargaining table with Quaker Oats had been greatly anticipated by investors and analysts, especially after Coke abandoned its deal and Danone publicly expressed its interest in buying Quaker and then reversed its position the next day. **********PepsiCo would also be taking on Quaker's food business, which it would probably sell, the executives said, though certain brands might be folded into PepsiCo's Frito-Lay snacks unit. Because the deal would be structured as a pooling of interests, the executives said, PepsiCo would not be able to sell any of the food businesses for two years. **********The acquisition could be considered a major blow to Coke because it would make PepsiCo, the smaller of the two companies, a much more powerful rival by adding $1.8 billion in sales to PepsiCo's balance sheet. **********Though not as extensive as Coke's, Pepsi's worldwide bottling and distribution system might allow it to increase sales by putting Gatorade in more than the 60 countries where it now sells. Nonetheless, some analysts have questioned whether Gatorade will be as popular in Europe and Asia as it has been in the United States, one reason that Coke backed away from buying Quaker. **********However, at $13.7 billion, the price is a relatively fair one, most analysts agree, and will not hurt Pepsi's earnings. That was a big consideration for Pepsi, analysts say, since the company has only recently come under Wall Street's good graces by consistently meeting analysts' growth forecasts. In setting a reasonable acquisition price for Quaker, few analysts expected Roger Enrico, Pepsi's chairman and chief executive, to risk that hard-won standing. **********Securing Gatorade would round out Pepsi's lineup of some of the best-performing noncarbonated brands. It already has the leading position in the iced tea market with its Lipton Brisk, as well as the dominant stance in the relatively new iced coffee segment with its Starbuck's Frappuccino line. **********Even more significant, its Aquafina brand of bottled water, a category responsible for roughly half of all the growth in the noncarbonated soft drink business, is the industry leader; Coke's offering in the field, Dasani, is in eighth place. **********''Pepsi has already begun to move very aggressively in the noncarbonated area,'' said John Sicher, editor of Beverage Digest, an industry newsletter. ''The addition of Gatorade would be a huge enhancement to that strategy.'' **********In many ways, Quaker fits better within Pepsi than Coke, analysts say. Because of its Frito-Lay snack food business, which accounted for roughly 60 percent of its $18.7 billion in revenue last year, analysts have long believed that Pepsi would face a far less cumbersome task absorbing Quaker's packaged food division. Some Quaker products have shown little growth potential recently, especially cereals. But other areas have proven more promising, particularly Quaker's line of convenience foods, like granola bars."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/22/business/a-visible-chief-has-a-head-for-numbers.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-02-22", "snippet": "Brief profile of Diana D Brooks, who resigned as president and chief executive of Sotheby's; photo (S)", "word_count": 174, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Visible Chief Has a Head for Numbers", "print_headline": "A Visible Chief Has a Head for Numbers", "body_text": " **********Diana D.

Ms. Monakhov, a 26-year-old free-lancer from New York on assignment for The Associated Press, suffered a fractured pelvis, hospital officials said. **********The assassination of the once-relatively obscure Fatah leader Mr. Obaiyat, whom the army blamed particularly for leading nocturnal shooting on Gilo, a neighborhood in southeastern Jerusalem, was regarded as a grave step by Israeli commentators. **********In the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, Roni Shaked wrote, ''The use of helicopter missiles as a tool of assassination is a step on the way to the 'Lebanonization' of the territories.'' Calling it an escalation of the war, he wrote that Palestinians will step up hostilities in response to the slaying, even though the army believes that in the long run the move will curb Palestinian attacks. **********The surge in violence came as Prime Minister Ehud Barak prepared for a meeting tomorrow with President Clinton in Washington. But no one here seemed to be holding out hopes that the meeting would bring calm soon. **********Mr. Barak said on Friday, before much of Israel closed down for the Sabbath, that the talks would be an effort to end the violence, but added he did not expect they would ''lead to a renewal of negotiations.'' **********With the seven-year-old peace process in tatters, one senior Palestinian figure, the Parliament speaker Ahmed Korei, known as Abu Ala, insisted that Israel must halt all settlement building, accept an international peacekeeping force to protect Palestinians and allow the United Nations a role in the peace process, before talks could be resumed. **********Those are conditions that are anathema to the Israelis and are unlikely to be met."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/29/world/fork-in-arafat-s-road.html": {"writer_name": "Jane Perlez", "pub_date": "2000-12-29", "snippet": "Clinton Adm confronts Yasir Arafat with one of most painful choices of his enduring career; unknown territory of comprehensive peace or familiar role of victim (News analysis); with Pres Clinton leaving office in three weeks, time is of the essenc...", "word_count": 1173, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis; News Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fork in Arafat's Road", "print_headline": "Fork in Arafat's Road", "body_text": " **********The Clinton administration has confronted Yasir Arafat with one of the most painful choices of his enduring career: the unknown territory of a comprehensive peace or the familiar role of victim. **********No one is quite sure which way Mr. Arafat will turn. With President Clinton leaving office in three weeks, time is of the essence, and Mr. Arafat is not known for speedy decisions. **********The White House, Arab leaders and the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, have all tried to steer him toward the peace package, which would give him sovereignty over the Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem and the longed-for Palestinian state. In exchange, Mr. Arafat would be required to sign away one of the fundamental tenets of the Palestinian nationalist movement, the right of refugees to return to what is now Israel. **********In short, Mr. Arafat has been presented with something close to Israel's best offer -- too good an offer, in the eyes of many Israelis. Part of Mr. Arafat's quandary is that he probably understands that there is not likely to be a better deal than this one. **********One question is whether his people  accept or believe that. Mr. Arafat knows that he is likely to face serious repercussions if he forecloses the options of the millions of Palestinian refugees, many of them in refugee camps that are now 50 years old. **********Among others, Mr. Arafat would face the wrath of extremist groups like Hamas, the fury of the refugees themselves and perhaps threats from inside the Palestinian Authority to his own position. **********Mr. Arafat's popularity has steadily eroded over the last five years, mostly because of corruption in the Palestinian Authority and a failed economy, and the Palestinian streets have been awash in violence and rage for the last three months. So  accepting what is perceived as a flawed deal could make his standing  tenuous. **********The Palestinian leader's choice is freighted with other questions that have little to do with the actual merits of the deal, but have plenty to do with its sustainability. **********Israel is in political turmoil over proposed concessions, and there is no guarantee that if Prime Minister Ehud Barak signs an accord before Mr. Clinton leaves office, the deal will survive opposition in the Israeli Parliament. **********Parliament is not in session now,  but members of the opposition Likud Party have started circulating a letter to Mr. Barak listing their objections to the proposals, for which they said they could obtain the signatures of a majority of legislators. **********Nor is there any guarantee that Mr. Barak will win re-election on Feb. 6, even with a peace agreement, or that a deal would survive under his opponent, the hawkish Ariel Sharon. **********Mr. Sharon, who is leading in public opinion polls, has said he opposes the package, which gives sovereignty to the Palestinians over the very holy site he visited in September in a gesture that was followed by the uprising of the last three months. **********But if Mr. Arafat rejects the proposals and refuses to come to Washington to work on the details, he knows that he will make Mr. Barak's defeat, and Mr. Sharon's victory, far more likely. **********And under a Sharon government,  Mr. Arafat could well face more Jewish settlements, more bloodshed and the likelihood that he would not see such a favorable offer again for a long time. **********''Will the Palestinians gain more by having to deal with a flawed program or from the opprobrium of a Sharon government?'' said Rashidi Khalidi, professor of Middle East history at the University of Chicago, summing up Mr. Arafat's quandary. **********Mr. Khalidi suggested that the Palestinian leaders had to wonder  whether they could survive the wrath of their people if they accepted a deal that fell short of popular expectations. **********Negotiators for Mr. Arafat have complained in the last several days that many ''clarifications'' are needed -- up to 26, according to one report -- before they could seriously contemplate the Clinton deal. **********Yet Mr. Arafat, who has made few public comments on the proposals,  probably understands that Israel will not budge on the basics: refusing to have the large majority of refugees return, retaining major settlement blocks in the West Bank, and maintaining a security cordon along the Jordan Valley. **********Arab diplomats said today that there were legitimate questions that Mr. Arafat had about the Clinton proposals for which he needed positive answers. But compared with the broad contours of Mr. Clinton's proposals, these were details, though important ones, they said. **********They centered chiefly on whether the Palestinian state anchored on the West Bank would be a contiguous piece of land or whether it would be cut by roads built by the Israelis to get from one settlement to another. The Palestinians are also concerned about how the neighborhoods of East Jerusalem, which the Clinton plan says will be under Palestinian sovereignty, would be linked. **********If these and other important questions are dealt with by the Americans, then Mr. Arafat should move ahead, an Arab diplomat said today. **********''The Arab side does not want to say 'No,' '' this diplomat said. ''This is a workable solution, unlike Camp David.'' At that summit meeting six months ago, the Israelis expressed total opposition to Palestinian sovereignty over the Temple Mount, which Muslims call the Noble Sanctuary. **********In the end, the Arab diplomat said, Mr. Arafat will never be able to satisfy the Palestinian diaspora. The shape of that part of the deal had been clear for years: that the Palestinians on the inside -- on the West Bank and in Gaza -- would get a state, but those who fled from properties in what is now Israel would have to settle for some form of compensation, and resettlement elsewhere. **********Mr. Arafat, he said, would have to live with the accusation that he had sold out the refugees. **********Despite these difficulties, the diplomat said, Mr. Arafat still has a concrete victory to sell. ''He needs to go out and say: 'I brought you back Jerusalem with full sovereignty, something you never dreamed of,' '' the diplomat said. **********As Mr. Arafat pondered his fateful choice, he maneuvered for time today, calling for a meeting on Monday of a committee of the Arab League. There, he will look for solid support in his decision. **********The negotiators in the Clinton administration, frustrated by Mr. Arafat's slowness, tried to see a silver lining in the proposed gathering. They argued that the moderate Arab leaders have supported the proposal and would continue to shore up Mr. Arafat if the meeting went ahead. **********By Monday, though, the big problem would be the calendar. Mr. Clinton has not set a deadline for receiving formal replies to his proposals. **********But after the middle of next week, there would be little time for the Clinton administration to conduct the arduous negotiations needed to complete a final accord."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/07/business/world-business-briefing-australia-diamond-mine-takeover.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "2000-11-07", "snippet": "Rio Tinto wins its takeover battle for Ashton Mining, giving it full control of Argyle diamond mine, world's largest; when Rio Tinto's sweetened bid of $375 million won approval from Malaysia Mining, which owns 49.7 percent of Ashton, rival bidder...", "word_count": 62, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DIAMOND MINE TAKEOVER", "print_headline": "WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: AUSTRALIA; DIAMOND MINE TAKEOVER", "body_text": " **********Rio Tinto won its takeover battle for Ashton Mining, giving it full control of the Argyle diamond mine, the world's largest.

They hope to counter drugmakers' huge marketing and advertising campaigns directed at doctors and consumers. **********The coalition, Rx Health Value, includes Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Kaiser Permanente and 21 other independent nonprofit managed care companies. Together, they have 83 million members. Other members include General Motors; GTE; U S West; the pharmacy benefits manager PCS Health Systems; several employer-sponsored health care associations; the A.F.L.-C.I.O.; the United Automobile Workers; American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees; American Hospital Foundation; and AARP. **********The new group, whose members have a clear stake in cutting drug costs, plans to move on a number of fronts to try to blunt what it sees as a distortion of the health care system by the long-running marketing success of drugmakers. **********Among other things, the group plans to tell doctors and consumers about independent studies showing which drugs, old and new, are most effective, and will seek to increase the influence of consumers in Washington. **********The pharmaceutical companies spent $13.9 billion to market drugs in 1999, including pitches to doctors and advertising aimed at consumers. That was over 50 percent more than they spent in 1996, before regulators opened the way to a torrent of advertising directed at consumers. Coalition members say that has contributed to a steep rise in drug spending. Fueled by heavily advertised, expensive new products, national spending on prescription drugs has more than doubled since 1992, to an estimated $101 billion last year. **********Pressure is growing to spend even more. Research in biotechnology and the human genome promise a host of new products. And the House voted on Wednesday to expand Medicare to cover prescription drugs, a change that is projected to add billions of dollars annually to spending. **********At many companies that offer generous health coverage, spending on drugs is increasing more than 20 percent annually. The prescription drug costs of insured individuals rose 29 percent annually between 1996 and 1999, researchers at Brandeis University said in a study sponsored by Rx Value Health. **********An organization sponsored by Blue Cross, RX Intelligence, is to begin operating today and will undertake clinical studies seeking to show which new drugs are a clear improvement. The Rx Health coalition plans to combine the findings of Rx Intelligence with analyses of the drugs' cost effectiveness and other issues and report the findings to consumers, employees, health plans and, especially, doctors and nurses who write prescriptions. **********It also plans to use its influence ''to get a consumer perspective in front of Congress and the regulatory agencies,'' said Barry Sloat, director of health care business strategy at Ford Motor and the auto industry's liaison to Rx Health Value. **********It will not be easy. With breakthroughs in biotechnology and genome research, ''expenditures on prescription drugs are going to rise very rapidly,'' said Robert D. Reischauer of the Urban Institute, a nonprofit research center. **********Alan F. Holmer, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association, said consumer advertising was worthwhile because it motivated people to consult doctors, who then found and treated previously undiagnosed problems. He said drug prices were justified because ''it's a very high-risk industry with a long time horizon'' for developing products. This year, makers will spend $26 billion, or 20 percent of revenue, finding new drugs and winning approval for them. **********Drug makers also contend that even expensive drugs save money because they enable many patients to stay out of the hospital. ''Our medicines are the most cost-effective part of our health care system,'' Mr. Holmer said. **********As an example, he said, government studies show that expensive ''clot-buster'' drugs reduce the need for hospital, rehabilitation and nursing home care, saving more than twice the cost of the drug. **********Coalition members contend that advertising does not provide a full picture of both the limitations and the benefits of new drugs. In May, in one of its first public moves, the coalition called on the Food and Drug Administration to tighten controls on television drug advertising, which climbed 70 percent last year, to $1.13 billion, according to IMS Health, a market research company. **********Dr. Jane E. Henney, the F.D.A. commissioner, said the agency was reviewing its advertising policies. **********Veronica Goff, vice president of the Washington Business Group on Health, a group of large employers that supports the coalition, said, ''We want to make sure that balanced, complete information gets out to consumers.'' **********And Dan Wolfson, chief executive of the Alliance of Community Health Plans, which includes Kaiser, and a founder of the new coalition, said: ''Everybody I know over 40 is on a medication. What we don't know is the benefit.'' **********He said Celebrex, a relatively new and expensive pain killer, is a case in point. Last year, Celebrex, part of a new class of genetically engineered drugs, was prescribed for 25 percent of people diagnosed with arthritis. But Celebrex is intended for patients who have intestinal bleeding when they use other arthritis treatments. ''We would think only 3 to 5 percent would be getting it,'' he said. **********Largely because of consumer advertising, ''we perceive substantial overuse, misuse and underuse'' of drugs, Mr. Sloat of Ford said. **********''If the drug industry is going to grow at 20 percent while everything else is growing at 3 percent, this is going to be a huge issue for national policy,'' he added. **********At DaimlerChrysler, for example, drug costs will be close to $300 million this year, almost as much as Chrysler's entire cost for employee health benefits in the early 1980's and a 17 percent increase over 1999, said Walter Maher, vice president for public policy. **********The rapid increase in spending on drugs since drug companies began advertising has reached a point where it is increasingly recognized as causing pain throughout the health care system. ''Everyone is feeling it,'' said John Rother, public policy director of AARP. ''Everyone has a stake in the cost of drugs.'' **********Managed care companies have shifted a growing share of drug costs to patients by raising deductibles and co-payments, but they still face double-digit cost increases, which they pass along in higher premiums. **********Drug spending is so high that even in the current tight labor market, unions are increasingly contending with unwanted choices when they negotiate new contracts: less money for health care or less for wages and retirement benefits. ''This is a huge issue,'' said Gerry Shea, an assistant to the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. **********In recent years, the drug industry, which spends about $75 million annually to lobby members of Congress and federal regulatory agencies, has usually had its way in Washington. Drug companies have received support from business groups like the National Association of Manufacturers. Drug costs are ''a delicate issue for the N.A.M., because the pharmaceutical manufacturers are members,'' Mr. Maher said. **********In addition, using a variety of special-interest organizations like Citizens for Better Medicare, the drugmakers have fended off attempts to pass laws or rules that might lead to lower prices. In 1997, the industry received permission from the F.D.A. to increase advertising to consumers. Drugmakers also won the right to help pay for administrative reviews of new drugs. Approvals rose by more than 50 percent in the 1990's, Mr. Holmer said. **********Rx Health is seeking to marshal ''enough heft so it can speak with an equal voice to the pharmaceutical industry,'' said John Golenski, executive director of the new group and a longtime consultant to Kaiser Permanente in California. **********''Research is producing new and better drugs,'' said Alain Enthoven, a health care expert and a professor of management at Stanford University. But, he added, ''high-quality, independent cost-benefit analysis is needed to determine if they are all worth the cost.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/30/business/worldbusiness/IHT-thinking-ahead-commentary-after-the-china-vote-a.html": {"writer_name": "Reginald Dale", "pub_date": "2000-05-30", "snippet": "President Bill Clinton was not the only one gratified by last week's congressional vote to normalize U.S. trade relations with China, on which he had staked so much political capital.

Passage of the hard-fought measure was also greeted with relief by everyone who supports an open world trading system. **********The vote to end the annual review of China's status, now that it is about to join the World Trade Organization, marked a serious setback for the forces that staged last year's protests against the WTO in Seattle \u2014 a disparate coalition of labor unions and others seeking to put new restraints on trade. **********If those forces had succeeded in thwarting Mr. Clinton, the world would have received the disturbing message that a U.S. president could no longer push a major trade-expanding measure through Congress, despite a full-court press. **********Even so, the world trading system still faces plenty of other problems, many of which were discussed at a small informal conference at this former monastery near Lisbon last weekend. **********Not least of the difficulties will be coping with China's actual entry into the WTO, probably this autumn. Although China has pledged to obey the organization's market-opening rules, many expect Beijing's differing interpretation or neglect of those rules to cause a large number of legal disputes. **********China's presence will also complicate plans for a new round of multilateral trade negotiations as proposed by the European Union. China, which is expected to seek a role as leader of the developing countries in any new talks, would probably challenge politically sensitive U.S. trade practices such as anti-dumping measures and barriers to textile imports. **********The consensus in the discussions here, however, was that a new round was unlikely to begin soon, and that that may be no bad thing. Although Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S. trade **********representative, is fighting hard for a new round to restore her tattered reputation after the disastrous Seattle meeting, most other U.S. officials are far from enthusiastic. **********Realistically, there is little chance that any major new trade initiative will be taken before a new administration is installed in Washington next year. The China vote has probably exhausted Mr. Clinton's political capital on trade issues for the rest of his term. **********David Aaron, until recently undersecretary of commerce for international trade, argued at the conference here that the EU had only proposed a wide-ranging round of negotiations as a \"tactical gambit\" to take the heat off its Common Agricultural Policy, currently under discussion in a much less comprehensive set of talks in Geneva. **********Rather than seeking a full-scale new round, the world's main trading nations should concentrate in these narrower talks on issues left over from the previous round of trade talks, the Uruguay Round, which also are covering trade in services, Mr. Aaron said. But there is little chance of early progress in these talks, either. **********The way ahead for any kind of trade negotiation is getting harder as the WTO expands to include nearly 140 countries, the developing countries acquire a stronger voice, the range of issues grows wider and the work of trade negotiators becomes more highly publicized and more controversial. **********Among the thorniest issues are calls to include labor standards in future trade agreements \u2014 bitterly opposed by many developing countries \u2014 the case for which was put here in a remarkably conciliatory manner by Emilio Gabaglio, a European labor leader. **********He said European unions, unlike their American counterparts, welcomed freer trade and wanted rich nations to import more from poorer countries. As the labor-standards issue is unlikely to go away, it is good to know that at least some labor leaders want to introduce it in a way that causes minimal damage to trade. **********Meanwhile, the EU and the United States must keep working to prevent their bilateral trade conflicts from endangering the system. That means the EU complying with WTO rulings and both sides showing restraint in starting new disputes. **********Despite the China vote, Congress can still turn nasty, as demonstrated by a recent move to toughen existing trade sanctions against the EU \u2014 a vindictive and counterproductive act that shows it is still too early to celebrate a universal outbreak of common sense on trade in Washington. **********E-mail address: thinkahead@iht.com"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/02/business/economic-view-a-revolution-built-in-mr-ford-s-factory.html": {"writer_name": "Tom Redburn", "pub_date": "2000-01-02", "snippet": "Tom Redburn (Economic View) article credits Henry Ford and his Model T with helping transform economic inequality that existed before World War I into an era in which workers themselves came to own much of means of production; says Ford not only p...", "word_count": 859, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Revolution Built In Mr. Ford's Factory", "print_headline": "ECONOMIC VIEW; A Revolution Built In Mr. Ford's Factory", "body_text": " **********IN 1942, in the face of the bloody tyrannies and colonial empires that covered nearly the entire globe, Aaron Copland composed ''Fanfare for the Common Man.'' How defiant, even naive, it looked then. How prescient it looks now. **********For all the real power that political rulers, corporate masters and technological forces have over our lives, the century just ended (I know, I know: supposedly another year to go) was shaped more than anything else by the passions and desires of millions upon millions of ordinary men and women. **********Think how unprecedented that was. Before 1900, the middle class in Europe and the United States was a relative drop in the bucket -- mostly small merchants and a sprinkling of professionals; it scarcely existed elsewhere in the world. Few industrial workers earned a living wage. The largest group of people, even in the most advanced countries, still worked the land from dawn to dusk. Domestic servants of the rich were another big part of the work force. **********Aristocracies and caste systems were the order of the day. Genuinely representative democracy existed in only a handful of countries, and even in those, all women and many men, including nearly all blacks in the United States, were barred from voting. **********For all our worries today about economic inequality, wealth in the era before World War I was really concentrated. ''In the half-century before 1914, most capital flows traced back to a few thousand wealthy European families,'' David Hale, chief global economist for Zurich Financial Services in Chicago, recently wrote. ''Today they are driven by fund managers allocating the savings of hundreds of millions of people in pension funds and mutual funds.'' **********WHAT brought about this revolutionary change, in which workers themselves came to own much of the means of production? Many things, of course, including the spread of democratic practices and public education. And one product above all others powered this transformation: the automobile, built on a moving assembly line. **********At the turn of the century, the horseless carriage was widely derided: contemporary observers said it was simply a plaything for the rich, a machine to impress the ladies. But in 1908, Henry Ford introduced the Model T. And in paying his workers what was then the princely wage of $5 a day to make a car selling for $850, he helped create a consumer mass market at the same time he was offering something to satisfy it. The combination released a torrent. **********''The mass-production automobile broke all the traditional boundaries that held people in place,'' said Daniel Yergin, president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates and author of ''The Prize,'' a Pulitzer Prize-winning history of the oil industry. ''Everywhere you go, it represents independence, mobility, freedom.'' **********So, before we bury the 20th century, let us praise its essential icon. For despite the environmental ills that cars have brought in their exhaust trail, nothing else so represents the empowerment of ordinary people. **********Mr. Ford knew exactly what he was after. ''I will build a motor car for the great multitude,'' he said, ''constructed of the best materials, by the best men to be hired, after the simplest designs that modern engineering can devise.'' It would be, he added, ''so low in price that no man making a good salary will be unable to own one and enjoy with his family the blessings of hours of pleasure in God's great open spaces.'' **********Well, maybe he miscalculated a bit on the open spaces. Our bottomless demand to own and drive automobiles has transformed the landscape almost beyond recognition, inexorably producing the highways we crowd onto and the suburbs where most of us in America now choose to live. **********For all the attention devoted to computers and the Internet, the auto industry still defies comparison. Roughly 7.5 million people, about 6 percent of the American work force, are involved in building, selling or repairing cars and light trucks, almost four times as many as are employed by all electronics and computer makers. Three of the four largest companies in the nation by sales -- General Motors, Ford and Exxon Mobil -- make cars or fuel them. In 1999, Americans bought a record 17 million of the vehicles. **********The phenomenon is global; there are more than 550 million cars around the world. Americans own the most -- one car for every 1.7 residents -- but even in crowded Japan there is one for every 2.1 people, and there is one for every 5.3 Britons. **********Do all these automobiles represent too much of a good thing? Perhaps, but good luck persuading people to stop buying them. No matter what is done in the form of taxes or regulation to discourage their use, as soon as incomes in any nation reach a certain level -- on average, around $6,000 a person -- sales of cars invariably skyrocket. **********In the United States, higher gasoline taxes would at least encourage the production of more efficient autos and slightly restrain driving. New technologies, like electric/internal-combustion hybrids and, eventually, fuel cells, should help further reduce the air pollution they cause. But don't expect more. **********As long as democracy and free markets persist, personal transportation in some form will be ubiquitous. Why?

Listening to a CD while you jogged on a treadmill was simply unthinkable. **********Each new generation of portable CD players arrived with promises of skip-free play. Broken promises. **********But no more. **********Just when CD player technology appeared to be badly outclassed by ever-smaller, relatively skip-proof mini-disc and MP3 players, designers of portable CD players began striking back with better technologies. **********A shining example -- literally, in its polished aluminum case -- of how portable CD players have been forced to reinvent themselves is the newly released antiskip Walkman D-EJ915 from Sony Electronics. This new model sells for $199.95, but other antiskip Sony players with fewer features, like the D-EJ611, start at $80. **********The new Walkman is handsome and almost impossibly sleek, barely larger than a five-inch CD. It is extremely light, and its rechargeable nickel-hydride batteries have a life of 62 hours of continuous playback -- more than three times that of most other players. **********Portable CD players started to appear in 1984, two years after Sony and Philips Electronics jointly introduced CD technology. What makes the new Sony players stand out in an increasingly crowded field of portable CD players is their capacity to play music skip-free in almost any setting and circumstance. **********At Sony's request, during a demonstration, I slapped the machine as if it were a tambourine while it played a CD. The result? Mary J. Blige belted out her songs without so much as a hiccup. **********It was not surprising, then, that the results were identical under more common circumstances. I walked with the player, jogged with it and took it on a crowded subway car and a bus. Both player and listener were frequently bumped, crushed and jostled, but the music played without the slightest interruption. **********A combination of technologies, grouped under the rubric G-Protection, kept the playback steady and true. The new Sony player uses a memory buffer. Long a part of high-end CD players, the buffer stores data from a spinning CD on a chip, then rapidly dips into this electronic music reservoir to cover gaps in the playback that are created when the CD is suddenly moved or bumped. **********But the buffer isn't what makes these new models different. The first line of defense in the new antiskip players are two technologies called quick focus search and fine access. **********Quick focus permits the CD player to almost instantaneously regain the focus of its laser pickup when it is jarred. Sony officials say that the refocusing occurs in less than 0.3 seconds. Fine access quickly resets the laser pickup if it is bumped so it can resume reading the CD's digital music data without interruption. **********The new Sony CD player can also increase the speed of the CD's rotation when it senses a bumpy ride. By spinning the disk faster, the player can more rapidly extract data from the disc to fill the player's memory buffer faster as that is needed. **********Sony is hardly alone in making portable players live up to their name. Late last year, Aiwa and Panasonic introduced much-improved portable CD players that were just about as skip-proof as the Sony G-Protection models. And both companies say this year they will release more refined antiskip players. **********This month, Aiwa America plans to introduce a CD player for joggers that will feature a 48-second memory buffer -- eight seconds more than on current models -- to help it overcome skips. And like the Sony players, Aiwa antiskip models will include technologies that permit the player to quickly adjust the laser pickup vertically and horizontally. **********Aiwa says its Electronic Anti-Shock System, or E.A.S.S. Plus, does not reduce battery life. Continuous playback on the current $110 Cross Trainer XP-SP90 is 14 hours with two AA batteries. The company says the new XP-SP911 will extend battery life to 20 hours. **********The XP-SP90 is not as elegant as the Sony player, but its rugged exterior is well suited for use by people engaged in athletic and outdoor activities. It also packs a big sound, to my ears significantly louder than the Sony player's. **********Panasonic's new antiskip player, the Shock Wave Metal SL-SW870, priced at $199.95, is also designed to withstand rugged outdoor use. It has a 40-second memory buffer and uses what Panasonic calls Anti-Shock Memory II, a collection of technologies that includes a memory buffer with variable speed control for the CD, error correction chips to quickly retrack the player's laser pickup and advanced optics to rapidly refocus the laser when it is knocked out of its ideal vertical position. **********The Shock Wave Metal player provides 25 hours of playback on two AA batteries, and it lives up to its name with a feature that trembles for youthful attention: its headphones have a vibration unit. When a button on the player is pressed, bass signals below 50 hertz are felt as mild vibration. Officially, the feature is known as the Virtual Motion Sound System, but as Reid Sullivan, a Panasonic executive, said, ''We like to call it the brain shaker.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/07/business/industry-view-smart-appliances-may-be-offering-some-features-that-now-seem-silly.html": {"writer_name": "Alice Hill", "pub_date": "2000-02-07", "snippet": "Industry View column by Alice Hill notes recent Housewares 2000 trade show introduced new generation of so-called smart appliances, including microwave oven that can go online to download recipes and WebPad that can be clipped to front of family r...", "word_count": 1048, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Industry View; Smart appliances may be offering some features that now seem silly, but every technology has to start someplace.", "print_headline": "Industry View; Smart appliances may be offering some features that now seem silly, but every technology has to start someplace.", "body_text": " **********JUST how smart are the designers of ''smart'' appliances, when it comes to meeting the needs of modern people like me -- technically inclined, but harboring no dreams of connecting their coffee pots to the Internet or having live stock quotes scroll across a liquid crystal display on their refrigerators? **********Whether we like it or not, home appliances are the latest to fall under the ''just add Internet'' spell. And if manufacturers have their way, the appliances heading your way later this year will make today's automatic ice maker and microwave oven as last-century as a wringer washing machine. **********At the recent Housewares 2000 trade show in Chicago, ''smart'' was the watchword, as a new generation of thinking appliances was introduced. **********There was an intelligent microwave oven from Sharp that can go online, download a recipe and program itself to cook the meal at just the right temperature. General Electric demonstrated a so-called WebPad that can be clipped to the front of the family refrigerator and serve as an electronic memo board for scheduling activities, ordering products or retrieving and storing recipes. And Sunbeam announced an entire line of smart products under a new and separate company called Thalia Products (Thalia being an acronym for ''thinking and linking intelligent appliances''). **********This coming generation of smart machines is not limited to the kitchen. Electrolux is working on a robotic vacuum that can rove over any floor plan without assistance, and on an automatic mower that will someday mow the lawn while the owner lounges in a nearby hammock. An inventor named Albert Montague has on the drawing board a smarter auto alarm that is capable of distinguishing between a car accidentally tapping your bumper and a thief jimmying the door lock, saving the neighborhood-rousing alarm for serious break-in attempts only. **********As exciting and futuristic as it all may seem, though, these marvels will almost certainly fight an uphill battle for consumer acceptance. For every intelligent dishwasher coming off the assembly line, there is a blinking videocassette recorder clock to remind us that the consumer may have little time or patience for learning to operate new devices -- whether microwave ovens that connect to the Net or refrigerators that automatically order milk. **********''It was possible to add sophisticated features quite some time back,'' said Dr. Micheal Parten, a professor of electrical engineering at Texas Tech and specialist in the field of appliance design. ''But think about digital watches. You had every kind of feature, but who used them? People just wanted to know what time it was. There was even a smart tennis shoe not long ago. It could calculate your heart rate and the distance  you ran, but nobody cared. Most people could do those things easily in some other way. For a product to succeed, it has to offer real value to the consumer. It must be useful and solve a problem.'' **********When asked to explain why a refrigerator would need Internet access, even some of the industry experts driving this push toward smarter, more high-technology appliances had to laugh and admit that most of these early products are more dazzling than useful. One of them was Jerry Fiddler, chairman and co-founder of Wind River Systems, which provides the operating software for the the tiny processors embedded in the majority of these new devices. **********The point, Mr. Fiddler said, is not whether this first round of smarter appliances will succeed, but that this is the start of a new generation of machines. **********''I can't imagine that a microwave connecting to the Internet will ever be useful, but we're at Generation Zero right now,'' he said. ''There are combinations that are yet to be discovered. But we're going to see a lot of interesting devices by Christmas, and even more right after that.'' **********According to Mr. Fiddler, a rapid evolution for machines that previously progressed at glacial speed is now possible, thanks to advances in embedded chips and software. ''The technology is there now,'' he said. ''The cost is incredibly low and the added connectivity means you can connect things to the real world. The problem is figuring out what is useful and what will make the consumer say, 'This will make my life better.' '' **********Of course, some manufacturers feel that they are already there. ''I don't think anyone would imagine a meaningful connection between a smoke alarm and an alarm clock, but that's how we see things getting smarter,'' said Jon Hamann, president and chief executive of Thalia Products. **********Thalia's offerings, expected to reach stores late this year, are based on what the company calls intelligent linking technology. Using this technology, a Thalia smoke alarm can ring a bedside alarm clock in case of a fire. A Thalia coffee pot can set its time from the same alarm clock and even send a message that will flash on the clock's display screen that you forgot to add water. The goal with each of the products is simplicity. You plug in the coffee maker, and it sets its own clock. **********''The average home has over 23 appliances,'' Mr. Hamann said. ''That is a lot of stuff to manage. If overcoming physical burdens was key in the 20th century, we think that overcoming mental burdens is key to the 21st century. We feel that most consumers want basic functions, fewer buttons, lower costs and simple benefits.'' **********Few would disagree that everyday machines should become smarter and make  lives easier. But not every machine will be made smarter with such noble intentions. No wonder that when Coke announced a new smart vending machine that would raise its own prices when the temperature rose, consumers reacted with outrage. **********Marvin Minsky, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology known for his work spanning electrical engineering, computer science, new media and artificial intelligence, takes an ironist's view to consumer hesitancy to embrace smart appliances. **********''Perhaps it is good that new ideas are unwelcome to almost everyone,'' Dr. Minsky said. ''That's partly why we have semistable cultures.'' **********If Dr. Minsky is right, the smart machine may be a long time coming, no matter how many rollouts and trade shows there are. Until then, we can always get Cokes from our own refrigerators and freshly made ice. No one, not even the refrigerator, will be the wiser."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/13/technology/news-watch-two-companies-agree-to-send-speedy-rebates-to-customers.html": {"writer_name": "Catherine Greenman", "pub_date": "2000-01-13", "snippet": "Federal Trade Commission, after fielding many consumer complaints about rebates that are slow to arrive, reaches accord with computer product companies Memtek Products and Umax Technologies to provide more timely rebates (M)", "word_count": 284, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Two Companies Agree to Send Speedy Rebates to Customers", "print_headline": "NEWS WATCH; Two Companies Agree to Send Speedy Rebates to Customers", "body_text": " **********After fielding numerous consumer complaints about rebates that are slow to arrive, the Federal Trade Commission has reached agreements with two computer product companies under which they will provide more timely rebates to customers. **********The agreements state that the companies, Memtek Products, which sells the Memorex brand of computer disks, and Umax Technologies, a distributor of PC's, scanners and digital cameras, must provide checks to their customers within the times they specify in writing.

Having promised that all Examiner employees can work at The Chronicle, it must consolidate two newsrooms. It must select a publisher and a top editor and it must decide what battles to fight in a several-front war. **********There will be a new and different Examiner. Ted Fang, the new owner, is free to remake it in the image of his family's other publications as an emphatically local community paper that wears its political agenda on its sleeve.

Harris, the publisher of The San Jose Mercury News, (circulation 289,000) The Chronicle's Silicon Valley competitor to the south, has taken the battle for readers into San Francisco, where he now has 2,000 readers. Mr. Harris has added 200 newspaper boxes and 70 retail sales outlets -- all the better to sell the new edition, which drops ''San Jose'' from its name plate. **********Should The Chronicle (circulation 465,000) respond in kind, expanding its coverage of Santa Clara County, and of the Silicon Valley business empires that are the showpiece of the national economy? **********National newspapers like USA Today, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal are a growing presence. Metro, the Swedish-based company that brought its free tabloid product to commuters on Philadelphia's bus and subway system earlier this year, is hoping to start up in San Francisco. Should The Chronicle offer more news digests, like Metro, or its own national and international coverage? **********San Francisco is going to be more competitive than it has ever been, said William Dean Singleton, chief executive of the MediaNews Group, whose papers in Alameda County are an irritant on the Chronicle's southeast flank. P. Anthony Ridder, chief executive of Knight Ridder, which owns The Mercury News as well as The Contra Costa Times, east of San Francisco Bay, suggests dryly that readers would be well served by the competition and better served if they bought his newspapers. **********Some journalists in The Chronicle's old newsroom are eager to compete regionally. With enough invested by Hearst, they think The Chronicle can rise to heights that have eluded it. Ken Conner, an assistant city editor, welcomes competition with The Mercury News. ''We are serious,'' he said. ''They are serious. It would be a great newspaper war.'' **********But decisions usually require planning, and while the antitrust case brought by Clinton Reilly, a multimillionaire real estate executive, remained undecided, Hearst forbade Examiner and Chronicle executives from talking about the future. Now they can talk. But who will lead the discussions? The career of Timothy O. White, the Examiner's onetime publisher is in limbo. Testimony during the antitrust trial disclosed that Mr. White had suggested ''horse-trading'' with Mayor Willie L. Brown Jr. (I support your campaign, you stop opposing Hearst's plans.) **********Perhaps Steven Falk, the president of the San Francisco Newspaper Agency, the business arm of both papers, which have had a joint operating agreement since 1965. Perhaps someone like W. Lawrence Walker Jr., a decade ago the No. 2 executive at the San Francisco agency, and now a seasoned publisher at Hearst's San Antonio Express-News with practical experience in shutting down a joint operating agreement. **********It is unclear who will be picked first, an editor or a publisher. It is also unclear if candidates include people at other newspapers. But soon, someone has to decide if the home-delivery schedule needs to be moved up, to compete with The Mercury News. Someone will have to tell the reporters what jobs they will be doing. If only one television critic is needed, what happens to the second one? How many metropolitan columnists should there be? **********For Gerald J. Roberts, The Chronicle's current managing editor, the top three priorities are creating a robust Sunday paper, expanding coverage of local news, and coverage of collegiate and high school sports. **********For Phil Bronstein, The Examiner's executive editor, city and suburban news coverage are crucial, but the most-pressing priority is business coverage (''this is the center of a universe, if not the universe, in technology.'') Both men want some foreign coverage; both mention Asia and Mexico. **********For Jay Harris, at The Mercury News, everything matters.

But recent polls have shown Britons are opposed to the euro by a ratio of 2 to 1, and few believe Mr. Blair will risk a referendum soon. **********Prime Minister Goran Persson of Sweden said the Danish vote would have an initial impact on public opinion in Sweden, but he expressed confidence that the impact would fade and said it would not affect the timing of a Swedish referendum, which is not expected until after the country's next parliamentary election in September 2002."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/17/business/dividend-meetings-241474.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-07-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 270, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dividend Meetings", "print_headline": "Dividend Meetings", "body_text": " **********A partial list for this week. **********MONDAY **********Central Vt Pub Svc Corp **********Johnson & Johnson **********Total Sys Svcs Inc **********TUESDAY **********Black Hills Corp **********Cavalier Homes Inc **********CCB Finl Corp **********Charter One Finl Inc **********Clorox Co **********Eastman Kodak Co **********FirstEnergy Corp **********Fleming Cos Inc **********Health Care REIT Inc **********IMS Health Inc **********M & T Bk Corp **********Manitowoc Inc **********Public Svc **********Enterprise Group **********Thornburg Mtg Inc **********(was Thornburg Asset Corp) **********Washington Mut Inc **********WEDNESDAY **********Apartment Invt & Mgmt Co **********Ashland Inc **********California Wtr Svc Group **********Chittenden Corp **********Cinergy Corp **********Dana Corp **********Detroit Diesel Corp **********Equitable Res Inc **********Federal Mogul Corp **********Heller Finl Inc **********Minnesota Pwr Inc **********Omega Healthcare Invs Inc **********PG&E Corp **********RPM Inc Ohio **********TCW Conv Secs Fd **********Teco Energy Inc **********Vastar Res Inc **********Western Res Inc **********THURSDAY **********Alltel Corp **********AptarGroup Inc **********Black & Decker Corp **********Burlington Northn Sante Fe **********Cabot Oil & Gas Corp **********Capital One Finl Corp **********Coca-Cola Co **********Cooper Tire & Rubr Co **********Golden West Finl Corp Del **********Hartford Finl Svcs Group Inc **********Idacorp Inc **********Keycorp New **********Lakehead Pipe Line Partners **********Pepsico Inc **********PPG Inds Inc **********Simon Ppty Group Inc New **********Standard Register Co **********Torchmark Corp **********Union Planters Corp **********FRIDAY **********Borg Warner Inc (was Borg Warner Automotive Inc) **********Cleco Corp New **********Corning Inc **********Ikon Office Solutions Inc **********MassMutual Corporate Invs Inc"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/20/business/company-news-norfolk-southern-to-cut-5-of-hourly-work-force.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "2000-12-20", "snippet": "Norfolk Southern Corp will eliminate more than 1,300 union jobs, or 5 percent of its hourly work force, and is considering laying off managers for first time in 15 years (S)", "word_count": 100, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NORFOLK SOUTHERN TO CUT 5% OF HOURLY WORK FORCE", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; NORFOLK SOUTHERN TO CUT 5% OF HOURLY WORK FORCE", "body_text": " **********The Norfolk Southern Corporation said yesterday that it would eliminate more than 1,300 union jobs, or 5 percent of its hourly work force, and was considering laying off managers for the first time in 15 years.

''Work,'' she says simply, a helpless smile spreading across her broad face. ''Work, that is why I came. In Bulgaria, there was no way to make money.'' **********Prostitution is an old trade but not an honored one, so Pavlika prefers not to give her family name. At the age of 21, she has plenty of company. Dubi now forms the center of a five-mile sex strip leading to the border where bars have names like ''Libido'' or ''Kiss'' or ''Alibi'' and young women loiter on every corner. **********About 70 percent of the prostitutes are foreign, most of them from Bulgaria, Belarus, Ukraine and Russia, said Vladimir Kriz, the Dubi police chief. He said several hundred women cater to ''sex tourism'' from Germany -- the ugly face of the economic divide that scars the land where the cold war died. Many of the women end up here because it is easier and cheaper to get a Czech visa than one to a European Union country. **********Average wages are $110 a month in Russia, three times that in the Czech Republic, more than fifteen times that in the European Union. No wonder a tide of more than one million migrants, a growing number of them women, is washing up each year on the European Union's borders and within them. **********Communism put women to work; post-cold-war capitalism does not necessarily do so. More than 60 percent of Russia's unemployed are women. A Russian girl called Luda, in a bar in southern Spain, put the West's lure simply: ''One-zero-zero-zero,'' she said laughing, ''instead of one-zero-zero'' -- the chance to earn $1,000 a month instead of $100. **********But the laughter can be short-lived, promised money illusory and the human cost high. Scratch the surface in the Dubi area and a world of violence, xenophobia, disease and misery is revealed. **********At the orphanage in nearby Teplice, Jirina Rajtrova, brisk in white uniform, points to three babies in a large bed and says two of them, Adam and Lucia, were born to local prostitutes. Of the 55 infants under her care, half are children of prostitutes. ''You see,'' she said, ''There are regular clients for pregnant women.'' Mr. Kriz, the police chief, said he last saw ''some pregnant girls working'' several months ago. **********As for child prostitution, Jiri Voralek, the chief of police in nearby Usti, says nine pimps are being prosecuted in three cases this year involving 12 children. ''The youngest was 9,'' he said. **********Those are extreme cases. But, generally, moral codes are loosening in a Western European society that is ever more mobile and bereft of the old constraints that church, community and steady jobs provided. Wealth is widespread, but so is alienation; sex has been commercialized like everything else. Fast money is in; so is fast sex. **********Central and Eastern Europe are  far poorer, their once sealed borders now open, their sense of what Bernd Burgfeldt, a Berlin police officer, called the ''Golden West'' still full of illusions, their young women liberated but often idle -- and desperate. **********For the sex trade, the balance of supply and demand could scarcely be better. Women have been coming to this border town for several years, and the influx shows no sign of abating. ''Between the two parts of Europe, the business of trafficking for sexual exploitation is booming,'' said Bjorn Clarberg, director of the ''Illegal Immigration and Human Beings Group'' at the European Union's joint police force, Europol. ''It's an industry now worth several billion dollars a year.'' **********Irene Freudenschuss-Reichl, an Austrian activist working to curb that business, estimates that half a million women from Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union are being shipped abroad each year. **********At Frankfurt an der Oder, on the German-Polish border, Mirko Heinke, a senior border guard official, said about 60 percent of the 681 people apprehended so far this year were women, with the largest numbers from Russia, Ukraine and Moldova. In Berlin, Mr. Burgfeldt put the number of prostitutes in the city at close to 7,000, ''most of them from Eastern Europe, women who have poured in since the fall of the wall.'' **********Some move westward without illusions, convinced, however reluctantly, that prostitution for a wealthier clientele is the only way to feed their families and fashion a future. Others come deluded, lured into thinking that they will work as babysitters or barmaids, forced into unpayable debt, deprived of all freedom in the end. **********Pavlika, the Bulgarian prostitute, saw no alternative to her current work on the E-55 highway. Her parents are dead, killed in a car crash when she was 16 and still at school. She took a succession of odd jobs, but they were insufficient to support her 10-year-old sister. Hardship. Dead ends. Vague dreams of ''getting married and maybe living in Germany.'' **********She stops talking, abruptly, says she has to work. The going rate is about $35 for 30 minutes, or about half the price over the border in Germany. Hence the steady stream of German cars. **********Pavlika takes a wad of notes out of a bag. She hands them to her pimp. Like others around here, he has a  look: track suit, Adidas sneakers, gold chain, sleeves short enough to reveal the bulge of his muscles. **********Leona, 19, works in the nearby Bihac bar, an upscale brothel owned by Bosnian immigrants. She is a Ukrainian girl from Uzhgorod; she seems desperate, to judge by whispered confidences. Unlike Pavlika, she is in the second category of women, those deceived, trafficked and ultimately trapped. **********She came westward believing that she would work as ''a gardener or some normal work.'' But upon arrival this summer her passport was taken. She was told she had been ''sold'' to the bar where she now works. She has no money, she says. Her gaze is vacant. **********''Money, money, money, money,'' says Natasha from Brest, Belarus, who is sitting next to her. ''There is none for young women in Belarus. There is none in Ukraine. We are here because we can get a Czech visa for $25. A German one is much more difficult, much more expensive.'' **********But many women do get into Germany, some illegally, some with three-month tourist visas arranged by the gangs that bring them. Barbara Eritt, a social worker, says about 1,000 women a year are coming to Berlin from countries further east to work temporarily as prostitutes. She tries to help the casualties. **********Their stories tend to resemble one another. The women may be teachers or farm laborers or unemployed, ages 18 to 30. Often they have one or two children to support. They receive an offer of temporary work and good earnings in the West. Even an au pair in Berlin may earn several times the wage of a teacher in Kiev. **********Travel and visas are arranged for  $800 to $1,000 -- the women's debt to the gangs that organize their transportation and work. After arrival, passports and any money are taken and the women are deposited, often in groups of four or more, in small, guarded apartments. Then they are told what their real job is to be. **********The Berlin tabloid newspaper, BZ, advertises them daily: ''The best from Moscow,'' ''Sweet, fresh Poles,'' ''New! Ukrainian Pearls.'' Some are taken to work in clubs or brothels; others are driven to clients' homes. **********The average rate in brothels is about $75 a half-hour, but no more than a tenth of that reaches the women's pockets. The women have to buy food and pay rent from their earnings, and so the debts mount. **********''The women are terrorized,'' said Ms. Eritt, who has helped about 30 of them in the last two years. ''They are often unable to pay off their debts. And they are paralyzed, afraid to go the police, terrified the gangs will do something to a member of their family back home if they try to escape.'' **********Prostitution is not illegal in Germany, if confined to designated urban areas. But trafficking in women, and their exploitation, is illegal; so, too, is working with a tourist visa or with none at all. Mr. Burgfeldt, the police officer, said he had 20 staff members fighting prostitution rackets, with limited success. **********The trade in women from the East has spread throughout Europe and is increasingly well organized. The Russian-German and Ukrainian-German mafias that dominate the business are an outgrowth of the long Soviet presence in East Germany. Their networks are old, slick, flexible and elusive. Everywhere, women are reluctant to testify because they are afraid; without them convictions are almost impossible to get. **********''If they are going to testify, these women need witness protection, new names, new passports, assurances they can remain in Germany,'' said Cornelia Buhrle, an expert on illegal immigration. ''But German authorities will not provide this. And the mafias are often much more sophisticated than the police or the border police.'' **********For Dr. Hana Duchkova, an expert on sexually transmitted diseases at Usti Hospital, the collapse of Communism and the order it imposed have been a ''recipe for many problems.'' Foreigners have no medical records, and spread disease. Cases of syphilis at the hospital are up to 134 so far this year from 59 in 1999, she said, heaping blame on foreigners and a large Gypsy population she described in disparaging terms. **********One young Gypsy woman on the highway said she was 19 and had been put to work at age 15 by her family. On a good day, she could make about $150. With a tattoo of a rose on her upper arm and a ravaged look in her big brown eyes, she seemed a waif broken before she could live. **********Under the former Communist government, Gypsies had jobs, however menial, and overt racism was repressed, although a contentious program involving paid sterilization also existed. The women here from Belarus, Bulgaria, Russia and elsewhere would also have had jobs. **********''Poverty was not the same in Communist societies,'' said Mr. Burgfeldt of the Berlin police. ''What we are facing now is people moving because of the poverty they face.'' **********Bara Rempertova, 26, who is Czech, sells her body voluntarily on the highway. At least, it is ''voluntary'' work in the sense that it is the only work she has been able to find that allows her to make what she called ''a reasonable living.'' After six years, she plans to stop next year. **********''I met a German here who is now my stable boyfriend and he wants to marry me,'' she explained. ''He understands why I have to do this. If things work out, I plan to go and live with him in Germany.'' **********CROSSING BORDERS **********This article is one in a series about how migration is changing Europe.

''We just didn't think it would include us.'' **********Toysmart, a unit of Walt Disney based in Waltham, Mass., was one of three Internet retailers to cry uncle last week.

''He offered me $25 million last year, and I turned him down.'' **********Mr. Lord said he had rejected the deal because he believed at the time that he had a better offer on the table -- an investment of roughly $45 million from Disney, which included $20 million in cash and the rest in advertising across Disney's media properties. **********In that deal, which was announced in August, Disney secured a controlling interest in Toysmart. In turn, Toysmart got an enthusiastic supporter in Chuck Davis, who was then the president of e-commerce for the Buena Vista Internet Group, the unit that oversees Disney's Internet properties. **********More than anything else, Mr. Lord said, the Disney alignment caused Toysmart's demise. ''They're a great company,'' he said. ''It just operates on a different timetable. And when time is running out, you don't want to operate on a slow timetable.'' **********Practically speaking, time ran out on Toysmart at the end of last year, when the stock market began to flee Internet retailers en masse, before Mr. Lord could take Toysmart public. Toysmart had spent $20 million on holiday marketing, and with the capital markets closed, the company's prospects dimmed. **********Because Disney works more slowly than venture capitalists, Mr. Lord said, ''the deal cost us four months.'' And with that time, he said, the company might have been able to go public before the window for stock offerings in e-tailers slammed shut. **********Disney's initial ardor for Toysmart had meanwhile faded after Mr. Davis left Buena Vista late last year for another Internet company. Then, two months ago, Disney announced that its Internet focus had shifted from commerce to entertainment and leisure. **********''We certainly knew it wasn't good for us,'' Mr. Lord said. **********''If corporations call me now to come lead their dot-com, I'll think about what would happen if, two years down the road, the strategy changed,'' he said. ''Or if it takes six months to fund instead of three. It's all about time. Time, time, time.'' **********For Boo, time was one of many enemies. The European fashion e-tailer had ambitious plans to sell luxury sportswear brands in 18 nations through one of the most technologically sophisticated Web sites available in e-commerce. And it raised about $135 million for the effort. **********But when the Boo.com site opened in November, five months behind schedule, the company had already spent tens of millions of dollars on marketing in the United States and Europe. **********The late start hurt in several ways, according to Ernst Malmsten, Boo's chief executive. Because the marketing had created huge expectations, particularly in Britain and on the Continent, the company was unable to test the site with a quiet rollout, in which traffic builds gradually and kinks can be worked out before visitors start showing up in droves. **********Instead, Boo.com had a decidedly noisy introduction, which led to a chorus of journalists complaining that features like 3-D photography and a talking saleswoman left those Internet users with slow modem connections -- the majority of users, in other words -- waiting endlessly for pages to load. The company added a low-bandwidth feature in February, to make the site work faster for the modemed masses. But by that time many of the consumers Boo had reached with its advertising campaign had visited, and sworn off, the site. **********Boo's staff, meanwhile, had grown to about 400 people, who worked feverishly to support a complex sales-fulfillment operation that allowed users to see only the items that Boo's distributors had in stock, in their preferred language, with prices in their nation's currency. One Boo executive estimated that the nonmarketing costs associated with building its global operation were $50 million to $70 million. **********Mr. Malmsten said that aside from coordinating the site's rollout with its marketing -- and perhaps waiting until shoppers were more comfortable buying apparel online -- he should have tried to restrain the expectations raised by the company. ''But we all make lots of mistakes all the time,'' he said. **********Mr. Mackie of CraftShop had more modest goals for his site -- and more modest financing to go with it. He said he had raised  $3 million to $5 million for the site, which went online in January. But he, too, was a victim of bad timing and less-than-perfect execution. The company originally sought to open the site before Christmas but failed because the technology was not ready; nor were there photographs of the 40,000 or so craft products the site sold. **********When the site did get up and running, Mr. Mackie said, it was not even close to meeting its sales goals, in part because it converted less than 1 percent of its visitors into buyers. ''We didn't have our merchandising department fleshed out,'' he said, ''so we didn't do a very good job of merchandising.'' **********Because CraftShop's investors, including the venture firm CMGI, tied their financing to performance, the company did not receive the bulk of a $15 million pledge earlier this year. By that time, other venture capitalists were far too leery of e-tailing to come to the rescue. **********One final lesson for CraftShop, which may hold some truth for the broader e-commerce market, was that investors' timetable did not coincide with the demands of customers. **********''I knew when we got our early angel financing in March '99 that we were probably too late,'' Mr. Mackie said. ''People were already beginning to ask the hard questions about performance. But if we'd been earlier, the craft shoppers wouldn't have been ready, willing and able. The marketplace is just now warming up to this.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/20/business/worldbusiness/IHT-china-plans-easing-on-currency-and-rates.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Crampton", "pub_date": "2000-07-20", "snippet": "China's central bank governor affirmed plans Wednesday to loosen currency controls and set a three-year deadline for market determination of interest rates \u2014 the most concrete blueprint yet for financial sector reform. .

But full liberalization of deposit rates for other bank accounts, including savings and checking accounts, will require \"further study,\" Mr. Dai said. **********\"We will be especially cautious about deposit rates,\" he added. **********For China's currency, Mr. Dai said that, while the yuan's trading band may be widened soon within the current \"managed float\" system, there is no time frame for letting the currency float freely. **********\"Recently, some experts at home and abroad have suggested increasing the flexibility of the exchange rate,\" Mr. Dai said. \"It's worth studying, but we haven't decided to change the managed-float rate.\" **********This announcement is part of China's preparation for a return to the former policy of allowing a tightly controlled float of the yuan, said Guonan Ma, chief regional economist at Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong. **********\"They are paving the way for the returning to a managed float system,\" Mr. Ma said. \"Formally they may not make a policy change, but it does mean they will allow greater flexibility and leeway for the currency.\" **********About three years ago, before Asia's economic crisis, China ran a managed-float currency regime conducted under central bank management that allowed the currency to vary slightly against the U.S. dollar. **********As the economic crisis forced currency devaluations across Asia, China tightened its exchange-rate policy to an unchanging peg against the dollar. Applauded as an act of regional responsibility, China's control of its currency was seen as a bulwark for stabilizing the region's currencies. Economists and regional finance ministers frequently warned that a devaluation by China would kick off another devastating round of devaluations. **********After remaining virtually unchanged for three years, many economists now say the currency should be allowed to move again. \"The sooner they loosen up the exchange rates, the better,\" Mr. Ma said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/17/business/distributor-of-flu-vaccine-comes-under-fire.html": {"writer_name": "Melody Petersen", "pub_date": "2000-11-17", "snippet": "Customers of flu vaccine distributor Henry Schein Inc say their longstanding orders for vaccine are going unfilled while other customers that ordered only recently, but at higher prices, are getting medication; Henry Schein and its subsidiaries ar...", "word_count": 897, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Distributor of Flu Vaccine Comes Under Fire", "print_headline": "Distributor of Flu Vaccine Comes Under Fire", "body_text": " **********With flu vaccine in short supply nationwide, customers of one big distributor say their longstanding orders are going unfilled while other customers that ordered only recently, but at higher prices, are getting the medication. **********The distributor, Henry Schein Inc., and its subsidiaries are the exclusive suppliers in the United States of vaccine made by Medeva, a British company that is the only flu vaccine producer that has not had manufacturing problems this year. **********Some Schein customers that ordered early, at low prices, said in interviews over the last week that they had received only partial shipments or no vaccine at all. At the same time, Schein is taking new orders at higher prices, and at least some of those orders have been quickly delivered. **********Schein, which is based in Melville, N.Y., said yesterday that its policy was to first fill orders placed early by doctors, and then to fill other early orders, like those of state governments. **********Susan Vasallo, a spokeswoman for Schein, said she could not explain why the company was shipping vaccine to some customers that placed orders only in the last few weeks. **********''We are trying to fulfill orders as best we can,'' Ms. Vasallo said. ''There probably are some exceptions. How many of those took place I could not say. But those are the exceptions, not the rule.'' **********Flu vaccinations have been delayed around the nation this year because of the difficulties that other companies had in making the vaccine. With health care providers desperate for vaccine, prices have shot up. **********Delays in shipments of vaccine ordered by the state of California have led Representative Gary A. Condit, a Democrat, to ask the General Accounting Office to investigate. **********''Any price manipulations that may put profit ahead of the health and well-being of the American people is simply wrong,'' Mr. Condit said this week. ''We think the distribution of the vaccine should be fair. It should not be awarded to the highest bidder.'' **********By last week, the California Department of Health Services had received only about 35 percent of the 700,000 doses of vaccine that it ordered in February, at $1.80 each, from a Schein subsidiary, General Injectables and Vaccines. Flu clinics across the state have been postponed. **********''This has put our clinics in a very difficult situation,'' said Dr. Natalie J. Smith, chief of the department's immunization branch. **********By contrast, General Injectables delivered all the vaccine that the state of Maine had ordered -- 123,500 doses at either $3.10 or $3.99 each, about twice as much as California's price, according to Paul Kuehnert, director of the Maine division of disease control. Maine placed its order in June, about four months later than California, and received it in early September. **********In addition, an order placed a few weeks ago by Dr. Stephen Dickey at the Doctors Walk-in Clinics in Tampa, Fla., for about 3,000 doses at about $7.50 each, was delivered last week, Dr. Dickey said. That order was filled by another Schein unit, Caligor. **********Ms. Vasallo said she could not comment on individual customers' cases, but she insisted that Schein was not delivering vaccine based on the price paid. ''That is not the policy,'' she said. **********''The price has gone up as the season has progressed,'' Ms. Vasallo acknowledged. But she said that Medeva had also increased its price. ''Our costs have gone up,'' she said. **********Powderject Pharmaceuticals, a company in Oxford, England, that bought Medeva in October, said that Schein had discretion to set the sales price of vaccine in the United States. ''From what we understand, they are making every effort to fulfill their customers' orders,'' a spokeswoman for Powderject said yesterday. **********Medeva is expected to sell about 15 million of the 75 million doses of flu vaccine that will eventually be available in the United States this flu season. Unlike Aventis and American Home Products, the other vaccine makers, Medeva had no problems producing flu vaccine this year and has been shipping it to Schein on schedule, Rob Budge, a spokesman for Powderject, said this month. **********Ms. Vasallo said that Schein had also placed orders with the other vaccine makers, and therefore did not yet have all the vaccine it was counting on. **********Dr. Smith, the California health official, said that when she heard this summer that some vaccine shipments would be delayed because of manufacturing problems she was relieved that California had ordered the vaccine made by Medeva. **********General Injectables had told state officials that it would try to deliver the vaccine in August, and no later than Sept. 15, she said. The company later told California that its order would be complete by October, so that vaccination clinics could be held as scheduled. **********With the arrival of thousands of additional doses on Wednesday, the state has now received about 65 percent of its order, Dr. Smith said, and is anxiously awaiting more. **********Also waiting are hundreds of customers of Insource, another Schein subsidiary, that have not received any vaccine. Many of them are regional medical distributors that sell to doctors' offices and clinics. **********Michael Jekoski, vice president for sales at Delaware Valley Surgical Supply in Boothwyn, Pa., said his company had ordered 5,000 vials of drug vaccine from Insource early this spring at a price ''in the low $20's'' for each vial, containing 10 doses. The company then took orders to sell the vaccine to doctors' offices at prices ''in the mid to upper $20's'' per vial, Mr. Jekoski said. **********''We have been left with nothing to give physicians,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/23/technology/out-of-the-mouths-of-babes-wirelessly.html": {"writer_name": "Michel Marriott", "pub_date": "2000-03-23", "snippet": "New wave of low-cost, handheld personal communication devices aimed at teenagers and children will be on retail shelves this summer, with second wave expected in time for new school year; devices include such features as ability to beam voice and ...", "word_count": 1645, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Out of the Mouths of Babes: Wirelessly", "print_headline": "Out of the Mouths of Babes: Wirelessly", "body_text": " **********IMAGINE a junior high school cafeteria anywhere in America, clamorous with juvenile jokes, jabs and gossip as cafeteria fare and brown-bag meals are gobbled up and chased down with soda and chocolate milk. **********Now reimagine the same scene, but in this version there is hardly a sound. Children carry low-cost, high-tech devices capable of beaming voice and text messages wirelessly to fellow students packing similar devices. By speaking directly into the devices or tapping tiny keyboards or writing with styluses on touch screens, they dispatch and receive juvenile jokes, jabs and gossip over radio waves. **********And it's all out of sight and earshot of teachers and principals. **********Yes, parents and educators have something new to worry about. The first major wave of handheld communication devices marketed to teenagers and children, some as young as 3, is scheduled to show up on retail shelves this summer, with a second wave expected in time for the new school year. **********If some toy manufacturers have their way, children will soon be reaching for gadgets like V Mail, a writing pen that doubles as a voice recorder and can beam and receive  voice mail up to 100 feet away. Or Lightning Mail, a small handheld device with a L.C.D. screen and virtual keyboard that can send wireless messages up to 50 feet; when plugged into a phone jack, it can send and receive e-mail from anywhere.  Or Send It, a personal data system that magnetically encodes and reads messages placed on plastic cards. **********While toys often pose as children's versions of adult tools, many of these new kinds of communications ''toys'' for children possess advanced features not yet found in the general consumer market. Try to beam a text message across a crowded shopping mall with two $450 Palm VII's, for instance -- something two $60 Lightning Mail units can easily do. **********Some technology experts suggest that these new child-chummy devices will prove to be previews of some of the more sophisticated features adults may one day have in their own personal digital assistants. **********''It's interesting to think of these playthings as precursors,'' said William H. Dutton, a professor of communication and director of the communication management program at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Southern California. ''Their technologies may yet not be ready for prime time but may well suggest ways the Palm is probably going to develop.'' **********The phenomenon of toys taking the technology lead has happened before, said Dr. Dutton, author of ''Society on the Line: Information Politics in the Digital Age'' (Oxford University Press, 1999). He noted, for instance, that a child's inexpensive walkie-talkie -- handheld and wireless -- of just a generation ago contained elements of more sophisticated communications capabilities than the intercom systems for adults that used wires rather than radio waves. **********''I read an article the other day that said kids are getting older younger,'' said Paul S. Nielsen, senior vice president for licensing and product development at ToyBiz, a toy company based in New York. ''I think that's right. Kids today are somewhere between toys and car keys.'' **********ToyBiz is preparing to release its V Mail device in June. It is an oversize, translucent pen with a kind of organic styling that makes it look like something aliens might have misplaced in Area 51. The 900-megahertz pen, directed at children 7 years old and up, is capable of sending voice messages, each up to four seconds long, to one person or a group of people on the ISM band, a frequency set aside by the Federal Communications Commission mostly for the use of wireless medical monitoring instruments. It will cost $20. **********''I think V Mail helps support how kids have changed already,'' Mr. Nielsen said, dismissing any concern that such a device might encourage some children to value electronic conversations more than real, face-to-face ones. ''It allows a tech-savvy child to do what he or she is doing already.'' **********The V Mail pen's core technology is like that of an instrument that uses radio waves to transmit patient information, like heart rate and blood pressure, to a nearby nurses' station, Mr. Nielsen said. The pen further refined the technology, with multiple mailboxes on the pen's shaft for sending, receiving, saving and playing back messages. The red tip of the pen flashes to indicate incoming messages. **********Mr. Nielsen said the V Mail pen had interested some retailers who want to sell the device to adults. ''One of the key buyers of a major retailer said he would like to have them in his office to call together meetings,'' Mr. Nielsen said. His company is considering making a V Mail pen with a more traditional look in hopes of making it appealing to older users, he added. **********Other toy developers said this new class of simple and cheap communications tools had been made possible by rapid advances in computer and communications technology. Another factor has been the plunging prices of electronic components, especially those deemed no longer powerful enough for other mobile products like cell phones and P.D.A.'s. **********''They are generally not as flexible as grown-up versions of the technology, but for kids they're great, perfect,'' said Jeremy Schwartz, a senior analyst at Forrester Research. **********A few of these Internet-generation devices carry prices close to those of grown-up gadgets. For example, the Cybiko, a handheld, wireless ''intertainment system'' can, among other things, send instant chat messages through the air and play multiuser computer games. It has a curvy, asymmetrical shape that makes it resemble a Palm V left in the sun too long and will cost $149. **********Whether children (or more likely their parents) will spend that much money for a communications toy, no matter how ''cool'' it may appear, remains to be seen. Another company, Kesonic, is releasing Kidz Digitchat, a scaled-down version of the same technology. Kidz Digitchat is also an organizer that can send text messages, but its range is much more limited than that of the Cybiko. It can be used to play or download games. **********Tiger, the division of Hasbro that populated the toy world with Furbys, attracted a lot of attention last month at the American International Toy Fair in New York with its new lineup of ''lifestyle communicators'' for children, including a $25 device called Power Talk that, like V Mail, can send short voice messages up to 100 feet. Tiger executives are reluctant to call them toys. **********The Send It, which looks like a small cell phone and will cost $30, doubles as a calculator and an alarm clock. But Send It's killer application is that its keypad can be used to put e-mail-like messages onto a plastic card about the size of a credit card. When the card is inserted into another Send It device, the message appears on that device's L.C.D. screen, giving the age-old practice of passing notes in school a high-tech twist. **********The cards can be encrypted so that if someone, like a teacher, intercepts the card the message cannot be revealed without a special personal identification number known only to the sender and the intended recipient of the message. **********Barbara Stein, a senior policy analyst on education technology issues for the National Education Association in Washington, said schools should prepare for a possible onslaught of a whole new category of computerized gadgets. ''Schools, at some point, are going to have to develop some system for controlling the use of these devices in schools,'' she said, adding that she presumes that someday soon everyone, even students, will have wireless means of communications at their disposal. ''This is the world that they are growing up in,'' Ms. Stein said. **********Not surprisingly, Marc Rosenberg, vice president for corporate communications at Tiger, is more optimistic about the implications of these devices. ''We are empowering kids with adult tools that really are making their world a lot more relevant,'' he said. ''Why not create something that is affordable and applicable to their lives?'' **********Another Tiger device called Lightning Mail is scheduled for release in September and is expected to cost $60. Lightning Mail, the size of a pocket calculator, is capable of wirelessly sending and receiving text messages up to 50 feet. And when the same device is plugged into a standard telephone jack, it can send and receive e-mail to and from anywhere in the world. Similarly, another child-friendly device, the Chat@ message system, can transmit messages wirelessly and, through a toll-free number, can also send and receive e-mail messages. **********(There are also a number of e-mail-only devices on the market that do not require the use of a personal computer. But most of those devices are intended for home use and cost considerably more than the new devices aimed at the children's market.) **********Tiger's Lightning Mail comes loaded with software from NetZero, a free e-mail service, so Lightning Mail can handle e-mail without the user having to pay a monthly fee, Mr. Rosenberg said. **********Even in the toy industry, these devices have their critics. Kenn Viselman, founder of Itsy Bitsy Entertainment, a New York-based company that licenses things like the Teletubbies to toy makers, urged caution for parents who want to wire their children with the latest technologies. **********''I think too many of us use technology as a means of saying, 'I love you,' '' Mr. Viselman said. ''I have a real problem with it.'' **********While some of the toys Mr. Viselman has licensed, like the talking Teletubbies, use electronic components, he said he favored toys that do less so children are required to do more -- like using their imaginations.  What's wrong, he said, with a child's saying ''ring, ring'' before answering a toy telephone? **********''We are taking imagination and fun out,'' he said, ''and turning children more into robots and less into free thinkers.'' **********But today's children, like those of prehistoric times, want to emulate what they see their parents and older peers doing, said Roger Richards, president of Kesonic, a division of Kessel Electronics that makes communication toys. **********''Kids are the great communicators,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/20/business/company-news-bausch-lomb-in-talks-to-buy-pharmaceutical-company.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "2000-07-20", "snippet": "Bausch & Lomb Inc, second-largest maker of contact lenses, is in discussions to buy unidentified ophthalmic pharmaceuticals company outside US (S)", "word_count": 83, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BAUSCH & LOMB IN TALKS TO BUY PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; BAUSCH & LOMB IN TALKS TO BUY PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY", "body_text": " **********Bausch & Lomb Inc. the second-largest maker of contact lenses, said yesterday that it was in discussions to buy an unidentified ophthalmic pharmaceuticals company outside the United States.

Revamps Incentive Plan Even After Profits Rise", "body_text": " **********General Motors today revamped its sales discounts for the third quarter, while announcing that its profits had inched up in the second quarter instead of falling slightly, as had been expected. **********G.M. raised its rebates by $500 on a wide range of cars, minivans, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. But the company also increased the lowest available interest rates on its discounted auto loans, to 3.9 percent from 0.9 percent. Recent interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve have made it prohibitively expensive for automakers to continue subsidizing deeply discounted loans. **********The Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler A.G. changed its incentives last month to emphasize rebates at the expense of auto loans, while the Ford Motor Company quietly did so earlier this month on a limited basis. But neither program was as generous in rebates as the deals G.M. made available to its dealers today, which took effect immediately and will last through Oct. 2. **********Because less-affluent buyers tend to choose auto loans while those with greater wealth tend to prefer rebates, the shift away from loans is likely to drive some less-prosperous customers out of the market, cooling overall sales and slowing the economy slightly, auto executives said. **********''Are the Fed actions having an impact in terms of how we're taking our vehicles to market? I would say yes,'' said Kevin E. Costello, Ford Motor's finance director for North American marketing and revenue analysis. **********Costly incentives in the second quarter had led many investors and some Wall Street analysts to fear that G.M. would post weak financial results today. But the company's net income from continuing operations ended up rising 1 percent, to $1.75 billion from $1.73 billion a year earlier. The giant automaker's earnings per share jumped 10.2 percent, to $2.93 from $2.66. That is largely because nearly two months ago the company reduced the number of its shares, by offering shareholders in exchange some of its Class H shares, which track the earnings of its Hughes Electronics subsidiary. **********Financial analysts had forecast that G.M would earn $2.82 a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. G.M. outperformed the estimates because its revenue from each vehicle stayed flat despite increasing discounts, analysts said. This was possible partly because customers ordered more optional equipment. **********''More people are buying leather seats, more people are buying sun roofs,'' J. Michael Losh, G.M.'s chief financial officer, said in an interview. **********G.M. announced its earnings before the opening bell today, while word of its new incentives did not dribble out until after the close of trading. G.M. stock climbed 44 cents, to close at $60.81. **********Scott F. Merlis, an investment banker specializing in auto companies at Wasserstein Perella Securities Inc., said that financial markets had been expecting more harm to second-quarter earnings from the discounts. ''The higher incentives are not leading to a devastation of the bottom line,'' he said. **********Ronald Zarrella, the president of G.M.'s North American operations, said that the automaker's average price for each vehicle after incentives would be down by roughly half a percentage point for the full year despite flat prices in the second quarter. He blamed competitive pressures. The average net price fell seven-tenths of 1 percent in the first quarter. It was unchanged in the second quarter. **********G.M.'s sales rose to $48.74 billion in the second quarter from $45.07 billion a year earlier. **********G.M. spun off its giant Delphi auto parts subsidiary during the second quarter of last year. Including the profits from that discontinued operation in last year's second-quarter results would mean that G.M.'s earnings actually shrank 8.7 percent, from $1.92 billion a year ago. But financial analysts have tended to exclude the Delphi figures, viewing the spinoff as a splitting of G.M. rather than the closing of a subsidiary."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/07/business/feeding-the-energy-eater-atlantic-canada-s-oil-boom-helps-the-northeastern-us.html": {"writer_name": "James Brooke", "pub_date": "2000-09-07", "snippet": "Atlantic coastal area of Canada is emerging as major source of oil and natural gas, with Northeastern US as its primary customer; Hibernia oil field and Sable gas field are already in production; Terra Nova, $200 million, 14-story oil production v...", "word_count": 1380, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Feeding the 'Energy Eater'; Atlantic Canada's Oil Boom Helps the Northeastern U.S.", "print_headline": "Feeding the 'Energy Eater'; Atlantic Canada's Oil Boom Helps the Northeastern U.S.", "body_text": " **********From this unexpected corner of the North Atlantic, American consumers could soon see a ray of relief from shortages that have kept oil and natural gas prices stubbornly high. But even though the new energy supplies will be welcome, they are not expected to bring prices down soon. **********Next spring, Terra Nova, a $200 million, 14-story oil production vessel will move 220 miles east of here, lock into place over a 400-million-barrel pool of oil, and start pumping 100,000 barrels a day, largely for the Northeastern United States. In addition, Nova Scotia has started sending natural gas south, and that flow could increase greatly in coming years. **********Atlantic Canada, from Nova Scotia to Labrador, could prove to be the next-generation North Sea or Prudhoe Bay. And Newfoundland, long Canada's poorest province, stands to reap the biggest benefit. Of the 11 oil fields larger than 100 million barrels discovered worldwide since 1979, 4 have been off the coast of Newfoundland, on the Grand Banks. **********Today, the cacophony from 1,300 workers hammering and welding the Terra Nova production vessel near here are drawing attention to two new trends: Americans' growing reliance on Canada for energy, and the future of Atlantic Canada as a major supplier of oil and natural gas to the Northeastern United States. **********While most oil fields outside the Persian Gulf are mature and declining in production, Atlantic Canada's oil industry is taking its baby steps. Of the four major fields offshore here, Hibernia started producing in 1997 and Terra Nova is to start producing early next summer. **********''We have barely touched the Grand Banks,'' said Gary Bruce, vice president for offshore development with Petro-Canada, Canada's second-largest integrated oil company and the lead operator at Terra Nova. **********Newfoundland is in the midst of a 15-year, $10 billion oil investment plan. By 2004, this long-overlooked province is to be pumping 400,000 barrels a day, the same amount as a small OPEC producer like Ecuador. That quantity, to be sure, would meet only a small portion of the average daily United States consumption of nearly 20 million barrels. But unlike Ecuador, Newfoundland is politically stable and no more than three days by tanker from New York. **********Already, Canada is the top supplier to the United States of natural gas and the No. 2 supplier of oil, after Saudi Arabia. During the first half of this year, a 44 percent jump in the value of Canada's oil and gas exports to the United States helped push Canada's June trade surplus with its neighbor to a monthly record of $5.2 billion. Responding to higher prices, Canada's oil production in June was up 7.5 percent from a year earlier, to 2.25 million barrels a day, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. **********While Western states have long imported oil and gas from Alberta, Eastern states only started importing natural gas from Nova Scotia's massive gas field in January and oil from Newfoundland's Hibernia field three years ago. By 2005, 40 percent of Canada's conventional oil production is to come from Newfoundland. After half a century of production, wells in Alberta produce an average of 50 barrels a day. Off Newfoundland, the average is 20,000 a day. **********In a mirror-like reversal of Canada's traditional oil picture, Exxon Mobil now estimates the potential conventional offshore oil reserves of Eastern Canada to be 40 billion barrels, compared with 34 billion for Western Canada. Lured by estimates like these, the major oil players are pumping billions of dollars through this four-century-old harbor city. **********''Eastern Canada is becoming better and better known in the industry,'' said Kenneth J. Miller, a Scot, who shuttles between here and Calgary, Alberta, to run Mobil Oil Canada's eastern operations. Canada's largest oil producer, Exxon Mobil has a leading, 33 percent, share in Hibernia; a 22 percent interest in Terra Nova, and 60 percent of Nova Scotia's new gas development, the Sable Offshore Energy Project. **********In addition to Exxon Mobil and Petro-Canada leading developments here, there is Husky Oil, which leads in White Rose, a field that is to start production toward the end of 2003. Chevron Canada Resources leads in Hebron-Ben Nevis, tentatively scheduled for production around 2006. In late July, Canadian officials increased their estimates of Hibernia, White Rose and Hebron-Ben Nevis by a third, to 2.1 billion barrels. **********''When you see an iceberg, you only see 10 percent,'' said Brian Tobin, premier of Newfoundland and Labrador. ''Well, our oil and gas industry is an iceberg waiting to reveal itself.'' **********While some oil goes to Eastern Canada, the big market is the Eastern seaboard of the United States. **********''All the oil is going down the North Atlantic, to New York, to Philadelphia,'' said David N. Willis, president of the consortium that operates Hibernia, which is producing 165,000 barrels a day. **********Mark Turner, a ship captain and maritime lawyer here, said, ''New York is the energy eater.'' **********In addition to oil, Atlantic Canada offers natural gas, increasingly the  energy of choice for new American homes and power plants. While much of New York City's gas comes from Alberta, the reserves of Newfoundland and Labrador are 62 trillion cubic feet, estimated Mr. Turner, who recently completed his term as chairman of the Newfoundland Ocean Industries Association, the energy company group here. That would provide energy for more than 700 million homes for a year. **********In Nova Scotia, a new 653-mile pipeline is pumping natural gas from the 3.5-trillion-cubic-foot Sable reserve through New Brunswick, Maine and southern New Hampshire to link up with existing pipelines north of Boston. Near the Sable development, three other companies are drilling 15 test wells this year. Nova Scotia has granted 43 exploration licenses and has set an Oct. 30 deadline for bids on 2,875 square miles of ocean around Sable. As a measure of the gas industry's infancy, there are about 200 wells, largely for exploration, off Nova Scotia, compared with more than 6,000 in the Gulf of Mexico. **********''The U.S. is consuming gas like crazy,'' Mr. Bruce of Petro-Canada said. ''If current prices remain on a sustainable basis, it will be economical to run a gas pipeline to the U.S.'' **********With natural gas prices running at almost double last year's levels, oil producers in Newfoundland are studying rival proposals to tap their mammoth gas reserves with a pipeline or with ships loaded with compressed or liquefied natural gas. **********Paul D. Dicks, Newfoundland's energy minister, estimated that within 10 years a gas pipeline would be built from the Grand Banks to Newfoundland to Boston, a $3 billion project. **********The investments in Atlantic Canada are part of a response to the stimulus of rising prices. In Western Canada, the number of wells drilled this year is expected to jump 50 percent, to 15,529. Over all, a government survey showed that oil companies planned to invest $13 billion in plants and equipment this year. Fueling investments are record second-quarter profits. Petro-Canada's profit jumped fourfold, to $174 million. Alberta Energy increased profit sixfold, to $78.5 million. **********The people of this island jutting into the North Atlantic, nicknamed the Rock, see the energy boom as welcome news. Newfoundland has Canada's highest unemployment rate, about 17 percent. In recent years, it has been the only province to lose population, shrinking by about 1 percent a year. **********Accustomed to bad news, and to making ends meet with federal revenue-sharing payments averaging about $3,400 a resident, Newfoundlanders are suddenly reading headlines in Toronto newspapers like ''Newfoundland, Alberta expected to lead growth.'' **********In a startling turnaround, this province of 540,000 people had the highest growth rates of Canada's 10 provinces in 1998 and 1999. This year, it is expected to top the list again, matching the last two years' growth rates by expanding 5 percent. **********Offshore oil production is an extremely capital-intensive business, with the cost of a single well often being 100 times that of a land-based well. To lift employment, Newfoundlanders have set an ambitious goal of joining Scotland, Norway and South Korea as major fabricators of offshore drilling structures. **********Although initial royalties from Hibernia have been considered low by the provincial government, Mr. Tobin, the premier, said he believed that oil and gas would be Newfoundland's ticket to self-sufficiency. **********''When I look to oil and gas,'' said Mr. Tobin, a former federal fisheries minister, ''I see Newfoundland and Labrador in a decade shaking off a history of being the poor cousin, the have-not province of Canada.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/07/technology/survey-lauds-midwestern-schools.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-09-07", "snippet": "Sparsely populated Midwestern states are challenging the stereotype of the isolated rural school, leading the nation in the use of technology to connect classrooms to the nation and the world, a recent study suggests.", "word_count": 935, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Survey Lauds Midwestern Schools", "print_headline": "Survey Lauds Midwestern Schools", "body_text": " **********Sparsely populated Midwestern states are challenging the stereotype of the isolated rural school, leading the nation in the use of technology to connect classrooms to the nation and the world, a recent study suggests. **********The survey, conducted by an independent educational research firm, rated Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota and several other largely rural Midwestern states among the top 10 in the nation in terms of \"technology sophistication.\" School size contributed significantly to the states\u2019 successful efforts, but so did coordinated technology planning by lawmakers and teachers, educators and those conducting the survey said,. **********\"Smaller communities aren't overwhelmed,\" said Wayne Fisher, Internet program specialist for the Nebraska Department of Education's Education Technology Center. \"Many of our K-12 schools have less than 1,000 students and many have less than 500. When you start about the task of connecting everyone, you can do it in a bite-sized chunk.\" **********Market Data Retrieval an educational research company, surveyed 30,000 public and private schools to create their \"Technology Sophistication Index.\" The index gauges a school's \"technology sophistication\" on several factors that included its type of computer networking, its Internet connection speed, how many high-end and multimedia computers a school had, the location of the computers and the number of computers per student. **********The other states ranked in the top ten were Alaska, Wyoming, Delaware, Idaho, Montana, Kansas and Iowa. **********While Fisher and other educators said it has been easier to quickly implement changes and get technology into the hands of students at smaller schools, that alone does not account for the success of Nebraska and the other highly-rated states. Several of the lowest-rated states, including Oklahoma, Alabama and Mississippi, are also largely rural. **********Fisher attributes Nebraska\u2019s success to a concerted effort made by lawmakers and educators in 1995 to wire every school and classroom to the Internet. That framework, which predated a much-publicized national effort to accomplish the same goal, helped to ensure that no School in Nebraska - wealthy or poor - was left behind, Fisher said. **********\"The way we ensured equity was to make sure that everyone got wired,\" he said, adding that rather than a grant program that favored wealthier schools with the means to apply, the state made a commitment to all schools. \"We designed it for everyone.\" **********Fisher added that the surrounding states, like Kansas, South Dakota and North Dakota, all had a similar attitude toward putting technology into the schools. The states recognized the value of connecting schools to the Internet early on to help them span the broad distances between cities and towns. **********\"That's been the secret to some of the other rural Midwestern states,\" he said. \"We, being rural states covering a large amount of distance, had the need more than other states. It's a work-ethic thing. We have that Midwestern ethic of 'let's do the best job we can.'\" **********E-rate discounts for Internet access and internal networking - enacted as part of the1996 Telecommunications Act and funded by contributions from long distance telephone companies - also have played a role in helping rural and urban school districts advance technologically. **********Fisher said the e-rate enhanced the network Nebraska had already committed to building by providing discounts for school district Internet connections. **********\"E-rate has really been a boon to us,\" he said. \"We were positioned from the beginning to go into the heart of what e-rate was for.\" **********Since every state has seen benefits from e-rate funding, even states scoring low on the Technology Sophistication Index were not bereft of education technology altogether. The 10 states with the lowest scores, where one quarter to one third of schools had low index ratings, included Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Arkansas, California, Maryland, Arizona, Pennsylvania and Connecticut. **********Claudette Tennant, chairwoman of the Education and Libraries Networks Coalition, or EdLiNC, an advocate for school technology, said a recent study by her group found that the e-rate has encouraged schools to leverage other funds to expand their technology offerings and implement changes faster. **********\"The e-rate provides an opportunity, but it provides pressure to perform,\" said Tennant, who is also the assistant director of the American Library Association's office of government relations. \"It also makes a difference wither or not somebody has a plan.\" **********Michael Subrizi, marketing director for Market Data Retrieval, said his group has never seen evidence of a rural-urban digital divide in the years it has surveyed schools and their use of technology. **********\"It's certainly not a rural divide,\" Subrizi said. \"We're seeing a flattening across indicators such as access to the Internet because of the e-rate. Schools definitely have accessed that money and they've had to use it in a targeted way.\" **********The Technology Sophistication Index was weighted toward a low student-to-computer ratio, which would tend to give schools with smaller populations an advantage. States such as Nebraska therefore may have an advantage, as their sparse student populations make it easier for school districts to afford more high-end technology for each student, several educators said. **********\"It's a lot easier for schools with low enrollments to have technology,\" Subrizi said. \"If you have a school with 200 kids, it's easier to buy enough high-end computers than if a school has 1,000 students.\" **********In building the index, Market Data Retrieval also considered where educators located their computers. For example, a school could have a computer lab or library media center full of high-end computers with high-speed Internet connections, but could still rank low in technology sophistication because the hardware is not used in the classroom for daily instruction, Subrizi said. **********\"If you have high-end technology, but if you only have one computer per 10 students, your rating will be lower,\" he said. \"The location becomes important, too. Classroom computers are desirable. That means they're being used for instruction.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/31/business/silicon-image-acquisition.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "2000-03-31", "snippet": "Silicon Image Inc acquires DVDO Inc for $45 million in stock (S)", "word_count": 104, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Silicon Image Acquisition", "print_headline": "Silicon Image Acquisition", "body_text": " **********Silicon Image Inc., whose computer chips help display digital images, agreed today to buy the closely held DVDO Inc. for $45 million in stock to add technology for digital televisions, DVD players and high-definition video.

So if they should happen to assess an applicant's professional qualifications, they might well focus on a more mundane matter: Is she actually suited for the job? **********That is, in essence, the question that Herbert M. Greenberg, 70, who has been blind since he was 10, has been helping managers answer for the last 39 years. As a result, his human resources consulting firm, Caliper Management in Princeton, N.J., has grown into a successful niche player with 195 employees and $14 million in revenue since he founded it in 1961. **********''As a 10-year-old, I thought I'd be stuck off in a school for the blind, and I'd weave baskets and maybe run a newspaper stand,'' said Mr. Greenberg, who grew up in Brooklyn, the son of working-class Polish immigrants. But his parents refused to comply. **********''It may sound corny, but the oldest son of a Jewish household is God,'' he said. ''You're the smartest and best-looking, and I internalized this.'' **********He certainly needed self-confidence after a mutant strain of the tuberculosis germ left him blind in 1940. Public schools turned him away for a year until his parents found one that offered Braille classes. He had to fight to get into the Boy Scouts. At summer camp, the other boys beat him up. **********But Mr. Greenberg was motivated by adversity. ''What drove me was I wasn't going to be pushed around,'' he said. He graduated from Bushwick High School with honors and went on to earn a bachelor's degree in psychology from City College and a Ph.D. from New York University. **********The Americans With Disabilities Act did not exist in those days. So Mr. Greenberg fired off 600 applications for jobs in college teaching and social work, listing his accomplishments but not his blindness. Eighty-five schools ''virtually accepted'' him, he said, but when he informed them of his disability, he got job interviews with just three and no job offers. Finally, he was hired by a Texas college, he says, though he was fired two years later in a policy dispute. **********The setbacks, Mr. Greenberg says, taught him a valuable management lesson: ''Don't over-personalize failure. If a school rejects you, apply to another. If a client rejects you, you go on to the next one.'' **********He went on to teach at Rutgers, Fairleigh Dickinson and Long Island universities in the late 1950's and early 60's, selling insurance on the side. All the while, the humiliation of being punished for his blindness ate away at him. **********''I can't stand people not having the opportunity to make the best of what they are,'' Mr. Greenberg said, wearing beige slacks and a blue golf shirt and seated on a deck outside his office, which overlooks woods and a pond. ''There's so much untapped value in people.'' **********Therein lay a money-making opportunity. Realizing how difficult it was for personnel managers to spot talent, he teamed up with a friend who ran a market-research company to study the personality traits of successful salespeople. **********For four years, the two men interviewed hundreds of sales representatives in a host of industries. They then developed a 180-question psychological test that measures characteristics like risk-taking, empathy and resilience -- traits that aren't always apparent in job interviews or on resumes. Applicants are asked, for example, to rate themselves on statements like ''I need immediate results,'' and ''I work best in situations where I am in control.'' **********''Someone can be experienced or good-looking and have a good handshake and the tests are blind to that,'' Mr. Greenberg said, using the term deliberately. **********Mr. Greenberg did not invent psychological testing, of course. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, the granddaddy of personality tests, was created in 1940 and three million people take it each year. But Caliper clients say that while Myers-Briggs gives insights into general personality traits, Caliper's tests are better suited for placing people in specific jobs. **********Mr. Greenberg and his partner, David Mayer, started Caliper with a $15,000 loan. Their first assignment was evaluating hundreds of job applicants for 30 Buick dealers. Today, with 1.8 million tests administered, the firm has cultivated a stable of loyal clients, including corporations like Federal Express and Avis as well as social-service agencies, the Orlando Magic professional basketball team and Major League Baseball's Chicago Cubs. **********John Gabriel, general manager of the Magic, uses Mr. Greenberg's tests to evaluate players. Last July, when the Magic was considering drafting Corey Maggette, a freshman guard at Duke University, he was worried that the 19-year-old lacked the maturity to play pro ball. The test disclosed, however, that Mr. Maggette had an ''amazing level of discipline for a young kid,'' Mr. Greenberg said. Reassured, Mr. Gabriel added the youngster to his roster. **********Does he find it strange that he gets scouting advice from a blind consultant? **********''Sometimes analyzing a player involves what you can't see, the intangibles,'' Mr. Gabriel said. ''They may be heart, hustle, drive, determination, leadership. Herb Greenberg can identify those for you.'' **********William Carey, chairman of W. P. Carey & Company, an investment bank in New York and a client for more than three decades, said the consultant was also good at identifying ''rainmakers,'' or masters of doing deals. **********To be sure, Mr. Greenberg, who is both president and chief executive of Caliper and says he has no plans to retire, has his detractors. **********''We haven't been able to make psychological testing work,'' said Howard Stevens, chief executive of the H. R. Chally Group, a rival consulting firm in Dayton, Ohio. ''Psychological testing describes people well, but it doesn't predict their success. I have a psychological profile similar to Jack Nicklaus. Am I anywhere near the golfer he is? No.'' **********Even Mr. Greenberg's fans are quick to point out his flaws. ''Mr. Greenberg is not a very good manager,'' said Irwin Stoolmacher, who says he had a good relationship with his boss while running Caliper's day-to-day operations for 10 years before leaving in 1986. ''He's not good with minutiae, not a very cautious person. I wouldn't want him as my accountant.'' **********Mr. Greenberg, who has been married three times and has four children, acknowledges that he is no model manager. He describes himself as impatient and demanding, with ''more nerve than brains.'' Some of his investments back up that assessment. He bought an African-American radio station in Trenton, N.J., in 1976, even though he knew nothing about broadcasting, he says. After losing $250,000, he sold it seven years later. **********Undaunted, he bought the Trenton Shooting Stars of the International Basketball League two years ago. The team, now in its first season, is losing money, and attendance has been low. **********But Mr. Greenberg predicts success because he loves basketball, he says, and ''I understand the sport.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/18/business/company-news-scc-communications-agrees-to-purchase-a-lucent-unit.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "2000-10-18", "snippet": "SCC Communications Corp, provider of 911 services to telephone carriers, agrees to buy public safety systems unit of Lucent Technologies Inc for about $41 million (S)", "word_count": 91, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SCC COMMUNICATIONS AGREES TO PURCHASE A LUCENT UNIT", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; SCC COMMUNICATIONS AGREES TO PURCHASE A LUCENT UNIT", "body_text": " **********The SCC Communications Corporation, a provider of 911 services to telephone carriers, agreed to buy the public safety systems unit of Lucent Technologies Inc. for about $41 million.

What's more, while the rate at which consumers ''click through'' to read banner advertisements has plummeted in the last year to less than 1 percent, the response to e-mail messages was measured in the January Forrester survey at about 10 percent, with a quarter of those actually buying something. (Because this was a one-time survey, Forrester could not determine whether the response rates are rising or declining -- but more on that  later.) Direct e-mail marketers see these as positive numbers. **********So, apparently, do advertisers. A Forrester survey of 50 e-mail marketing managers found that they planned to triple their e-mail spending by 2004, the year that the analysts predicted that American marketers would send almost 210 billion e-mail messages. **********For consumers, such a blitz could be hellish or heavenly. To those who  feel inundated by unbidden electrons and try to guard their privacy against the commercial world, no amount of online coupons will seem anything but menacing. **********But for those who enjoy receiving bargain tips, who zip through their morning e-mail messages without complaint, the new age of personalized, targeted messages promises to bring information and deals they want, when they want them and where it is most convenient -- be it a home PC, hand-held organizer or squint-inducing cell-phone screen. **********Most of these messages will not be spam, according to Forrester, though the onslaught of unwanted e-mails may never go away. Four years from now, Forrester predicts, most e-mail will go to consumers who agree explicitly to receive it. Most of it will be intended to hold on to current customers -- the most economical use of the medium. **********The rise in the fortunes of e-mail -- now being used by retailers and e-tailers like Amazon.com, Eddiebauer.com, Barnes & Noble.com, Borders.com and Victoriasecret.com -- comes after several developments in the e-commerce universe, not least of which is the realization that money really does matter. At first, as new enterprises crowded the Internet, one significant question was hardly ever asked, and even less frequently answered: namely, who would pay for it? **********Some predicted that Web companies would follow the example of newspaper publishers, who sell their product for little or nothing and make their profits from advertising sales. **********BUT Internet companies have also learned an old rule of advertising, which is that even the best commercials cannot make a business successful if the business does not make sense in the first place. An online advertisement can do only so much, however refined, powerful or entertaining it may be. On the other hand, e-mail, even if it's homely, gets the job done, especially when coupled with time-tested principles of the direct-marketing industry, which boil down to ''test, test, test, measure, measure, measure,'' said H. Robert Wientzen, the chief executive of the Direct Marketing Association. **********Those who are among the best at formulating and directing e-mail are the people who are good at sending regular direct mail, old-economy types like Mr. Wientzen, who gleefully say they have beaten many new-economy people at their own game. **********A recent survey for the Direct Marketing Association found that nearly all the group's members were on the Internet; 69 percent reported that their online operations were profitable, with 20 percent reporting profits of more than $1 million a year. These figures are especially hearty at a time when some of the best-financed dot-coms are circling the drain. The profitability figure, though unverified, is up from 49 percent a year ago. **********''The guys who know how to do it are the ones who are going to come out ahead,'' Mr. Wientzen said. ''I don't think that's brain surgery.'' The difference is the attention to detail that may make the direct marketer a bore at parties but a winner at the bank. **********E-mail works precisely because its success can be calculated so extensively, William Park, the chief executive of Digital Impact, said in an e-mail interview. ''It's the most measurable marketing vehicle of all time,'' said Mr. Park, whose company, in San Mateo, Calif., helps the Hewlett-Packard Company and other businesses reach customers through personalized e-mail and other media. ''You know exactly who you are sending e-mails to, you know how they are responding -- did they click, did they buy?'' **********The speed of e-mail revolutionizes direct marketing, Mr. Park said. ''People respond to their e-mails in a matter of days or they won't respond at all,'' he said. ''So marketers can determine if their campaign was a success in 48 hours versus the four to six weeks it might take for a direct-mail campaign.'' **********The combination of lower cost and greater effectiveness has made believers out of many online merchants, including Jon Nordmark, a co-founder of E-bags, which sells luggage and accessories. In the last year, he said, judicious use of e-mail has helped him lower advertising costs by two-thirds, while sales have more than doubled. Last December, the company sold 18,000 bags online; this December he said he expected to sell 43,000. **********Mr. Nordmark said that his company had tried to economize from the start, while other companies spent their venture capital and stock money wildly. ''Too much money makes you stupid,'' he said. While the flashier dot-coms are still trying to figure out how to get people to pay for something they already receive free, like online news, direct marketers are building on decades of experience in sending consumers mail they don't think they want. They are then making sales from a small but profitable fraction of the recipients. And  they don't sulk that their contribution to the new economy is going unrecognized. Profits are a powerful consolation. **********Along with the testing, measuring and datamongering that Mr. Park speaks of, classic direct marketing means providing the kind of customer service that puts workers on the telephone to answer questions and puts armies in the warehouses to ship products and manage the inevitable returned goods. **********Mr. Wientzen recalled a recent visit to the luxurious offices of a lowerManhattan online retailer that was trying to to pull itself toward profitability. With wonder in his voice, he recalled that the first thing the company wanted to show him was its sophisticated Web site. **********''They kept using the term 'storefront,' '' Mr. Wientzen recalled. ''I kept thinking of it as a movie set without much behind it.'' **********Hans Peter Brondmo, the author of ''The Engaged Customer: The New Rules of Internet Direct Marketing,'' said that gradual understanding -- that there is more to e-commerce than designing a cool Web site -- was leading to a broad change in how online companies do business. **********''Marketers are having to shift their thinking into being service providers,'' he said, as opposed to what he calls simply telling and selling. **********One company that Mr. Brondmo works with, Palm Computing, uses e-mail messages to alert customers about new software for their hand-held devices, tying the messages directly to the kind of device the customers own, as well as to their line of work. The customers reply by e-mail with questions and complaints. **********The key to making e-mail effective, enthusiasts say, is getting personal, which strengthens bonds with current customers. **********''If a person buys red wine, send offers related to red wine rather than discounts on white wine,'' Mr. Park said. ''Your customer has given you permission to e-mail them; you have an obligation and an urgency to send them relevant e-mails, because if you don't, your customers will begin to ignore your messages much like they ignore banner ads.'' **********West Shell III, the chief executive of Netcentives, a San Francisco company that helps other companies operate their e-mail marketing programs, agreed. ''Relevancy drives response,'' he said. ''If you're not relevant, you're gone.'' Companies like Petopia, which sells pet products, build on their knowledge of the customer with each successive e-mail by asking questions -- What is your dog's breed? What is his name? -- that are worked into future messages. **********This lesson is taken to heart at LifeMinders, a company in Herndon, Va., that sends regular, personalized e-mail that includes advertising and offers of bargains to 20 million consumers. Its customers supply personal information in exchange for more accurately targeted offers, which range from discounted subscriptions to Sports Illustrated to  pitches for dog food. **********''If I put something as simple as the name of your dog in the subject line of your e-mail, the e-mail is opened about six times more frequently than if it were not there,'' said Stephen R. Chapin Jr., the chief executive of LifeMinders. **********LifeMinders now helps other companies manage their e-mail marketing. Mr. Chapin came to the Internet from direct marketing, where he sold credit cards by mail. ''The same thing we did in direct marketing we do in online advertising,'' he said. **********ANOTHER lesson emerging from the e-commerce shakeout is that the Internet works better as one element of a company's marketing strategy than it does as the only way to reach consumers. Kenneth Weil, the vice president for new media at Victoria's Secret, which features supermodels wearing sexy underwear in its advertisements and in its e-mail, said his company sends e-mail to 3.3 million people, encouraging them not only to go to the Victoria's Secret Web site but also to call or visit such a store nearby. **********''It's part of a greater strategy,'' he said, a strategy that totals $145 million in advertising and marketing expenses each year. About half the e-mail messages contain images and links to Web pages and the rest are simple text messages sent to customers whose computers can't receive more complex mail. Privacy advocates have warned that the picture-laden e-mails, because they use much of the technology from Web pages, open consumers to the same kinds of surreptitious monitoring that online sites engage in. But the use of the e-mail with pictures and Web links is sure to grow, since industry analysts estimate that those messages are about two and a half times as effective as e-mails that use plain text alone. **********This being the ephemeral Web universe, there are those who detect chinks in the electronic armor of online direct mail. One is Donna Hoffman, a business professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, who studies marketing on the Internet. ''Things seem good now, but, in fact, the signs are already coming,'' she said, that the success of e-mail marketing has led to a glut, and that ''the overuse has already reduced its effectiveness.'' **********Professor Hoffman said she had seen other industry figures that indicate the 10 percent click-through rate in the Forrester study has  slipped to 5 percent. ''I think it's going to go the same path as banner ads,'' she said. ''The more of this stuff you get, the more likely you are to start deleting it. It's like, 'Enough already.' '' **********Several companies said they were aware of the pitfalls of overzealousness. Todd Simon, a senior vice president of Omaha Steaks and the vice chairman of Omahasteaks.com, said  he wanted his companies to be known as purveyors of fine meats, not purveyors of spam. ''We have to be very, very sensitive to the spamming issue,'' Mr. Simon said. ''There's a chance if you just give them too much stuff, or they're not interested, they're going to say bye-bye.'' **********For his part, Mr. Godin of Yoyodyne said his new passion was viral marketing, in which companies try to adapt the notion of word of mouth to the Web. Viral marketing has been praised as the next big thing; its promise, like so much in the online world, has not been borne out so far. But Mr. Godin says that is because people have not figured out how to do it right yet. He said viral marketing can take many forms, including Web pages and banner advertisements. Another one, unprepossessing as always, is e-mail."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/04/business/l-politics-of-china-trade-586293.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-06-04", "snippet": "Mary Ann O'Donnell, letter, responds to May 21 article on debate of normalizing trade with China; contends free trade subordindates domestic labor concerns to multinational profits (M)", "word_count": 183, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Politics of China Trade", "print_headline": "Politics of China Trade", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********''Lighting Up a Lesson in China Trade'' (May 21) quotes the Communist Manifesto to argue for normalizing United States trade with China. **********The gist of that argument?

At long last, he is moving on. **********''My mother agonized about waking me up that morning,'' says Time magazine's bureau chief of the August day in 1971 when he flew from Manila to Hong Kong and then crossed by train into China for what was to have been a three-week tour. She had an inkling that something might go wrong. **********Something did. The longhaired, bell-bottomed Mr. FlorCruz, a well-known student advocate during the waning days of Philippine democracy under President Ferdinand Marcos's increasingly authoritarian rule, had been invited to see China by the Chinese Friendship Association -- an illegal journey under Philippine law at the time. **********While Mr. FlorCruz visited Mao Zedong's revolutionary redoubt amid the caves of northern Shaanxi Province, Marcos suspended the writ of habeas corpus, allowing Philippine security forces to imprison political opponents without presenting them for trial. **********Hundreds of people disappeared, some never to be seen again. Mr. FlorCruz was on Marcos' list of enemies. As a result, he did not leave China again for 12 years. **********At first he did not dare leave. Then he could not leave. And at last, he did not want to leave, having married, had children and built a career as a journalist here. The soft-spoken Mr. FlorCruz, 49, watched the country emerge from Cultural Revolution fanaticism to the brutal pragmatism of the post-Tiananmen Square protest era and became a well-known fixture in Beijing's expatriate community. **********He covered the trials of Mao's widow, Jiang Qing, and the rest of the tyrannical Gang of Four, and he covered the Tiananmen Square student protests that ended in bloodshed in 1989. Under his watch, Time broke the story of Jiang Qing's suicide in 1991. He interviewed Jiang Zemin when he was Shanghai's mayor, and again after he had become the nation's president. **********But Mr. FlorCruz has finally had his fill. He says he has reached the point ''where I can almost write the story without doing any reporting, and so it is time to go.'' He will spend a year in New York on an Edward R. Murrow Press Fellowship at the Council on Foreign Relations. **********Mr. FlorCruz recounted how his early naivete gradually gave way to cynicism toward the Communist Party. But he showed, too, that he has retained a remarkable optimism about the country that became his home. **********''I'm conscious of the need to maintain a distance from politics, to try not to let it color my views,'' he said. ''Just about any change is an improvement from where I started.'' **********His hosts brought him and his friends to Beijing nearly three decades ago, installing them in a small hotel near the heart of the city. His punishment was mind-numbing boredom. He did not speak Chinese and certainly did not read it. The available reading materials in English were arid editions of Chinese propaganda. He and his group soon exhausted the supply of tourist sites, and they were not otherwise allowed to leave the hotel. China is still undergoing class struggle, Mr. FlorCruz recalls being told by his minders. **********Still, he says his enthusiasm for the New China was undaunted. ''We blamed everything on Marcos,'' Mr. FlorCruz said, his face older, his hair shorter, but otherwise little changed in appearance from those days. ''We were still very high on China -- we had that wide-eyed, gee-whiz attitude,'' he added from behind his new, owlish eyeglasses. ''There were no flies! The cops didn't carry guns!'' **********In fact, the group had little idea how turbulent the times were. Mao Zedong's anointed heir, Lin Biao, was in power when they arrived, but gone a month later. Mr. FlorCruz remembers being told that Mr. Lin was killed in a plane crash. (Many people today believe he was shot down while fleeing to the Soviet Union after staging an aborted coup.) Soon, Mr. FlorCruz realized that he and his friends were the only ones still toting Mao's little red book and many people had stopped wearing the Mao pins that had been so ubiquitous. **********The summer turned to fall and fall to winter and Mr. FlorCruz saw his first snowfall. To cure their cabin fever, the group agreed to go work in the countryside along with millions of urban Chinese following Mao's exhortation to bridge the gap between intellectuals and peasants. Mr. FlorCruz and his friends were sent to Mao's home province of Hunan, mistakenly thinking they would escape Beijing's brutal winters in a more southern clime. Instead, they traded their heated Beijing hotel for a frigid, unheated dormitory and left the hotel menu for crude peasant fare. The work was backbreaking but occupied the mind. **********By the time he and his friends returned to Beijing in mid-1972, Marcos had declared martial law, making their repatriation even riskier. Mr. FlorCruz's passport expired the next year, leaving him stateless in China. **********He worked on a Yellow Sea trawler shoveling fish, enrolled in a language school and later earned a degree in Chinese history at Beijing University. He watched the nation convulse when Mao died in 1976. **********In 1983 the Philippine Embassy finally issued him a new passport and he visited home. But by then he had a life in China, where he had started working as a reporter for Newsweek and later Time magazine. After the 1989 massacre, Time helped secure him a visa to the United States in case the bureau needed to be evacuated. He was made Time's bureau chief the next year. **********From the black vinyl sofa that is about the only furniture left in his Beijing home, Mr. FlorCruz summed up how he feels about all that has happened since his mother woke him on that morning 29 years ago: ''It's like a dream.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/11/world/couple-leave-italy-after-rebuff-over-surrogate-motherhood.html": {"writer_name": "Alessandra Stanley", "pub_date": "2000-05-11", "snippet": "First Italian couple to fight medical establishment, as well as Italy's legal system, and win approval for surrogate motherhood gives up and seeks other avenues abroad; case has been widely followed in Italy, where bill that would sharply limit ar...", "word_count": 517, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Couple Leave Italy After Rebuff Over Surrogate Motherhood", "print_headline": "Couple Leave Italy After Rebuff Over Surrogate Motherhood", "body_text": " **********The first Italian couple to fight the medical establishment, as well as Italy's legal system, and win approval for surrogate motherhood gave up this week and are seeking other avenues abroad, their doctor said today. **********The case was widely followed in Italy, where a bill that would sharply limit artificially assisted pregnancies has been blocked in the Senate for a year. The measure has revived a passionate debate about fertility, Italian-style.

''Recent contested cases about surrogate motherhood show the confusion that is created in society to the detriment of the unborn child.'' **********The couple, who have remained anonymous, were the first in Italy to obtain a judge's consent to use a surrogate, which in their case involved implanting the embryo into another woman's womb. **********More than five years ago, they learned that the wife suffered a rare congenital malformation that left her without a uterus, although she was able to produce eggs.

But by then the medical association had blocked Dr. Bilotta from performing the procedure. In 1995, the group issued its code of bioethics, which prohibits surrogate motherhood. **********The couple took their case to court. In February, a Roman judge decided in their favor. The association appealed, but an appeals court upheld the judge's decision. **********The decision would not have set a precedent in Italian law, and the couple's legal standing seemed uncertain. **********Dr. Bilotta explained that the furor also proved so daunting that the two decided to give up on the process in Italy and went abroad. ''The clamor was so intense,'' he said. ''There was so much negative pressure from the church, Catholic politicians and the medical establishment, they decided to go abroad.'' **********He declined to say where exactly they went. Seven states in the United States have clear laws that permit surrogate motherhood. But in Western Europe, just England allows it. **********Dr. Bilotta said the couple were also worried about the legal status of their child after it was born. **********Italy has no law on artificial fertility. Many critics complained about possible abuses in private clinics. Last year, the center-left majority in Parliament wrote a draft bill that sought to improve the regulation of private clinics and broaden couples' choices. But Catholic and center-right politicians reworked the draft, imposing harsh restrictions. **********The draft, now blocked in a Senate committee, sets prison terms for doctors who use donor sperm in artificial inseminations. The bill would also prohibit surrogate motherhood. **********''The Italian medical leadership say they are acting on behalf of the child,'' Dr. Bilotta said.

Then he added, ''It is moving in a way that it should not move, and at the moment we do not know why that is.'' **********A similar attitude of confusion and dismay has seized 10 Downing Street as the Blair government has been buffeted by a series of events in recent weeks that have caused the prime minister's once stratospheric popularity figures to swoon and his three-year-old administration to lose public trust. Labor politicians have expressed alarm at the sudden wobble in the smooth-running administration, and there are calls on Mr. Blair to adjust his approach. According to the new surveys, Mr. Blair, until now the most popular prime minister in British history, is being perceived as distant, controlling and smug. **********Compounding Mr. Blair's problems is that just as he has been losing his touch, William Hague, the Conservative leader who has struggled to make a mark since taking over the party from former Prime Minister John Major three years ago, has been finding his voice. Mr. Hague has seized upon emotive issues like tougher action against asylum-seekers, more protection for homeowners who attack burglars, and reduced increases in pensions, and the Blair government has been cast onto the defensive. **********In The Mail on Sunday, the well-regarded MORI survey showed Mr. Hague only three points behind Mr. Blair, the first time he had ever broken out of double-digit trailing margins. Also for the first time, Mr. Hague is being talked about as a serious competitor in the national election expected next year. **********The survey took place after a humiliating episode last week when Mr. Blair found himself heckled into awkward silence by the 10,000 people attending the convention of the Women's Institute, the rural service organization known for its allegiance to ''jam and Jerusalem'' -- home-bottled preserves from English country kitchens and the Blake poem enshrining ''England's green and pleasant land.'' The women complained that the speech was too political and patronizing. **********The image of a prime minister facing a disapproving crowd of provincial women and not being able to do anything about it but grin sheepishly was displayed across the front pages of newspapers and played repeatedly on television. It was Mr. Blair's first appearance since returning to work after two weeks of time at home with his wife, Cherie, and newborn son, Leo, and it damaged his claim of being sensitive to the concerns of middle England rather than just the ''liberal elite'' that Mr. Hague has accused him of favoring. **********Emboldened, Mr. Hague laid into the prime minister, declaring him ''the most out-of-touch, arrogant, opportunistic, remote prime minister we've every had.'' **********Mr. Blair is finding that he can no longer ride on his party's hard-won reputation for competence, an early goal of his to separate the British public from its traditional suspicion, based on the performance of past Labor governments, that the party could not be trusted to run the country. Starting his fourth year as prime minister, Mr. Blair is being held responsible for the failure of his social programs to produce more immediate gains, and the aggressive British press is uniformly reporting that he has lost his grip. **********Mr. Blair's press spokesman, Alastair Campbell, said today that it was ''business as usual'' at 10 Downing Sreet and that the prime minister was paying no attention to the papers. It was probably just as well since their front pages have been carrying headlines like ''Rattled,'' ''Blair Is Clapped Out'' and, in reference to his savaging by the Women's Institute delegates, ''Handbagged.'' **********Roy Hattersley, a former deputy leader of the party, faulted Mr. Blair for trying to appeal to too broad a gamut of the public. **********''The tent is now so big that all we hear is canvas flapping in the wind,'' he wrote in today's Guardian. Michael Meacher, the Environment Minister, said the government's policies remained right but the presentation was flawed. ''I think we are under pressure now, and we have got to make those facts clear in an unvarnished, straight, clear and honest manner,'' he told a breakfast television show. **********The government has fought back with a populist assault on Oxford and Cambridge based on questionable evidence that they practice class-conscious admissions policies. The debate was prompted by the case of a young woman from a state school in the North who was denied entry to Magdalen College but got a full scholarship from Harvard. In a second effort to placate internal critics,  the government announced today that it would move more aggressively in Parliament to obtain a ban on hunting with hounds, a popular issue with the Labor left. **********What is happening seems not to be in doubt, if what it means still is. **********''Something is going wrong with this government,'' the left-of-center Guardian said in an editorial. ''Friends of Labor will hope this is only a bad case of mid-term blues, but the patient is looking very peaky.'' **********Labor can only wish that a prediction by Lord Foster about the future of his bridge comes true for them. ''I don't want to minimize the issues that are at stake,'' he said today, ''but there's going to be a point when everyone can look back on this as a hiccup.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/16/jobs/life-s-work-a-most-delicate-balancing-act.html": {"writer_name": "Lisa Belkin", "pub_date": "2000-02-16", "snippet": "Lisa Belkin's Life's Work column on balancing career and care for elderly relatives; work of American Business Collaboration for Quality Dependent Care, coalition of 17 big companies that has spent $100 million in last seven years to improve quali...", "word_count": 817, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Job Market", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Most Delicate Balancing Act", "print_headline": "LIFE'S WORK; A Most Delicate Balancing Act", "body_text": " **********WHO made the last dozen calls to your pager or cell phone? Was the boss on your list? The baby sitter? The carry-out place on the corner? Added together, such numbers are likely to form a mosaic of your life. **********Now scroll with me through the calls to Joan Jaffe's cell phone -- a phone she bought as a link to her ailing 91-year-old mother. Added together, such numbers will one day form the mosaic of each of our lives. **********Mrs. Jaffe, a travel agent near Chicago, is one of seven million of us who will care for elderly relatives this year. And her worries -- our worries -- are reshaping the world. ''Demand for elder care is growing faster than demand for child care or school-age care,'' says Barry Wanger, a spokesman for the American Business Collaboration for Quality Dependent Care, a coalition of 17 big companies that has spent $100 million the last seven years to improve the quality of such care in nearly 70 communities. **********On the day he tells me this, his mother is moving into a nursing home and he apologizes for being distracted. ''It's something everyone will go through,'' he says, adding that employers, who have not quite gotten the knack of helping employees through the shoals of child care, ''are just starting to figure this one out.'' **********The first thing they learn -- the first thing each of us will learn -- is that this is different than child care. ''With a child, a healthy child, you can plan,'' says Carol House, a diagnostic veterinary microbiologist who lives in Cutchogue, N.Y., with her 75-year-old mother, who has lung cancer and heart disease and has had a stroke. ''You know when you're going to have the baby. You know that when that baby is 5 he'll go to kindergarten and by the time he's 16 he won't be home as much as you are. With a parent, it can come out of the blue, and you can't promise an employer, 'I'll be back in six weeks.' '' **********And even if you are back at work, there is  a good chance you won't really be concentrating on your job. The infrastructure of elder care is both more complex and less complete than that of child care, says Pat Netsch, a legislative analyst for Chevron in San Francisco, whose 86-year-old mother, paralyzed on one side by a stroke, lived with her until last month when she moved into an assisted-care center. ''Medicare, Social Security, home care,'' she says. ''You have to do that during work hours. You can't do it at home. You can't do it on weekends.'' **********But the biggest difference, the most overwhelming difference, has nothing to do with logistics. Caring for a healthy child is about happiness and hope; caring for a failing parent is about mourning and loss. Caring for a child is about living for the future; caring for a parent is about living in the moment. **********''Once again, I have become a parent,'' says Margaret Tierney, who has two grown children. This time, though, the ''child'' is her 91-year-old father, who lives with her in her home in Suwanee, Ga., but who often does not know where he is or who she is. Instead of 2 a.m. feedings, she says, she is roused in the middle of the night because her father is waiting at the door for a phantom guest or wandering the yard searching, inexplicably, for cans of gasoline. ''My babies,'' she says of her father and her 90-year-old mother, who also lives with her and who is crippled with arthritis. ''My friends will ask me, 'How are your babies?' '' **********To take better care of her ''babies,'' Ms. Tierney, who is a manager at AT&T, telecommutes from home. She has not taken a vacation in two years. Ms. Netsch turned down a promotion that would have required frequent travel. Dr. House retired at age 55. **********Mrs. Jaffe kept her travel agency job. ''Going to work was a godsend to me,'' she says, ''to go there and do something productive.'' But she reordered her life for her mother in so many other ways, helping the elderly woman stay in her own home, surrounded by 24-hour nursing care, during her long battle with lung cancer. The cell phone was the bridge between that home and Mrs. Jaffe's office. ''She's really the only one who had the number,'' she says, and in the final months, when the illness created delusion and panic, there were frequent, frantic calls resulting in white-knuckle dashes, usually in rush-hour traffic. **********Mrs. Jaffe's mother died several weeks ago. When Mrs. Jaffe went back to work, just last week, the cell phone went, too. She powered it on and placed it within reach, though she knew no one was likely to call."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/27/business/after-space-hughes-battles-time-chasing-cable-foes-to-a-web-future.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "2000-02-27", "snippet": "Profile of Hughes Electronics, which having developed successful DirectTV satellite system, and its recent agreement to sell its satellite manufacturing operations to Boeing Co, is now moving into content business, taking stakes in programming ven...", "word_count": 2883, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Chronology", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "After Space, Hughes Battles Time; Chasing Cable Foes To a Web Future", "print_headline": "After Space, Hughes Battles Time; Chasing Cable Foes To a Web Future", "body_text": " **********WHEN Hughes Electronics was first developing a service to beam television programs from satellites to home antennas, skeptics joked that D.B.S., the industry shorthand for direct broadcast satellite, actually stood for ''Don't Be Stupid.'' **********But no one is laughing now -- except, perhaps, for Hughes executives and investors. DirecTV, the service Hughes started in 1994 that transmits as many as 200 channels of digital television to pizza-sized rooftop dishes, has become a major threat to cable television. **********At 8.1 million subscribers and growing rapidly, Hughes is about to become the third-largest provider of pay television in the United States, behind the leading cable operators, AT&T and Time Warner. As the nation's largest distributor of pay-per-view movies, it is a force to be reckoned with in Hollywood. And because it offers multiple channels of Home Box Office, Cinemax and all the Turner Broadcasting services, it distributes more programming created by Time Warner than does Time Warner Cable. **********With its agreement last month to sell its satellite manufacturing operations to Boeing for $3.75 billion, Hughes has finished  a transformation that no other company has made so completely -- from military contractor to consumer and business service company. It took the first big step in that transition late in 1997, by selling its military business to Raytheon. **********''We've got a new company again for the second time in two years,'' said Michael T. Smith, the bookish chairman and chief executive of Hughes, a subsidiary of General Motors. Mr. Smith said the company expects revenue growth of 20 percent to 40 percent a year for the next five years and earnings growth -- excluding interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization -- of 50 percent a year. **********No defense company performs anything like that, and Wall Street certainly likes what it has seen. Shares of General Motors Class H, the tracking stock for Hughes, have doubled since September, while shares of cable companies have performed sluggishly as investors anticipate more inroads by satellite TV. **********But Hughes will not be able to just sit back and let the money roll in. DirecTV now has positive cash flow but is still not profitable -- and will not be until 2001, Mr. Smith said. It is also purely a distributor of entertainment at a time when many distributors are vertically integrated with program providers. **********So Hughes is beginning to move into the ''content'' business, taking stakes in programming ventures and, with its war chest from the Boeing sale, continuing to look for acquisitions. Further evolution is expected, meanwhile, in Hughes's relationship with G.M., perhaps ultimately leading to the spinoff that many investors are craving. **********The biggest challenge, however, involves DirecTV, which now contributes about two-thirds of the company's revenue. Cable operators are investing heavily to upgrade their systems from analog to digital, allowing them to multiply the number of channels they offer and to close the gap with DirecTV. Cable systems are also adding two-way transmission capacity, so they can sell high-speed Internet access and telephone service, potentially leapfrogging what satellite television can offer. **********Indeed, America Online, which agreed last year to invest $1.5 billion in Hughes to deliver Internet service over satellites, plunked down 100 times that much in January to buy Time Warner, in part to gain access to its cable systems. Even Mr. Smith's old boss, the former Hughes chairman C. Michael Armstrong, has switched sides. Now chairman of AT&T, he has made it the nation's largest cable operator through purchases of Tele-Communications Inc. and MediaOne. **********SO for Hughes, the moment is now. It must try to quickly lock in new subscribers before all these new cable systems are in place. And it also must scramble to provide Internet service from space; indeed, the company is promising to begin offering two-way data communications as early as October. **********''Cable's spending all kinds of money to catch up, and when they catch up, we want to be 10 steps ahead of them,'' Mr. Smith said. **********The company's steps into content are being taken gingerly, executives acknowledge, though the logic is clear: having exclusive content would help DirecTV differentiate itself from cable as cable begins to erode DirecTV's advantage in the number of channels offered, and it could also be a new source of profits. **********''Good content is something we are going to want to carry no matter what,'' said Eddy W. Hartenstein, president of DirecTV since its inception. ''If that's the case, why not get in on the front end?'' **********But with its aerospace heritage, it is not clear that Hughes has the mind-set for entertainment. Mr. Smith, 56, who friends say can remember numbers from presentations he has seen months before, spent much of his career in finance at General Motors and ran Hughes's defense business. Mr. Hartenstein, an aerospace engineer by training, began his career working on projects like a spacecraft to Venus. **********Of course, the company's founder, Howard Hughes, wooed starlets and produced movies even as he built and flew planes. But he ended up a billionaire recluse, spending his days sitting naked in a Las Vegas hotel room -- and Hughes's leaders today are not out looking for the next Jean Harlow or Jane Russell. **********''We're not going to buy a studio or anything like that,'' Mr. Hartenstein  said in an interview in his office overlooking Los Angeles International Airport, a reminder of the company's roots. **********Rather, because DirecTV is in a strong position to nurture new programming services by giving them distribution, it will take equity stakes in some of the most promising. Mr. Hartenstein cited a deal with the Action Adventure Network, which produced some shows that had premieres on DirecTV's pay-per-view service. Now the shows are being sold into syndication, and DirecTV gets part of the proceeds. **********Hughes is also expected to announce an investment in NeTune Communications, a company that will use satellites to transmit images shot by movie makers in remote locations back to studios. **********BIG question -- the one that is most on investors' minds -- is whether G.M. will eventually spin off Hughes, which it bought for about $5 billion in 1985 and is now worth about $50 billion. **********On Feb. 1, G.M. announced transactions that would reduce its ownership of the tracking stock to about 35 percent, from 68 percent. But the automaker, which owns 100 percent of Hughes's assets, reiterated that it did not intend to give up the company; G.M. sees Hughes as integral to its plan to provide on-the-road communication services in cars. **********The plan did little to relieve pressure from shareholders for a spinoff. Some G.M. holders want Hughes sold to break out its value from the automaker's limping stock; some Hughes shareholders think the company could grow faster if it were independent. Both stocks slid in February -- until Hughes jumped 17 percent and G.M. rose 6 percent Thursday and Friday, in part on an analyst's report that G.M. indeed was likely to complete a spinoff by 2002. **********Even Hughes executives hint that more may be coming. ''You can't get free in one fell swoop,'' said Mr. Smith, whose older brother, John F. Smith Jr., is chairman of G.M. Possibly in preparation for a spinoff, Hughes has for the first time begun recruiting independent board members. Having sold its auto electronics and satellite manufacturing businesses, Hughes is now selling its research laboratory in Malibu. So there is less technology it can offer G.M. **********What remains is a company that has three main businesses, and all seem well positioned. **********Besides DirecTV, there is Hughes Network Systems, the largest provider of satellite systems used for such purposes as connecting gasoline stations to headquarters for credit card authorizations, or auto dealers to their headquarters to order parts. The third business is Hughes's 81 percent ownership of PanAmSat, the largest owner and operator of commercial satellites used by paging and telephone companies and by cable programming services like Home Box Office. **********Still, it is DirecTV that has fueled Wall Street's enthusiasm. Indeed, as well as Hughes's stock has performed lately, the stock of its pesky satellite TV rival, EchoStar Communications, has done far better, rising eightfold in the last year. That is because EchoStar is a pure play in satellite television. **********A desire to come closer to that profile was one reason that Hughes sold its satellite manufacturing business -- which had also been suffering from manufacturing problems and is being investigated for possible violations of national security laws for its dealings with China. The other reason for the sale was the need for money to finance DirecTV's growth.  But Mr. Smith said there are no plans to spin off DirecTV to shareholders as a truly pure play, because developing Internet services will require coordination between DirecTV and Hughes Network Systems. **********Satellite television has attracted not only rural dwellers who do not have access to cable but also urban consumers who want more channels than cable can provide or are disenchanted by their local cable monopoly's service. Some 70 percent of DirecTV's new subscribers live in areas where cable television is available. DirecTV subscribers pay an average of $58 a month, compared with about $41 for cable subscribers. **********The Carmel Group, a market research firm, forecasts that satellite television companies will add 4 million new subscribers this year to the 11.4 million they had at the end of 1999, while cable providers will lose 500,000. ''It's not a huge loss, but it's a wakeup call,'' said Jimmy Schaeffler, a Carmel analyst. Cable is estimated to have 67 million subscribers. **********Having between them acquired all their competitors, DirecTV and EchoStar now enjoy a duopoly. DirecTV had 8 million subscribers at the end of 1999, compared with 3.4 million for EchoStar, which began what it calls its Dish Network in 1996. (Some 1.4 million of DirecTV's customers are subscribers of Prime star, which DirecTV acquired last year.) The two companies are running neck and neck in the race for new subscribers, with DirecTV adding 1.6 million last year and EchoStar 1.5 million. **********DirecTV has more movies and sports and stronger retail distribution, and several big electronics retailers carry only DirecTV equipment. So EchoStar has fought back with low pricing and promotions. **********In 1996, when satellite dishes were still selling for $500 or more, EchoStar dropped its price to $199, catching Hughes off guard. In response, Hughes decided to defer profits in a race for market share, much as Internet companies now do. DirecTV is now spending about $500 in advertising and incentives to attract each customer -- an amount it says it recoups in 17 months. **********Last month, EchoStar -- whose scrappy chief executive, Charles Ergen, delights in his role as industry renegade -- filed a federal antitrust suit accusing Hughes of paying or pressuring retailers not to carry EchoStar equipment. The suit, filed in Denver, also accuses Hughes of unfairly locking up rights to National Football League games. **********The suit notes that DirecTV stopped doing business last year with Sears, Roebuck, EchoStar's biggest retailer. ''They never directly said it was because of EchoStar,'' said Chuck Cebuhar, Sears vice president for home electronics and home office products. But, he added, ''If you look at their activity, it says they would obviously prefer not to be on the floor with anybody else.'' **********Hughes says the suit is without merit. Mr. Hartenstein said that DirecTV had ''no stated policy'' of demanding exclusive distribution and that retailers are dropped for not performing well. Sports leagues, he added, often make exclusive deals with broadcasters. **********Both DirecTV and EchoStar should get a big boost from a new law that will allow them for the first time to offer local television channels. Until now, satellite subscribers had to get their local channels over the air or by cable -- a situation that has been one of the biggest drawbacks of satellite television. **********For now, the satellite services generally are offering the four major network channels. DirecTV says that as many as 60 percent of subscribers in some cities have opted for the added service at $6 a month, and Hughes is expecting that it will help DirecTV attract two million new subscribers this year. **********Cable, meanwhile, has increased its capacity to carry more than the recent norm of 40 to 80 television channels -- albeit at a tremendous cost. At the end of 1999, digital cable service was available to one-third of all cable customers. But there were 3.75 million digital subscribers, just over 5 percent of all cable customers, following $30 billion in spending by the industry to upgrade its systems since 1996. **********The expanding bandwidth of cable services is already allowing Time Warner to test a video-on-demand service in a suburb of Honolulu. Many cable companies are offering high-speed Internet access, and some sell local telephone service as well -- the latter being a big part of AT&T's cable strategy, for example. **********Hughes is playing catch-up on the Internet front, arguably the most important for its future growth. The company offers Internet access through its DirecPC service, which can transmit information from satellites to personal computers at 400 kilobits a second -- slower than cable modems but about eight times as fast as a conventional modem. **********DirecPC has attracted only about 100,000 subscribers, in part because it requires a telephone line to send information from users' computers.  But the investment by America Online will give Hughes the money for a DirecPC promotion intended to add a million customers in three years. It also plans to offer two-way communications without the need for a phone line, starting in October. **********Still, DirecPC is seen as an interim solution. Hughes is banking most on Spaceway, a $1.4 billion, three-satellite system that is scheduled to begin service in 2003 and will offer higher speeds and higher capacity. **********Hughes is also starting to look beyond satellites to other forms of distribution. The company gave up making cell-phone equipment, but does make equipment for wireless broadband, which uses radio waves to distribute data or video in a city. Hughes might use that technology to offer local channels, Mr. Smith said, freeing up satellite capacity. **********The company is also trying to bolster its management. Divisions have been run as independent fiefs, and it remains to be seen whether Mr. Smith can make the whole greater than the sum of its parts. **********Charles H. Noski, Hughes's chief operating officer, left recently for AT&T. Mr. Hartenstein, seen as being better at growing companies than at managing a big one, was promoted to oversee all consumer operations for Hughes, including DirecTV and Internet operations. **********The company is looking for an experienced manager to run DirecTV in the United States. Mr. Hartenstein, meanwhile, will devote more time to DirecTV's Latin America service, which has been going through a restructuring, and its operations in Japan, where DirecTV lags behind its rival, Sky PerfecTV. Mr. Hartenstein hinted that Hughes might seek to merge the Japanese operation with Sky PerfecTV, owned by the News Corporation, Sony, Softbank and others. **********Still, in the United States, at least, satellite television still has some running room, even as cable strives to catch up. ''We see the growth not slowing down till we get to 30 million,'' Mr. Smith said of satellite television in general. And he fully expects Hughes to garner the biggest part of that growth. **********Coming Soon, Downloads From Up Above **********The battle to offer high-speed Internet access is often seen as being between cable modems and digital subscriber telephone lines. Hughes Electronics and other satellite companies beg to differ. Hughes executives say Spaceway, their satellite-based data system, could be as big a business as DirecTV. **********The $1.4 billion, three-satellite system, scheduled to begin service in 2003, will offer consumers download speeds of about one megabit a second, equivalent to what people get with cable today, although businesses will be able to get speeds of up to 108 megabits a second. **********Cable and high-speed phone lines have a head start. They are already available to some consumers -- and they do not require subscribers to put dishes on their roofs. ''Cable currently has the edge in the urban markets,'' said Tom Eagan, an analyst with PaineWebber. **********Still, by 2004, one-quarter of all homes in the United States will still not have access either to cable modems or to digital subscriber lines, according to the Yankee Group, a market research firm. **********Many other companies are also planning satellite-based Internet service, including DirecTV's big rival, Echostar Communications; Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation; Teledesic, the satellite company backed by Craig McCaw, the cellular telephone magnate, and a start-up called iSky Inc. that is backed by, among others, Liberty Media, the AT&T unit led by John Malone. **********Hughes executives are banking on Spaceway's sophisticated design to give it an edge -- especially among corporate customers, which they expect to be the biggest users. Most satellites receive signals from earth and broadcast them down again in a wide swath. But Spaceway satellites will be like computerized telephone switches in the sky, so that two offices or homes with Spaceway dishes can communicate with each other. **********But some experts say it does not make sense to put computer processing in space, where systems cannot be readily upgraded as technology improves. Moreover, some say, there might not be much demand for one-to-one communications, given the ease of using the Web. **********''Now all we want to do is plug into the Internet,'' said Thomas E. Moore, president and chief executive of iSky. Because it uses a simpler satellite design, iSky says it will spend half as much as Spaceway and be in service two years earlier."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/23/business/investing-another-boom-in-biotechnology-stocks.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-01-23", "snippet": "Stocks of leading biotechnology firms are experiencing run-up of kind experienced in 1991; American Stock Exchange's Biotechnology Index is up 25.6 percent just this year as investors warm to stocks like Amgen and Genentech; Jeffrey Casdin, presid...", "word_count": 759, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Another Boom in Biotechnology Stocks", "print_headline": "INVESTING; Another Boom in Biotechnology Stocks", "body_text": " **********IT'S raining money on the biotechnology sector. **********Momentum investors, their pockets flush with Internet returns, have discovered the world of genomics, monoclonal antibodies and biochemistry laboratories on a chip, and within a few weeks have turned what had been a financing drought into a deluge. **********The American Stock Exchange's Biotechnology Index is up 25.6 percent just this year. **********There have been wild biotechnology run-ups before, most notably in 1991, but nothing like this. Stocks of the leading genomics companies, those that decipher human genes, are up as much as tenfold from their 52-week lows. Recent public offerings by biotechnology companies like Tularik, Caliper Technologies and Maxygen have taken off like Internet stocks. **********''It is biotech's time,'' said Mark Edwards, president of Recombinant Capital, a San Francisco research firm. He said as many as 70 biotechnology companies were poised to become public within the next few months, if the market holds. **********Investors warmed earliest to mature biotechnology stocks like Amgen and Genentech, but the current boom was ignited by the genomics companies, which have piggybacked on the multinational effort to identify all the genes in the human body. By finding, sequencing and patenting genes ahead of the publicly funded labs, these companies hope to alter the way health care is practiced and make lots of money in the process. Six months ago, the entire genomics industry commanded a market capitalization of less than $5 billion; now just one of them alone, Millennium Pharmaceuticals is worth more than that. **********Of course, anyone who bought genomic powerhouses like Millennium, or Human Genome Sciences, both of which have traded below $29 within the past year, looks like a genius given Friday's closing prices of $200.625 and $221.875, respectively. **********But gains like that have even some stalwarts moving money off the table. ''I own the Amgens, and I have owned some of the genomics companies, but at these levels it gets hard to rationalize any investment,'' said Larry N. Feinberg of Oracle Partners L.P., a hedge fund. Nevertheless, he believes the gains are in many cases justified. ''Almost every biotech drug is selling above expectations, and the reason is these are better drugs,'' he said. **********STILL, if justifying the rise in valuations is difficult, it is even tougher to determine where, and how, to put money into the group if you think there is still room for growth. **********For investors interested in the current market leaders, the genomics companies, one tactic is to buy a fixed dollar amount at regular intervals, to take advantage of any market pullbacks. ''For the average investor, it's certainly not wise to plunge and put all your money into genomics today, so you dollar-cost average,'' said Jeffrey Casdin, president of Casdin Capital Partners, a fund that owns several kinds of biotechnology stocks. ''You can't be a market timer.'' **********Mr. Casdin said he saw the genomics companies accelerating their progress from scientific discoveries to novel drugs and diagnostic tests. **********One can also mitigate risk by concentrating on companies with near-term product potential, although most of those stocks have already run up. Dennis Purcell, managing director for life sciences at Chase Hambrecht & Quist, said he believed some companies would grow into their valuations.  ''We do have over 300 products in late-stage clinical trials and a lot of those will pan out,'' he said. ''You are always going to make money on companies that are going to have products.'' **********Mr. Purcell currently favors ImClone Systems, which is in the final stages of clinical trials on a novel cancer drug. ImClone closed Friday at $66.75, or more than six times its 52-week low of $9. **********Another tack is to seek out those companies that have solid fundamentals but are out of favor for one reason or another. These, however, are few and far between. **********As a long-term biotech investor looking for value, Viren Mehta, a fund manager at Mehta Partners, says his current favorite is Elan Corporation of Dublin. Because Elan has a number of products on the market, it is valued like a mid-cap drug company, but it is really a biotechnology firm in disguise, with a novel pain drug in the late stages of clinical trials, and a vaccine for Alzheimer's just entering the clinic. ''Elan is down 25 percent when everyone else is skyrocketing,'' he said.

A total of 44 states are scheduled to convene during 2000, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. During those sessions, the Internet Alliance predicts that there will be more than 2,000 Internet-related bills that will result in a flurry of policy making at the state level. **********\"This will be the big story of the Year 2000,\" said Jeff Richards, executive director of the Internet Alliance, a trade association based in Washington. **********Many of the debates will mirror those that have been going on in Congress for the last year. \"But at the state level, they tend to move much faster,\" Richards said. **********Preliminary indications from Internet Alliance offices around the country are that the top three Internet issues in state legislatures will be privacy, Internet sales and access taxes and content issues like unsolicited commercial e-mail. **********And while lawmakers have matured greatly in their understanding of the new medium and its unique challenges for policy makers, Richards said the industry could still expect to see a number of bad laws. **********\"Legislators are clearly more thoughtful about the Internet. Their parents, their children and themselves are now using the Internet far more than ever before. They now have constituents who are Internet companies and the Internet is becoming a part of everyday life,\" Richards said. \"That same familiarity, however, brings about a tendency to legislate.\" **********\"There will be some terrible laws that will be made -- some laws that are far ahead of their time or don't incorporate reality in the sense that they are meaningless or totally unenforceable.\" **********But there are also some laws that the Internet Alliance, one of the original Internet trade associations that is now owned by The Direct Marketing Association , will be pushing for on behalf of its member companies. **********Emily Hackett, state policy director at the Internet Alliance, says her group will be pushing for the adoption of bills to establish uniform rules to give electronic contracts and signatures the legal weight of their ink and paper counterparts. **********Hackett said her group would also be lobbying for legislation to curb unsolicited commercial e-mail, commonly referred to as spam, by outlawing fraudulent headers in e-mail messages and the tools used to create them. **********\"About 14 states have already passed good spam legislation,\" Hackett said. \"We'll see that continue,\" she said. **********On the privacy front, however, the Internet Alliance will continue to promote industry self-regulation. **********When it comes to Internet taxes, Richards said many states would be discussing how to protect their tax bases from electronic commerce. Although a federal three-year moratorium currently is in place barring states from adopting new Internet use or access taxes, Richards said many states would pass laws to take effect when that ban expires next year. **********Some states also will be looking at laws to increase the collection of sales taxes on Internet sales, like laws requiring that state income tax forms be changed to include a section for residents to claim and voluntarily pay levies on their Internet purchases. **********Another favorite issue for lawmakers at both the state and federal level is Internet content, specifically attempts to limit access to adult sites. \"We think that if the spam bill is implemented, that will take care of a lot of the content issues,\" Hackett said, referring to the fact that a lot of unsolicited e-mail promotes adult Web sites and products. **********Still, Richards said Internet content in general would continue to be a tricky issue for policy makers, even though the Supreme Court has struck down past attempts by federal and state lawmakers to regulate Web sites. \"State legislatures often feel they want to challenge federal lawmakers on constitutional issues,\" Richards said. \"So if there is a place in America where the content issue is debated, it tends to be in the states. They want to push the envelope.\" **********Because of that, one of the Internet Alliance's priorities, Hackett and Richards said, will be to educate state lawmakers about the need to proceed with caution when it comes to regulating the Net. **********Richards said law officers need to first look to apply traditional laws to the Internet rather than hastily passing new ones that cannot be enforced on a global network. **********\"We think enforcement of current laws is always a first priority,\" Richards said. \"When you do that, two things happen: No. 1, You don't veer off into hasty lawmaking. No. 2, we are honest with ourselves and legislate with the idea of enforcement in mind.\" **********Attorneys General Examine Their Role in Internet Regulation **********On a related note, the changing role of the state attorneys general in the age of the borderless Internet will be the focus of a three-day conference being held by the National Association of Attorneys General in Palo Alto, Calif., next week. **********\"This is considered a major deal,\" said James Tierney, a former attorney general in Maine who now works as a consultant on issues affecting state attorneys general. **********\"It is going to be very well attended by attorneys general who, in all honesty, are searching to find out the appropriate level of state involvement in the new economy.\" **********The big question, Tierney said, is: \"Will the traditional attorneys general role, that of consumer protection, survive? Will there be a place for them in this world where millions are making transactions across state borders.\" **********Tierney says he thinks the answer will be a resounding yes. **********\"I think there is a pretty firm commitment by them to maintain an involvement\" both in criminal law enforcement and civil protections for consumers, Tierney said. **********The CAPITAL DISPATCH column is published weekly, on Tuesdays.

Roosevelt plotted to remove Charles de Gaulle as leader of the French resistance at a critical moment in World War II, saying they found him boastful, conceited and deeply biased against Britain and the United States, according to newly released British records. **********''He hates England and has left a trail of Anglophobia behind him everywhere,'' Churchill said in May 1943 in top-secret telegrams to his ministers from Washington, where he was on a White House visit. The British prime minister described the French general as ''vain and even malignant'' and said he suspected him of ''fascist tendencies.'' **********Writing under his telegraphic code name ''Britman,'' Churchill urged his war cabinet to remove de Gaulle, then based in London. To bolster his argument he passed on telegrams he had received from Roosevelt in which the American president labeled the French general ''well-nigh intolerable'' and doubted that de Gaulle enjoyed the support of the French people that he claimed. **********He even had a tart suggestion for what Churchill might do with de Gaulle: ''Possibly you could make him governor of Madagascar.'' **********The irritation between Churchill and de Gaulle has long been known, but the lengths to which the British prime minister was willing to go to rid himself of the man he had championed at the war's outset had not been revealed until now. So sensitive has the Public Record office considered the documents that it kept them secret for 57 years, even though British policy is to declassify most records after 30 years. **********In his calls for the autocratic French leader's head, Churchill was clearly emboldened by Washington's antipathy to de Gaulle. ''When we consider the absolutely vital interest which we have in preserving good relations with the United States,'' he wired his ministers on May 23, ''it seems to me most questionable that we should allow this marplot and mischief-maker to continue the harm he is doing.'' (A marplot is someone who spoils a plot or hinders the success of an undertaking.) **********The war cabinet met that same night and Clement Attlee, the deputy prime minister, and Anthony Eden, the foreign secretary, wired Churchill back, dismissing the American view. ''A precipitate break with de Gaulle would have far-reaching consequences in a number of spheres that the Americans have probably never thought about,'' they said. **********They also quarreled with Roosevelt's attitude about the depths of support de Gaulle enjoyed with the French. ''The de Gaulle they follow is of course an idealized, semi-mystic figure very different from the man we know,'' they said. ''But nothing that Allied propaganda could do would convince the French that their idol has feet of clay, and the removal of de Gaulle would probably have a disastrous reaction on the whole resistance movement.'' **********In May 1943, de Gaulle was fighting for pre-eminence among the expatriate French factions based in North Africa, and the Americans were backing another general, Henri Giraud. By autumn, de Gaulle had won the power struggle for leadership of the Free French movement. **********Churchill accepted his cabinet's rebuff in a reply on May 24, though in a grumpy aside he wondered if Britain's relations with the United States might suffer more from not acting than acting. He said, ''I should be very sorry to become responsible for breaking up that harmony for the sake of a Frenchman who is a bitter foe of Britain and may well bring civil war upon France.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/16/world/challenge-to-premier-threatens-japan-party.html": {"writer_name": "Howard French", "pub_date": "2000-11-16", "snippet": "Japan's Liberal Democratic Party is in danger of losing its dominant position; Prime Min Yoshiro Mori's stark loss of popular support, to less than 20 percent in recent opinion polls, has invited challengers under country's coalition-driven parlia...", "word_count": 785, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Challenge To Premier Threatens Japan Party", "print_headline": "Challenge To Premier Threatens Japan Party", "body_text": " **********The last time a contest for control of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party broke out in the open, in 1992-93, the party was kicked out of power for the first time in decades, though the exodus proved to be brief. **********Now, with the party hobbled by a catastrophically clumsy prime minister, and claimants to his office putting up fortifications for an all-out fight for power, many here have begun to wonder whether the party will lose its dominant position. **********For months Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori's stark loss of popular support -- to less than 20 percent in recent opinion polls -- has shone like a beacon inviting challengers under Japan's coalition-driven parliamentary session. And in recent days, the challenge has finally come out, in the form of a shrewd but risky maneuver by a leading figure of the party, Koichi Kato, 61, who was once its secretary general. **********Just last week Mr. Kato was expressing cautiously parsed formulas about staying away from Parliament if the opposition submits a motion of no confidence in Mr. Mori's government. That stance that seemed to beg for such a motion, since his absence would make it easier to bring down Mr. Mori. **********Since then he has steadily stepped up the pressure on Mr. Mori and his powerful backers from the mainstream of the party, which despite its name is conservative. **********''If Mori stays in power, our nation will disintegrate,'' Mr. Kato said in a recent interview with Asahi Shimbun, a leading newspaper. ''Japan's image in the eyes of the world will only decline.'' **********Mr. Kato's prospects depend on whether he can carry his 45-member parliamentary faction with him and, beyond that, whether others in the party will defect in common cause with the opposition. Most analysts say opponents and supporters of the prime minister in Parliament are narrowly divided on the question of a no-confidence vote. **********Party members say the vote on Mr. Mori's future may occur as soon as next week, after he returns from the meeting of Asian and Pacific leaders under way in Brunei. Several Japanese newspapers today reported comments he supposedly made to a confidant suggesting that he did not expect to be in office by December. **********Mr. Mori's allies, perhaps caught off guard or simply preferring a quieter transition ahead of a critical election for the upper house of Parliament next year, hope to block a no-confidence vote by keeping party members in line. **********The stakes for the party are huge, and many members have reason to fear another election under Mr. Mori. **********In the last parliamentary election, in June, the Liberal Democratic Party suffered major losses as a result of his frequent malapropisms. Since then Mr. Mori has suffered a public relations disaster almost monthly. **********''If Kato leaves, many people will leave the L.D.P., because they don't have very much confidence in the party anymore,'' said Ikuo Kabashima, a professor of political science at Tokyo University. ''But how individual members will behave, in fact, nobody knows yet. People are weighing the situation, and if they sense more opportunity with Kato, then they will leave.'' **********Mr. Kato is a longtime aspirant to the prime minister's post who has advocated sweeping deregulation and greater competition to shake this country out of its economic doldrums, and for him it seems that the struggle has become a matter of political life or death. **********''There is a possibility that he may become prime minister,'' said Yoshimi Watanabe, a Liberal Democratic member of Parliament. ''But this is the last chance for him, and it is a high-risk, high-return situation.'' **********Mr. Kato has been attacked by rivals in the party who say he should leave it if his no-confidence maneuver fails to oust Mr. Mori. **********But kicking him out would give the Liberal Democrats little comfort. Japan's largest opposition group, the Democratic Party, made an unusual call to Mr. Kato to join forces during the last electoral campaign. **********Mr. Kato seems clearly to prefer to remain a Liberal Democrat, but if he were to carry his faction members into such an alliance, the resulting party or coalition would be just a few votes shy of parity with the Liberal Democratic Party. That would be a huge step toward the political realignment into a two-party system that many Japanese say they would like to see. It might also end the Liberal Democrats' long hold on power, which has lasted five decades with only a brief interruption. **********Democratic Party members have restated their interest in such an outcome, while remaining wary of manipulation or double crosses. ''Kato's ideas and policies are quite close to ours,'' Yukio Edano said. ''But we do not want to be used for some struggle within the Liberal Democratic Party. Unless Kato leaves them altogether, we will not tie up with him.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/22/world/putin-bends-clinton-s-ear-hoping-to-halt-missile-shield.html": {"writer_name": "Marc Lacey", "pub_date": "2000-07-22", "snippet": "Pres Vladimir V Putin of Russia meets with Pres Clinton during Group of 8 meeting in Okinawa to argue against American deployment of a national missile shield; Clinton makes clear that he has not made a decision, but intends to make a decision dur...", "word_count": 756, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Putin Bends Clinton's Ear Hoping to Halt Missile Shield", "print_headline": "Putin Bends Clinton's Ear Hoping to Halt Missile Shield", "body_text": " **********At the summit meeting here of eight world leaders, where the focus was unremittingly on harmony, President Vladimir V.

National missile defense was the most attention-getting issue, because it exposed a rift in a well-scripted gathering. **********Mr. Clinton joined Mr. Putin in a casual setting, a private dining room overlooking a hotel pool. Mr. Clinton wore a tan suit and an exhausted look. Mr. Putin, in a dark blue suit, shook Mr. Clinton's hand vigorously for the photographers but offered no Boris Yeltsin-style bear hug. **********Flanked by aides, the two men spent 75 minutes discussing and disagreeing on security issues. **********Of the national missile defense system, a senior administration official said, ''President Clinton made clear, as he has publicly, that he has not made a decision, but he intends to make a decision during the course of this summer.'' **********Mr. Putin, who met recently with the leaders of China and North Korea to solidify opposition to the building of such a system, briefed Mr. Clinton on an offer by the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, to scrap his missile program if other countries provide him with rockets to explore space. American officials have reacted with skepticism. **********''It's not entirely clear what is in Kim Jong Il's mind with regard to this possible trade-off,'' one official said. ''A very dangerous idea would be that the international community would provide actual launch capability to North Korea.'' **********Mr. Putin was not the only leader making the case against a United States missile shield. President Jacques Chirac of France, speaking to reporters, said the system might never work but nonetheless would prompt an arms race. **********''It's of a nature to retrigger a proliferation of weapons, notably nuclear missiles,'' Mr. Chirac said. ''Everything that goes in the direction of proliferation is a bad direction.'' Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany sided with the critics of the system, saying simply, ''I'm skeptical.'' **********But such disagreement was rare. Common ground was what this annual meeting was all about. For instance, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Putin issued a statement saying they would set up a center for the exchange of data between systems that provide early warning in case of a missile launching. **********Leaders of the eight nations discussed other topics ranging from debt relief for developing nations and AIDS to oil prices and financial crime. ''We are deeply concerned about the growth of armed conflict in the continent of Africa,'' said one unanimous decree. **********Official events took place in a majestic seaside resort, the Cape Busena. Journalists, protesters and even top aides were stopped in their tracks at the front door. Few people with last names other than Clinton or Blair or Amato or Chirac or Chretien or Mori or Putin or Schroder could stroll easily through the metal detectors. **********All of the leaders seemed to be sweating, and plainly not because of the intensity of the meeting. Mr. Chirac was wiping his forehead in the heat as he stopped in the hotel lobby to admire Okinawan schoolchildren in traditional dress who were beating drums and singing. **********Mr. Clinton's schedule included the trivial, the serious and the in-between. This morning Mr. Clinton and Japan's Prime Minister, Yoshiro Mori, sat down to discuss economic and foreign policy issues. Later, they planted a tree together. **********In the giant media centers set up in hotel ballrooms across the island to accommodate the thousands of reporters covering the meeting, ''officials,'' ''senior administration officials'' and some people actually willing to use their real names briefed them on everything from the volatility of oil prices to the illicit trade in  diamonds in Africa. **********''On the area of debt reduction, there was a very lengthy and very good exchange,'' Lael Brainard, Mr. Clinton's adviser on international economic issues, said on Friday. **********The Middle East also came up repeatedly, as leaders congratulated Mr. Clinton on his peacemaking efforts.

''They lost the broader fight over whether their service is regulated or not.'' **********But AT&T executives disputed that assessment, arguing that it was premature to conclude that federal regulators would force them to open their cable lines to rivals. ''This is a complete victory,'' said Mark C. Rosenblum, an AT&T vice president. ''Our point was that local authorities are not allowed to regulate telecommunication services, and we won.'' **********Federal Communications Commission officials said the decision was likely to bring all sides in the dispute to Washington for clarification. **********Until now, the officials said, neither the cable industry nor its opponents had sought regulators' guidance on their view of the cable modem business. A central issue is whether cable modem operators are more like cable companies, which are not required to open their lines to rivals, or more like telephone companies, which must. **********''These are open questions on which the commission has not yet ruled and presumably will rule soon,'' an F.C.C. official said. ''I suspect all of this will be brought to our doorstep very soon.'' **********More generally, the F.C.C. has embraced a policy it calls ''vigilant restraint'' with regard to Internet access, arguing that the marketplace -- not the government -- should determine which technologies prevail and which fall by the wayside. **********The case stemmed from a Portland City Council decision in December 1998 to make the transfer to AT&T of a cable franchise owned by Tele-Communications Inc. contingent on AT&T's opening access to its high-speed Internet connections. In June of last year, a federal judge in Portland upheld the move, despite objections from AT&T that regulatory authority belonged to the federal government. **********The outcome of the case is of growing interest to major telecommunications providers, Internet access companies and a growing number of consumers seeking higher-speed Internet access. **********Access to the Internet over cable lines is one of the nascent technologies proffered as a high-speed alternative to the conventional dial-up Internet access, but its distribution has been held up in part by questions of whether local governments can decide who controls the lines. **********In light of today's decision, AT&T said it would start offering the At Home cable modem service in Portland starting Friday. The company had refused to offer access previously because the Portland City Council mandated that if AT&T offered its At Home service, it would have to offer service to rivals, as well. **********In December, AT&T announced plans to give rivals access to its cable lines to deliver Internet access, asserting in a letter to the F.C.C. that access would be available by 2002. The company said it could not open the lines before that time because it had an exclusive deal to lease those lines to At Home, a high-speed cable service in which AT&T holds a stake. **********Starting in November, AT&T plans to conduct a trial in Boulder, Colo., in which rival Internet access providers will share the same cable lines. AT&T says the effort will help it address unresolved technical problems with open access. But several local governments across the country, including Portland's, have sought to force AT&T's hand, arguing that competition will yield faster, better-quality Internet access. **********Erik Sten, a Portland city commissioner, said today that the city had not decided whether to appeal the decision, in part because city officials viewed it as a partial victory. ''If the decision is interpreted as we think it will be,'' he said, AT&T will be deemed to be a telecommunications service provider and thus required to open access on a national level. **********In its decision, the Ninth Circuit wrote that the ''principle of common carriage governs cable broadband as it does other means of Internet transmission such as telephone.'' **********Portland, along with a coalition of Internet service providers, pointed to the language of the decision as evidence that AT&T will ultimately be subject to the same regulatory requirements as local telephone companies, which must open their lines to rivals. **********''Open access is the law of the highest court that has reviewed this,'' said Greg Simon, co-director of the openNET Coalition, a group of Internet companies that supported Portland and other municipalities. ''The law is now open access in the Ninth Circuit.'' **********But Mr. Rosenblum of AT&T said that even if the cable modem business were construed as a telecommunications service, it would not necessarily be subject to open-access requirements. **********The F.C.C. official said, meanwhile, that just because the Ninth Circuit defined AT&T as a telecommunications service did not mean that the decision was a binding legal conclusion. The official said the question before the court was about Portland's right to regulate AT&T, not about how AT&T's status should be defined before the F.C.C. **********The official, as well as executives from AT&T, also said that the court decision stated clearly that even if the cable modem business were deemed a telecommunications service, federal regulators had broad powers to exempt the technology from open-access requirements."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/11/world/hilversum-journal-europe-s-reality-tv-chains-and-big-brother.html": {"writer_name": "Edmund Andrews", "pub_date": "2000-04-11", "snippet": "Article on Endemol Entertainment Holdings, Dutch entertainment group operated by John de Mol that develops and exports voyeuristic television game shows across Europe (Hilversum Journal); photo; map (M)", "word_count": 1252, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hilversum Journal; Europe's 'Reality' TV: Chains and Big Brother", "print_headline": "Hilversum Journal; Europe's 'Reality' TV: Chains and Big Brother", "body_text": " **********Oprah Winfrey dropped out of shock television long ago. Maury Povich migrated from audience shout fests to the million-dollar quiz biz. Even Fox TV was shaken enough by the fallout from ''Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?'' to quash a plan to crash a jet into the desert for prime-time entertainment. **********But a European producer, John de Mol, is convinced that ''reality'' television has not come close to the boundaries of the possible. Witness his latest brainstorm, ''Chains of Love,'' a post-millennial evolution of ''The Dating Game'' that had its premiere last week on Dutch television. **********In ''Chains,'' four men compete for a date with one woman, or vice versa, while all five are chained together in handcuffs and ankle irons for five days. The woman cuts the suitors loose one at a time until the one man left on the last day gets a big cash prize and the date. **********Too outlandish for the United States? Perhaps. But Mr. de Mol, chief executive of Endemol Entertainment Holdings, is already exporting voyeuristic game shows across Europe, and CBS will soon be producing his most recent hit show, ''Big Brother.'' **********Making good on the Orwell reference, ''Big Brother'' is a game show based on five men and five women who are sealed for 100 days in a house where cameras and microphones record them 24 hours a day. Every two weeks, viewers vote to oust one of the characters. At the end, the surviving player wins about $125,000. **********In Germany, television regulators in the state of Hesse were so offended by ''Big Brother'' that they tried to ban it last month. They failed, and the one-hour show is now drawing about 2.5 million, or 15 percent of viewers, six nights a week. **********If ''Big Brother'' catches on with Americans, Mr. de Mol is ready to export scores of other shows to the United States There is ''The Bus,'' where contestants ride cross-country for 16 weeks. Or ''In the Money,'' in which roving camera crews offer people money to do things like sit on raw eggs and imitate a hen. **********And there is ''Now or Never,'' a pilot program Mr. de Mol has produced with Jerry Springer, the bad boy of American talk-show hosts. In ''Now or Never,'' which has not yet been picked up by broadcasters, Mr. Springer plans to confront guests plagued by strange phobias. **********''Right now, I can look at our catalog and think of 20 or 25 formats which could work in the United States,'' Mr. de Mol said, sitting behind his huge, delta-shaped glass desk in his headquarters here. **********Right or wrong, Endemol Entertainment is part of an important change in European media. Until recently, European commercial broadcasters relied overwhelmingly on American shows -- dubbed versions of Melrose Place, locally produced clones of ''Wheel of Fortune'' (''Glucksrad'' in Germany) and brazen imitations of talk-show hosts from Oprah to David Letterman. **********The big reason was that most European countries did not even begin commercial television until 15 years ago. Before that, most television was government-owned and taxpayer-financed, more educational than American television but less entertaining. **********That situation changed radically after the mid-1980's, when governments gave licenses to for-profit broadcasters, and cable television vastly expanded the number of channels reaching the homes. **********Now, spurred by big demand for new programming, European producers are filling more of the gap, often with astonishing results. **********Europeans have been leading the charge in voyeuristic ''reality based'' shows. It was a British company, Celador, that created ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' Another British company, Castaway, developed ''Survivor,'' a game show in which contestants are dropped onto a desert island. **********But it is Endemol that has dominated the production of game shows at the very edge of television. The company was created just four years ago when Mr. de Mol merged his television company with that of Joop van Ende, a well-known Dutch theater and television producer. **********The two men set their sites on creating programs that could easily be cloned for the rest of Europe. They also started buying smaller production companies in France, Portugal, Spain, Germany and Italy. **********Today, Endemol produces nearly 400 separate television ''formats,'' seizing on game shows and other reality-based programs as the easiest to export. In 1999, Endemol's sales reached 963 million Dutch gilders, about $414 million, and they are expected to top 1 billion gilders this year. **********It was ''Big Brother,'' begun in the Netherlands last year, that really put Endemol on the map. Though it sounds like a knock-off of shows like MTV's ''Real World,'' Mr. de Mol took pains to give it added edge. **********After carefully selecting attractive young people in their 20's and early 30's, the producers look for ways to promote tension and conflict. **********The contestants have no idea what viewers think of them, as viewers log their preferences on the show's Web site. **********The contestants are also given ''assignments,'' like chopping wood to keep a fire going for 24 hours. But the main source of tension, besides being recorded on camera at all times, is that the contestants have to vote their recommendations to viewers for throwing one another out of the house. **********Though the show was a smash hit in the Netherlands and is now attracting about 15 percent of the audience at 8 p.m. in Germany, critics say it is often dull. **********In Germany, the highlight of the show recently came when a mechanic named Zladko, who had been recommended to leave, accused the other contestants of ganging up on him. **********Despite dullness, the show has mesmerized the media and many young viewers in both the Netherlands and Germany. When the first contest reached its final vote in the Netherlands on Dec. 30, one-quarter of the population tuned in to watch. **********In Germany, where the first contest began one month ago, ''Big Brother'' attracted a torrent of advance publicity and ethical debate.  When a contestant named Despina voluntarily quit the show after the first week, she became front-page news in Bild, the country's biggest-circulation newspaper. **********''My explanation is that our everyday life has become very boring and nondramatic,'' said Jens Jessen, chief culture editor of Die Zeit, the German newsweekly. ''People are missing the real life in their lives, so they want a substitute life.'' **********A 23-year-old student near Dortmund, who was bounced from ''Big Brother'' on the first vote, said he had not been burdened by the loss of his his privacy. But the student, Thomas, who is prohibited from giving his last name until the current contest is over, predicted that the show was in real danger of becoming boring once the novelty of the concept wore off. **********''I think there will be more of these kinds of shows in Germany,'' he said.  ''But I don't know how far you can take it. You will have to change the concept, make it more interesting. So they've now thought up the idea of chaining people together, and that in my opinion is at the boundary of shamelessness.'' **********Mr. de Mol is not worried. Last month, thanks in large part to ''Big Brother,'' the Spanish telephone company Telefonica reached a deal to acquire Endemol Entertainment for approximately $5 billion in Telefonica stock. **********Mr. de Mol will turn over his job as chief executive officer, but remain in charge of developing new programs.  And he clearly has not exhausted all the possibilities. **********''I can't answer answer the question that has been asked 100,000 times, which is 'where are the limits and how far are you going?' '' he said. ''You can't give a general answer to that. You have to take it on a case-by-case basis.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/24/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-bates-will-handle-four-pfizer-brands.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "2000-11-24", "snippet": "Pfizer reassigns creative duties on four consumer brands to Bates Worldwide; two of brands had been handled by J Walter Thompson and two by Bozell Group (M)", "word_count": 168, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bates Will Handle Four Pfizer Brands", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Bates Will Handle Four Pfizer Brands", "body_text": " **********Pfizer has reassigned creative duties on four consumer brands to Bates Worldwide in New York, part of the Cordiant Communications Group.

Now, two European asset managers are getting in touch with their softer side. **********BNP Paribas began a campaign in November for its Parvest umbrella fund featuring the face of the Italian supermodel Carla Bruni. And Schroders Asset Management, in a campaign running since October, is introducing a series of global mutual funds with the help of four women -- one for each region of the world in which the funds will operate -- with the tag line, ''The most beautiful investment in the world.'' **********Beautiful has not typically been a word used to describe mutual funds. **********''I can't picture any U.S. ads that have used fashion models,'' said Russell Kinnel, director of fund analysis for Morningstar, the financial information company. He added that Americans tend to be a bit more ''fuddy duddy'' than Europeans when it comes to investments. ''The U.S still has a touch of the old bank sell: 'Trust your money with us.' '' **********That's not to say that the American mutual fund industry is devoid of humor. The Fidelity Investments unit of the FMR Corporation has had advertisements featuring Peter Lynch, the famed money manager,  with Lily Tomlin, the comedian. But generally, Mr. Kinnel said, ''ads tend to put up a big number: either the trailing three-year return, or the star rating.'' **********Breaking away from that convention was exactly what BNP Paribas had in mind when it developed its new advertisements, said Antoine Sire, head of corporate communications for the French bank. **********''We conducted a study that showed there was a standard style of advertisement for asset managers that tended to focus on sports themes,'' he said. ''So we tried something new.'' **********The campaign's departure from the norm owes something to changes that have taken place since BNP merged with Paribas last year. **********Historically, Paribas kept a low profile when it came to brand awareness. Advertising for its Parvest family of funds, which are listed in Luxembourg and marketed to wealthy individuals, was equally discreet. ''We decided coming out from the merger, we should try to stand out,'' Mr. Sire said. **********So when BNP's longtime advertising agency, Euro RSCG Worldwide, a unit of Havas Advertising, came to Mr. Sire with the face of an unknown model in a campaign parodying traditional beauty ads, his only complaint was: Let's use a famous face. **********Shot by the Italian photographer Paolo Reversi, the campaign features a close-up of Ms. Bruni's face with arrows fanning out from her eyes, nose and mouth. Under one eye, where crow's feet tend to develop, are the words ''Extra vitality, nine new sector sub-funds.'' **********The idea was to show that ''our mutual funds will have a similar effect as beauty products,'' Mr. Sire explained. ''They will ease wrinkles, and you will appear younger. And less worried.'' **********The campaign, which cost $3 million, triple what Parvest spent last year, is running in European newspapers and magazines and will start in Asia next year. The ads will not run in the United States, where BNP Paribas lacks the sales force to support the product, Mr. Sire said. **********This may not be the last time that Ms. Bruni's face graces a BNP Paribas advertisement. ''We've entered into an agreement that allows us to use Carla for other investment products -- but only for those at the top of the range,'' Mr. Sire said. **********Schroders, too, was looking for a departure from the tried and true when it began its beautiful campaign, but for a different reason. **********''Traditionally, ads for the investment industry have been performance related,'' said Robert Higginbotham, Schroders' retail marketing director for Britain. ''That can be a powerful way to get a message across to investors driven by greed and fear.'' **********The Schroders problem was that it had no performance to boast about, given that these eight funds opened on Dec. 1. Schroders also wanted a way to convey quickly the idea of ''style investing'' -- that is, buying a value fund, or a growth fund -- to a British public unfamiliar with the notion, Mr. Higginbotham said. **********''The concept of style investing in mutual funds is big in the States,'' he explained. ''But it hasn't really taken off over here for lack of products.'' **********Schroders is moving into this area with its Style Collection. The group consists of a pairing of funds -- one value and one growth -- in four regions of the world: Britain, Europe, Japan and the United States. **********''We're launching eight funds, as opposed to one specific product,'' Mr.  Higginbotham said.

''I'm panic-buying,'' he said. **********He was lucky to find fuel at all. More than 1,000 gasoline stations across Britain were forced to close today as groups of protesters, furious at high fuel prices, blockaded oil refineries, cutting off fuel deliveries and sending consumers rushing to the pumps in a mad race to fill their cars before the gasoline ran out. **********The protests -- by truck drivers, farm workers and taxi drivers -- were echoed by similar demonstrations in Belgium, where truck drivers paralyzed the center of Brussels. **********That irate mood was sweeping across Europe. Groups in Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands and Germany, emboldened by the success of French protests last week -- which resulted in the government's decision to lower fuel taxes by 15 percent -- mounted or prepared to mount their own actions. **********The rising cost of gasoline is a huge irritant to consumers, and a serious threat to some industries in Europe, where enormous government taxes have resulted in gasoline prices that can be more than twice as high as those in the United States. **********But prices in Britain are the highest of all. The current price of premium fuel is about $4.37 a gallon, of which 76.2 percent goes to taxes. **********''It's a wonder anybody can afford to drive in this country,'' said Mark Ostron, 45, who had his gas-buying hopes dashed at the Old Brompton Shell station this afternoon when it became apparent that there was no more super unleaded. Normally, he said, it costs him about 55 pounds -- or $83 -- to fill up his Ford Escort. **********The consumer anger has presented Prime Minister Tony Blair with an unpleasant political problem.  Today's events brought unhappy memories of the dark days of 1973, when fuel was rationed and there were endless waits at gas stations. The Conservative government lost the next election. **********But today Mr. Blair said he was determined not to capitulate to public pressure by lowering the fuel tax. **********''We cannot and will not alter government policy on petrol through blockades and pickets,'' he said, speaking at a conference on e-commerce in Loughborough, central England. ''That's not the way to make policy in Britain.'' **********The prime minister also denied rumors that Britain's fuel supplies were in danger of running out. ''The sensible way, the only way, to deal with this problem is to put pressure on OPEC,'' he said. Still, the government did invoke special powers, dating from 1976, to ensure that supplies of fuel are distributed. It did not detail exactly what it would do, however. **********The protests have been varied. In the center of Liverpool, taxis choked traffic circles and key roads. On some highways, deliberate slowdowns by truck drivers resulted in mass delays. Blockades by haulers ground deliveries to a halt, or severely curtailed them, at refineries. **********Gasoline was rationed -- $15.50 worth per customer -- in parts of Wales and the Midlands. In some areas of the country, ambulances were told to keep to a 55 miles-per-hour speed limit. **********By tonight, the Petrol Retailers' Association was estimating that 2,000 British gas stations had already run out of fuel or were about to do so. Texaco reported that a third of its stations had shut down. And in Leeds, suppliers warned that the city's pumps could be dry by morning. **********''Until now, this demonstration has been carried out by haulers and people in the agricultural sector,'' said Roy Holloway, director of the fuel retailers' group. ''But this could swing the motorists behind these two groups and give the government a serious problem indeed.'' **********At a Shell station in London, Amanda Brownell was not worried about traffic slowdowns or protests.  She was worried about getting some gasoline for her Vauxhall Tigra, whose gauge was on empty. And the unleaded fuel pumps were empty. **********Ms. Brownell, 30, an Internet designer, said, ''There's only one other petrol station near here, and I don't think I'm going to make it.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/05/news/philippines-faces-long-guerrilla-war-on-mindanao-a-victory-but-no-peace.html": {"writer_name": "Don Kirk", "pub_date": "2000-08-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1626, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Philippines Faces Long Guerrilla War : On Mindanao, a Victory but No Peace", "print_headline": "Philippines Faces Long Guerrilla War : On Mindanao, a Victory but No Peace", "body_text": " **********CAMP SARMIENTO, Philippines\u2014                     The bullet-spattered walls of the local mosque, the crumpled heaps of flimsy homes, the craters by the dirt road all testify to the ferocity of the attack a month ago on what was once the military headquarters of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. **********Philippine marines proudly show the remains of the building.

Some wanted aspirin, others cold medicine. One just wanted a place to cry because she had flunked a math test. **********Soon, however -- as soon as the nurse here gets her supply -- students will also be able to pick up morning-after pills. **********Last month, France became the first country in the world to give its school nurses the right to dispense emergency contraception pills. The pills are to be available in both high schools and junior high schools, where students are as young as 12. Although the nurses are advised to make efforts to inform the child's parents, they do not have to. **********French health and education officials hope that the policy will help reduce unwanted pregnancies among teenagers and lower the country's abortion rate, among the highest in the European Union, and stubbornly so, because it has not dropped despite the easier availability of contraception in the last decade. **********While the measure does face opposition from some parents and family rights groups around the country, it has found wide support here. **********Women's groups, abortion rights activists and some parents groups see it as a major step toward making contraception more accessible to young people, even those who live a long way from family-planning clinics, those who can not afford to buy the pills and those who are too shy to go to the local pharmacist, who may know everyone in the village. **********The school nurse's union has also hailed the measure as a positive step. Many nurses, like Chantal Broal, who runs the infirmary at the high school here, believe that they will be able to ease the burden on terrified young girls who made a mistake. **********In this working-class city on the outskirts of Paris where many of the students come from North African immigrant families who rarely discuss sex with their children, Ms. Broal says there are unwanted pregnancies every year. ''Having a pill that can help is a lot better than standing around with my arms at my side,'' Mrs. Broal said recently between tending to students. **********Despite days of banner headlines on the subject, few youngsters who stopped by the infirmary even knew about the new policy. **********But even in a country that has often been a leader in contraception issues, some parents and family rights groups are saying the government has gone too far this time. Some say the it is usurping the role of the parent and is encouraging casual sex. Worse still, some say, it may be inadvertently promoting the use of the morning-after pill when the need for condoms to prevent sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS, should be emphasized. **********''It is a complex issue,'' said Christian Ganet, the president of Parents of Public School Students, the more conservative of the two federations of parent associations in France, which has denounced the school distribution program. ''There are a lot of facets to this thing. On the one side there are advantages. If you did a survey there is an advantage to a number of children, but from the other side how many will begin to rely on this and become H.I.V.-positive?'' **********The decision to make the morning- after pill available to schoolgirls follows a decision last June by the French government to allow pharmacists to sell the medicine over the counter without a prescription. France is also the only country to do that. To be effective, the pill, marketed here under the brand name Norvelo, must be taken within 72 hours of having sex. It works by preventing a fertilized egg from implanting itself in the womb. Similar pills are available in the United States and about 15 countries in Europe but only with a prescription. England alone is currently testing a program that would allow specially trained pharmacists to sell such a pill without a doctor's approval. **********The Norvelo pill is not the same as RU-486, or methapristone, which can terminate pregnancies up to 12 weeks after conception. In its literature, the French government describes Norvelo as a ''late contraception'' pill, though Catholic groups take offense at that. **********''They are kidding themselves,'' said Francoise Meauze, the vice president of the National Confederation of Catholic Family Associations. ''This is an abortion pill, too, and distributing it like this is not right. There is a banalization of sex going on. And of course the big danger is that the kids will just keep going back and back again for another pill.'' **********Ms. Meauze, like others who have come out against the program, says she is shocked at the way that French government decided on distributing the pill, after hardly consulting anyone involved. Mr. Ganet, the leader of one parent group, said he was not informed of the decision before it was announced. **********But French officials say the decision was carefully thought out, if not widely discussed. ''No decision like this is wholly without flaws,'' said Segolene Royal, the deputy minister of education who announced the decision at a conference for school nurses on Nov. 26. ''But at the same time there exists a universal morality that demands that we relieve human suffering when we can.'' **********School nurses could have begun dispensing the pills on Jan. 8, but nurses were on their own to order the pills, and nothing was in place by then in most schools. **********The decision was touched off in part by a government-commissioned report looking into abortion practices, 25 years after abortion was legalized here. The author of the report, Dr. Israel Nisand, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Strasbourg University, recommended the measure and the institution of sex education after discovering that French adolescents, who receive virtually no sex education, were horribly misinformed. **********Dr. Nisand found that many youngsters believe that they could not get pregnant until they have had sex several times. They also believe that having sex when they are menstruating is risk-free. And, he said, they often do not use condoms correctly. **********''The people who mix up a discussion about the morning-after pill with AIDS are really masking other motives,'' Dr. Nisand said. ''Right now, the youngsters have a far greater risk of getting pregnant and an abortion at the age of 14 is very traumatic. If you can prevent only a few hundred of those it is a good thing.'' **********Though a largely Catholic country, France has for a long time given students confidentiality when they sought advice on contraception, and condoms have been available in French schools for years. **********But abortions have failed to decline in the last decade. Each year, about 220,000 abortions are performed in France, about 6,700 on adolescents under the age of 18. Based on the most recent figures available for France, from 1995, 10.5 of every 1,000 girls under the age of 20 had an abortion, according to the World Health Organization. By comparison, the rate of abortion in 1995 in Germany was 6.8, in Italy 6.3, in Spain 4.5. The United Kingdom has a higher rate at 18.5. **********Former eastern bloc countries, where other forms of birth control used to be very difficult to obtain, continue to have far higher abortion rates, in many cases more than 30 per 1,000. In 1996, the rate of abortion among girls between the ages of 15 and 19 was 29.9 per 1,000 girls, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States. **********Some students at the Lycee La Plaine de Neauphle, the high school in Trappes, squirmed with embarrassment at the idea of going to the infirmary to get either condoms or the morning-after pill. ''Maybe,'' said Isabelle Sohet, 17, looking doubtful. ''If you were in real trouble.'' **********But like several other students, she wondered whether the easy availability of the pill would make it that much harder to convince the boys to use a condom. ''It's hard to know what is good policy,'' she said. ''I can see, too, that having that pill could really save your life some time, so this is a hard question.'' **********Ms. Broal, who runs the infirmary, says she can not begin to guess whether there will be a lot of demand for the pill. Until now, she pointed out, girls who needed it had no reason to come see her. ''But if they know it's here,'' she said, ''they may come.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/18/business/preludes-marriage-insurance-for-the-young.html": {"writer_name": "Abby Ellin", "pub_date": "2000-06-18", "snippet": "Abby Ellin Preludes column notes more young couples are signing prenuptial agreements, a trend that reflects their improved economic standing and greater objectivity regarding the prospects of divorce; notes prenuptial contracts had been more comm...", "word_count": 784, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Marriage Insurance for the Young", "print_headline": "PRELUDES; Marriage Insurance for the Young", "body_text": " **********HERE is a happy thought during this month of matrimony, this saison d'amour: Of the nearly 230,000 marriages that begin in June, more than half will end in divorce, and of those, about 60,000 will involve heated legal battles. **********Young adults, of course, account for the bulk of the people making trip No. 1 to the altar: in 1998, the average bride was 25 years old, the average groom 26.7. **********The good news is that young people today -- some of whom, as we have heard ad nauseum, are worth millions -- know full well the connubial risks.

''I thought he was the delivery boy. He didn't have much money, but he had these options worth $12 million.'' **********Prenuptial agreements have grown in specificity. Once they mainly protected an inheritance, ''but now you can protect everything -- business, homes, how much child support there will be,'' said Seymour J. Reisman, a divorce lawyer with Reisman, Peirez & Reisman in Garden City, N.Y., who also sees many young clients. ''There are a lot of different choices for people to make.'' And waltzing down an aisle need not be one of them: many lawyers write these agreements for unmarried people who live together. **********Kalman C. Sporn runs a New York Internet management company with his name on the door. He is 29, worth in the low single millions, presently unmarried and completely pro-prenup. Many of his clients in the dot-com world have them, and he would insist that any spouse of his sign one. ''You look at the people who were in love and are now divorced, and you realize that so many had hidden agendas,'' he said. ''I'm a purist. I believe a couple should share everything. But a part of me is distrustful: I want to know I'm protected if something goes wrong.'' **********Of course, there is still a stigma attached to the little document, which typically costs from $500 to $1,000. Plenty of people hesitate to acknowledge marrying for any reason but dewy-eyed wonder -- or that their assets might mean more than their mates. ''Usually the moneyed spouse wants to sign and the other doesn't,'' said Mr. Reisman, who has seen couples split up over the terms. **********Some people attribute the rise in prenuptial agreements among the dot-com set to youthful anxiety in an uncertain economy. **********''The prenup is just another way of young kids' pumping up their ego or being underconfident about what their real abilities are,'' said Avi Moskowitz, 36, chief executive of Virtual Communities, which builds online portals. ''No one's seen these Internet companies exist for more than three or four years, so no one knows what's going to happen.'' **********This week, Mr. Moskowitz will celebrate his 14th wedding anniversary. He says he understands why some people might want a prenuptial agreement as a safety net, but he and his wife and business partner, Helen Moskowitz, do not have one. ''A prenup essentially says we may stay together, but we may also carve out some things that are yours and some that are mine, which overemphasizes the material aspects of the relationship,'' he said. **********He is right. Ideally, anyway, we should all say ''I do'' with the proper amount of optimism and hope; we shouldn't worry in advance about who'll get the stock options, the Lexus or the 'N Sync CD's. We should plan for the best -- or at least learn to part amicably without needing written instructions. **********Or maybe, as Mr. Felder suggests, society needs to rethink the matrimonial institution. ''There never was an instrument people would buy if it only worked half the time,'' he said. ''Yet people are getting married knowing there's a failure rate of 50 percent. It's truly amazing.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/30/world/barak-asked-clinton-to-raise-embassy-issue.html": {"writer_name": "Jane Perlez", "pub_date": "2000-07-30", "snippet": "Clinton administration officials say Pres Clinton, in raising prospect of moving American Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, responded to unusual request made by Israeli Prime Min Ehud Barak as he left failed Camp David peace talks; national security...", "word_count": 629, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Barak Asked Clinton To Raise Embassy Issue", "print_headline": "Barak Asked Clinton To Raise Embassy Issue", "body_text": " **********In raising the prospect of moving the American Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, President Clinton was responding to an unusual request from Prime Minister Ehud Barak as he left the failed Camp David peace talks to help shore up his political position back home, administration officials said today. **********The president's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, said today that President Clinton had decided to use an interview on Israeli television Friday as a platform to support Mr. Barak, who had explained to Mr. Clinton the difficult political situation he faced in Israel during a parting conversation at Camp David. **********''The president said that the United States would stand by those who took risks for peace,'' Mr. Berger said. He acknowledged that Mr. Clinton's statement on Jerusalem was more ''forward leaning'' than in the past and closer to a readiness to make the move. **********The seemingly spontaneous remark from the president, who said unprompted that he had ''always wanted'' to move the embassy to Jerusalem, was actually carefully vetted beforehand by American negotiators who had accompanied Mr. Clinton to Camp David, and came after Mr. Barak had specifically asked Mr. Clinton to raise the issue. **********In addition to his appeal to Mr. Clinton, Mr. Barak also called a number of congressmen on Thursday asking them to introduce a resolution on moving the embassy, according to officials familiar with the calls. **********Among those Mr. Barak telephoned was the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, and Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, who is chairman of the Appropriations Committee. **********A senior American official acknowledged today that Mr. Clinton believed that moving the American stance forward might  help Mr. Barak survive a no-confidence vote scheduled in Parliament for Monday. **********Mr. Barak, who returned home to raucous criticism in Parliament for the concessions he was prepared to make to the Palestinians -- including on the status of Jerusalem -- is considered absolutely vital by the administration for any chance of continuing the peace talks. **********The administration has been monitoring political developments in Israel almost hourly as Mr. Barak faces the no-confidence vote. By some calculations, if he loses the votes of only two legislators who supported him on the last no-confidence vote, he will be forced to call new elections. Mr. Barak lost his parliamentary majority on the eve of coming to the Camp David talks. **********Explaining Mr. Clinton's television appearance, Mr. Berger said, ''We decided it was important to speak to the Israeli people and tell them the kind of leadership Barak had shown at Camp David.'' **********Mr. Clinton's public proclamation on the embassy was considered extraordinary because in the past, the administration has been careful to tamp down any enthusiasm in Congress for such a move. Some Israeli prime ministers, including Yitzhak Rabin, have also been careful not to encourage the issue, on the grounds that it would unnecessarily inflame the Palestinians and set back peace prospects. **********Asked today whether Mr. Clinton's statement would also serve to help his wife, Hillary, who is running for the United States Senate in New York, a senior administration official said, ''It had nothing to do with it.'' **********Another official said, however, that White House officials were aware that a positive answer on moving the embassy would not hurt Mrs. Clinton. **********In reviewing the parameters of what Mr. Clinton would say in the interview, American negotiators weighted his position that he would consider moving the embassy as a 6 on a scale of 10. **********On the lowest end of the scale, Mr. Clinton could have said -- as the White House has in the past -- that it did not want to jeopardize the peace efforts by advocating a move. On the high end, Mr. Clinton could have said he wanted to move the embassy, a position that the White House ultimately decided was too forward."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/22/business/investing-with-paul-a-blaustein-whitehall-growth-fund.html": {"writer_name": "Carole Gould", "pub_date": "2000-10-22", "snippet": "Article describes how Paul A Blaustein manages $173.7 million Whitehall Growth Fund; photo; chart (M)", "word_count": 831, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INVESTING WITH: Paul A.

Blaustein sees it, investing is an evolutionary process, and flexibility is a key to success. He has used that philosophy throughout his 27-year investing career, most recently at the $173.7 million Whitehall Growth fund, which has become a standout among its peers. **********''In the 1970's, the U.S. and world economies weren't growing, so I focused on cyclical stocks,'' Mr. Blau stein said. ''The 1980's were a disinflationary period, so I focused on companies with strong brand names, especially consumer packaged-food businesses.'' In the 1990's, he added, opportunity was based on ''the explosive growth in technology.'' **********Mr. Blaustein still likes technology, despite its current volatility. But since he began managing Whitehall Growth two years ago, he has also branched out into other growth areas like health care and financials. **********The fund returned 29.8 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Sept. 30, compared with 14.4 percent for its peers in the large blend category, according to Morningstar Inc. **********Mr. Blaustein, 52, looks for growth among American companies with market capitalizations of more than $2 billion. He evaluates each stock as if he were buying the entire business. **********''I want to be a long-term owner of superior businesses that we try to acquire at attractive prices,'' he said from his office in Midtown Manhattan. ''Over time, we should participate as owners in the increase in the valuation of the company's assets.'' **********Mr. Blaustein does not use computer screens to identify potential purchases. Instead, he keeps a close eye  on 200 to 300 stocks with which he has become familiar during his years at other fund groups, including Legg Mason, Oppenheimer Capital and Warburg Pincus. **********In evaluating a stock, Mr. Blaustein looks for above-average annual growth in the company's sales and earnings, compared with its industry. Under either measure, that generally means gains of 10 to 30 percent or more. He measures profitability by reviewing return on equity or return on capital, as well as profit margins, to establish whether a company is a market leader. **********Finally, he analyzes the sustainability of growth. ''We want to have conviction that the company can sustain its position through various economic and product cycles,'' he said. ''Few companies like Coca-Cola can prosper by selling the same product for 100 years.'' **********In Mr. Blaustein's view, ''superior businesses'' are companies that have had strong growth and profitability for at least 10 years. Such companies also have a competitive edge, like a proprietary product or service. **********He also likes to talk to a company's customers, suppliers and competitors as well as to market researchers, business consultants and other industry experts. **********Mr. Blaustein works with a seven-member investment committee; it meets weekly to vote on possible changes to the 35 to 40 stocks in the portfolio. **********Technology stocks now account for about half of the fund's assets -- a higher-than-usual stake and up from 26 percent two years ago. Mr. Blaustein has been a net seller of tech stocks over that period, so that increase can be attributed to their surge in value. **********HE likes the Altera Corporation in San Jose, Calif., which designs and markets semiconductors. It sells a programmable logic device, or P.L.D., that lets users buy cheap chips and program them rather than investing in custom-designed chips. **********The P.L.D. ''drastically shortens the time to market of a customer's product, which is an enormous advantage to technology companies because prices drop so quickly,'' he said. The market for P.L.D.'s is growing rapidly, he added, as electronic devices become more sophisticated. **********Mr. Blaustein expects Altera's sales and earnings to grow 25 to 30 percent a year, on average, over the next three years. He bought shares in August 1998 at $10.12 each. The stock is now at $39.19, or 25 times his earnings forecast of $1.55 a share for next year. **********Another favorite is Cardinal Health Inc., a pharmaceutical services company in Dublin, Ohio. The company's growth rate of roughly 20 percent is driven partly by its fast-growing drug distribution business, he said. It also runs a high-margin  drug dispensing business and has a strong manufacturing operation, he added. **********He bought shares in July 1997 at $36.45; they now trade at $93.63, or 30 times his earnings forecast of $3.10 a share for the fiscal year ending next June. **********Mr. Blaustein also likes the Costco Wholesale Corporation, the warehouse club retailer based in Issaquah, Wash. The stock sells at a significant discount to those of retailers like Wal-Mart Stores and Home Depot because of Costco's shorter track record and smaller base of stores, Mr. Blaustein said. But sales and earnings should grow about 15 percent a year, on average, over the next three years, he said, because the company offers lower prices on higher quality merchandise. Costco has added services like photo processing and pharmacies, he added, and has been expanding into the southern and central regions of the United States. **********He bought shares in January 1995 at $6.88. They now trade at $34.31, or 22 times his earnings forecast of $1.52 a share for the fiscal year ending next August."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/11/business/company-news-hilton-has-option-to-buy-stake-in-lodgenet.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "2000-10-11", "snippet": "Hilton Hotels Corp obtains option to buy as much as $42.9 million in stock of LodgeNet Entertainment Corp, which will provide pay television and Internet service in its rooms (S)", "word_count": 103, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HILTON HAS OPTION TO BUY STAKE IN LODGENET", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; HILTON HAS OPTION TO BUY STAKE IN LODGENET", "body_text": " **********The Hilton Hotels Corporation has obtained an option to buy as much as $42.9 million in stock of the LodgeNet Entertainment Corporation, which will provide pay television and Internet service in its rooms.

Flooding at his home also forced him to live with relatives. ''It was like the feeling you have after the death of a close friend,'' Mr. Towers said. **********Yet despite the damage, Mr. Towers's two restaurants, a Wendy's franchise and his own Italian Moon pizza parlor, are back in business, as are most other businesses in Grand Forks, located in the northeast corner of the state on the Red River. **********But Mr. Towers now faces what he calls ''a financial cancer'' -- roughly $500,000 in loans from the Small Business Administration needed to rebuild his business -- and that makes retiring in the foreseeable future almost impossible. **********''People here don't tend to give up,'' said Mr. Towers, who traces this determined spirit to the strong religious faith shared by many local residents. ''We are stronger, more resilient. We have the pioneer attitude -- we are not simply going to give up everything we have and move to Phoenix.'' **********But if Grand Forks has come back to life, it remains, like many places in the vast stretches of the Great Plains, an economically troubled place. In addition to the flood, the city's economy has been weakened by a sustained agricultural recession, the recent closing of a local missile base and a persistent ''brain drain'' of younger, educated people. **********The aftermath of the flood remains the most evident problem. Randy L. Newman, president of the First National Bank North Dakota, which is based here, estimates the flood wiped out as much as $1 billion in net worth of residents and businesses. **********But other, more fundamental problems also worry Mr. Newman. The city's continued reliance on agriculture, he fears, provides little of the kind of economic growth entrepreneurs like Mr. Towers will need to meet their debt obligations. Taxable sales in Grand Forks, for example, have remained below the level of Fargo, the state's largest city, for over a decade, and overall economic growth has been torpid despite the strong national expansion. **********''Until we change our economy, Grand Forks is going to be steady, slow and stagnant,'' said Mr. Newman, 46, whose bank building was severely damaged in the flood. ''We are already stuck in very low growth.'' **********These problems are clearly evident in the downtown area's 12 square blocks. **********After the flood, the old central core looked like a war zone. A fire that started in the wake of the flood destroyed 11 buildings, and some residents and officials thought the whole area, across the river from Minnesota, should be abandoned. **********INSTEAD, the city, using federal disaster aid as well as local bank loans, rebuilt much of the downtown, restoring many early 20th-century buildings. **********Several small parks, graced with public sculptures, flourish today, as do many restaurants, coffee shops and bars. Yet the economic recovery remains spotty, with building vacancies running at least 25 percent. **********To entrepreneurs like Mr. Towers, rebuilding the downtown is both a source of pride and contention. Given the massive debt that limits business expansion here, Mr. Towers wonders if the funds spent on restoring that part of the city may have been better used in helping other businesses  throughout the region. **********''The city did a great job,'' said Mr. Towers, whose two restaurants are located on the city's outskirts, ''but you can see the vacancies. People elsewhere could have gotten more.'' **********The biggest long-term problem facing Grand Forks, Mr. Towers and many other local residents say, is not misplaced priorities but a rapidly aging population and the steady loss of younger, educated people. Two of Mr. Towers's three children have left the state -- one daughter moved to South Carolina, another to Vermont. **********''This is a great place to educate a family and raise kids,'' Mr. Towers said. ''But people have to leave if they want to make a decent living.'' **********Since the flood, the city's population has dropped to 47,000 from 52,000. The impact is especially noticeable at the city's schools. The kindergarten class of 2000, for example, is down by 100 from 1997, a decline of more than 12 percent. Most years, the graduating class from the three high schools in Grand Forks gets smaller as families move to Fargo, Minneapolis and places outside the region. **********The loss of younger people, Mr. Newman and other community leaders say, is slowing the city's transition to a more high-technology, information-oriented economy. **********On the surface, the city has powerful assets, most notably a public education system that sends roughly 80 percent of its high school students to college, as well as the presence of the University of North Dakota. **********But Gerald H. Groenewold, president of the Energy and Environmental Research Center at the University of North Dakota, said 70 percent of the graduates from his university and from North Dakota State University in Fargo leave for other states. **********''Unfortunately, our biggest high-value export has been people,'' said  Dr. Groenewold, whose research center has been among the leaders in keeping its staff in the area. **********The university's faculty and students, he said, helped create companies like Meridian Environmental Technology Inc., which provides computerized weather projections. **********Leon Osborne, the company's founder and a professor of atmospheric science, has hired 25 local people, and he finds a large number of students are eager to stay in Grand Forks. Yet most talented students, he said, do not find adequate opportunities for advancement and eventually move on to other places. **********''I've seen so many brilliant students come and then leave,'' Mr. Osborne said. ''It's not only that they leave but they can't come back.'' **********PART of the problem, many local residents say, lies in the North Dakota culture. The very stolid spirit that allowed for rebuilding the city from the flood also works against financing start-ups, whether in technology or other fields,  said David Badman, who runs a  custom jewelry business in the restored downtown. **********''There's a very conservative farm attitude,'' he said. ''You'd rather give away money to some guy with a tractor than to a creative person or computer entrepreneur.'' **********Mark Schill, 23, who runs a small Internet business in downtown Grand Forks, agreed. ''People here tend to be into cash flow,'' he said. **********That tendency has been reinforced recently because the flood has left many residents too preoccupied with debt to take risks. **********''We could survive the flood and start again,'' Mr. Schill said, ''but we won't survive if we don't change how we do things here.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/18/business/personal-business-a-peek-at-your-credit-scorecard.html": {"writer_name": "Mickey Meece", "pub_date": "2000-06-18", "snippet": "Mickey Meece Personal Business column offers advice on maintaining a good credit score; some factors are obvious: borrow moderately and pay on time, but some idiosyncrasies of credit scoring and potential pitfalls may surprise consumers; Fair Isaa...", "word_count": 1010, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Peek at Your Credit Scorecard", "print_headline": "PERSONAL BUSINESS; A Peek at Your Credit Scorecard", "body_text": " **********THINK of the numbers that matter most when you apply for credit. You know your date of birth, Social Security number and annual income well enough, and you may know just how much money you have in the bank. But the make-or-break figure is one that lenders are privy to but that you have probably never seen: your credit score. **********The veil is lifting from this mysterious metric, in response to pressure by consumer groups, by legislation before Congress and by loan-service Web sites like E-Loan that were eager to spill the beans to customers. Fair, Isaac, the San Rafael, Calif., company that pioneered credit scoring 40 years ago and dominates the field today, has published on its own Web site, www.fairisaac.com, its general recipe for scoring consumer credit. **********The factors considered are payment history (35 percent of the overall score); amounts and types of outstanding debt (30 percent); length of credit history (15 percent);  amount of new credit recently sought or gained (10 percent); and types of credit in use (10 percent). Points are added to yield a score that ranges from the 300's to the 900's -- the higher, the better. **********In large part, Fair, Isaac's recipe confirms popular notions of what good credit means: that people who borrow moderately and pay on time can expect to score better than those who borrow to the limit or not at all, or those who chronically pay late. But some idiosyncrasies and potential pitfalls revealed in the scoring system may surprise consumers. **********Moves to remove credit blemishes, for example, may not help, or may even backfire. Closing an account that you once paid late won't remove it from consideration. And say you  think you are carrying too much debt on too many credit cards, so you get a loan from a personal finance company to consolidate the debt into a single, easier-to manage payment. A good move? Not for your credit score: finance-company loans are considered a greater sign of risk than owing the same amount on credit cards. On top of that, if you consolidate the debt into one loan and close the credit card accounts, you have reduced the credit available to you without reducing the amount you owe, which hurts your score. **********Consider a consumer who always pays her credit card balances in full each month. Her credit scores will rise, based on zero card debt, right? Wrong. The scoring system generally picks up the balances on her most recent statements -- before she has paid them. So if she racks up a lot of charges each month -- say, to earn bonuses like airline miles -- it is possible that her score will be pulled down a bit by what the formula considers heavy debt relative to her credit limit, even if she has never missed a payment. **********Even shopping aggressively online for the best rate on a new loan can lower your score. Each time you enter personal information like your income and Social Security number on a Web site's form, it may be reported to credit bureaus as a credit inquiry. Too many credit inquiries will count against you, though Fair, Isaac said it had taken steps to collapse multiple inquiries for a particular loan over a short period into a single hit for scoring purposes. **********''Inquiries are not enough to make or break someone's score,'' said Cheri St. John, a senior vice president of Fair, Isaac, who oversees its credit bureau scoring services unit. Still, she advises, ''only shop for and accept the credit you need.'' **********For years, consumers setting out to establish credit were told that more credit is better, a myth ''that took a while to dispel,'' Ms. St. John said. In fact, getting too much credit at once makes a person appear risky, she said; building up gradually and establishing a good payment history is a better approach. **********While Fair, Isaac provides the models used to calculate scores, it does not have access to credit bureau data on individuals. The scores are used in three out of four mortgage originations as well as for other kinds of loans; a score in the middle 600's is generally high enough to get a mortgage on favorable terms.  Keith T. Gumbinger, a vice president of HSH Associates, a research firm in Butler, N.J., said the federally sponsored mortgage agencies, like Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, use 620 as a cutoff for high-quality loans. **********As a result, loans below that score are harder to package and sell, so many mortgage lenders will deny credit or charge higher interest rates, added fees and more points up front, Mr. Gumbinger said. But contrary to popular belief, he said, in the mortgage world, ''there's almost no benefit for having a better score'' than 620. **********For now, the only way a consumer can obtain his or her current credit score is from a lender, which will usually reveal the score only when an application is denied. Starting next month, consumers who know their scores can get an explanatory report on the Fair, Isaac Web site; people who do not know their scores can have their lenders provide them to Fair, Isaac on their behalf, and then pass along the explanation. **********Eventually, Fair, Isaac said, it would like to be able to provide scores directly to consumers. And later this year, Trans Union, one of the three major credit bureaus, plans to create its own credit scores and explain the results to consumers. **********Raising Your Score **********Here are some ways to put your best foot forward in the complex arithmetic of credit scoring. **********Apply sparingly. Seek credit only when you need it, not on a whim. **********Don't change indiscriminately. Putting all your spending on a credit card can make you look deep in debt, even if you pay it all off each month. **********Avoid maxing out. Using all your available credit makes you look risky; either borrow less or have your limit raised. **********Pay on time. Late payments do more to hurt your score than almost anything short of default and bankruptcy. **********Inspect your credit report.

Friends at the Detroit cargo facility where she worked as a service manager for Northwest Airlines  took the noose down before she came to work that day, she said, so that she would not be upset seeing it. **********Three years later, however, Ms. Hamilton, who is black, was alerted to a knotted noose in an employee lunchroom. This time she took the noose down -- after first taking a picture of it -- and then complained to a higher manager. The company is challenging Ms. Hamilton's account, and says that there is no evidence that the piece of rope she found was intended to intimidate any employee because of race or sex. **********That's not the way Ms. Hamilton sees it. ''I'm old enough to remember Emmett Till,'' she said, referring to the 1955 lynching of a black teenager from Chicago who was accused of whistling at a white woman while visiting relatives in Mississippi. **********The hangman's noose has long been one of the most frightening representations of racial harassment in America, a reminder that thousands of black people died at the hands of lynch mobs from the end of the Civil War well into the 20th century. But while the symbolic use of a noose has traditionally been associated with hate groups like the Ku Klux Klan, employment experts say that nooses, although still rare, are increasingly turning up in ordinary workplaces. And noose incidents are affecting not just black employees, but also those of Asian, Hispanic and Native American descent. **********Many companies still prefer to settle such cases out of court, but officials at the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission say they have at least 20 noose-related lawsuits pending or recently resolved. For an agency that files only a few hundred lawsuits a year, they add, that is a disproportionately high number. **********And the agency says it is currently examining dozens of other allegations involving nooses from around the country. **********In most cases, officials say, a noose was placed anonymously on an employee's chair, in a locker, or on a door. But the Miami office of the equal employment opportunity commission is currently pursuing a lawsuit on behalf of a black employee, who, it says, had a noose wrapped around his neck, which was then pulled, while he was working for a Florida office of the Asplundh Tree Expert Company. The company, which is based in Willow Grove, Pa., said it had no comment on the suit. **********No one is sure why reports of such racial incidents have risen lately. Some employment lawyers see it as reflecting intolerance among certain younger workers who do not remember the civil rights struggles of the 1950's and 1960's. The incidents, experts say, also might reflect resentment among some whites over affirmative action in diverse workplaces where blacks and other minorities were often excluded in the past. **********At the same time, says Ida L. Castro, the chairwoman of the equal employment agency, the increase in court cases might also be due to a growing defensiveness on the part of some employers, who sometimes treat them ''almost flippantly.'' **********''What I see as alarming is not just that employers are now fighting us in courts,'' she said, ''but that they're also making statements implying that such incidents are just horseplay.'' **********Indeed, a recent exhibit of photographs -- many once used as postcards -- of white participants in lynchings and their lifeless victims only reminded viewers of why nooses are such an incendiary emblem of America's not-so-distant past. **********Nor are noose incidents confined to one region of the country. **********Jeff Lanza, a special agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Kansas City, Mo., says his office is investigating two cases of nooses left in workplaces. The regional office of the equal employment agency in Charlotte, N.C., has three racial harassment lawsuits pending where nooses were said to be involved. **********The Miami office has an equal number, including one in which a Sanibel Island, Fla., country club has been charged with failing to act against several workers accused of holding up a hangman's noose to a black groundskeeper before asking him whether he wanted ''to go for a ride.'' Art Cassell, a member of the board of governors of the Sanctuary Golf Club in Sanibel, said the suit was ''completely without merit.'' **********The Dallas office of the commission is investigating four such cases. In Detroit, the agency is continuing to pursue a lawsuit on behalf of Ms. Hamilton. And the agency has one current lawsuit in California. **********Still, the cases the equal employment office is pursuing may represent only the tip of a workplace iceberg. The agency handles just a small fraction of the thousands of lawsuits that are filed privately between employees and employers each year. **********Employment lawyers say that it is impossible to say how many of those cases involve noose incidents. But David Bennet Ross, a managing partner at Seyfarth Shaw, a law firm based in Chicago that represents employers, thinks they ''happen with surprising frequency.'' **********Mr. Ross said he could think of only one noose-related lawsuit in which a court had found that an employee had fabricated the claim, in order to collect money. **********''They're a sign,'' he said, ''that something serious is going on in the workplace.'' **********Employment lawyers say that incidents involving nooses are now appearing at large and small companies alike. **********Mr. Lanza, the Kansas City F.B.I. agent, said that until recently cross burnings seemed to be the ''hate crime of choice,'' in his area, but that noose incidents are now appearing instead. **********''I've been here 12 years and I can't remember any other noose cases that preceded the two we now have,'' Mr. Lanza said. The Justice Department considers noose incidents to be federal crimes of intimidation, punishable by up to 10 years in prison. **********Over all, racial harassment charges have surged over the last two decades, with the E.E.O.C. reporting that it received close to 50,000 such charges during the 1990's, versus roughly 10,000 in the 1980's. **********The agency considers noose incidents to be among the most egregious forms of racial harassment. **********Yet some employees say they have lost their jobs after speaking out against racial harassment incidents like the display of nooses. **********In January, Harold H. Archuleta, a former mechanic for American Airlines, filed a lawsuit against the company charging that he had been wrongfully fired for complaining about aircraft safety violations, and also for supporting the racial harassment and discrimination claims of another American employee, Charles L. Walker. **********In his court papers, Mr. Archuleta, who is Native American, said that his superiors at American took no steps to prevent, among other things, the ''prominent'' display of nooses at the airline's maintenance facility at Los Angeles International Airport. **********During the two or three years before he left American in May 1998, Mr. Archuleta said he saw three nooses displayed at the maintenance facility: one in the area where the company gave out time cards, another in front of a production control office and a third carried by Mr. Walker, as he was on his way to complain about it to his managers. **********Each time he saw a noose at his workplace, Mr. Archuleta recalled recently, he ''couldn't believe it was happening.'' **********Tim Kincaid, a spokesman for American, a unit of the AMR Corporation, said that the airline settled Mr. Walker's case out of court last fall. As for Mr. Archuleta's suit, Mr. Kincaid said that a company investigation found no evidence of racial harassment at the Los Angeles facility, and that Mr. Archuleta's claims were simply an effort to ''mask his own misconduct.'' According to American, Mr. Archuleta was fired for failing to remove outdated life vests from certain airplanes, a charge that he denies. **********At Lockheed Martin, the military contractor, seven current and former hourly employees at its plant in Marietta, Ga., filed a lawsuit in Atlanta in May charging that the company had excluded them from its promotion process. They also stated that Lockheed Martin management had ignored -- or conducted only a cursory investigation of -- numerous racial harassment incidents, including some involving the display of nooses. In the suit, Joseph Banks, a Lockheed employee who still works for the company, said a hangman's noose was placed in his work area last summer. **********Mr. Banks took his complaint about the noose to the equal employment commission in October last year. On the same day, another Lockheed employee, Ted Gignilliat, who had earlier accused the company of discriminating against him because he is disabled, also filed a complaint that he had received threats after witnessing a noose at the company. **********Mr. Gignilliat says that he has seen roughly a half-dozen nooses displayed during his tenure with Lockheed, and that the two most recent incidents occured during the spring of 1999. He says that he reported the most recent incident last September to Lockheed's human resources department, but that his effort received no response, as did another a month later to the security department. **********Mr. Gignilliat said he was spurred to act, in part, after Lockheed managers issued memos in August stating that the company thoroughly investigated all harassment and discrimination claims. **********Sam Grizzle, a Lockheed spokesman, said that the noose Mr. Gignilliat reported last fall was already under investigation and that the company was not aware that he had ever reported any other incidents. **********Meanwhile, in a response last month to the May lawsuit, Lockheed denied the employees' charges. In its court papers, Lockheed acknowledged that a rope tied in the shape of a noose had been found in Mr. Banks' department, but said the rope was not in his work area. The company, which declined to comment more specifically because of the litigation, stated that it had investigated the incident ''immediately and thoroughly,'' but had not been able to determine who had left the noose. **********Mr. Ross, the employment lawyer, said he advises companies that have received a complaint of racial harassment to investigate immediately. But unlike many other harassment cases, it is usually difficult to identify the culprits because most nooses are left anonymously. **********In the case involving Ms. Hamilton, Northwest Airlines, in its court papers, said that it learned of the noose incident only after Ms. Hamilton had been denied a promotion, and after she had gone to the equal employment agency to complain about racial and sexual harassment at the company. Ms. Hamilton said that she had indeed notified the company when the incident occured. **********The company also argued that the noose that Ms. Hamilton found was simply a piece of rope, and that there was no evidence it was directed against her or any member of a minority group. **********The equal employment agency's suit against Northwest involving Ms. Hamilton and some other employees at its Detroit cargo facility has yet to be resolved. **********Meanwhile, in January the agency's San Francisco office also filed a noose-related lawsuit against Northwest. It charged that employees at the airline's maintenance department at San Francisco Airport subjected a Filipino mechanic, Marcel Espiritu, to almost five years of racial harassment. After Mr. Espiritu filed his accusation with the federal agency, officials say, he found a noose hanging in his locker, along with a note that read ''get Marcel.'' **********William R. Tamayo, a regional attorney for the equal employment agency, says that Northwest Airlines never did enough to investigate the incident. In response to both cases, Kathy Peach, a spokeswoman for Northwest, said that it was company policy not to comment on lawsuits in litigation. ''We believe that it is dangerous to draw conclusions before the legal process has been fully completed,'' she said. **********As for Ms. Hamilton, the noose she found in 1995 still haunts her. Last fall, while attending a work-related conference in Minneapolis, she ran into a Northwest vice president, who showed her a newspaper article on the lawsuit and then expressed surprise that she still worked for the airline. **********Shaken, Ms. Hamilton went back to her hotel room, only to discover while packing that she had unwittingly hidden the noose at the bottom of her garment bag. **********''It was like getting a double whammy,'' she recalled. ''I need to find a better place to put it.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/01/business/company-news-cephalon-shares-drop-as-drug-fails-test.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "2000-08-01", "snippet": "Cephalon shares drop sharply after company reports its narcolepsy drug, Provigil, does not improve symptoms of patients with attention deficit disorder (S)", "word_count": 103, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CEPHALON SHARES DROP AS DRUG FAILS TEST", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; CEPHALON SHARES DROP AS DRUG FAILS TEST", "body_text": " **********Cephalon shares lost nearly a third of their value yesterday after the company said its narcolepsy drug, Provigil, did not improve symptoms of patients with attention deficit disorder.

Before noon today, the morning after the occupation zone precipitately collapsed, its stores were shuttered and its cobblestone streets nearly empty but for two young men with a clipboard. **********One of the men, Nadir Abdelkhalek, 25, a clean-cut financial analyst and member of a small occupation resistance group, checked the clipboard and pronounced his job done. Working off a roster, he and a colleague had gone door to door, rounding up 60 South Lebanese Army members who did not flee to Israel. All had surrendered, no weapons were drawn, and the town was now officially ''collaborator free,'' he said. **********''We acted in a calm manner, and told them that it was all over, welcome back to Lebanon,'' Mr. Abdelkhalek said. ''We didn't yell at them. We didn't rough them up. We just turned them over to the Lebanese police. And, of course, we pitied them.'' **********Given that the Israeli withdrawal happened so suddenly, southern Lebanon was gripped by rapid tumult today, exultant but chaotic as the national landscape was redrawn in a night. Official Lebanon improvised a reaction to the instant reunification of the country, but it quickly became apparent that much remains undecided, starting with whether the military conflict with Israel was indeed over or was still on. **********Young men like Mr. Abdelkhalek -- most brandishing AK-47's or M-16's rather than clipboards -- took over the countryside. Six competing resistance groups, led by the Shiite Muslim Hezbollah, roamed the 400 square miles of southern Lebanon, jumping feet-first into the power vacuum left by Israel's quick withdrawal. So far, there is surprising calm, but it is a volatile situation. **********''Unless the army or a major internal security force moves in here quickly, you have to fear that the different groups will argue among themselves, and they are basically kids with guns,'' said Mohana Rafa, the police chief of the 20,000-resident town of Hasbeya. **********The Israeli-backed militia men are another potential friction point, and their fate is unclear. The Lebanese Army is holding some 1,250 men in army barracks in Baalbek; some are former militiamen, but some are people who crossed the border to work or even just for medical treatments. **********Officials say those men will proceed immediately to military tribunals to be judged on charges of treason. Based on what happened in the town of Jezzin, which was abandoned by Israel last year, experts expect short sentences of several months to a year for a most. Lebanon has few available prison beds. But it remains to be seen whether the government seeks to make an example of a few high-ranking militia officers to allay a demand for vengeance. **********Also unclear is the future of the half-deserted Christian towns, whose mood swung wildly between confusion and panic today. **********''Father, father, come quickly,'' yelled a woman who ran to fetch the priest from the St. George's Church in the town of Qlaia, adjacent to Merj  'Uyun. ''They are searching our houses.'' **********''Not to worry,'' said the Rev. Fedi Salameh, 30, whose parish was cut in half on Tuesday, when 2,000 local Christians packed their cars and fled to Israel. ''Nothing will happen. The Hezbollah has given its word.'' **********Israel spent its final night in Lebanon blowing up its positions and discharging its ammunition supply, so it went out in a fury of sound and smoke but more uneventfully than anyone would have imagined. **********Today, for the first time in decades, international monitors reported no Israeli violations of Lebanon's land, water and airspace. **********Israeli soldiers worked furiously to dismantle their border posts that overstep the 1923 international border. Israel wants the United Nations certification teams to be able to move in quickly and judge whether the withdrawal is complete. **********Lebanese officials have uttered contradictory opinions on whether they will accept the United Nations certification, since the organization has put aside Lebanon's claim over a piece of property at the edge of the Golan Heights. Israel is not planning to abandon the property, the Shebaa Farms, which the United Nations accepts. **********The United Nation's Middle East envoy, Terje Roed-Larsen, arrived tonight to work with Lebanese officials on resolving their contradictions into an official position that helps end the conflict. For if Lebanon does not accept the withdrawal, it signals guerrilla groups that the violent fight against Israel is still on. **********''The key at the end of all of this is Lebanon has to accept our determination,'' said Timor Goeksl, spokesman for the United Nations forces here. ''Then we will be able to move to the border zone.'' **********Today, Hezbollah moved into the border zone, planting its yellow flags atop such formerly Israeli-controlled sites as the Beaufort Castle overlooking northern Israel. Lebanese families, with picnic baskets, poured into the area, too, digging through the rubble of the abandoned posts as if they were archaeological sites. **********Some were giddy with re-orientation. ''I am staring down into Misgav Am, Israel,'' said a reporter for a local radio station. ''I can see the asphalt on the road. And the houses. Look, there's people walking there. Israelis! It's really amazing, you know.'' **********Contrary to appearances, as the fighters rode Israeli armored personnel carriers along mountain roads, the Lebanese Army recovered most of the weapons and equipment left behind in the hasty pullout, Mr. Goeksl of the United Nations said. **********Granting the resistance fighters their moment of glory, President Emile Lahoud of Lebanon sang their praises as he traveled into the southern zone for the first time -- although advance teams distributed posters of the president and Lebanese flags to towns slathered with Hezbollah imagery. **********Mr. Lahoud tried to allay the anxieties of the Christian townspeople of the south, as did several Hezbollah sheiks and United Nations officials. ''Tell your relatives who left the country to come back because the state of Lebanon will protect everybody,'' he said. **********In Qlaia, so long on the fringes of Lebanon, they were not sure whom to believe. The South Lebanon Army's forerunner, the Army of Free Lebanon, was born in the small hilltop town, which long ago allied itself with Israel out of alienation from local Shiite Muslims and out of fear that Palestinian radical groups would use their town as a base. **********The residents mingled in the church courtyard this morning after Hezbollah rode through their town shooting in the air. One woman said she had shivered with each shot, but another, Josephine Nahara, who was shouted down as she talked, said: ''I thank them. It will be nice to see Muslims and Christians holding hands.'' **********The sky-blue dome of the chapel is riddled with bullet holes, and the paint peels off the forlorn walls. Father Salameh, cradling a cell phone in his black cassock, said he was struggling to assess the town's fragile situation. **********''A large part of the town has left,'' he said. ''Imagine having 50 percent of your population emigrate in one day. There were three kinds: Officers and soldiers of the South Lebanon Army, who left for obvious reasons, and people who had worked in Israel, who feared they would be imprisoned.'' **********''How can one explain what happened in this town?'' he continued. ''It was the situation of war that warped us and debased us. By the end, the people were cut off from Lebanon, and serving Israel was the only way to make a wage. But it's clear now that Israel used them. Look at those who fled across the border. They have put them in camps, in tents.'' **********The priest jumped to his feet as Lebanese Army officials strode into his church unannounced, their first foray into the area in 22 years. The officers talked quietly with the priest, telling him that the people should not worry about reprisals. And then they were gone. **********''We'd be happier if the army stayed,'' Father Salameh said. ''Who's to stop the Palestinians from coming in and causing problems across the border?'' **********Here in Merj 'Uyun the villa of Antoine Lahad, the South Lebanon Army chief, was trashed. In Israel, Mr. Lahad faced a bruising confrontation with his troops, who harangued him for the humiliating way in which they were forced to flee their homes. Lebanese television showed a clip of the confrontation. **********In the town of Hasbeya, the Rafa family, many of whom served in the South Lebanon Army, hope that those who stayed in Lebanon will not be treated like collaborators or agents. ''We love that we are Lebanese,'' said Gamal Rafa, 30, who served seven years with the Israeli-backed militia. ''But the wars here made us crazy. We grew up on guns. Guns were muscles. And in this area, the guns were in the hands of the S.L.A.'' **********''We were poor,'' he said. ''The only work was their army. If you're in their army, you can live. If you're not, you can't.'' **********When he learned that the occupation zone had folded, Mr. Rafa, who quit the militia four years ago to pump gas, set off to track down his cousins who were militiamen. They were still obediently standing at their posts. He took them to his house, dressed them in civilian clothes, and then drove them to an army checkpoint and turned them in. **********''If they're in prison for a month or a year, I can still see them,'' he said. ''If I didn't take them in, maybe they would have been tempted to go down to Israel. And that would be the saddest end to our story.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/14/business/media-apology-highlights-abc-reporter-s-contrarian-image.html": {"writer_name": "Jim Rutenberg", "pub_date": "2000-08-14", "snippet": "On-air apology by ABC news magazine 20/20 correspondent John Stossel for inaccuracies in a news feature highlights his controversial position at ABC; Stossel is a man of strong opinions, trait that does not always go over well within network's new...", "word_count": 1844, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Apology Highlights ABC Reporter's Contrarian Image", "print_headline": "MEDIA; Apology Highlights ABC Reporter's Contrarian Image", "body_text": " **********Last Friday evening on the TV news magazine ''20/20,'' John Stossel, the square-jawed consumer and environmental correspondent, was forced to do something relatively rare for ABC News or any other network news operation: deliver an apology on the air for inaccuracies in a news feature. **********What was not so rare, though, was Mr. Stossel's being in the thick of a controversy at ABC. He is a man of strong opinions, even about the work of his colleagues -- a trait that does not always go over well within the network's news division. **********Last month, for instance, Mr. Stossel took aim at the environmentalist icon Erin Brockovich, the feisty legal secretary portrayed by Julia Roberts in a recent movie. On the program ''20/20,'' he cast doubt on  the lawsuit she helped bring charging Pacific Gas and Electric with contaminating the groundwater in Hinkley, Calif. **********Mr. Stossel believed that his ''20/20'' co-anchor, Cynthia McFadden, among other reporters, had too blindly accepted Ms. Brockovich's case in an earlier ABC News report. So he discussed fighting it out with  Ms. McFadden in a broadcast. **********This made Ms. McFadden angry, people familiar with the situation said, and she complained loudly to her supervisors. She told colleagues she would refuse to appear on the program. When it was shown, Elizabeth Vargas was the anchor. The segment did not refer to Ms. McFadden's report. **********Afterward, Ms. Brockovich demanded that Mr. Stossel apologize for his ''dangerous and misleading broadcast.'' He did not. **********All in all, just another day for Mr. Stossel. Reviled in some quarters as an ideologue and crusader, admired in others for his fresh, contrarian approach, Mr. Stossel is an anomaly in television journalism. Reporters are generally forced to keep their ideologies to themselves. Mr. Stossel is allowed to make his views known. **********And that he does. An unabashed libertarian, he has argued that greed is good for the economy; that environmentalists are ''scaremongers'' with vastly overblown fears of global warming and pollution, and, even, that seat belts in school buses are a waste of money. **********His views have put him under intense scrutiny in the hothouse world of environmental and consumer politics. And now an error made in a recent ''20/20'' segment -- in which he cited pesticide tests that were never done to debunk the assumed benefits of organic foods -- has put him under scrutiny by a wider audience while creating a public relations mess for ABC News. From now on, Mr. Stossel is likely to draw even more attention. **********As coverage and criticism of Mr. Stossel spread last week, ABC, a unit of Walt Disney, took the rare step of publicly reprimanding him, and suspending the producer of the report, David W. Fitzpatrick, for one month, without pay. On ''20/20'' Friday night, Mr. Stossel apologized. **********''I apologize for the error,'' he said, saying he mistakenly thought the tests referred to in the report had been conducted. ''I am deeply sorry I misled you.'' But he said the gist of his report was accurate. **********The whole episode sent jitters throughout ABC News, which recently took heat for allowing the actor Leonardo DiCaprio to interview President Clinton about environmental issues on a prime-time special, a move that split the division internally. Executives tried to figure out how the pesticide error made it through what they describe as an elaborate vetting process. **********Shelley Ross, the executive producer of ''Good Morning America,'' sent an e-mail to her staff members, warning them to take all complaints about their reports seriously. Mr. Stossel and his producer, the message said, were punished not so much for their mistake, ''but for the arrogance of ignoring complaint letters that followed.'' **********Environmentalists still insist that Mr. Stossel should be fired. But ABC executives said they would do no such thing. **********By all appearances, they are fond of Mr. Stossel. His edgy, distinctive approach tests well in audience research. And, in fact, he is allowed to operate within the news division as a sort of island unto himself. He is given the sort of freedom no other ABC reporter has: though not labeled a commentator, he is allowed to take a point of view and report  stories based on that point of view. He has his own unit of 8 to 10 staff members who help him with his weekly segments on ''20/ 20,'' and with his various prime-time specials. **********Last week, Mr. Stossel said he wanted to answer his critics directly, but ABC would not allow it, making Phyllis McGrady, an ABC News senior vice president, available instead. **********Ms. McGrady said executives like Mr. Stossel's work because his reporting goes against the grain of the established media and offers the network something fresh and different. Though he avoids the traditional pose of objectivity, he bases his conclusions on hard reporting, she said. This hard-edged approach, she said, makes him a target of the powerful groups he offends. **********''He's an original thinker, and he is not afraid to tackle complicated issues,'' she said. ''He takes on issues that are thought-provoking and what he is wanting and hoping for and, yes, advocating for, is for you to become a freer thinker, to basically stand back and look at it from every perspective.'' **********Mr. Stossel's point of view is welcomed by various conservative and industry groups. Though ABC has a general policy against paid public speaking engagements, as are  some of his colleagues, Mr. Stossel is allowed to accept such offers. He was quoted in the March 2000 issue of Brill's Content magazine as saying he had spoken to 27 groups in the last two years, collecting hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees. An ABC executive said those engagements were approved because all of the money he collects went to charity. **********Mr. Stossel is advertised, along with Charlton Heston, as one of the most sought-after speakers of the Young America's Foundation, a conservative group. This year, a spokesman for the Y.A.F. said, Mr. Stossel had given speeches at three schools, including Washington & Lee University, the Stetson School of Law in Florida and Florida State University. **********His strong views, combined with speaking engagements before conservative groups, opens Mr. Stossel up to criticism. So heated is his opposition that FAIR, a liberal-minded media watchdog group, has an entire Web site devoted to what it sees as distortions. **********As serious as the pesticide mistake was, there is a general belief within ABC News that the situation was worsened because of the lobbying prowess of the groups Mr. Stossel tends to provoke. **********Still, the organic food mistake certainly played directly into Mr. Stossel's critics' accusations that he is biased and tailors his reporting and statistics to fit his fervent belief system -- in this case, that organic farmers are preying on fear of chemicals to sell overpriced food with its own problems. **********During his initial report, shown on Feb. 4, to an audience of 12 million, Mr. Stossel said that tests commissioned by ABC showed conventional produce did not necessarily have more pesticide residue than did organic produce, debunking a main selling point for organic food. **********But the two researchers who were commissioned by ABC -- Dr. Michael Doyle, a scientist at the University of Georgia, and Dr. Lester Crawford, director of the Center for Food and Nutrition Policy at Georgetown University -- said they had never tested produce for pesticide residue. **********Dr. Crawford said that he had tested samples of organic and conventional chicken and that those tests had found traces of pesticides in the regular poultry, not in the organic. Those findings were not mentioned in the ''20/20'' segment. **********After the report was first broadcast, advocates with the Environmental Working Group wrote a letter that alerted Mr. Stossel that the researchers said they had not conducted the tests. The report ran again on July 7 with the same information, however. **********In fact, it was not until The New York Times raised the issue in a Media Talk column on July 31 that ABC News began to investigate the situation in earnest and found that the test results in question did not exist. **********ABC executives said on Friday that they believed that the erroneous reference to pesticide tests was the result of honest mistake, though a serious one. There are valid explanations for all of the critics' charges, they said. **********They said Mr. Fitzpatrick was receiving a spate of different test results on organic and conventional foods, had become confused and somehow had developed the solid notion that produce was tested for pesticide residue. **********Even when he was contacted by the environmentalists, executives said, Mr. Fitzpatrick continued to believe that he had the results in question. In a subsequent conversation with Dr. Crawford, when Mr. Fitzpatrick asked if pesticide tests had been performed, Dr. Crawford answered in the affirmative. Dr. Crawford said in a recent interview that he did so because he was referring to the pesticide tests performed on chicken. **********Why were the chicken tests, which would go against the grain of Mr. Stossel's argument, not included in the report? In his apology, Mr. Stossel said he did not refer to them because he was focusing on produce. **********Michael Jacobsen, executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest -- whose group is supported by subcribers to its publications and by the Rockefeller Family Fund and the Park Foundation -- said though he found Mr. Stossel's erroneous organic food report egregious, he was not surprised by it. He said he believed it to be in keeping with what he sees as Mr. Sossel's bias in favor of industry. **********That such an accusation could be attached to Mr. Stossel would have been unimaginable 10 years ago. His point of view has evolved drastically in the course of his career. Once a dogged consumer reporter for WCBS-TV, the local New York City CBS station, and then for ABC, he won his early reputation railing against corporate America. But in the early 1990's, his views changed. He evolved into a true believer in the free market and came to believe that advocates and the media were unnecessarily scaring consumers. **********His transformation took place in an ideologically charged arena. Evidence about the impact of toxic substances on humans is hotly disputed. **********But while Mr. Stossel's transformation has angered liberal groups, it has delighted conservative ones. **********Walter Olsen, of the libertarian-oriented Manhattan Institite, said Mr. Stossel was now ''filling in what we don't get from the rest of'' the media. Other reporters, Mr. Olsen said, ''have broadcast grossly misleading stuff over the years.'' **********Though he apologized on night for the error, the gist of his statement was that his segment was still correct. The clear message from Mr. Stossel: despite this setback, he intends to continue his brand of journalism. But, he said in his apology: ''All we have in this business is our credibility -- your trust that we get it right. I will make every effort to see that it never happens again.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/14/your-money/IHT-in-japan-weak-economy-and-corporate-shifts-give-franchising-a.html": {"writer_name": "Miki Tanikawa", "pub_date": "2000-10-14", "snippet": "WHILE JAPAN'S ECONOMY was dragging through the 1990s in a state of stagnation, there was one type of business that grew every year: franchising.

The traditional approach of debt-fueled growth is giving way to a more risk-diffused method of seeking outside capital while profiting from a brand name and systematized support and services. **********Franchising business models range from the highly controlled, in which a franchisee must hand over all of the sales to headquarters and then receives a cut from the gross income, to the nearly independent, with the franchisee simply paying a loyalty contribution of, say, 5 percent of sales. **********The former is much more common, Mr. Oono said, especially with established franchise operations, such as convenience stores, where the owner has little latitude in managing his business. But franchisees are generally amenable to exchanging freedom for stability, analysts said. **********A convenience-store owner, for example, usually cannot select what items to place on store shelves beyond what is allowed by the franchiser, although most franchise chains have thousands of items in their procurement catalogues. In exchange, some large convenience stores \u2014 such as Seven-Eleven Japan Co. \u2014 extend store owners an annual guaranteed income of 19 million yen ($176,600) **********At Seven-Eleven, a store owner pays 43 percent of the gross profit to the headquarters, while at FamilyMart Co., another major convenience-store chain, the franchisee pays 38 percent of the gross profit. **********The Japanese franchise model may often be restrictive, but the choice of businesses is of baffling breadth. They range from standards such as hamburger shops, family restaurants and hotels, to beauty parlors and shoe-repair stores, to uniquely Japanese businesses, such as private schools, known as jukus, and public baths, called sento. **********Doutor Coffee Co., among the fastest-growing franchise chains in Japan, made itself a favorite hangout for many Japanese with its cheap coffee and tasty sandwiches in a comfortable atmosphere. But Starbucks Coffee Co., the U.S. chain, is gaining fast in Japan, threatening Doutor's dominance in large cities. **********Japan Marriage System Co., a match-making agency, invites potential franchisees to participate in the growing industry of helping single people find a partner. The business of match-making is not new in Japan, but a modern, computer-assisted system of mate-searching has caught on recently. Matrimonial franchise revenue is therefore rising, even as the overall wedding industry shrinks. **********Some chains have found fertile ground overseas. In California, Yoshinoya D&C Co. operates 91 stores selling gyudon, which is seasoned beef served over rice, and has 61 in Asia, including in China, Singapore and Taiwan. The chain has 665 domestic stores and is one of the biggest and best-recognized fast-food operations in Japan. **********As elsewhere, there is a fad aspect to franchising in Japan. Chains tend to grow quickly, Mr. Oono said, but a franchisee can only count on five to 10 years before having to diversify or switch businesses, as a concept's popularity wanes. **********The industry, meanwhile, has been plagued by legal battles between franchisees and franchisors, which is unusual in a country that is relatively nonlitigious. **********\"The main reason litigation has spread is because franchise participants do not have a firm sense of independence,\" Mr. Oono said. **********Franchise participation, however, is not predominantly an individual affair in Japan. While comprehensive statistics are not available, observers said many franchisees were business owners who had converted themselves into proprietors of several franchise outlets as they come to realize that their traditional lines of business may be doomed. **********[Not to be reproduced without the permission of the author.]"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/11/technology/microsoftacutes-position-as-to-future-proceedings-on-the-issue-of.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-05-11", "snippet": "Microsoft's Position as to Future Proceedings on the Issue of Remedy", "word_count": 4663, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Microsoft\u00b4s Position as to Future Proceedings on the Issue of Remedy", "print_headline": "Microsoft\u00b4s Position as to Future Proceedings on the Issue of Remedy", "body_text": " **********Microsoft's Position as to Future Proceedings on the Issue of Remedy **********May 10, 2000 **********Microsoft's Position as to Future Proceedings on the Issue of Remedy IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA **********UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, **********&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Plaintiff, **********vs. **********MICROSOFT CORPORATION, **********&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Defendant. **********&nbsp; **********STATE OF NEW YORK ex rel . **********Attorney General ELIOT SPITZER, et al ., **********&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Plaintiffs, **********vs. **********MICROSOFT CORPORATION, **********&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Defendant. **********&nbsp; **********MICROSOFT CORPORATION, **********Counterclaim-Plaintiff, **********vs. **********ELIOT SPITZER, **********Attorney General of the State of New York, **********In his official capacity, et al. , **********Counterclaim-Defendants. **********&nbsp; **********&nbsp; **********&nbsp; **********Civil Action No. 98-1232 (TPJ) **********&nbsp; **********&nbsp; **********&nbsp; **********&nbsp; **********&nbsp; **********&nbsp; **********&nbsp; **********&nbsp; **********&nbsp; **********&nbsp; **********&nbsp; **********&nbsp; **********&nbsp; **********&nbsp; **********Civil Action No. 98-1233 (TPJ) **********&nbsp; **********&nbsp; &nbsp; DEFENDANT MICROSOFT CORPORATION'S POSITION AS TO FUTURE PROCEEDINGS ON THE ISSUE OF REMEDY **********In its proposed final judgment, the government has asked the Court to break Microsoft up and then actively regulate the two resulting companies, impairing their ability to develop new products for consumers in the highly competitive software industry. As Microsoft explains in its memorandum in support of summary rejection of the government's breakup proposal, such radical relief is unprecedented and wholly inappropriate given the antitrust violations found by the Court -- which relate principally to Microsoft's development and distribution of Web browsing software in competition with Netscape. Should the Court not summarily reject the government's breakup proposal, then substantial discovery, adequate time for preparation and a full trial on relief will be required. **********In addition to its attempt to rip apart Microsoft's integrated operations, the government seeks to impose other relief that, although characterized as a &quot;disclosure remedy,&quot; would constitute a wholesale confiscation of Microsoft's intellectual property -- the company's crown jewels. Microsoft has spent billions of dollars creating operating systems like Windows 2000 and Windows 98, and it is entitled to the fruits of those research and development efforts. It is not a proper purpose of the remedy in this case to enable leading software companies like IBM, AOL/Netscape, Novell, Oracle and Sun Microsystems to appropriate Microsoft's inventions and innovations free of charge. **********If the Court intends to consider giving Microsoft's competitors open access to Microsoft's enormously valuable intellectual property -- by requiring Microsoft to disclose the inner workings of its operating systems as well as other proprietary information such as codecs, file formats and protocols -- then substantial time for preparation and a lengthy evidentiary hearing will still be required. There can be no rush to judgment granting such unprecedented relief in light of the importance of the interests at stake, and the government has offered no justification for highly expedited procedures in seeking to impose its requested relief. **********The need for deliberate procedures is especially strong because much of the intellectual property the government seeks to confiscate relates to products and technologies, such as Windows 2000, that were not even mentioned at trial. (As the Court is aware, Windows 2000 is the successor product to Windows NT 4.0, not Windows 9x.) There is no evidence in the record to support a de facto taking of these products and technologies, and if the Court intends to consider such draconian relief, Microsoft is entitled to address these new issues fully and deliberately. **********Even if the Court rejects both the government's proposed breakup and confiscation of Microsoft's intellectual property, the remaining &quot;conduct&quot; relief requested by the government -- which includes several provisions regulating the design of Microsoft's operating system software -- is severe and unwarranted in the circumstances. As Microsoft explains in its memorandum in support of its proposed final judgment, the relief awarded by the Court should be reasonably related to the antitrust violations found. The &quot;conduct&quot; relief requested by the government, which goes far beyond remedying the acts the Court found to be anticompetitive, is punitive and thus improper. Microsoft is entitled to a full hearing before &quot;conduct&quot; remedies as regulatory, over-reaching, vague and difficult to administer as those requested by the government are imposed. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE PROCEEDINGS **********&#9; A.&#9;Microsoft's Remedy Proposal **********In accordance with the procedure established by the Court, Microsoft has submitted a proposed final judgment that fully redresses all of the antitrust violations found by the Court. Should the Court deem it appropriate, Microsoft consents to entry of that order forthwith, without prejudice to Microsoft's position on the merits or its right to contest on appeal the appropriateness of any granting of relief. Microsoft has no interest in delaying resolution of this case; its only interest is in ensuring that this Court, and the appellate courts that review the matter, render decisions on a fairly constructed and complete record. If the Court believes that it is imperative to enter some relief now, but wishes to consider additional relief necessitating discovery and a more extended hearing schedule, the Court could enter Microsoft's proposed final judgment as a preliminary injunction, providing the government with substantial immediate relief while preserving Microsoft's ability to make a full record with respect to any additional relief at such time as the Court may chose to consider such relief. Granting such a preliminary injunction would, of course, be subject to Microsoft's right to seek immediate appellate review of the basis for the preliminary injunction order before the Court imposes any remedy. See 28 U.S.C. \u20ac&nbsp;1292(a)(1). **********&#9; B.&#9;Proposed Alternative Schedules **********The nature and scope of the procedures required at this stage of the trial depend upon the kind of remedies that the Court is prepared to consider. The more extreme the remedy under consideration, and the more that remedy is based on information outside the trial record, the more discovery and the more extensive the procedures Microsoft will need to defend and assert its interests. Accordingly, pursuant to Scheduling Order No. 8, dated April 5, 2000, Microsoft requests that the Court adopt one of the following schedules, depending on which elements of the government's proposals the Court elects to consider. **********&#9;&#9;1.&#9;If the Court elects to consider the full range of relief requested by the government, including the government's breakup proposal ( see Pls.' Proposed Final Judgment ||&nbsp;1-2), Microsoft requests that the Court enter the scheduling order annexed hereto as Exhibit A, which culminates in an evidentiary hearing beginning on December 4, 2000. **********&#9;&#9;2.&#9;If the Court grants Microsoft's motion for summary rejection of the government's breakup proposal ( see id . ||&nbsp;1-2), filed contemporaneously herewith, but elects to consider the government's proposed &quot;disclosure relief&quot; with its attendant confiscation of Microsoft's intellectual property ( see id . |&nbsp;3(b)-(c)), Microsoft requests that the Court enter the scheduling order annexed hereto as Exhibit B, which culminates in an evidentiary hearing beginning on October 2, 2000. **********&#9;&#9;3.&#9;If the Court rejects both the government's breakup proposal and its proposed &quot;disclosure relief&quot; now ( see id . ||&nbsp;1-2, 3(b)-(c)), but declines at this juncture to enter Microsoft's proposed final judgment, Microsoft requests that the Court enter the scheduling order annexed hereto as Exhibit C, which culminates in an evidentiary hearing beginning on August 7, 2000. ARGUMENT **********If the Court is willing to consider the full range of relief requested by the government, including the government's proposal to break Microsoft into two companies, then Microsoft needs significant time (i)&nbsp;to conduct discovery of persons who possess relevant information, and (ii)&nbsp;to prepare for an evidentiary hearing at which the lack of justification for, and deleterious effects of, the government's requested relief can be fully presented. Due process requires that Microsoft be given adequate time to defend itself against the threat of dismemberment. See United States v. National Lead Co. , 332 U.S. 319, 329-31, 353 (1947) (court-ordered divestiture of separate operating units of going concern &quot;would amount to an abuse of discretion,&quot; despite existence of substantial record on remedies consisting of more than 5,500 pages of testimony and exhibits compiled during more than three months of trial). **********What the government has described euphemistically as a &quot;reasonably implemented&quot; proposal (Pls.' Mem. at 2) is, in reality, a punitive attempt to weaken or destroy Microsoft's position as a leading software company. Unlike requested relief in most antitrust cases, which seeks to enjoin the violations found and to undo the effects of specific conduct, the government's proposal is a broad-based attack on Microsoft that the government acknowledges &quot;will profoundly affect the information industry.&quot; (Romer Decl. |&nbsp;3.) The government thus concedes that the intended consequences of its requested relief would be far-reaching. The unintended -- or at least unacknowledged -- consequences would be even more far-reaching: breaking Microsoft into two pieces would damage, if not destroy, the company's commercial viability, making it extremely difficult for Microsoft to compete with well-financed companies like IBM and Sun Microsystems that are far more integrated than Microsoft. Understanding why the government's breakup proposal is so misguided involves an in-depth exploration of the myriad ways in which Microsoft's development and marketing efforts, as well as consumers and the industry as a whole, benefit from the unitary nature of the company's operations. **********Similarly, confiscating Microsoft's intellectual property by mandating disclosure to competitors of much of the company's proprietary information would have devastating effects on Microsoft's ability to develop innovative products. As explained in greater detail in Microsoft's summary response to the government's proposed final judgment, the government's proposal would require Microsoft to disclose to its competitors -- free of charge -- essentially all of its intellectual property associated with its operating systems. Such a requirement would create an obvious disincentive for Microsoft to innovate. It also would discourage other companies from working with Microsoft on new innovations in Windows because such companies may not want their innovations to be disclosed immediately to the industry at large. **********The government admits that its requested relief could have a dramatic impact on the entire software industry. According to one of the government's economists, &quot;[t]he remedy entered by the Court in this matter will have a major influence on the nature of competition and the path of innovation in the information technology sector of the economy.&quot; (Shapiro Decl. at 29.) The government is not , in the guise of proposing a remedy for specific antitrust violations, supposed to engage in economic experimentation based on the untested views of academics who think they know better than the Nation's free enterprise system how the software industry should be structured. The sort of micro-management of Microsoft's design decisions embodied in the government's requested relief is precisely what the Court of Appeals has cautioned against. If the Court nonetheless elects to consider proceeding down the path suggested by the government, Microsoft must be allowed to develop the factual record necessary to enable the Court to understand fully the implications of doing so. **********Basic considerations of judicial efficiency ( see Fed. R. Civ. P. 1) call for the prompt denial of those aspects of the government's requested relief that are facially unreasonable. The government's breakup proposal is grossly disproportionate to the antitrust violations found. Moreover, as explained in Microsoft's summary response to the government's proposed final judgment, the breakup proposal is both inconsistent with positions asserted by the government at trial and only speculatively connected to the purported goal of increasing competition in what the Court has defined as the market for &quot;Intel-compatible PC operating systems.&quot; For those reasons, among others, the breakup proposal should be summarily rejected. **********&#9; A.&#9;If Breakup Is Considered **********Although the government presumably has been formulating its remedy proposal for many months now, Microsoft learned just twelve days ago of the radical nature of the relief requested by the government and of many of the new allegations that underlie those sweeping requests. As discussed in Microsoft's summary response to the government's proposal, these allegations amount to an improper attempt by the government essentially to collapse an entirely new lawsuit, involving different products, different technologies, different competitors and different time frames, into the remedy proceeding in this case. **********If the Court denies Microsoft's request for summary rejection of the government's breakup proposal, Microsoft will require significant time to conduct discovery and prepare for a full trial. In particular, Microsoft will need time to prepare and serve document requests on the government, draft and issue subpoenas for documents and deposition testimony on third parties and obtain documents and deposition testimony from the government's proposed trial witnesses. It will, of course, take time for third parties to respond to Microsoft's requests, and the government may serve its own discovery requests. At the same time it is engaged in such discovery, Microsoft will need to identify its own witnesses to present as part of its affirmative case, including expert witnesses to respond to the opinions offered for the first time by the government's new witnesses and fact witnesses to respond to the raft of new factual issues raised by the government's breakup proposal. Microsoft and its counsel cannot be expected to investigate a whole host of new issues, conduct significant third-party and other discovery, identify its witnesses and otherwise prepare its own affirmative case in less than six months, especially given that the government's requested relief threatens Microsoft's very corporate existence. **********&#9; B.&#9;If Breakup Is Not Considered **********Should the Court summarily reject the government's breakup proposal, the remedies phase will be shorter and less complicated. If the Court is not going to consider breakup, Microsoft suggests that the Court adopt proceedings similar to those that preceded the rebuttal phase of the trial: limited third-party discovery and reasonably prompt disclosure by the parties of their trial witnesses, together with a brief summary of the witnesses' anticipated testimony, followed by limited document and deposition discovery relevant to that testimony. Yet, given the severity of the government's proposed &quot;disclosure&quot; provisions -- which relate largely to products and technologies that were not at issue at trial -- Microsoft still will require adequate time (approximately four months) to conduct discovery, identify expert and fact witnesses and prepare its affirmative case should those provisions not be rejected now. **********Although it may appear at first blush to be less extreme than breakup, the government's proposed confiscation of Microsoft's intellectual property is similarly radical. Indeed, the government's proposed relief threatens to destroy the value of Windows (which is premised entirely on its intellectual property protections) and to make it impossible for Microsoft to work with any other companies to improve the operating system. Nothing in the Court's Findings of Fact or Conclusions of Law remotely justifies the government's demand that Microsoft provide its competitors with detailed information about the inner workings of products that Microsoft has spent huge amounts of time and money to develop. Like the breakup proposal, the proposed confiscation of Microsoft's intellectual property is unreasonable in law and fact and should be summarily rejected. **********Removing the distraction of these over-broad requests for relief would enable the parties to focus their efforts on developing a record that will aid the Court in framing a proper remedy. The government's remaining requests for relief, which include provisions extensively regulating the design of Microsoft's operating system software, are much too severe in light of the antitrust violations found by the Court, suffer from a serious lack of clarity, raise numerous practical questions as to implementation and would gravely injure the Windows platform. For these reasons and others, even these proposed &quot;conduct&quot; provisions would cause adverse consequences to Microsoft, its many business partners and the consuming public. They thus should not be imposed without a full and fair consideration by the Court of their costs, and Microsoft should not be required to defend against such proposed restrictions without at least two months to conduct discovery, identify witnesses and prepare its affirmative case. CONCLUSION **********The government has invited the Court to destroy or hobble an American company that is a model of success in the high technology arena and to do so explicitly to reshape the single most productive and envied industry in the United States. In contrast, Microsoft has filed with the Court today -- and consents to the Court's immediate entry of -- a proposed final judgment that fully addresses the antitrust violations found by the Court in a manner consistent with the law of antitrust remedies. If the Court declines to enter that order, Microsoft requests that the Court adopt a schedule that gives the parties adequate time to obtain discovery and prepare for an evidentiary hearing, consistent with fundamental principles of due process. **********Respectfully submitted, **********______________________________ **********William H.

Problems", "print_headline": "Ford and Another Tire Maker Facing New S.U.V. Problems", "body_text": " **********Even as Firestone and Ford struggle to recall millions of defective tires on Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles, the Ford Motor Company and another tire maker, Continental A.G., are preparing to replace another brand of tire on 40,000 Lincoln Navigator full-size sport utility vehicles. **********Continental and the Lincoln division of Ford said in a joint statement this evening that they planned to present information on problems associated with the tires to regulators at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration at a meeting in Washington on Tuesday. **********The companies declined to make the information available tonight, but said in their statement that ''it is appropriate to point out that the information the companies will share with N.H.T.S.A. includes no reports of serious accidents, fatalities or serious injuries.'' **********Katharina Konowalski, a Continental spokeswoman, said that the tiremaker planned to announce a ''customer satisfaction'' program, but not a recall, to replace the tires. ''It's not a safety-related issue,'' she said. **********But a person close to the Ford effort on the issue said that the automaker and Continental would discuss with regulators whether to call the tire replacement a recall. The tires have sometimes lost portions of their treads, and this has produced an above-average rate of property damage claims as well as requests by consumers to replace the tires under warranty, the person said. **********In another sign of the tire issues' spreading effects, Firestone's parent, the Bridgestone Corporation of Japan, said that it would reshuffle Firestone's management and would increase its line of bank credit. **********The replacement of Continental tires is certain to increase regulators' scrutiny of other brands of tires as well. While tire makers have long blamed customer neglect or abuse for tire failure, and have said some tires inevitably fail, Firestone's admission last week that it ''made bad tires'' appears to have opened the floodgates for lawsuits and regulatory action against other companies. **********The tires involved are the 16-inch ContiTrac AS tires, which were installed on half the Navigators in the 1998 and 1999 model years, which were the first two model years for the $45,000 luxury sport utility. Lincoln offered 17-inch tires as an option on the Navigator in these two model years, then made the 17-inch tires standard equipment beginning in the 2000 model year. The 17-inch tires are not being replaced. **********The far larger recall of Firestone tires, to which 88 deaths have been linked, involves the smaller of two sizes of tires installed on Ford Explorers. Bridgestone/Firestone is recalling 15-inch tires in that case, but not 16-inch tires. Smaller tires can carry less weight than larger tires of the same pressure, so they are subject to more strain when mounted on large, heavy sport utility vehicles. **********Ford's recommendation that the Explorer tires be inflated to 26 pounds per square inch has been criticized by some lawmakers and personal injury lawyers as insufficient. But the recommended pressure for the 16-inch tires on the Navigator is 30 pounds for the front tires and 35 pounds for the rear tires. Higher pressure tires can carry more weight. **********Ford documents given to Congressional investigators two weeks ago, which were quickly distributed to reporters, included a memorandum from Ford's Middle Eastern units more than a year ago warning that Continental tires on Lincoln Navigators there had sometimes failed. Another document in that collection showed that Ford had installed high-speed tires on its cars for sale in Saudi Arabia, but had not done so for its sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks sold there. By contrast, General Motors installs high-speed tires on all vehicles sold there, because the heat and fast driving there are a harsh combination for tires. **********Regulators opened a review last March of 47 million Firestone tires;  they have not endorsed Firestone's decision to recall only 14.4 million of these tires, of which 6.5 million are still believed to be in use. Also under review are 16-inch Firestone Wilderness tires for Ford Explorers and Ford Expeditions."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/30/business/william-blair-82-co-founder-of-country-journal.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-06-30", "snippet": "William S Blair, former publisher of Harper's magazine and co-founder of Country Journal, died on June 21 at age 82 (M)", "word_count": 405, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Obituary; Biography", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "William Blair, 82, Co-Founder of Country Journal", "print_headline": "William Blair, 82, Co-Founder of Country Journal", "body_text": " **********William S. Blair, a former publisher of Harper's magazine and co-founder of Country Journal, died on June 21 at a retirement home in Peterborough, N.H. He was 82. **********It was at Harper's, in 1971, that Mr. Blair clashed with the younger editor in chief, Willie Morris, over declining circulation and huge financial losses at the magazine. Mr. Morris was a magnet for writing talent, revered by writers like Norman Mailer and William Styron. When Mr. Morris resigned from the magazine that year, six editors quit in stormy protest. **********Mr. Blair became the publisher at Harper's in 1968. He was also president, and left soon after the departure of Mr. Morris. Before that, he was president and chief executive of Harper-Atlantic Sales, a company he joined in 1957. It was then a wholly owned subsidiary of Harper & Row and the Atlantic Monthly Company. Before that, he was a research director at Ogilvy, Benson & Mather. **********After the trouble at Harper's, Mr. Blair moved to Guilford, Vt., where he and his wife, Mary, had bought a 106-acre farm in 1964. (It grew to more than 200 acres.) There, Mrs. Blair said, he grew 40 acres of daffodils, tulips and irises, reminiscent of the fields of flowers he used to wander through as a boy in Scotland.  Local farmers grew corn and raised cattle on the property, and Mr. Blair spent afternoons fishing for trout. **********''It was much more his speed,'' said Lewis H. Lapham, the current editor of Harper's, who knew Mr. Blair. ''It was tweed coats. And people talked in civil tones.'' **********It was there, too, in 1974, that he started Country Journal with a friend and colleague, Richard M. Ketchum. The magazine was written for people who had grown tired of hectic city and suburban life and took refuge in rural living, not unlike Mr. Blair. ''The magazine was an extension of his own life,'' Mrs. Blair said. It was sold a decade later. **********Mr. Blair was born in Glasgow in 1917, the son of a minister, and attended Oxford University in the late 1930's, earning a degree in economics, Mrs. Blair said. He moved to the United States in 1940, where he attended graduate school at Princeton and, during World War II, joined the Canadian Army. **********In addition to his wife of 55 years, Mr. Blair is survived by two daughters, Sheila, of Richmond, N.H., and Fiona, of Brattleboro, Vt.; a son, Colin, of Arlington, Mass.; and two grandchildren."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/12/world/world-briefing.html": {"writer_name": "Terence Neilan", "pub_date": "2000-01-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 909, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "World Briefing", "print_headline": "World Briefing", "body_text": " **********EUROPE **********FRANCE: TRUCK PROTEST CONTINUES -- Thousands of trucks stayed backed up at France's borders on the second day of a blockade by truck owners protesting higher fuel prices and a government-imposed move to reduce the workweek, without reducing wages.

She regained the office for a third time in 1994, but retired in August to let her daughter, current President Chandrika Kumaratunga, appoint a hard-liner ahead of the elections to help boost the battle against the Tamil separatists, called the Tamil Tigers. **********The rebels' quest for an independent homeland has claimed some 63,000 lives and displaced another 1 million Sri Lankans since the war began. **********Several hours before news of Bandaranaike's death spread across this island nation off the southern tip of India, Tamil Tiger rebels shelled an administrative center in Jaffna, a northern city which has been under siege for years. **********Reports from Jaffna, the center of the ongoing Tamil war, said 15 to 20 shells fell around the main administrative building before voting started. The army also discovered a time-activated bomb at the city's bus station shortly before polling started. No casualties were reported in either incident. **********Kumaratunga regards the election as a referendum on a proposed new constitution that would give more power to Sri Lanka's regions, including the north and east, where separatists are fighting for a homeland for the minority Tamils. She hopes her seven-party coalition can win the two-thirds majority of legislative seats needed to pass it. **********With the constitution, Kumaratunga hopes to win over moderate Tamils, dim the appeal of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and bring an end to the war. **********The race was primarily between the two main parties: Kamaratunga's People's Alliance and former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's United National Party. A record 5,477 candidates were vying for 225 seats in parliament in the election. **********Reports from around the country indicated widespread problems at polling booths. \"At least 20 of our supporters have been either harassed and assaulted in several parts of the country,\" said Chinthaka Perera, a People's Freedom Front spokesman. The party emerged as the third-largest vote puller in the December presidential election. **********At least six officials of Kumaratunga's People's Alliance in the eastern Ampara area were chased out of polling stations, said party spokesman Ariyasinghe, who uses only one name. **********Elsewhere, two members of Kumaratunga's Peoples' Alliance were dragged out of their vehicles near Kandy after midnight and beaten to death, police officer Sanath Happugale said by telephone. The area is 56 miles east of the capital, Colombo. In a second incident, a grenade was thrown into the house of the People's Alliance vice chairman of a southern village council in Elpitiya, killing his 6-year-old daughter. **********The fatalities brought the total number of people killed in election violence to 64 since campaigning started five weeks ago."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/24/business/company-news-bausch-lomb-makes-bid-for-wesley-jessen.html": {"writer_name": "Bridge News", "pub_date": "2000-03-24", "snippet": "Bausch & Lomb, maker of contact lenses, makes unsolicited offer of $600 million in cash to acquire Wesley Jessen VisionCare, specialty lens manufacturer (S)", "word_count": 99, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BAUSCH & LOMB MAKES BID FOR WESLEY JESSEN", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; BAUSCH & LOMB MAKES BID FOR WESLEY JESSEN", "body_text": " **********Bausch & Lomb, the maker of contact lenses, made an unsolicited offer of $600 million in cash yesterday to acquire Wesley Jessen VisionCare, a specialty lens manufacturer.

One of two possibilities, the German foreign minister said, would be for a federal European government to emerge from the European Commission, with a directly elected president. **********The suggestion echoed a view held by some of the European Union's founding fathers, who hoped that Europe would evolve into something resembling the United States. The commission would be the executive; the European Parliament would play the role of the House of Representatives, and the intergovernmental Council of Ministers that of the Senate. **********Mr. Fischer's musings on the commission's possible governmental destiny will have delighted old-style European federalists \u2014 who see the commission as the most important motor of European integration \u2014 as well as many current commission employees. Renato Prodi, the commission president, already sees himself as a kind of prime minister of Europe. **********Realistically, however, the idea is not going to work, at least anytime soon. If there is a move to a federal European government over the medium term, it is much more likely to follow the path of Mr. Fischer's alternate suggestion \u2014 a government composed of representatives of the member states. **********Over nearly half a century, the EU has not developed the way many of its founders had hoped. Although the European Parliament has gradually increased its authority, member governments meeting in the Council of Ministers have maintained political dominance over the EU's more supranational institutions. **********More recently, the national governments have added to their authority by developing common policies in such areas as security, justice, foreign affairs and immigration, which go far beyond the EU's traditional economic and commercial concerns. The new policies are being pioneered largely outside the original institutional framework, the source of the commission's political power. **********The commission, in fact, is looking weaker politically than it has for a long time. The current Prodi commission is a great improvement on its predecessor, which was forced to resign last year after allegations of nepotism and mismanagement caused an outcry in the European Parliament. **********But the commission is still the target for anyone with a gripe about European integration and, in many quarters, a symbol of \"faceless\" bureaucracy. With most of the legislative foundations already in place for the EU's single market and common currency, the commission seems bereft of a new \"big idea.\" **********Many of the complaints are unfair and should be directed at national governments, not the commission. Although some of the \"faceless\" Eurocrats are freeloading at taxpayers' expense, most are dedicated, highly talented and professional. Important reforms are under way in such areas as financial controls and personnel management. **********The commission is still a unique institution, with broad executive, administrative, regulatory and representative functions. It remains the official initiator of EU legislation, the guardian of the flame of European idealism and the EU's collective memory. **********Despite its declining political influence, its responsibilities continue to grow. According to a new study published by the Center for European Reform in London, \"European Governance and the Future of the Commission,\" it is well placed to play a major role even in such new policy areas as foreign affairs. **********\"As globalization blurs the boundaries between international and domestic policy, the Commission's influence in external relations is, in fact, growing,\" Ben Hall, the study's author, argues. The commission will manage the EU's enlargement into Central and Eastern Europe (the nearest thing to a new \"big idea\") and could be the \"brains\" of the 11-nation euro zone. **********The commission will play a key part in implementing the extravagant pledge by European leaders at their recent Lisbon summit meeting to make the EU the world's most economically competitive region by 2010. But, Mr. Hall said, it will have to do so by employing \"softer\" methods, such as peer pressure and mutual surveillance. **********It must, he said, \"learn to adapt to a new role where it no longer has the right of initiative to propose laws nor a monopoly of wisdom.\" It must conduct a delicate balancing act between maintaining its independence and cooperating more closely with member states. It must, in a nutshell, endeavor to behave less, not more, like a European government if it is to remain influential. **********- **********E-mail address: thinkahead@iht.com"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/24/business/worldbusiness/IHT-host-to-cebit-fair-tries-to-shed-image-germany.html": {"writer_name": "John Schmid", "pub_date": "2000-02-24", "snippet": "As hosts to the world's biggest Internet trade fair, Germans this week are doing their best to shed a time-honored reputation as a nation of risk-shy technophobes..\"Germany until now was always known to view new technologies with a certain reserva", "word_count": 3037, "score": null, "source": "International Herald Tribune", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": null, "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Host to CeBIT Fair Tries to Shed Image : Germany Goes Techno", "print_headline": "Host to CeBIT Fair Tries to Shed Image : Germany Goes Techno", "body_text": " **********As hosts to the world's biggest Internet trade fair, Germans this week are doing their best to shed a time-honored reputation as a nation of risk-shy technophobes. **********\"Germany until now was always known to view new technologies with a certain reservation \u2014 yes, often even hostility,\" said Ron Sommer, chief executive of Deutsche Telekom AG, in the text of a keynote speech he was scheduled to deliver at the opening of the CeBIT fair. **********Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who hails from this industrial German city, came back to revel in his self-cultivated role as a new-generation politician helping to lead an iron-and-steel economy into a new epoch. **********\"CeBIT 2000 marks the start of the on-line century,\" Mr. Schroeder said in his speech for Wednesday evening. \"Our ambition is that our nation also takes a leading place in the international rivalry of the information age.\" **********Events leading up to the fair reveal a country eager to narrow what many Germans freely acknowledge as a yawning technology gap with the United States. **********In the past week, two of the biggest German banks sealed alliances with big on-line companies to offer financial services on the Internet.

Although the euro jumped briefly against the United States dollar to its highest level in six weeks -- 87.89 cents, up from 86.28 -- it later receded and closed at 86.68 cents. That was up from 86.01 on Thursday. **********''It is a desperation move by the E.C.B.,'' said Tony Norfield, chief foreign exchange analyst in London at the Dutch bank ABN  Amro. ''They are acting completely on their own behalf. The problem is that the underlying capital flows have not changed.'' **********The intervention was the latest in a long series of attempts to reverse the euro's relentless plunge in value against the dollar. Since the euro was adopted at the start of January 1999, it has lost more than 30 percent of its value against the dollar and even more against the Japanese yen. **********Six weeks ago, the European Central Bank stirred world markets when it announced a coordinated intervention on behalf of the euro, supported by the United States Treasury. But after rising a few cents on the day of the intervention, the currency soon began floating down again and hit a new intraday low of 82.30 cents on Oct. 26. **********At least part of the reason for the euro's hapless position has been the increasingly clear refusal of the United States to take part in a more sustained rescue effort. **********Hours after the intervention, the United States treasury secretary, Lawrence H. Summers, said the government stood by its policy of favoring a strong dollar but said he shared Europe's concern ''about the implications of the broad movements in the euro for the world economy.'' **********The question now is: Will the central bank be more effective on its own if it has more freedom to act? In short, is it better to have the United States as a reluctant partner or to act alone as a decisive player? **********Though not entirely unexpected, the intervention today caught investors off guard. Most experts had concluded that there would be no more intervention until after the United States presidential election next Tuesday, on the assumption that the Clinton administration did not want to be seen as weakening the dollar just before Americans went to the polls. **********But it was clear by the euro's drift back downward that currency traders and money managers were far from convinced that the euro's revival was at hand. **********Analysts estimated that the European Central Bank had intervened fairly modestly, buying up about one billion euros, or $860 million at today's depressed exchange rates. **********If that estimate is accurate, the intervention would be more limited than the one orchestrated on Sept. 22 by the European Central Bank, the United States Treasury and the central banks of England, Canada and Japan. Then, the banks were said to have bought $2 billion to $7 billion worth of euros. **********But the timing of today's move was fairly shrewd. By catching traders by surprise, the central bank was able, at least briefly, to jolt them out of their complacency. The central bank also moved just as the euro had begun to stage a tiny rally of its own. After sinking to the record last week, it had gained a few pennies in value this week. That allowed the central bank to reinforce a trend, which most analysts believe is more effective than trying to fight one. **********''I think the E.C.B. selected a very good moment,'' said Martin Hufner, the chief economist at Hypovereinsbank A.G., Germany's third-largest bank. ''Today's intervention decision was the signal to international financial markets that the European Central Bank is now showing its decisiveness.'' **********The euro's weakness has already pushed inflation above the central bank's declared upper limit of 2 percent a year. Inflation is running at 2.8 percent, with the most inflationary pressure coming from oil prices, which have tripled in two years. Moreover, the euro's weakness has added a huge surcharge for Europe because oil is priced in dollars. **********Wim Duisenberg, the president of the European Central Bank, said at a news conference on Thursday that inflation would remain above the designated targets for longer than the bank had originally expected. In Germany, Europe's biggest economy, import prices have surged 13 percent in the last year and producer prices have climbed steeply. **********Yet despite efforts on almost every front, the euro has yet to revive. Originally conceived in part as a strong rival to the dollar, the new currency has instead become an ever-present suggestion that Europe's economy simply is not as robust or attractive as the economy in the United States. **********Most analysts continue to say that the euro's weakness has little to do with short-term speculators but that, rather, it stems from the huge flow of direct investment into the United States from Europe and the rest of the world. **********In Germany, a growing number of prominent economists are begging the European Central Bank to intervene in a big way and more than once. Although many British and American experts are skeptical that orchestrated interventions can have a lasting impact, some argue that now, the time is right. **********But the risks are substantial and growing higher. Each time the European Central Bank intervenes unsuccessfully, it loses more credibility. That, in turn, makes each subsequent attempt even more likely to fail. **********''The E.C.B. needs to make it clear that the euro devaluation is over,'' said Mr. Hufner of Hypovereinsbank. **********In a market where trillions of dollar cross borders daily, however, that is much easier said than done."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/04/world/muzzle-chafes-chechen-war-media.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Gordon", "pub_date": "2000-02-04", "snippet": "Two struggles are under way in Chechnya: fierce fight between Russian military and thousands of rebels, and more subtle tug of war between Russian high command and nation's media; every day Russia's journalists do battle with military press servic...", "word_count": 1240, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Muzzle Chafes Chechen War Media", "print_headline": "Muzzle Chafes Chechen War Media", "body_text": " **********''No filming the corpses,'' a military press officer barked as a group of correspondents jumped off a Russian Army helicopter on the outskirts of the Chechen capital. **********Six dead Russian soldiers were wrapped in shiny metal foil and lined up in a muddy field. Some photographer quietly sneaked a shot, but the grisly images were not included in the Russian television news. **********Two struggles are under way in Chechnya: a fierce fight between the Russian military and thousands of rebels, and a more subtle tug of war between the Russian high command and the nation's media. **********Every day Russia's journalists do battle with the military press service, which regulates access to the battlefield and is determined to put out the message that the Kremlin's war is going according to plan. **********So far the military has the upper hand. **********''The main preoccupation of the military press service is not to organize press coverage of the war, but to limit journalists' access,'' said Yevgeny Kirichenko, a military correspondent for NTV, the only independent Russian television network. **********Russian television helped turn the Russian public against the last war in Chechnya. So television is now a preoccupation for the Russian military, which sees it as the main vehicle for influencing public opinion. **********Virtually all of the Chechnya trips arranged by the military are for the benefit of Russia's three major television networks: NTV, the state-owned RTR and ORT, which is officially owned by the Russian government but is heavily influenced by Boris A. Berezovsky, a tycoon and now parliamentary deputy. **********Even so, television crews face enormous obstacles. **********During the 1994-1996 war in Chechnya, reporters were able to shuttle from the Russian forces to the Chechen rebels and back. But the threat of kidnapping for ransom, which emerged after the first war, has discouraged many journalists from traveling freely in Chechnya. **********The Russian government's restrictions have hampered the media too. Russian authorities require that all reporters who enter Chechnya obtain official accreditation or go on government-arranged trips, which generally last no more than two or three days. In either case, the journalists must be escorted by the Russian military. **********Reporters who ignore those procedures and venture into rebel-controlled areas to cover the other side of the story are subject to detention when they return to the Russian positions. Andrei M. Babitsky, a reporter for the United States funded Radio Liberty, filmed life in the rebel controlled part of Grozny and then was apprehended by Russian forces after he left the Chechen capital. **********''During the previous campaign we had a chance to move about Chechnya on our own,'' said Roman Perevezentsev of ORT. ''In three weeks I have not really been able to see the places where the main fighting is going on. The abyss between Mozdok and Grozny is hard to overcome.'' **********The best of Russia's war correspondents, in fact, spend most of their time waiting at the sprawling military Russian base in Mozdok, which is just a few miles northwest of Chechnya. **********Russian television crews stand for hours on a muddy patch at the base, or even ankle deep in snow when the temperature plunges below freezing, waiting for the military press service to whisk them into Chechnya by helicopter. The trips usually last for several hours, and correspondents are rarely allowed to visit with the troops overnight. **********The press service chooses the destination. Many of the trips have been to the highlands in southern Chechnya, where the fighting is often intense but devoid of the grim scenes of destroyed apartment houses and terrified civilians that typify Grozny. **********Eager to report on the battle for the besieged Chechen capital, some Russian television reporters have bypassed the military press service by exploiting their contacts with the Interior Ministry forces and special rapid reaction troops, which are fighting in the streets of Grozny. **********Sometimes, however, Russian television crews fail to reach the city and their networks show several-days-old film in the evening broadcasts without identifying it as dated. **********Grozny is not the only place that is hard to reach. The military press service itself is inside a barricaded compound within the heavily secured base at Mozdok. Reporters cannot call: the press service has no civilian telephone. Nor can they visit it without a special pass, which even some of the most prominent networks have found hard to obtain. **********Reporters who do reach the press service receive one-page situation reports, which are issued twice daily but provide few battlefield details. **********Not all of the constraints are imposed by the military. Pyotr Korovikovsky noted that his state-owned RTR network takes care to describe the militants as ''separatists, bandits or participants in illegal armed groups.'' They are never ''defenders of Grozny'' or ''resistance fighters.'' **********Still, even RTR has chafed at the restrictions on travel within Chechnya and the scanty information distributed by the press service. **********''I am greatly disappointed with their work,'' Mr. Korovikovsky said. **********Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the Kremlin's new spokesman for the Chechen war, has promised to streamline the accredition system and improve the quality of information. **********To make the point, Mr. Yastrzhembsky for the first time said how many Russian soldiers and Interior Ministry troops were in Chechnya: 93,000. Despite that, however, there is no indication that the constraints are being loosened. **********Russian reporters face formal and unstated restrictions. The media, for example, are explicitly forbidden to show pictures that would enable the rebels to pinpoint Russian positions. **********The unstated rules are more confining. Filming the Russian dead and wounded, for example, is deeply frowned upon. **********Mr. Kirichenko of NTV knows as well as anyone where the authorities draw the line. He was one of the first correspondents to challenge the official casualty count, citing sources within the military. **********The aggressive Russian press coverage of the casualty issue was the main reason the Russian Defense Ministry recently acknowledged that Russian losses in Chechnya and neighboring Dagestan since August exceed 1,100, a number far greater than previously stated. **********Still, when Mr. Kirichenko's crew filmed wounded soldiers during a trip to Khankala, a Russian-controlled airfield on the eastern outskirts of Grozny, it did not include the footage in its evening report. **********''We shot it but did not show it,'' he explained. ''If we broadcast it the next NTV crew to come here might not be accredited.'' **********Reporting military setbacks can be risky, too. Mr. Perevenzentsev of ORT said the press service had recently informed him that the accredition of his fellow ORT correspondent Pavel Spirin was being canceled. **********Mr. Spirin's sin was in reporting that a stronghold occupied by rapid reaction troops had been jeopardized after nearby Russian Army forces failed to coordinate their actions with the occupying troops and retreated. As it turned out, Mr. Spirin was at the end of his tour, so the sanction had no effect. **********Sometimes the press service has fought to keep embarrassing episodes off the public record. Several Russian television crews were recently traveling in the Caucasus Mountains with Col. Gen. Viktor G. Kazantsev, commander of Russian forces in the North Caucasus, when their helicopter was grounded for several hours because of a thick fog. **********By the time the helicopter took off, a thick crust of ice had collected on its blades. It crashed shortly after lifting into the air, according to Mr. Perevezentsev of ORT. The tail broke off, and the helicopter collided with a truck carrying ammunition, which actually saved it from sliding down a hill. **********General Kazantsev, his aides and the television crews scrambled out of the helicopter shaken but uninjured. They had just regained their bearings when the first words from a press officer rang out: ''No filming the helicopter.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/01/world/world-briefing.html": {"writer_name": "Jeanne Moore", "pub_date": "2000-08-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1026, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "World Briefing", "print_headline": "World Briefing", "body_text": " **********ASIA **********INDIA: TOP ACTOR KIDNAPPED **********Rajkumar, one of southern India's best-known movie stars, left, has been kidnapped by Veerappan, one of India's most notorious criminals, the police said.

Rain blows in on the pupils through broken classroom windows when thunderstorms sweep across the cactus outside. **********So when Francisco Labastida, the governing party's presidential candidate, promised in a television commercial to install computers and offer English classes in every Mexican elementary school, teachers like Gabriela Garcia were skeptical. **********''I think they should start by fixing our windows,'' said Ms. Garcia, who teaches fifth and sixth grade in the dilapidated rural school in Otumba, 50 miles northeast of Mexico City. **********For weeks, educators and parents all across Mexico criticized Mr. Labastida's proposals as an election-year gimmick out of touch with the basic needs of most schools. Mr. Labastida finally retreated, acknowledging in a speech that the government could help many more students by patching schoolhouse roofs and improving Spanish instruction rather than introducing computers. **********In previous presidential elections, governing party candidates referred to the schools mainly in self-congratulatory speeches extolling the heroic educational achievements of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, which has ruled Mexico for 71 years. But this year's race has aroused a genuine debate over education, with opposition candidates criticizing the top-heavy bureaucracy and inequities of the public schools. **********On average, Mexicans attend classes for eight years, the government says, but Inter-American Development Bank figures show that the poorest 30 percent of students attend for just three. Recognizing that a better educated population is required for economic progress, all three major candidates have pledged to increase school spending. But that may not be an easy solution because President Ernesto Zedillo says that 27 percent of every government peso already goes to education. **********Educators in several towns and villages surrounding Mexico City, asked about school financing, contended that little of that money reached their schools. Experts on Mexico's education system said extraordinary sums were frittered away by education bureaucrats. **********Mexican schools are controlled not by local boards, as in the United States, but by a federal Education Department, which mandates a national curriculum, and 31 state departments, which keep academic records and send inspectors to oversee teachers. The same system, transferred to New York, would require a principal in Queens, for example, to negotiate even small curriculum changes with federal officials in Washington and to travel to Albany to register students' grades. **********The Mexican bureaucracy is dominated by a teachers' union whose bosses are leaders of Mr. Zedillo's governing party, and they frequently press teachers to campaign for official candidates. **********In the farm village of Atlatongo, a 90-minute drive north of Mexico City, the Ramon Beteta elementary school is named for a prominent governing party politician. The tidy school,  shaded by jacaranda trees, is one of the best in its county, but different from most American schools. It has no cafeteria, gymnasium, science lab or lockers. It is just a line of concrete classrooms. **********Its principal, Jesus Rangel Hernandez, said in an interview that he wondered where Mexico's relatively high education expenditures went. The government says it spends $661 on every elementary student. With 900 students, the school should get nearly $600,000 this year, Mr. Rangel reasoned, jotting figures on a paper. The government provides textbooks and pays his 24 teachers a total of about $240,000 annually. That should leave at least $300,000 for maintenance and other supplies, he said. **********''But they give us nothing,'' Mr. Rangel said. Parent contributions pay for the salaries of a secretary and two janitors. From his desk he pulled a stack of letters sent over the years to authorities, requesting money to mend the school's fence, hire a janitor, and buy supplies like chalk and mimeograph ink. ''It's always the same response: 'No money in the budget,' '' he said. **********''You know what I think they do with the money?'' he said. ''They spend it in the PRI's election campaigns.'' **********Education Department bureaucrats and union leaders tried to strong-arm his teachers last year to campaign for the governing party candidate for state governor, Mr. Rangel said. **********''The waste is extraordinary,'' said Carlos Ornelas, an education professor who is the author of a standard textbook, ''The Mexican Education System.'' Many full-time workers for the union are classified on the payroll as teachers and given government cars. ''I'd say 30 to 40 percent of the education budget is just squandered by the bureaucracy,'' Mr. Ornelas said. **********[Miguel Limon Rojas, Mexico's secretary of education, acknowledged in an interview in his office in Mexico City that his efforts to trim bureaucratic waste had fallen short. **********[''It's a considerable problem,'' he said. But it was worse, he said, before a decentralization in 1993 turned control of 115,000 federal schools over to the states. About 85 percent of Mexico's $23.7 billion education budget for the year 2000 goes to pay teachers and bureaucrats, leaving little for anything else, he said. Hundreds of rural schools with only a handful of students absorb disproportionate sums in salaries. **********[''Our spending on physical plant and operational costs is insufficient, creating the sensation that the money isn't getting to the schools,'' Mr. Limon said.] **********The authorities have been reluctant to permit international scrutiny. After Mexican eighth graders took part with students from 37 other countries in a 1996 math and science test, the government embargoed the results.

An experimental physicist, he worked to puzzle out what cosmic rays are made of -- primarily protons, electrons and the nuclei of light atoms --  and to unlock the many mysteries those rays hold to this day. **********In 1944 he and another French physicist, Michel l'Heritier, published an article describing evidence of a new subatomic particle mixed with the cosmic rays.

It is likely that the particle was what was later called a meson. **********Like the proton and neutron (the constituents of atomic nuclei) mesons are made of smaller building blocks known as quarks.

He said that because teams of Israeli and Palestinian negotiators had been at an impasse for the last month, he had been left with no choice but to ask the two leaders to meet and take on the most difficult decisions themselves. **********''They're willing to give it their best shot,'' Mr. Clinton said in the press room at the White House. ''And they understand too that as we have already seen, delay tends to make these things worse, not better.'' **********Despite his optimism, Mr. Clinton and his advisers refrained today from even listing the major issues the two leaders will tackle: the future status of Jerusalem, the fate of Palestinian refugees and the territorial shape of a Palestinian state. **********For Mr. Barak, faced with a fragile political coalition in his government, the summit meeting fulfills a strategy he has been urging on Mr. Clinton for several weeks. In Paris today, the Israeli prime minister spoke confidently of such a meeting as an ''important moment'' in the history of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. He said he would seek ''separation from the Palestinians and the establishment of good-neighborliness with them.'' **********In contrast, Abu Ala, the speaker of the Palestinian legislature and the senior Palestinian negotiator, contended today that Mr. Clinton had bent to Israeli pressure and that he doubted that the summit meeting would ''achieve any of its aims.'' **********The Palestinians had made clear they believed that the divisions between the two sides were so great that more discussion was needed at a lower level before convening the leaders. In Ramallah last week, speaking with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright at his side, Mr. Arafat made it clear that he would go to a summit meeting if invited, but reluctantly. **********For Mr. Clinton, a successful outcome would cap his foreign policy achievements, giving him several accomplishments in the Middle East. He has overseen a series of Israeli-Palestinian agreements starting with a handshake between Mr. Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin, the late Israeli Prime Minister, on the White House lawn in September 1993. **********Mr. Clinton's senior foreign policy aides, including Dr. Albright and his national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, met at Camp David on Monday and decided that it was ''now or never,'' a senior official said. **********They concluded, the official said, that little was to be gained by waiting and that by sequestering the two leaders in the relaxed atmosphere of Camp David, a positive outcome was not out of the question. **********A heavy influence on the decision on Monday, according to the senior official, was the date of Sept. 13. Mr. Arafat's Palestinian Central Council reaffirmed a few days ago that he would unilaterally declare a Palestinian state on that day if a peace agreement was not reached by then. **********With that threat, which the administration knew would prompt retaliation by the Israelis and annexation of settlements on the West Bank, the risk of increasing violence was unacceptably high, the official said. **********''We didn't want to slide into that period when things begin to unravel in anticipation,'' he said, alluding to Sept. 13. **********Despite Mr. Arafat's threat to declare a Palestinian state and the emerging image of his being almost dragged to the summit, administration officials said they believed that the Palestinian leader preferred to have a state recognized by Israel. **********Unilaterally declaring a state on 40 percent of the West Bank that has been handed over to the Palestinians so far would be a ''mixed bag'' for Mr. Arafat, the senior official said, adding, ''That is a prescription for turmoil, and he understands that.'' **********The administration has set no deadlines for the summit meeting and has left open the possibility of a second stage. **********The two teams of negotiators are to arrive in Washington during the weekend, followed on Monday night by Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat. **********Mr. Clinton is to leave Washington for Okinawa, Japan, on July 19 for a summit meeting of the leading industrial nations, known as the Group of 7. Russia will also attend, and the president is to meet with its leader, Vladimir V. Putin. **********''I hope we would have some clarity before that,'' the official said of July 19, but added, ''We will face that when and if we get to it.'' **********In looking at the task at Camp David, Mr. Clinton said: ''We all know what the deal is. We know what the issues are. We know at least within a range what the options are. I think if we work hard, we can get it done in several days, but I will give it whatever time is required, as long as we're still moving forward.'' **********After the announcement, a senior official said that by mentioning ''the deal,'' Mr. Clinton was not referring to a specific outcome but rather to the fact that the negotiators know the broad outlines of the ''story.'' The talks are likely to take more than the ''several days'' described by the president, a senior official said. **********A series of leaks in Israeli newspapers, which were intended to put pressure on Mr. Barak not to make significant concessions to the Palestinians, outlined the shape of what a final agreement would look like. The newspaper accounts were not definitively denied by the Israeli government, and they conformed with accounts given by diplomats from the region in recent weeks. **********In essence, the accounts said the future of the Palestinian refugees scattered across the Middle East could be settled by financial support from the international community -- perhaps as much as $100 billion over 20 years -- enabling them either to stay where they are or to emigrate to other countries. **********They also said differences were beginning to be narrowed on the size of the Palestinian state -- about 90 or 92 percent of the West Bank -- with about 40,000 Israeli settlers having to be evacuated from the West Bank. **********But the issue of Jerusalem remains the biggest sticking point, the diplomats said. The Israeli accounts said Mr. Barak was contemplating conceding Arab neighborhoods in Jerusalem to Palestinian control. The Palestinians would have a capital in Jerusalem based outside the current municipal boundary in Abu Dis. **********But Palestinian negotiators and Arab diplomats have said that in the Palestinian mind, Abu Dis is not part of Jerusalem and that therefore the proposal is not sufficient. ''Jerusalem for every Arab and every Muslim is the holy city -- it's not Abu Dis,'' one of the diplomats said. ''It's the walled city, and this is where you have to find a creative solution.'' **********Further, the diplomats said, it is highly unlikely that Mr. Arafat will sign an agreement that did not include a settlement on Jerusalem. **********In choosing Camp David as the site for the summit meeting, Mr. Clinton is investing about the highest prestige possible for the gathering. **********The first Camp David summit meeting, called in 1978 by President Carter between President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt and Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel, concluded a framework for a peace treaty between the two nations as well as a broader framework for peace in the Middle East. **********The idea for the setting originally came from Mr. Carter's wife, Rosalyn, who thought that the wooded retreat would provide an undisturbed atmosphere for the two leaders, who by July 1978 had been deadlocked for months in their negotiations. After 12 days that mixed high emotions with tedious detail work, the agreements were reached. **********Mr. Clinton reflected today on the difficult dynamics of summit meetings. ''The objective is often overshadowed, I might say, as all of you know, by the abject dreariness of the pursuit,'' he said. ''The ups and downs of the process, the daily hassles and disputes, the open-ended nature of the negotiations -- all of these over time have blurred the vision of what it is we are trying to achieve.'' **********-------------------- **********Sharansky Offers to Resign **********JERUSALEM, July 5 (By The New York Times) -- Interior Minister Natan Sharansky, who heads a Russian immigrant party, said at an immigrant rally here today that he would tender his resignation from the government at Sunday's Cabinet meeting, two days before the Camp David summit meeting is to begin. **********Mr. Sharansky has been uncomfortable with Prime Minister Barak's peace moves, and he made his announcement at a rally opposing territorial concessions to the Palestinians.

The combined company would be the largest seller of prescription drugs in the United States, with more than $9 billion in prescription sales, based on last year's results. **********The deal might result in the elimination of overlapping jobs among the combined companies' 106,000 employees worldwide. But Glaxo SmithKline's ambition to expand its American presence is expected to mean that few of its nearly 22,000 jobs in the United States would be at risk. In fact, the merged company would probably set up an operational headquarters in the United States, somewhere near New York City, executives said, although the specific location has not been chosen. **********Word of the deal, which the companies planned to announce here on Monday morning before the opening of the London Stock Exchange, comes amid rampant consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry. Mergers are being driven by the increasing pressure for companies to slash costs and bolster drug pipelines as profit margins continue to thin. Moreover, throughout the industry, patents for many of the leading prescription drugs have expired or will soon, intensifying competition among big research laboratories to find new drugs. **********Combined, Glaxo and SmithKline would control 7.3 percent of the pharmaceutical industry and hope to save $1.63 billion annually by the third year after the deal, the executives  said. The two companies would surpass the industry's current leader, Aventis, which is based in Frankfurt and had sales of $10.8 billion last year. **********Glaxo and SmithKline's plans were driven, in part, by Warner-Lambert's announcement on Thursday that it was in talks with Pfizer over a possible merger that would have made it the largest drugmaker in the world. If they do combine,  Pfizer and Warner-Lambert would  rank second in the world behind a combined Glaxo SmithKline and would be the only American pharmaceutical company in the industry's top five. **********''In this era of merger mania, you don't want to be the last company without a partner,'' said Sergio Traversa, a pharmaceutical analyst at Mehta Partners, a New York investment firm. Mr. Traversa said that Glaxo and SmithKline were a good fit because both were themselves formed by past mergers and because many of their London-based executives already know one another. Of all the drug companies, Mr. Traversa said, ''this is one of the combinations that makes the most sense.'' **********Executives said the Glaxo and SmithKline boards voted tonight to approve the deal. Although the companies are calling it a merger of equals, it is actually a stock swap in which SmithKline shareholders will get 0.46 share of Glaxo stock for each share they own, the executives said. Although Glaxo shareholders would control 58.75 percent of the company, each side would send the same number of directors to the board. **********This is the second time that Glaxo and SmithKline have tried to merge. Nearly two years ago, the drugmakers began merger discussions, but those talks collapsed because of a bitter clash between the companies' top executives over who would control the combined company. The deal can be consummated now, in part, because one of the executives involved the earlier stalemate, Jan Leschly, SmithKline's chief executive, is to retire in April. **********Executives close to the talks said that Sir Richard Sykes, chairman of Glaxo, would become chairman of the combined company, while Jean-Pierre Garnier, chief operating officer of SmithKline, would become chief executive and run the company day to day -- probably from the United States. **********Sir Richard, 57, is expected to retire in 2002, at which point Mr. Garnier, 52, would be expected to succeed him, the executives said. John Coombe, Glaxo's finance director, is to become finance director of the new company and Tadataka Yamada, SmithKline's chairman of research and development for pharmaceuticals would be be director of research and development. **********Glaxo now has its American headquarters in Research Triangle Park, N.C., while SmithKline's American base is in Philadelphia. Glaxo has 9,750 employees in the United States, most of them in North Carolina. SmithKline has about 12,000 employees in the United States, with about 9,000 in Pennsylvania. **********In recent years, SmithKline has managed much of its global operations from Philadelphia, near which both Mr. Leschly and Mr. Garnier live. **********Because both companies have been trying to increase their American presence, most of the job reductions are expected to be outside of the United States. The companies expect to continue most of their operations in North Carolina, Philadelphia and Pittsburg, where SmithKline has its American consumer products business, which makes Tums, Aquafresh and Contac cold medicine. **********Pharmaceutical analysts said today that if United States jobs were cut, they would most likely be in overlapping administrative or manufacturing operations, rather than positions in the companies' research laboratories or sales forces. **********On Friday, officials at Glaxo and SmithKline acknowledged that they were in talks, though neither company would disclose any specifics except to say that any deal would be a merger of equals. Spokesmen for Glaxo and SmithKline declined to comment on the impending deal this evening. **********Shares of both companies rose on Friday in hopes the combination would be consummated. SmithKline rose 56 pence, or 7 percent, to 847 pence. Shares of Glaxo rose 78 pence, or 4.5 percent, to 1,818 pence.

Bush and Al Gore of business magazines -- are at it again. **********The two publications, longtime competitors for circulation and advertising, are introducing campaigns aimed at generating additional dollars in both realms. The ads are as pointed as they are sophisticated, portraying the pursuit of success in business as a battle to be as fiercely fought as, say, an unresolved presidential election. **********The campaigns arrive as the business category of the American magazine industry completes what is likely to be a record year. On Jan. 1, Fortune, published by the Time Inc. unit of Time Warner Inc., plans to raise its rate base, the circulation guaranteed to advertisers, to 830,000 from 810,000. Forbes, published by Forbes Inc., plans to raise its rate base that same day, to 900,000 from 850,000. **********But uncertainty is beginning to cloud the outlook for 2001 with the dot-com shake-out threatening to dampen demand for ad space as well as subscriptions as laid-off readers no longer need to keep up with developments in a field in which they no longer work. **********''We're certainly mindful of the competitive world we operate in,'' said Jack Haire, president of the Fortune Group unit of Time Inc. in New York, which publishes Fortune, Fortune Small Business and eCompany Now magazines. **********''But the reason the competition's there,'' he added, ''is that it's a great time to be covering business.'' **********The competition for Fortune and Forbes now extends beyond their traditional rival, Business Week, which is in the early stages of a review for its account, with billings estimated at $10 million. Publications based abroad like The Economist are seeking American readers. And the new economy has spawned a spate of magazines specializing in coverage of technology, e-commerce and the Internet, the so-called Seven Dots: Business 2.0, eCompany Now, Fast Company, The Industry Standard, Red Herring, Upside and Wired. **********''There's a growing body of readers interested in the tech world and not the broader businesses,'' said David Bunnell, editor and publisher at Upside in San Francisco, part of Upside Media. **********Upside, too, is introducing a campaign, by a boutique agency in New York named Dirty Water. The print and outdoor ads, with a budget of more than $1 million, carry the theme ''Venture voyeurism.'' They are intended to show Upside's reporters and editors as being ''on the inside,'' Mr. Bunnell said, ''and not part of the hype.'' **********Hyped up and psyched up is an apt way to describe the personalities of Forbes and Fortune as displayed in their campaigns, which strive to present each magazine as an important tool for corporate warfare, as necessary as the newest cellular phone or personal digital assistant. Forbes's is by Merkley Newman Harty in New York, part of the Omnicom Group, and Fortune's is by Mullen Advertising in Wenham, Mass., part of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies. **********The Forbes campaign, with a budget of $3 million to $5 million, carries an assertive theme, ''Never settle.'' Print ads and a television spot celebrate the relentless pursuit of excellence, to paraphrase the old Lexus slogan, whether inside a cubicle or an executive suite. **********''There's a sense of a strong emotional connection with our readers,'' said James S. Berrien, president of Forbes, ''the movers and shakers who won't settle for anything less than a life well lived.'' **********For instance, one print ad begins ''You think your proposal is good,'' but ends by dismissing ''good'' as ''only a half a block from average'' while ''great is all the way uptown.'' **********The commercial strikes a similar chord, mocking ''good'' as ''great without'' intestinal fortitude, although the ad uses a vulgarism that has come to stand for such fortitude, especially among men. The commercial, vulgarism and all, has been running since last week on CNBC. **********''We're talking about what drives people,'' said Marty Orzio, partner and executive creative director at Merkley Newman, ''and that's something every reader of Forbes can relate to.'' **********The Fortune campaign, with a budget of $2 million for the fourth quarter, carries a similarly pugnacious theme, ''Business rules.'' Each print and outdoor ad uses photographs that have run in Fortune to illustrate a fanciful rule derived from its coverage of the economy, companies and well-known business personalities. **********''The magazine brings you inside the room,'' Mr. Haire said, ''with some energy, irony and fun.'' **********For example, a photo of Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, appears in one ad to demonstrate ''Rule No. 7,'' which is ''Pay attention to the man behind the curtain.'' Another ad, for ''Rule No. 5,'' which is ''Be your biggest fan,'' shows an ornate painting of Donald J. Trump. A third ad displays a photo of William H. Gates to explain ''Rule No. 1,'' which is ''Do unto others until they can do no more.'' **********The purpose of the campaign ''is to suggest in a telegraphic way that Fortune takes you close to the people who make the decisions,'' said Edward Boches, chief creative officer at Mullen. **********''If in fact business is about the people who run and rule the game,'' he added, ''why not associate ourselves with those people?'' **********In an added twist, the people pictured in the ads, who also include John F. Welch, chairman at General Electric, and Jeff Bezos, chief executive at Amazon.com, are not identified. **********''The campaign assumes Fortune readers know who they are,'' Mr. Boches said. ''And if you don't, you could, so shouldn't you?'' **********Sounds like a revised version of the old Buick slogan: ''Shouldn't you really rather read a Fortune?''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/31/business/technology-news-corp-delays-spinoff-of-part-of-sky-global-networks.html": {"writer_name": "Geraldine Fabrikant", "pub_date": "2000-10-31", "snippet": "News Corp, which planned to sell part of its Sky Global Networks to public in November, postpones sale because of market conditions; News Corp chairman, Rupert Murdoch, is interested in using Sky Global to acquire DirecTV, satellite business owned...", "word_count": 355, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "News Corp.

Focusing on one of the biggest problems for active traders -- completing Schedule D, the federal tax form for capital gains and losses -- the site helps track holdings and their associated tax implications. Investors enter their holdings on a secure site that is updated daily. One of the site's biggest selling points is that it keeps track of stock splits and other corporate actions, a niche service with which other sites have struggled. ''You can't do this with software,'' said Duncan Routh, co-founder of the site. ''You have to have a staff that's capable of analyzing each corporate action.'' *********** IExchange.com. On this site, amateur analysts can offer written research, available for purchase, on a variety of stocks. The better their  track record, the higher the price the analysts can charge, though most reports cost $3 or less.

''And it will have a lot more of my annoyingly Democratic politics in the middle.'' **********Ms. O'Donnell has made a point of emphasizing issues like breast cancer and foster care on her television show, which is syndicated by Warner Brothers, and in 1999 clashed publicly with the actor Tom Selleck over the issue of gun control, despite the fact that cozying up to celebrities is de rigeur behavior for the contemporary talk-show host. **********Ms. O'Donnell said that she would add a political slant to the magazine and run some ''controversial'' articles along with  such standard Seven Sisters fare as features about entertainment, parenting and ''the real stars and heroes'' of American life, civilians. **********While gun control is a far cry from the noodle recipes and miracle-multiple-birth stories of the Seven Sisters, publishers are looking for any way to revive the magazines. **********For more than a century in some cases, the magazines -- a group that includes titles like Ladies' Home Journal, Good Housekeeping, Family Circle, Redbook and Better Homes & Gardens -- have reigned over the women's market with their child-care tips and advertisements for china figurines. (McCall's and Family Circle were owned by The New York Times Company until Gruner & Jahr bought them in 1994.) **********The magazines attracted millions of readers, but now almost all have experienced dwindling circulation. **********Since 1994, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations, Ladies' Home Journal is down to 4.5 million from 5 million; Good Housekeeping to 4.6 million from 5.1 million and Woman's Day to 4 million from 4.6 million. **********Family Circle, which is also published by Gruner & Jahr, and Better Homes & Gardens, have remained flat, at 5 million and 7.6 million, respectively. **********Publishers have been scrambling to improve circulation. Redbook and Ladies' Home Journal run sex columns. Redbook, which is published by Hearst Magazines, has often used the word ''sex'' on the cover headlines that appear on newsstand copies. And O: The Oprah Magazine, with its modern mixture of empowered spirituality and self-help, has refocused the marketplace. **********Of the Seven Sisters, McCall's was among those suffering most visibly. Its reported circulation slid to 4.2 million this year from 4.8 million in 1992. **********Advertising has also slipped this year, according to the Publishers Information Bureau. For the year to date through October, the number of pages of advertising fell 10.8 percent and revenue fell 5.8 percent compared with the period last year. **********Two weeks ago, the editor in chief of McCall's, Sally Koslow, left the magazine to become corporate editor for new-business development at Gruner & Jahr. **********Ms. O'Donnell will work with the editor in chief of Family Circle, Susan Ungaro, to find an editor for Rosie's McCall's. Ms. O'Donnell's title will be editorial director. **********Describing the deal, which was reported in The New York Post yesterday, Ms. Ungaro and Ms. O'Donnell said that Ms. O'Donnell's production company, Kidro Productions, will share the cost of producing the publication. **********Ms. O'Donnell said that she was happy to keep the McCall's name and that because many women grew up reading the magazine, she could keep those readers and attract even more -- in part, because she can add the point of view of a mother, which Ms. Winfrey cannot. **********''I didn't have a desire to have a 'Rosie' magazine,'' she said, adding that such a personal title could reinforce a sometimes already uncomfortable, too-close personal relationship with viewers. **********She said that she would not, for example, ever write about her children and that she tries not to talk about them on her talk show. **********One advantage to simply pairing Ms. O'Donnell with the McCall's name is that the magazine already has a circulation of 4.2 million, giving Ms. O'Donnell a leg up on ''O,'' a partnership between Hearst Magazines and Harpo Productions that  has a circulation guaranteed to advertisers of 1.3 million but has sold as many as 3 million copies per issue."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/27/business/at-t-panasonic-deal.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "2000-09-27", "snippet": "AT&T, biggest US cable television company, orders one million digital set-top boxes from Panasonic so that it can offer more services (S)", "word_count": 92, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AT&T-Panasonic Deal", "print_headline": "AT&T-Panasonic Deal", "body_text": " **********AT&T, the biggest United States cable television company, has ordered one million digital set-top boxes from Panasonic, a unit of Matsushita Electric Industrial Company in Japan, so that it can offer more services.

The trading frenzy has even infected the staid mutual fund world: investors are holding funds for less than four years on average.

The supercharged Nasdaq is turning over its shares at more than three times the pace of any major industrialized market in the world. The trading in its shares amounted to more than twice its entire share base; the turnover was 88 percent in 1990. **********While the data do not address different industries, some of the Nasdaq stocks most popular with online investors trade furiously. The entire share base of Doubleclick, which specializes in Internet advertising, turned over 21 times last year. Investors traded shares equal to 16 times those available in CMGI, an incubator for Internet companies, and more than 13 times the shares of Amazon, the online retailer. In the 50 Nasdaq stocks with the heaviest trading, investors hold their shares for just three weeks, on average. **********Steve Galbraith, a senior research analyst at Sanford Bernstein in New York, compiled the statistics and sees trouble in the trading frenzy. ''It does look suspiciously like a game of musical chairs, and you do wonder when the music is going to stop,'' he said. ''Because three-week holding periods is not investing in my view, it is speculating.'' **********Unfortunately for investors, frantic trading can lead to much lower returns. ''It's not very tax efficient and not very cost efficient,'' said Antonio E. Bernardo, assistant professor of finance at the Anderson School at University of California in Los Angeles. **********According to academic studies, rapid turnover results in significantly lower returns, though the bull market of recent years has been so good that investors may not quite realize what they are missing. Brad Barber and Terrance Odean, associate and assistant professors of management at the University of California at Davis, analyzed data from 60,000 households that traded shares through a discount broker from 1991 through 1997. They found that the households trading most frequently earned an annualized net return of 11.4 percent, while those that traded infrequently earned 18.5 percent. **********And yet more and more investors are succumbing to the trading rush, giving up potential profits. ''What you end up with is a few people out there who hit the jackpot and a lot of people wondering why they didn't,'' Mr. Odean said. **********In addition to higher transaction costs and taxes (since relatively few stock trades occur in tax-deferred accounts), excessive trading poses a problem because of human foibles. Investors tend to sell their winners after a small profit and hold onto their losers. It is much easier, psychologically, for people to realize their gains than to take their losses in stocks they have picked. **********And, in an April 1999 study of 10,000 stock trading accounts belonging to individuals, Mr. Odean found that the stocks investors buy as replacements in their portfolios lag the securities they sell by enough to cover trading costs. On average, the replacement stocks did not rise as much as those that were sold. **********Besides reducing investors' gains, the effects of rapid-fire trading are widespread. The practice has enriched both the brokerage firms that execute investors' transactions and the federal government that collects the taxes. Ducking in and out of stocks produces short-term capital gains, which are taxed at ordinary income rates. Those rates are higher than those on long-term capital gains on investments held at least a year.  Mr. Galbraith estimates that investors' short-term gains in Nasdaq stocks alone amounted to more than $25 billion in taxes paid to the federal government last year. **********Excessive trading also contributes to wide swings in specific shares and the overall market. According to the Leuthold Group, an investment advisory firm in Minneapolis, moves of 2 percent or more from the previous day's close occurred in the Nasdaq market 25 percent of the time last year, or one out of every four trading days. Since 1971, moves of that size have occurred about 3 percent of the time. **********Much of this trading is a result of the long and steady rise in stock prices over the last 10 years. Attracted by increasing share prices and heady returns in the major indexes, more investors are trying their hand at trading for fun and profit. Indeed, trading volume rises as stock prices do. In 1987, for example, turnover on the New York Stock Exchange  reached 73 percent; the following year, after the crash, turnover plunged to 55 percent. **********Heavy turnover rates also characterized the early part of the 20th century. In 1901, the New York Stock Exchange turned its entire share base over more than three times. And in 1905, its stocks changed hands more than two times on average. **********''During this period, you had mergers, financial innovation, increased participation of the public, and all of these led to higher turnover in Wall Street,'' said Richard Sylla, professor of market history at the Stern School of Business at New York University. But as Mr. Sylla pointed out, the turnover was accompanied by a great deal of upheaval in the stock market. First was the so-called Rich Man's Panic of 1903 when the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 24 percent. Then there was the Panic of 1907, which took the index down 28 percent. **********Mr. Odean of the University of California at Davis said the volume of trading was so high because investors had become overconfident about their stock picks. ''A bull market leads to rising degrees of overconfidence among investors,'' he said. ''They attribute some of the returns to themselves, rather than to the overall rising market. And the temptation is to get a little bit overactive on trading.'' **********It is no coincidence that the sharp rise in stock trading has been accompanied by an explosion in information devoted to investing. Cable television, magazines, newspapers and online chat rooms foster a transaction mentality among investors. **********''The fact that people have more information than they had in the past gives them more reason to say I'm going to make a change now because I know what's happening,'' said Mr. Sylla of New York University. **********Still, he points out a potential problem. ''One of the pernicious aspects of it is when trading volume is rising, people think they can buy and sell easily.'' But when the market turns down and the trading cools? ''They find it a lot harder to get out.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/23/business/technology-peoplepc-finds-niche-in-corporate-sales.html": {"writer_name": "Laurie Flynn", "pub_date": "2000-10-23", "snippet": "PeoplePC, which offers personal computers along with Internet service for three-year commitment, has found niche in affiliate buying programs--sales to corporations, which in turn sell home computers to their workers at fraction of cost; takers so...", "word_count": 1269, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PeoplePC Finds Niche in Corporate Sales", "print_headline": "TECHNOLOGY; PeoplePC Finds Niche in Corporate Sales", "body_text": " **********It has been two years since a handful of ambitious start-ups began offering personal computers at no additional charge to customers willing to pay for several years of Internet service and, in most cases, to view a constant stream of online advertising. Only a few still exist. **********It is not surprising that Nick Grouf, chairman and chief executive of PeoplePC, resists comparison to those early trials. His company, founded in San Francisco a year and a half ago, may indeed offer personal computers along with Internet service for a three-year commitment. But from there, he insists, the similarities stop. **********For one thing, there is no forced advertising. And rather than sell its combination PC and Internet service solely to consumers, PeoplePC has found a niche in affiliate buying programs -- sales to corporations, which in turn sell the home computers to their workers at a fraction of the cost. So far, the takers include the Ford Motor Company, which is subsidizing a program that offers its 365,000 employees PeoplePC systems with Internet access and technical support. Delta Air Lines has undertaken a similar effort to get computers from PeoplePC into the hands of its 75,000 employees. **********More recently, PeoplePC signed an agreement to supply computers and Internet service to up to 300,000 workers at the National Trades Union of Singapore, a deal that could reach about 10 percent of Singapore's population. The New York Times Company has also signed a deal to offer  subsidized computers from PeoplePC to about 10,000 employees. **********PeoplePC says that the advantages of affiliate buying programs can be significant for corporations and employee groups, helping create a more technology-literate work force and improving workers' speed and efficiency by giving them access to company data. And then there is Mr. Grouf's personal goal of bridging the digital divide by putting PC's -- and, by extension, vital corporate information -- into the hands of more blue-collar workers. **********Mr. Grouf is no stranger to Internet start-ups, nor to the vagaries of the market. He ran Firefly, a so-called personalization software company that was spun out of M.I.T.'s renowned Media Lab and eventually acquired by Microsoft. Firefly's software performed ''collaborative filtering,'' meaning it helped recommend products to Web surfers based on other people's online preferences; Microsoft has incorporated Firefly's technology into its own online services. **********When Mr. Grouf came up with the idea for PeoplePC and went looking for cash two years ago, he had no trouble finding it, raising $65 million in venture capital from sources that included John Sculley, the former chief executive of Apple Computer who is now an investor; Access Partners, and Softbank Technology Ventures. As part of their deals with PeoplePC, Ford and Delta have also become investors. **********But competition is arriving quickly. As sales of personal computers slow, industry analysts expect affiliate programs to become an increasingly important channel for home computer sales, which typically have yielded low profit margins. **********Various computer makers are gearing up for the market, but so far the biggest threat for PeoplePC appears to come from Dell Computer and Gateway. In March, American Airlines said it would spend $15 million a year to offer Dell PC's and Internet connections to employees. Likewise, the energy company Enron chose Dell to supply similar systems to as many as 15,000 of its full-time employees for use at home. And in August, Gateway announced that it would provide PC's for up to 500,000 sales representatives for Avon. Toshiba has joined with AT&T in an affiliate buying program aimed at companies with fewer than 1,000 employees. **********PeoplePC had initially planned to go public in early August. But the evolving competition, combined with the weakening market for Internet stock offerings, forced the company to delay its plans by a week and scale back its ambitions. The company did raise $85 million in a stock offering in mid-August, but the shares opened at $10 and ended the first day's trading at $8.88. Since then, the shares have declined further, closing on Friday at $3.06. **********Much of the market's wariness stems from the fact that the company is still losing money on each of its PC's, which are are made by Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M. and Toshiba. **********As for Internet access, the company's other primary product, the company buys bulk access from other companies and resells it to PeoplePC users. **********The company does not project profits until 2003. In the six months ended June 30, the company reported revenues of $18.9 million and a net loss of $107 million. **********But analysts are optimistic about the company's announcement of its fiscal first-quarter results, planned for this week. Paul Marenbloom, a former senior analyst at Prudential Securities who recently joined CMGI, the Internet investment company,  circulated a Prudential report that called the PeoplePC's corporate deals ''large-scale, transnational opportunities.'' **********Over time, selling PC's and Internet access is not how PeoplePC expects to make its money. The company expects profits to rise as more customers take advantage of PeoplePC's ''buyer's club,'' an online shopping mall that is able to offer big discounts by pooling customers. The buyer's club is available only through the Internet service offered by PeoplePC. **********About 100 online merchants have signed up to sell their products at a discount through PeoplePC's site, including E*Trade, Priceline.com and AtYourOffice .com. PeoplePC's share of the take varies from deal to deal. **********If the buyer's club takes off, it could add substantially to PeoplePC's bottom line. In the meantime, the company will continue to subsidize the cost of its service and equipment in the name of building market share. **********In the case of Ford, for example, PeoplePC charges $24.95 a month per contract, the same amount it charges individuals. Ford, in turn, charges its employees $5 a month, swallowing the remaining $19.95. But once PeoplePC's revenue from Ford employees surpasses its expenses, PeoplePC and Ford will evenly split any profits from the buyer's club that are generated by Ford employees. A similar deal gives Delta 20 percent of revenues from purchases made by its workers. **********PeoplePC engages in such profit-sharing only with Ford and Delta, said Wayne Gattinella, chief marketing officer for PeoplePC said, because the deals help those companies subsidize their employees' PC's. **********PeoplePC's strategy has its risks, not the least of which is that PC sales overall are beginning to slow after years of phenomenal growth. In 1999, PC sales increased 23.8 percent, to 45 million computers, up from 36 million in 1998, according to the International Data Corporation. But for the current year, IDC is projecting a growth rate of only 12.2 percent in the United States PC market. **********But Mr. Grouf sees opportunity in the fact that 49 percent of American households still do not have personal computers. And he says that more than half of all new customers are opting for higher-performing, higher-margin machines than basic models, meaning more profits for the company. **********PeoplePC's line includes basic machines with Intel Celeron 500-megahertz chips for $24.95 a month; higher-performing desktop models, and notebook computers that cost up to $85 a month. In PeoplePC's corporate deals, an employee who upgrades typically pays the difference between the basic model and the more powerful one. **********''Right now, we're in the 50-percent range of households,'' he said of homes that have personal computers. ''We think we can get to 60 percent to 70 percent, even 80 percent penetration in the next several years.'' **********That of course, would be a lot more than the crop of free-PC vendors were able to achieve, even when they were giving away the computers. **********''I think they have a better shot at this market than anyone else we've seen,'' said Zia Daniell Wigder, a PC analyst at Jupiter Research in New York.

The price it charges others to use those lines is critical to opening the telecommunications market in Japan. At current rates, 40 percent of the revenue of competing carriers is consumed in fees to N.T.T., according to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, which regulates the market. **********The United States has threatened to take the matter to the World Trade Organization, a potential escalation in the dispute at a time when Japan's government is working to ensure a smooth summit meeting, which President Clinton will attend. **********Even politicians sympathetic to N.T.T., which has tremendous political influence because of its legions of employees and strong trade union, are trying to coax the former telephone monopoly to make concessions on the fees. **********The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading business daily, said the normally conservative Fair Trade Commission was about to publish a report saying that N.T.T.'s reorganization last year failed to enhance competition in the telecommunications market here and urging sharp cuts in access fees. **********But some worry that in exchange for such cuts N.T.T. may get even more power than it already has and further hamper competition here. Executives at competing carriers, Japanese businessmen and politicians believe that Mr. Nonaka and other senior politicians are promising N.T.T. that they will push for a sweeping revision of the restrictive law -- dating from the time the company was a monopoly -- that governs its activities. **********''There is a move afoot to drastically revise, or even abolish the N.T.T. Law,'' said Kei Hata, a member of the upper house of Parliament who is fast becoming one of the most vocal critics of the way N.T.T. is regulated by the government. ''I myself favor an abolishment of the law, but only after we have secured conditions for free and fair competition.'' **********Ms. Hata and many others say those conditions do not yet exist in Japan. Abolishing the N.T.T. law would open the door for NTT East and NTT West, the two regional fixed-line phone companies in the N.T.T. family, to provide long-distance and international service, and many worry that with the advantages of N.T.T.'s financial resources and existing technology, they would wipe out competitors that are only just beginning to secure a toehold in the market. **********''We need to think more about the implications of changing the law,'' Ms. Hata said. **********N.T.T.'s recent financial performance, which was far better than the company had projected, undercut its contention that it would be crippled by major reductions in access fees of the magnitude the United States is demanding. Nor did Junichiro Miyazu, N.T.T.'s president, further his company's cause by saying he could not explain the markedly better performance. His insistence that declining profitability at NTT East and NTT West was a trend also rang somewhat hollow, as both of them did surprisingly well. **********''The earnings of the regional carriers improved,'' Eita Yashiro, minister of posts and telecommunications, said at a news conference today. ''It's very different from the initial projections.'' **********In light of that, he said his agency would consider the reduction in interconnection fees it has proposed, as well as the proposed timetable for achieving those reductions.

LEWIS **********Stuart Goldenberg **********OME away with me to my desert island, sort of a cross between \"Survivor\" and \"Fantasy Island.\" The fantasy comes into play in that the island would already have a Power Macintosh G4 Cube computer with a 15-inch flat-panel Studio Display, a set of Harman Kardon SoundSticks speakers and a fast Internet connection. Add to that just one luxury item, \"Survivor\" style, and that would be a copy of Culture 4.0, an endlessly fascinating CD-ROM from Cultural Resources. **********Culture 4.0 ( www.culturalresources.com ) is an ambitious Western civilization study guide for the Internet age, for adults as well as for students. It works with Windows computers as well as with Macs. **********Although I have become quite intimate with both types of machines over time, I think I'm going to vote Windows off my island. I suppose some things would move me to choose Windows -- if, say, the alternative was eating rats. Both are acquired tastes. But the new Macintosh G4 Cube computer, like the Parthenon in Athens, is a thing of classic beauty. **********The Parthenon, as I was reminded by browsing through the Culture 4.0 software, is a superb architectural example of the golden rectangle, one that has the most aesthetically pleasing ratio of length to width -- the mama bear of rectangles, according to one of the many clever academics, historians and critics whose views are included in Culture 4.0. A golden rectangle can be divided into a square and a smaller rectangle that has the same proportions as the original rectangle, and the smaller rectangle can itself be subdivided into a square and still smaller rectangle with those proportions, and so on. **********Apple may have messed up the dimensions slightly, but the Cube is still the most aesthetically pleasing personal computer on the market, at least in the eye of this beholder. **********The Cube is a Power Macintosh G4 computer shrunk to an 8-inch silver square. The computer is suspended at the top of a crystal clear, rectangular case that takes up less than a square foot of desk space. It is an impressive technical achievement, and one that should please anyone who lives in a small apartment or works at a small desk. Because it has no internal fan, the Cube computer is silent, which is another bonus. **********There is a price to pay for such beauty. The basic Cube, with a 450-megahertz G4 microprocessor, costs $1,799, which is more than one would pay for a comparable Macintosh in the larger, tower configuration. It also lacks expansion slots, other than one for an Apple Airport wireless network card. **********Apple says the 450-MHz G4 chip delivers better performance than a Pentium III chip operating at twice the processor speed. Its marketing pitch for the Cube boasts, \"Honey, we shrunk the supercomputer.\" Intel and Advanced Micro Devices counter that Apple must have been out in the sun too long. **********But the Apple G4 chip can indeed hold its own with any Windows-based machine, even those with Pentium III chips, which now reach 1,000 megahertz or more. Megahertz is just one measure of a chip's performance, and it can be misleading, like trying to compare a Ferrari engine running at 4,000 revolutions per minute with a Honda engine at the same r.p.m. In this case, the G4 chip is the Ferarri. **********The Cube comes with 64 megabytes of system memory, a 20-gigabyte hard drive, a DVD-ROM drive that loads from the top the way a toaster does, a better-than-average graphics card, an Ethernet port, FireWire and U.S.B. ports, and a 56K modem. A pair of baseball-size Harman Kardon digital speakers, also in clear plastic, sound as good as they look. **********The Cube also comes with a greatly improved Apple Pro keyboard and an elliptical Apple Pro optical mouse, replacing the hated hockey-puck mechanical mouse and skeletal keyboard that Apple has been using since the introduction of the iMac. **********The old round mouse was a case study in the hazards of putting form over function. The new optical mouse blends form and function much more harmoniously, and it is more accurate and more reliable than the mechanical mouse it replaces. **********Owners of older Macintoshes will be able to buy the new U.S.B.-based Apple Pro keyboard and mouse from the Apple Store later this year for $60 each, but they will also have to upgrade to version 9.0.4 of the Macintosh operating system. **********On my fantasy island there is also a pirate's chest of gold, which would allow me to spend $2,299 for a souped-up Cube with a 500-megahertz G4 chip, 128 megabytes of RAM and a 30-gigabyte hard disk. The memory can be expanded to 256 megabytes for an extra $300, and the hard disk to 40 giabytes for an extra $100. **********The perfect complement for the Cube is Apple's elegant new 15-inch flat panel Studio Display LCD ($999), which matches the silver and crystal design scheme and takes up a fraction of the desk space of a conventional monitor. (It is a Mini-Me version of Apple's magnificent but magnificently priced 22-inch Cinema Display, which at $3,999 goes beyond the resources of even a pirate's chest.) The Cube will work with any V.G.A. monitor, but the 15-inch Studio Display L.C.D. (liquid crystal display) does not squander desk space as a comparable 17-inch tube display does. **********In part because it uses a truly digital interface, the Studio Display L.C.D. delivers a brighter and sharper image than any other flat-panel monitor I've seen. And the Studio Display L.C.D. plugs directly into the Cube without the need for a separate power cord, a feature that reduces clutter and enhances the monitor's already unmatched desk appeal. **********To complete the package, consider adding the beautiful Harman Kardon SoundSticks speaker package ($299), available only through Apple's online store ( www.apple.com ). The three-piece system consists of a beach-ball subwoofer and a pair of nine-inch desk speakers, all in clear plastic. Although the subwoofer is intended to be placed under the user's desk, it is a shame to put it there and hide its mesmerizing violet light. On the other hand, the subwoofer may remind some people of the severed head of Robby the Robot. **********Either on the desk or beneath it, the SoundSticks system delivers brilliant sound, especially when the user is watching DVD movies on the Studio Display. **********Together, the Cube, the Studio Display L.C.D. and the SoundSticks speakers create a stunning array of desk sculpture. It is a shame, then, that one has to junk it up with an ugly printer. There are no printers available in the crystal and silver color scheme, although the gray-and-black Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 970 comes closest. Apple has not indicated whether it will license its silver color scheme to peripherals makers, as it did when it introduced the blueberry-colored iMacs, but I hope it does. **********All these thoughts about beauty and art surfaced as I was using the Cube to browse Culture 4.0, which is subtitled The Contextual Guide and Internet Index to Western Civilization, Covering Various and Sundry Things Every High School Student Should Learn and Every College Student and Graduate Should Know. **********Culture 4.0 ($69, plus $5 shipping) draws heavily from the lectures of Dr. Walter W. Reinhold, a professor of music history and humanities who has twice been voted teacher of the year at New York University. Classroom teachers or self-teachers may want to order the 195-page printed workbook ($29, plus $5 shipping). **********The first Culture version appeared a decade ago in Apple's Hypercard format, which could be described as a prototype of the World Wide Web, only with training wheels. Culture 4.0 has now been rewritten in Web format so it requires the use of a browser like Internet Explorer or Navigator. **********Compared with fancier educational programs created by big software companies with multimillion-dollar production budgets, Culture 4.0's user interface and screen presentation are a bit threadbare, and it can be occasionally difficult to navigate. But the program is rich in ideas and content, which is where it really counts. **********The disk itself comes with more than 10,000 profiles of famous people, more than 1,700 pictures and illustrations, and more than 200 short, entertaining essays on political, literary, musical, artistic, philosophical and theological history, all woven together to put people, events and ideas into context. The program's scope is virtually unlimited because it has more than 25,000 links to related sources of information on the Web. And most of those links have links, creating an outward spiral of information as elegant as the Nautilus shell. **********\"Personalities, events, works of art and styles all play on and off each other, and the computer facilities the understanding of these interactions,\" Professor Reinhold notes in an introduction to the program. The computer makes learning an active process rather than a passive one. Culture 4.0 builds order out of what might otherwise seem to be the chaos of historical events and ideas, and that, after all, is what civilization is all about. **********Above all, Culture 4.0 reminds us that in our haste to make computer literacy a goal of our schools, we must not forget cultural literacy. And that is a beautiful thing. **********State of the Art is published on Thursdays.

Parliament, which is jousting with President Abdurrahman Wahid for control over the bank, has just gone into a holiday recess for several weeks, leaving in contention new legislation that is supposed to make the bank more transparent and accountable, analysts said Wednesday. **********This situation follows the return of Syahril Sabirin to the helm of the bank as its governor on Dec. 5 after nearly six months of house arrest on allegations of corruption, which he denies. Until his detention warrant expired, Mr. Sabirin had been held on suspicion of complicity in the 1999 Bank Bali affair, when dollars 80 million in official bank recapitalization money was diverted with central bank approval to senior members of Golkar, the governing party at the time, under President B.J. Habibie. **********\"I am very, very nervous,\" said Sri Mulyani Indrawati, a former adviser to Mr. Wahid and now director of the Institute for Economic and Social Research at the University of Indonesia. \"Stability in central banks is something investors like to see.\" **********With the uncertainty, the currency, the rupiah, has been slipping in value in recent days. On Wednesday in New York, it traded at 9,250 to the dollar, or about 25 percent below its level in January. Some traders say they expect the dollar to rise above 10,000 rupiah in the next few weeks, a rate not seen since the height of the Asian financial crisis that fueled the downfall of Suharto as president in 1998. **********The weak currency helped push the inflation rate to just above 9 percent in November. In response, the central bank has raised interest rates, choking off loans needed for economic expansion and complicating the task of reviving the debt-laden banking system. **********\"Whether the allegations against Mr. Sabirin are true or not, the current situation is clearly destabilizing,\" said Desmond Supple, head of Asian economic research at Barclays Capital. \"The timing could not be worse.\" **********Adding to the confusion and loss of confidence, five of the seven members of the central bank's board of governors resigned late last month, before Mr. Sabirin's return, to take responsibility for a report by the Supreme Audit Agency. It found that during the financial crisis nearly dollars 9 billion in emergency loans to commercial banks, many controlled by associates of Mr. Suharto, had been misspent. **********The five board members quit even though most of them were not with the central bank when it approved the loans, which were intended to prevent troubled banks from collapsing. The agency estimated that as much as 95 percent of the more than dollars 17 billion in total credits to Indonesian banks might never be repaid. **********Compounding the country's woes, the International Monetary Fund said this week that it would delay its next loan to Jakarta, about dollars 400 million, from this month until February or March. **********Most analysts attributed the delay to the Fund's dissatisfaction at the pace of economic reform; especially moves to sell state assets to raise revenue to reduce the budget deficit, recover billions of dollars in unpaid corporate debt, and prepare for the start next month of a far-reaching program to decentralize political and economic power in Indonesia. **********But the finance minister, Prijadi Praptosuhardjo, indicated on Tuesday that the delay in the IMF loan disbursement was also linked to the controversy over the central bank. Mr. Prijadi said a credible central bank law was crucial to maintain investor and market confidence. He added that the IMF wanted to see the new legislation governing appointments to the bank and its status before lending Indonesia any more money. **********Despite increasing separatist violence in parts of Indonesia, turmoil among political factions and Mr. Wahid's erratic leadership, the economy \u2014 which was virtually stagnant in 1999 after shrinking 13 percent in 1998 \u2014 grew at an annual rate of 5.1 percent in the third quarter, according to official figures. **********An export boom that resulted in a trade surplus of dollars 30 billion in the year to October helped to increase growth and enabled the central bank to raise its foreign exchange holdings to dollars 29 billion **********High oil prices for much of this year also helped the economy perform better than expected, analysts said. Indonesia is Asia's largest exporter of oil and natural gas. **********But economists are forecasting a more difficult outlook in 2001, with an expected slide in oil prices, slowing global growth and increasing reluctance of international investors to bet on resource-rich, low-cost but unstable countries like Indonesia. **********\"Against such an adverse backdrop,\" Mr. Supple said, \"monetary policy needs to be a tool for stabilizing sentiment and the rupiah, rather than being a source of fresh instability.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/17/business/the-markets-key-rates.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-06-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 118, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "THE MARKETS; Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/04/technology/dell-warns-its-third-quarter-sales-hurt-by-europe.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-10-04", "snippet": "NEW YORK - Dell Computer Corp. , the world's No. 2 personal computer maker, said Wednesday its third quarter sales were coming in about 3 percent below what it expected due to weak demand in Europe.", "word_count": 273, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dell Warns Its Third Quarter Sales Hurt by Europe", "print_headline": "Dell Warns Its Third Quarter Sales Hurt by Europe", "body_text": " **********NEW YORK - Dell Computer Corp. , the world's No. 2 personal computer maker, said Wednesday its third quarter sales were coming in about 3 percent below what it expected due to weak demand in Europe. **********\"There has been some macro-psychology at play with the weak euro,\" said Chairman and Chief Executive Michael Dell, speaking to analysts at a meeting in Round Rock, Texas. \"People (in Europe) have been significantly less inclined to make expenditures in terms of technology.\" **********Dell was only the latest tech victim of weak demand in Europe.

Simply walk up to a Coca-Cola vending machine and point your mobile telephone at it. **********Punch a few buttons on your phone and bang, a cold bottle clatters down the chute and 20 Czech Koruny, about 50 cents, is charged on your mobile phone bill. **********As consumer spending in the former Communist bloc has risen, so has the use of mobile phones: in some countries as many as one in four households now owns one. But the creaky banking system inherited from Communism has left Central and Eastern Europe mostly cash economies. Credit cards and checks are seldom used, and both merchants and consumers are deeply fearful of losing their life savings to credit-card fraud. **********Now, with the advent of sophisticated wireless technologies, improved data security and increasingly versatile handsets, Eastern Europe -- and the Czech Republic, in particular -- are at the forefront of a movement to put e-commerce in the hands of consumers. The result is m-commerce, for mobile. Moving far beyond the quick Coke, companies like Nokia and Citigroup want to turn mobile phones into virtual credit cards. **********''People perceive mobiles as trusted personal devices,'' said Jari Paakkarinen, of Nokia Telecommunications, the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer, which is using the highly competitive Czech mobile phone market to test new technology. ''You eat with it, you rest with it. It's an extension of your personality, so it's a very short step to trust it to pay with it.'' **********M-commerce is likely to take off much more rapidly in Europe, especially the Czech Republic, than in the United States. Although some former Communist countries lack readily available wired telephones, most of Europe has mobile networks that are  several generations more advanced and more secure than the older United States systems. And most European systems function across entire countries, not just several cities or states. **********In the United States, the widespread use of checks and credit cards reduces the need for a new payment system. And Americans would be more likely than Europeans to see the spread of m-commerce as a threat to their privacy. **********But Central Europe lacks the sophisticated database of consumer credit that card issuers require. Akshaya Bhargava, general manager of Citibank's Czech operations, says that the bank is instead arranging, by this fall, for retailers to accept payment by mobile telephone for goods sold on their Web sites. **********The Czech Republic's 10.5 million people already own more than 2 million mobile phones and pay their bills religiously. But credit cards have hardly made a dent, with few Czech adults holding them. **********Nor do Czechs use checks. Instead, most use A.T.M. cards to withdraw money, then pay their bills and make their purchases in cash. Czechs commonly pay for kitchen furniture, airline tickets and even new cars with wads of bills. **********But merchants complain that cash transactions encourage theft and that customers often forgo purchases because they simply do not have enough cash in hand. **********The prophets of m-commerce, here and around the world, therefore, see a double boon: The phone will replace or pre-empt the credit card, giving merchants authorization to immediately debit a shopper's bank account or add the charges to a phone bill. It can also become the prime means of gaining access to the Internet, allowing consumers to browse stripped-down Web sites especially tailored to small mobile phone displays. Only about 7 percent of Czechs have regular access to the Internet at home or work. **********The m-commerce revolution depends on a series of technologies meant to bring information from the Web to screens not much larger than a watch face. The current technology, called Wireless Application Protocol, is seen as only the first step toward high-speed data transmission for mobile phones that will receive a constant flow of news bulletins, stock prices or suggestions for nearby restaurants, as determined by the nearest transmitter. **********With an average monthly income of around $341, not many Czechs are likely to charge a new Lexus on their mobile phone. But Jack Schrantz, founder of Albumcity.cz, an Internet record shop, says he expects compact discs to sell well. ''It matches the demographics here -- it's the young and tech-savvy who buy CD's,'' Mr. Schrantz said. **********Several European airlines and banks are already making plans to extend m-commerce. Finnair and Lufthansa allow passengers to check for delays and change their reservations with Web-enabled telephones.  Over the next two to three years, Lufthansa plans to offer everything from ticket purchases to check-in. **********Banks in several European nations also are allowing customers to use telephones and the Internet to make transfers, check account balances and spend cash downloaded into an ''electronic wallet.'' Others see the technology going even further. At Globopolis (www.globopolis.com), a collection of regularly updated city guides to major European cities, mobile phone surfers some time this year will be able to not only find a restaurant, cinema or nightclub, but to make a reservation and pay for tickets, and in some cases, even meal bills. **********As with many an Internet business, however, it remains unclear how m-businesses will generate revenue and profits. Banner advertisements simply cannot fit on phones. **********For now, the airtime that callers burn up while browsing is the main source of revenue for mobile phone operators. But competition and further generations of technology could replace charges by the minute with flat monthly rates, leaving the operators looking for a new model. **********PROFITS from m-transactions are often small: hi-technology Coke machines will not make anybody rich. ''The question with micropayments is how you split commissions: There's not much there,'' said Robert Chvatal, the marketing director of Radio Mobil, whose Paegas mobile telephone service, provided in a partnership with Deutsche Telekom, is the second-largest in the Czech Republic with nearly one million subscribers. **********Both Paegas and its larger rival, EuroTel, whose partners are Bell Atlantic and Media One International, say they may eventually make their money much as Visa and American Express do, by charging merchants a percentage on every transaction. **********EuroTel and Paegas count on Web traffic to be dominated by the mobile telephone, not the personal computer, or even palmtops. ''Many of these customers simply cannot or will not invest in a home PC, so the ability to get to the content and applications of the Internet via the mobile is very attractive,'' said Mike Burns, EuroTel's marketing director. ''What's in it for us is to be essentially the primary provider of Internet services in this country.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/01/world/israel-seeks-to-uncover-fate-of-11-jews-lost-fleeing-iran.html": {"writer_name": "Deborah Sontag", "pub_date": "2000-10-01", "snippet": "Israeli officials push for international campaign on behalf of 11 Iranian Jews who disappeared while emigrating; 11 missing men have come to attention of human rights and American Jewish groups only in last month; until then, Iranian Jews, who pre...", "word_count": 1293, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Israel Seeks to Uncover Fate Of 11 Jews Lost Fleeing Iran", "print_headline": "Israel Seeks to Uncover Fate Of 11 Jews Lost Fleeing Iran", "body_text": " **********In her immaculate apartment here, Farahnaz Rabizade, an Iranian immigrant, was tempted to set an extra place at the Rosh Hashana table for her missing husband. But she did not let herself be that maudlin, she said, because she did not want to upset her children, who have been waiting four years for their father to show up in Israel for the Jewish New Year. **********Mrs. Rabizade's husband is one of 11 Iranian Jews who disappeared while emigrating. The men set off from Iran at different times -- three groups in 1994 and Mr. Rabizade's group in 1997. Lacking travel documents, they all chose to leave illegally, presumably by hiring smugglers to help them across the perilous Iranian border, where many travelers disappear in kidnappings. None of the Jews have been heard from since. **********''My father sacrificed himself for us,'' Dahlia Rabizade wrote in a 10th-grade essay at her new Israeli school. ''He was like a candle that lights the way while he himself is the wax that melts.'' **********The 11 missing men came to the attention of human rights and American Jewish groups only in the last month. Until then, Iranian Jews, who prefer to handle sensitive issues with the Iranian government very quietly, had used back channels to search for the men. **********Recently, Israeli officials, frustrated by the lack of response, decided to push for an international campaign on behalf of the 11 men. Given Iranian governmental hostility toward Israel, some Jewish groups and experts on Iran did not think that this was wise. **********One expert here said that he was personally told by a Jewish member of the Iranian Parliament that the government was working hard to locate the men. **********''I think they might get some good results,'' the expert said, ''and maybe the Israeli authorities should be a little more patient.'' **********But the Israeli officials believe that, on the heels of the recent convictions of 10 Iranian Jews on espionage charges, which the American government and others condemned as unjust, the time was ripe to develop international sympathy for the men. Iran might be more receptive than imagined, the officials added, having become more sensitive about its image and eager to portray itself as tolerant of minorities. **********''The original assumption was that it would be easier for the Iranians to respond positively when they were approached discreetly,'' said Sallai Meridor, chairman of the Jewish Agency. ''But this assumption has not been proven correct. And we don't think the families should have to wait any longer. It's time for answers.'' **********Whether the men were arrested and imprisoned by the authorities or fell prey to the violence of the no man's land that exists in Iran's border zones is unclear. The frontier with Pakistan, in particular, is treacherous territory for a stranger, with tourists and others -- including many Bahais from Iran -- disappearing in kidnappings. **********But Israeli officials and Iranian Jewish leaders outside Israel say  they have reason to believe that at least some of the men are alive and in prison; there have been recent reports of sightings by other prisoners, they said. **********If they were behind bars, the men would be in the company of thousands of Muslims and other Iranians who have also been apprehended while fleeing the country. A senior Clinton administration official told an American Jewish leader that the case of the 11 men should be treated as part of a broader human rights problem. **********Emigration from Iran is restricted in general and, an Amnesty International official noted, record numbers of Iranians are seeking political asylum elsewhere, even in this time of peace and relative openness in Iran. **********But world Jewish leaders say the issue of emigration is particularly resonant for Jews because of a history of flights from peril. **********''The idea of Jews in this day and age seeking safety and being intercepted is a horror story and even worse,'' said a senior official at an American Jewish organization, who  requested anonymity because he has not decided that going public with the case is a good idea. **********Mrs. Rabizade, 37, has taken a Hebrew first name, Urit, a job as a nanny, and an apartment in this immigrant-filled town near Tel Aviv. Her children have assimilated very rapidly. But the whole idea of coming to Israel was her husband's dream, not hers. So, she said, she cannot help but feel displaced in her new life, especially when her old one, in the southern Iranian city of Shiraz, was quite nice. **********Her husband owned a clothing shop, and she was a sales clerk, she said. Their Jewish life was open and free, she said, with plenty of kosher food available and a lovely old synagogue in walking distance from their home. **********Jews are a protected minority in Iran; although they do suffer official discrimination, the case of the 13 convicted of spying for Israel on what many believe were trumped-up charges was an anomaly in their history. **********Still, Mrs. Rabizade's husband, who is 18 years older than she is, set his sights on a life in Israel after several trips here, and she, too, believed it was ''our land.'' **********Generally, the Iranian government did not permit all members of a Jewish family to travel abroad at once. But in late 1996 the Rabizades decided to try. **********After their farewell parties, they packed a few suitcases and, with four children ranging in age from 7 to 15, presented themselves to the immigration authorities at the airport. Mr. Rabizade's passport was seized. **********Her husband told her to ''go, go,'' that he would follow the family as soon he could arrange it, she said. Mrs. Rabizade said that she felt, psychologically, that she could not turn around; she had already left Iran. To this day, she said, she regrets what she now calls that wrong-headed feeling. **********Within days, Mrs. Rabizade and her children, having presented themselves to Israeli consular officials in Turkey, had landed in an immigrant absorption center in Mevasseret Zion, outside Jerusalem. Several months later, her husband told her by telephone that he had arranged passage through the Iranian-Pakistani border town of Zahedan, a difficult and dangerous route that traverses desert and drug-trafficking terrain. **********He would leave on Feb. 15, 1997; later she learned that he left with two other Iranian Jews, brothers, Syrous and Ibrahim Ghahremani. **********After two weeks, when she had not heard from her husband, Mrs. Rabizade said, she was certain that something had befallen him. ''Maybe the police caught him,'' she said, ''but until this day, they haven't said word one about him.'' **********Alone with her children in a new country, she did not know where to turn. Eventually, she went to an Iranian community group, and, she said, ''they made a tremendous effort,'' but she acknowledges that she does not really know what they did. **********The wife of one of the brothers who traveled with her husband did not handle the disappearance as well as she did, said Azriel Nevo, a retired general who is serving as the Jewish Agency's point man on the case of the missing 11 men. **********That woman remains in the immigrant absorption center four years later, not ready to take the step into Israel itself without her husband. **********In contrast, Mrs. Rabizade, presiding over an elegant display of pastries and soda pop, looks very composed. But she said she was sleepwalking through her days, ''limbo days,'' as she called them. **********At night, she dreams of her husband and does not feel as lonely, she said. In the dreams, he is behind bars, and she is pleading with the guards to release him, telling them that she needs him and that he does not deserve a heavy punishment ''for being an innocent, just a Jew who wanted to come to Israel.'' **********''That's why I say to myself that he's alive,'' she said. ''Because I dream so much about him.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/01/business/chicago-law-firm-makes-new-york-deal.html": {"writer_name": "Kruti Trivedi", "pub_date": "2000-08-01", "snippet": "Winston & Strawn, Chicago law firm, will merge with New York office of Whitman Breed Abbott & Morgan; new firm, which will use Winston & Strawn name, will be run by existing Winston management; Sonnenschein, Nath & Rosenthal of Chicago adds New Yo...", "word_count": 275, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Chicago Law Firm Makes New York Deal", "print_headline": "Chicago Law Firm Makes New York Deal", "body_text": " **********Winston & Strawn, the large law firm in Chicago, said yesterday that it would merge with the New York office of Whitman Breed Abbott & Morgan next month as they join the race to become one of the world's 20 largest law firms. **********The new firm, which will use the Winston & Strawn name, will have about 840 lawyers in six offices worldwide and will be run by existing Winston management.

He smiled at the phrase as he coined it, but never elaborated on how it would mesh with his interventionist inclinations. **********George W. Bush, in contrast, argues that an overextended American military should gradually pull out of the Balkans -- a step that the Europeans view as abandonment. He insists on charging ahead with a national missile defense system -- which Russia and China have vowed to defeat by building up new nuclear forces to overwhelm defensive interceptors. **********Yet Mr. Bush, asked in the second presidential debate to describe his philosophy for projecting American power, sounded startlingly like Mr. Gore. ''If we are an arrogant nation, they will resent us,'' he said. ''If we're a humble nation, but strong, they'll welcome us.'' **********At a moment of unchallenged American primacy, it is understandable that both candidates want to convince the rest of the world that they would step lightly. Beneath their words, however, lie very different priorities, and probably very different styles, in managing America's relations with both allies and enemies. **********In his debate performances, interviews and speeches on foreign and economic policy, the vice president has repeatedly portrayed himself as a man who has come to believe in vigorous American intervention abroad, a reversal of Democratic philosophy for most of the time since the end of the war in Vietnam. **********He describes how the experience of seeing the Clinton administration move too slowly to end the killing in Bosnia drove him to conclude that America must be prepared to prevent disaster, and how two successive global financial crises reshaped his understanding of the central role economic stability must play in the foreign policy agenda. **********Mr. Bush has woven a middle ground between two battling factions of his party -- internationalists who support engagement with great powers like China and isolationists who are deeply suspicious of the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization. **********Drawing on the advice of Gen. Colin L. Powell, widely viewed as a potential secretary of state in a Bush administration, Mr. Bush is far more tentative about committing American troops and rules out their use for what he dismisses as nation building. ''There may be some moments when we use our troops as peacekeepers, but not often,'' he said in the final presidential debate. In the second debate he suggested a broader philosophical disagreement with Mr. Gore: ''I'm not so sure the role of the United States is to go around the world and say, 'This is the way it's got to be.' '' **********Any comparison of foreign policy between the two candidates is inherently unbalanced: Mr. Gore has a long record, in the Senate and as vice president, while during Mr. Bush's time as governor, his only real foreign focus has been Mexico, whose long border with Texas is a major matter of state and local politics. **********Mr. Gore is always eager to mention his extensive dealings with foreign leaders and to analyze international events; he granted an hour-long interview for this article. **********Mr. Bush took four weeks to consider repeated invitations to be interviewed on his foreign policy views. In the end he declined. **********Seeing the World From Texas **********The Texas governor has traveled frequently to Mexico, and says that as president he would focus on Latin America far more intensively than the Clinton Administration. But beyond those trips Mr. Bush, now 54, has left America's shores only three times in his adult life. He spent five or six weeks in China in 1975, on a break from graduate school when his father was American envoy to Beijing. When his father was president, he led an American delegation to the Gambia for a celebration of the country's independence. **********In 1998, when he was considering a run for the presidency, he visited his daughter in Italy and then joined other governors on a tour of the Middle East. He stopped in Egypt and met President Hosni Mubarak, then went on to Israel, where he met the current prime minister, Ehud Barak and toured the West Bank with Ariel Sharon, a hard-liner now in negotiations about creating an emergency government with Mr. Barak. **********The Bush campaign also provided a list of 150 foreign officials Mr. Bush has met with in Texas and elsewhere, mostly diplomats and trade officials, but also representatives of Russian energy firms. He saw the foreign minister of Russia, Igor Ivanov, this year. **********Mr. Bush's aides say these meetings have left him at least as well prepared for the presidency as three past governors: Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter. Nonetheless, Mr. Bush makes foreign policy by committee, and prefers to have his coterie of advisers answer all the questions. **********Mr. Gore's eagerness to place America's imprint on the world has clearly grown in his seven years in the vice presidency, which have featured dozens of trips abroad and many meetings with world leaders. White House advisers recall him making an impassioned plea to President Clinton in the summer of 1995 to threaten bombing Serbian forces after they overran a United Nations safe area in Bosnia, a moment that one aide said was now ''seared on the front of Al Gore's brain.'' The former United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, recalls bringing Mr. Gore to meetings about how to confront Japan on opening its economy ''so that I would sound like only the second-most vociferous guy in the room.'' **********What Mr. Bush derides as nation building, Mr. Gore calls a natural evolution, decades later, of the Marshall Plan -- when American willpower and capital, and some American troops, helped rebuild Europe. **********That difference was accentuated this month when Mr. Bush's chief foreign policy adviser, Condoleezza Rice, said the Republican contender would, if elected, gradually pull the remaining American troops out of the Balkans, after consulting with NATO allies. That prompted Mr. Gore and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright to shoot back that Mr. Bush would squander a nascent American victory in rebuilding the former Yugoslavia, where there are now some 11,400 troops, less than 20 percent of the total peacekeeping presence in Bosnia and Kosovo. **********Lurking just beneath the surface of that dispute are questions that both candidates have left unanswered. Mr. Bush has never defined what kind of mission is in the ''vital national interest.'' Mr. Gore has never said how long he would keep troops in place to build a democratic state. Mr. Bush, in short, won't say when he'll wade into a crisis, and Mr. Gore won't say when he'll get out. **********These positions reflect, in many ways, the advisers who surround the two men. Mr. Gore depends heavily on Leon Fuerth, his national security aide for two decades, who urged him to break with the Democrats and vote for going to war with Iraq in 1991. Richard Holbrooke, the United Nations ambassador, supported Mr. Gore's ill-fated run for the presidency in 1988, a political risk one aide says ''the vice president has not forgotten.'' He is often mentioned as candidate for secretary of state. And Mr. Gore has grown closer to Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, the architect of the Clinton administration's biggest financial interventions, from the Mexican bailout to the Asian crisis. **********Mr. Bush relies heavily on Ms. Rice and a large cast of other graduates of his father's administration. Their influence is evident: Long before Mr. Bush ever criticized the International Monetary Fund, another close adviser, former Secretary of State George P. Shultz, said it should be shut down. **********Both candidates insist that they would never seek to throw America's weight around. When it serves their purposes, though, each is quick to jettison his commitment to American humility. **********Mr. Bush has made it clear that he will go ahead with a missile defense shield no matter what America's allies think -- and despite the harm it might inflict on America's fundamental relationships with Russia and China. Mr. Gore has repeatedly expressed a desire to incorporate environmental and labor rules in every future trade accord -- even though poorer nations view that as an unvarnished effort to assure that developing nations remain less competitive with American manufacturers. **********Gore and Globalization **********Not surprisingly, Mr. Gore tries to portray himself as the candidate best prepared to delve into the newest and most complex territory of foreign affairs, the challenges of economic globalization. The vice president's aides whisper that Mr. Bush's advisers are lost in the thicket of 1980's era problems, and are unprepared for a world in which global capital flows can cause as much havoc as global arms sales. **********In a speech last spring in Boston, Mr. Gore charged that his rival was ''stuck in a cold war mindset,'' that ''continues to view Russia and China primarily as present or future enemies.'' At one point he said that ''Governor Bush's foreign policy is noticeably blank.'' **********Mr. Gore has never repeated that charge, but his aides do what they can to sow doubts about Mr. Bush's competence as a potential world leader and a recent New York Times poll indicated that roughly half of American voters have their doubts on that score. **********Mr. Bush's campaign officials say that in the second presidential debate their candidate established himself as respectably conversant in the major international issues of the day. Mr. Bush himself was comfortable enough to joke shortly afterward about his trouble wrapping his tongue around the names of world leaders. ''I was especially pleased that Mr. Milosevic has stepped down,'' he said after the Yugoslav leader bowed to a street revolt. ''It's one less polysyllabic name for me to remember.'' **********Mr. Gore, in his interview, showed that he indeed has absorbed seven years of daily intelligence briefings -- and that he can name names with ease. He spoke with authority about the differences between the separatist movements in two parts of Indonesia, and discussed what kind of opposition movements in Iraq the United States could exploit to help unseat Saddam Hussein. **********But Mr. Gore frequently passes up opportunities to describe a sweeping vision of how he would position the United States in the world. Mr. Clinton, by contrast, has mastered that patter, rarely missing a chance to draw the link between economic integration and the spread of capitalism and democracy. **********Managing the Nuclear Rivals **********China and Russia are huge powers in the midst of huge transitions, whose weaknesses and strengths pose some of Washington's biggest challenges. In either nation, an economic collapse or a military buildup could cause tremendous instability, not only in Asia and Europe, but around the world. **********Yet those challenges have hardly been discussed in the final months of the campaign, for different reasons on each side. **********Mr. Gore knows Asia well. He talks about his priorities there more crisply than many of his foreign policy advisers do. (Sometimes, in fact, he is too crisp: When he backed anti-government protesters in Malaysia two years ago, using their rallying cry of ''reformasi,'' in a speech, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad deftly used the moment to whip up a nationalist backlash against America that squashed the reform movement.) **********But as one of his informal advisers says, ''all the imagery is bad for him'' in Asia. Raising broad visions of how to deal with China, for example, invites the Bush campaign to play up the photos of Mr. Gore bowing at the Buddhist temple in California that became the subject of lengthy campaign finance investigation. (The temple was linked to Taiwan, not China, but such subtleties are lost in campaigns.) **********So Mr. Gore's campaign has indicated that he would continue in the Clinton mode of using economic ties to encourage China to greater openness, democracy and capitalism. But as China's leaders have stepped up the arrest of political and religious dissidents in the last year, Mr. Bush has homed in on the Clinton administration's oratory about a ''strategic relationship'' with Beijing. (Mr. Gore does not use that term.) **********''China is a competitor, not a strategic partner,'' Mr. Bush often says. And he has indicated that he would sharply depart from the Clinton script in two ways: by pursuing the national missile defense, which China vigorously opposes and would counter with more and better intercontinental missiles, and perhaps by announcing a break with longstanding policy and pledging that the United States would come to Taiwan's aid if it was attacked by China. **********Previous presidents have left that commitment vague, and critics warn that an explicit security guarantee would antagonize China while increasing the risk that Taiwan would take steps toward independence. Such moves, in turn, could increase chances of a conflict with the mainland. **********There has been more talk about Russia, where Mr. Gore played a leading role, though a commission he co-chaired with former Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin. Mr. Gore knew from the outset that an active role in guiding Russia toward a new role in the world would distinguish him from any potential rival for the presidency. And the effort had some early successes, including an agreement to return to Russia the nuclear weapons that had been stationed in Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan. But American hopes of guiding economic reforms went off-track, and recent disclosures indicate that Mr. Gore failed to get Russia to halt arms sales to Iran by this year. **********Mr. Bush argues that the administration was naive, ''focusing our aid and attention on a corrupt and favored elite'' that sometimes failed to fulfill promises made to Mr. Gore. ''When Bill Clinton compared Boris Yeltsin in Chechnya to Abraham Lincoln, what signal did that send to states around Russia's periphery?'' asks Ms. Rice, a Russia expert. ''When the Russians didn't follow the favorable and attractive script we wrote for them, we continued to pretend they were carrying out their part of the bargain. They lost respect for us as a result.'' **********(While Mr. Clinton in 1996 did make a glancing comparison of the Chechnya rebellion to the Civil War, he also said then that ''a free country has to have a free association'' and Russia would have to find ''a diplomatic solution.'') **********Mr. Bush has offered only generalities about how he would handle Russia differently, and has never said how he would persuade Moscow to accept the missile defense system that could require quitting the Antiballistic Missile Treaty. (Ms. Rice says that Mr. Bush would review ''the size of the American arsenal,'' and perhaps reduce it). **********On the Middle East, Mr. Bush has gone to some lengths not to criticize Mr. Clinton's handling of a volatile and deteriorating situation -- at least not directly. And Mr. Gore has been almost completely uninvolved in managing the failed Camp David talks and diplomacy that followed -- until he flew back to Washington 10 days ago to sit in on the meetings planning Mr. Clinton's summit meeting with Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and Mr. Barak. **********Indirectly, though, Mr. Bush has thrown a few jabs. ''You can't put the Middle East peace process on our timetable,'' he said in a not-so-subtle suggestion that Mr. Clinton rushed into Camp David in hopes of a comprehensive agreement before he left office. **********Both candidates are quick to tick off their criteria for sending America's troops to intervene. But ask them for their criteria for using taxpayer dollars to choke off a market crash or a global financial crisis -- the kind that struck Mexico in 1995, and Asia two years later, then spread around the world -- and specificity vanishes. **********Mr. Bush stumbled when asked in the first debate how he would handle a stock market crisis -- and then announced that he would summon his top advisers. **********Mr. Gore pointed to Robert E. Rubin, the former treasury secretary, in the audience, a man regarded in Washington and on Wall Street as a cool manager of such crises. He seemed to suggest that he would call his old friend -- now a top executive at Citigroup -- and then he changed the subject. ''He clearly wasn't prepared for that one,'' one of his close economic advisers said. **********In his interview, Mr. Gore was similarly vague about his standards for economic intervention. ''I'm not sure there is a handy cookie cutter on that one,'' he said. ''I think there are so many variables that you have to know it when you see it.'' **********He referred an interviewer to Mr. Summers, who said that he would recommend using America's financial might to right another country if ''there was a material impact on the U.S. economy or the global economy,'' provided the loans came with conditions to assure reform in the country getting assistance, ''a credible assurance we will be repaid'' and a ''prospect of success in restoring market confidence.'' **********Ms. Rice said in an interview that Mr. Bush's first criteria for bailing out a foreign nation would be ''whether the countries we are helping have the political will to make economic reforms.'' Clearly Russia in 1998 -- a bailout Mr. Gore helped coordinate -- did not fit her test. Other Bush aides tick off economic criteria closely parallel to that of Mr. Summers. **********Bush and the I.M.F. **********Mr. Bush is more leery of the role of the International Monetary Fund. ''I think a lot of times we just spend aid and say we feel better about it and it ends up being spent the wrong way,'' he said in the second presidential debate. He charged that the fund -- which the United States effectively controls as its largest shareholder -- often sends the message to international bankers that ''if you make a bad loan, we'll bail you out.'' **********He also charged that much of the $4.8 billion lent to Russia in 1998 ended up ''in the pockets'' of Mr. Chernomyrdin. Mr. Chernomyrdin denied it, threatening to sue Mr. Bush for defamation. The I.M.F. says independent auditors have found no evidence that the money was diverted, and the Bush campaign has cited no evidence to back up the charge. **********Ms. Rice insisted that Mr. Bush's broader point was correct. ''Once the Russians were flaunting it, cooking the books, and once their privatization effort went awry, we kept pumping I.M.F. money in,'' she said. ''That weakened the I.M.F., and it allowed the Russians to have a kind of drug on which they became dependent. It was a mistake. A big one.'' **********Economic sanctions create a sticky problem for both candidates. Mr. Gore defends the slow lifting of sanctions against North Korea, saying, ''Incredibly enough, we have seen a positive response to initiatives there,'' but refuses to consider trying the same approach on Cuba. ''I'm a hard-liner on Castro,'' he said, ticking off the Cuban leader's list of offenses, and ignoring a similarly long list for North Korea. **********Cuba, of course, is a highly emotional issue in Florida, whose 25 electoral votes are hotly contested. So Mr. Bush has taken a similarly tough line. But he has also distanced himself from the views of his running mate, Dick Cheney. In 1998, while running Halliburton, the oil services company,  Mr. Cheney said unilateral sanctions almost always fail and hurt the competitiveness of American businesses. He called for lifting sanctions on Iran, saying the United States could no longer rely on them ''as a club that we can use to punish those who disagree with policies or goals or objectives of the United States.'' Mr. Bush has said pointedly that he is not ready to lift sanctions on Iran. **********Free Traders, but Not Always **********Everyone in this race is a free trader. Except, of course, when campaigning in Michigan or West Virginia, or anywhere else where overseas competition seems a mixed blessing, threatening old jobs even as it creates new markets for American goods. **********Mr. Gore is accustomed to weaving between his free-trading boss and the labor unions that make up his core support. Those unions have opposed every major free trade initiative by the administration, from the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993 to the China trade bill that passed last month, and some threatened to bolt from Mr. Gore. In the end, they backed down. **********This year, Mr. Gore backed the China trade legislation, just as he backed the North American trade pact in 1993. It did not include standards for protecting workers or preserving the environment that he said in his interview he would, if elected, try to get included in all trade negotiations. A free trade agreement with Jordan, signed by Mr. Clinton last week, is the first to include all of those standards in the core of the accord. **********Mr. Bush insists that he would aggressively press new accords -- without labor and environmental provisions -- and expand the North American pact to include much of the rest of Latin America. **********In short, he sounds like a true free-trader. Yet in coal country, Mr. Bush has also bent over backward to draw in union workers who have become disaffected with Mr. Gore. Earlier this month he visited a coal-rich area of West Virginia, and was introduced by a laid-off miner who is president of a United Mine Workers local. ''This is an administration that fears coal,'' he said. ''They see it as a threat. I see it as an opportunity to make us less dependent on big, foreign oil.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/04/world/so-boson-arrives-at-the-party.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-11-04", "snippet": "Physics of Higgs boson is so hard to explain that scientists once competed in contest to see if anyone could do it in less than one page; excerpts from one entrant's explanation (S)", "word_count": 183, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "So Boson Arrives At the Party . . .", "print_headline": "So Boson Arrives At the Party . . .", "body_text": " **********Particle physics is outside the realm of ordinary experience, so it's hard to explain.

He had just turned 30 and remembers growing misty-eyed because his life was so good as he celebrated at a dinner with his family. **********The next afternoon, Mr. Gross's younger brother, Matthew, was shot in the head -- a victim of a shooting spree on the 86th-floor observation deck of the Empire State Building.

He tried that, but although he showed up at his job, only his outer shell was there. **********Most of the time, our work shapes our lives, leaving us to fit life in around the edges, in the spare time that work allows.

She was back at Macy's shortly after the second of her two mastectomies, and she came in every day during her chemotherapy. Halfway through her treatment she was promoted to director of women's shoes, a job she used to think she wanted. **********But after four months of slogging in every day she had a revelation: while her fear had been that she would not be able to work, her problem was that she didn't want to work. ''My heart wasn't in it,'' she says. ''Going in and worrying whether my shoes were on the selling floor just didn't do it for me.'' **********What did do it for her was walking. She had been an avid runner before her cancer (in fact, the disease was diagnosed soon after she ran the New York City Marathon) and during the worst of her chemotherapy she began training for a three-day, 60-mile Avon-sponsored fund-raising walk against breast cancer, so that she would have a goal. **********Every morning, ''even when I felt sick,'' she would walk 8 to 10 miles and think about what she should do with her life.

This ingenious, quizzical, quixotic figure's broad knowledge of literature, especially poetry; refined appreciation of art works of every kind; employment in architecture of the patterns of the constellations of the stars, combinations of numbers and other arcane symbols; old-fashioned working methods, and robust use of everyday language set him apart as a kind of rough-edged Renaissance man marooned in the 20th century, who was never going to fit comfortably into the architectural establishment of his day. **********That Scarpa spent so much of his career in the world of museums and exhibitions \u2014 for which he did some 60 designs between the end of World War II and 1978 \u2014 was partly because it suited his inclinations and temperament. But it was also of necessity, given that his style was so individual, his institutional and political contacts limited, and most of his larger-scale commissions came to him only late in life. **********The surroundings of his upbringing deeply immersed him in the art and architecture of Venice and the Veneto \u2014 one of his earliest memories being of playing amid Palladian columns in Vicenza, where his family lived for several years when he was a child \u2014 which left him with a lifelong love of antique art and artifacts. **********But as an architect he was not in any obvious sense a traditionalist, though a closer examination of his work reveals that he did draw on the past in myriad subtle ways. He admired Frank Lloyd Wright and even Le Corbusier, and had a particular affinity for Japanese art, but the solution to each commission he undertook was always, in the end, very much his own. Indeed, it was his practice to produce a multitude of alternatives before finally choosing one of them, and he left behind tens of thousands of drawings in his own hand. **********Budgets for public galleries and special shows in Scarpa's time were a fraction of what they can be now. But a telling pair of timely shows devoted to him \u2014 \"Carlo Scarpa: Exhibitions and Museums: 1944-1976,\" at the Museo del Castelvecchio in Verona, and \"Houses and Landscapes: 1972-1978,\" at Palazzo Barbaran da Porto in Vicenza (both until Dec. 10) \u2014 confirm that Scarpa was able to achieve remarkable results with very limited resources and that he still has a great deal to teach to contemporary designers. **********The Castelvecchio museum was Scarpa's masterpiece of remolding, carried out in phases between the late 1950s and 1974. Although dating from the 14th century, the castle had been repeatedly altered and badly damaged over the centuries \u2014 fortunately in this case, since it gave Scarpa a much freer hand than he would otherwise have had. The challenge was not only to consolidate and restore a crumbling edifice, but to find new means of presenting the city's considerable collection of medieval, Renaissance and later art. **********Scarpa's scheme was daring in its opening up of additional sources of light and arresting new vistas from room to room, as well as creating more intimate spaces to show smaller exhibits. Equally striking was the compendium of devices Scarpa deployed to display different pieces of art \u2014 from plinths and armatures, to easels and rods extending from floor to ceiling \u2014 specifically designed for the purpose of bringing out each piece's special qualities. The overall result is a tour de force of design which is a pleasure in itself, and yet does not come between object and spectator. **********Among a score of projects illustrated in the special show at the Castelvecchio, which include a number of Scarpa's designs for major exhibitions, is an extraordinary gem, his entirely new wing for the old museum of Antonio Canova's original models and casts at the artist's birthplace in the Veneto, Possagno. Here, like Borromini, Scarpa proved himself a genius at staging unexpected drama in a constrained space, creating box-like lantern windows and other apertures to cast broad, shifting shafts of natural light on his meticulously planned choreography of the sculptures within. **********The architect's elusive cocktail of restraint and theatricality, of austerity illuminated by flashes of color contrast and artfully positioned ornament, is further unfolded at the Vicenza show, of the private houses, public buildings, piazzas and commemorative monuments he was commissioned to build during the last decade of his life. Several of these were not realized for various reasons, and others he did not, alas, live to execute: he died in an accident while visiting Japan in 1978. **********RODERICK CONWAY MORRIS writes for the International Herald Tribune on art and culture. **********[Not to be reproduced without the permission of the author.]"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/04/business/spice-maker-will-accept-ftc-review.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "2000-02-04", "snippet": "McCormick & Co, world's largest spice maker, agrees to let antitrust enforcers review its sales contracts for 10 years to head off lawsuit contending that it illegally charged some grocers more than others; company says proposed settlement, which ...", "word_count": 332, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Spice Maker Will Accept F.T.C.

The numbers are avidly scanned by investors and by the companies themselves. Some investment strategies are based in part on those numbers. **********But how good are those figures? Only as good as the reports from brokerage firms, which are required to add up short positions of their customers on all trades that have been settled by the 15th of each month. And it appears that the N.A.S.D. is doing something less than a stellar job of riding herd on the brokerage firms. **********Yesterday, NASD Regulation, its regulatory arm, announced that E*Trade Securities, a large on-line brokerage firm, had been fined $20,000 because it failed to file such reports for 28 months, from June 1996 through September 1998. **********How did E*Trade manage to go for more than two years without reporting? The firm called it inadvertent, and an N.A.S.D. official agreed. **********Stephen Luparello, a vice president for market regulation of NASD Regulation, said E*Trade, like many other brokerage firms, had arranged for the firm that clears its trades to make the report. **********In 1996, he said, E*Trade began to clear some of its own trades, but did not realize that it had an obligation to file the reports. No one at the N.A.S.D. noticed until 1998, when an examiner spotted the failure during a routine examination of the firm, and referred the matter to NASD Regulation, which began an investigation in January 1999. **********Mr. Luparello said the association did make sure that every firm it knew had an obligation to file such reports did so every month. But any firm that is newly required to file will only be caught during an examination, he said. ''This is sort of a technical administrative failure where they didn't realize the obligation they had,'' he added, maintaining that the numbers, which E*Trade supplied after going through its records, were ''not material'' to the Nasdaq short-interest figures. **********Those figures show the number of shares of each stock that have been borrowed and sold short, but not yet repurchased, by the reporting date. One reason to short a stock is to bet on its decline; others include arbitrage involving differing securities issued by the same company or involving two companies that are planning to merge. **********Mr. Luparello said that in the first month E*Trade failed to file, its customers had short interest of 314,000 shares in 298 securities. By September 1998, the final month it failed to report, the figure had grown to 1.4 million shares involving 749 companies, while the overall figure for all brokers was 2.15 billion shares. **********Mr. Luparello said that the N.A.S.D. had decided not to update its earlier records after concluding the figures were not material for any stock. He said it would not release the figures for individual stocks, having decided there was no need to make that information public. **********Patrick Di Chiro, an E*Trade spokesman, said: ''As soon as we discovered this inadvertent situation, we immediately moved to correct it. We take our regulatory responsibilities very seriously.'' **********The penalty is the second in a few months that indicates E*Trade had a great deal of trouble in dealing with its explosive growth. In May, NASD Regulation fined the brokerage firm, a subsidiary of the E*Trade Group, $20,000 because it had failed to respond to requests for information concerning customer complaints. **********E*Trade shares rose 13 cents yesterday, to $17.25, in Nasdaq trading. The company went public at $2.63 a share, adjusted for subsequent splits, in August 1996 -- a month after it began clearing some trades without complying with reporting requirements.

Before credit-card rewards programs, there were S&H Green Stamps. Before Web dollars, e-coupons and MyPoints.com, there were S&H Green Stamps. **********And now, Green Stamps are back, this time in digital form. The S&H company recently went online with an Internet site, Greenpoints.com, in an effort to resurrect one of the most famous icons of 20th-century retailing as a reward for online shopping. **********The challenge for S&H will be to persuade online users that a new digital currency called greenpoints -- which you can't see or hold or lick or print out -- is as meaningful as a stack of perforated Green Stamps that would accumulate in an old red Pyrex bowl on the kitchen counter. **********For those of you who have not thought of S&H stamps since your mother redeemed them for a new blender, let me refresh your memory. At the peak of trading stamp popularity in the mid 1960's, most gas stations and supermarkets were offering them to shoppers. S&H operated 800 free-standing redemption centers nationwide, and in the mid-1960's it printed more stamps than the Postal Service. **********Each stamp had a pale green background embellished by a jaunty red ''S&H'' logo, a serial number and fine print that read ''Value 1 2/3 mills,'' which meant that you could redeem it for cash. **********But when I was a child, nobody I knew would have considered trading green stamps for mere money; they were worth far more than that. For my family -- sitting around the kitchen table for hours, licking that tapioca-flavored glue and filling Quick Saver Books until the pages began to warp and sag under the weight of wet stamps -- the experience provided the opportunity to ask the big questions: Were we the sort of people who would redeem our hoarded stamps for the kinds of sensible items that you could really build a postwar lifestyle around, like a 12-cup coffee percolator or a toaster? Or would we blow everything on something frivolous, like that family down the block who redeemed their stamps for a basketball that their kids lost the next day? **********Green Stamps confirmed us as proud members of the first generation that succumbed to the heady lure of fancy new appliances. ''That was the year,'' my mother said, remembering one green stamp purchase in 1969, ''that we upgraded from a two-slice to a four-slice.'' And toast never tasted so good. **********Long after the popularity of Green Stamps waned in the 1970's, the S&H logo still exerts a powerful, Proustian pull on nearly everyone who was old enough back then to lick. ''The most compelling thing about S&H Green Stamps,'' said Melissa Shore, an analyst at Jupiter Communications, ''is that whenever I tell someone that the company is entering the online market, people immediately begin to relate an emotional story about their experience of growing up with S&H Green Stamps. They have strong brand equity and a hundred years of experience.'' **********So it is understandable that S&H wants to repackage the old-fashioned appeal of Green Stamps into something the company's executives describe with straight faces as a ''complete loyalty solution.'' **********''This is a company founded in 1896,'' said Walter Beinecke, the executive vice president of Greenpoints.com and a great-grandson of an S&H founder, Thomas Sperry. ''But we're also a 104-year-old dot-com startup.'' **********Computers, however, do not come loaded with a sense of taste, at least not yet. Clicking on a Web site seems a poor substitute for giddy feelings that the original stamps induced in millions of consumers. **********''The question is: can you convey, online, that emotional feeling that people remember?'' Ms. Shore said. It is a question that could be asked of any old-style retailer poised to take its business to the Web. The S&H company has a few additional hurdles. **********''Our parents remembered the Depression and the war, and collecting trading stamps was all part of the dream of affluence, which meant acquiring your Levitt home and your television and your first appliances,'' said David Monod, a historian and the author of ''Store Wars: Shopkeepers and the Culture of Mass Marketing, 1890-1939.'' ''It definitely had to do with the physical feeling of the stamp itself, and the fact that your whole family sat around the table doing it together.'' **********The transition to the Web becomes even more problematic because the domain name Greenstamps.com belongs to two California lawyers, Sullwold & Hughes, who think of themselves as S&H, too, and say they would not give up the name. **********But Greenpoints officials said the name would have been too old-fashioned. ''We would not want to be Green Stamps on the Internet anyway, because that speaks to an older way of doing things,'' Mr. Beinecke said. **********In 1896, Mr. Beinecke said, Sperry & Hutchinson became the the first independent trading stamp company to distribute stamps and books to merchants, beginning in Michigan, and by the turn of the century trading stamps were very popular. **********The reason, Mr. Beinecke said, was that the S&H incentive program rewarded shoppers both for timely payment (the stamps were given out in exchange for cash purchases) and loyalty to specific merchants. **********But after the First World War, ''the novelty wore off and nobody used them,'' Mr. Monod said. ''Trading stamps tended to be popular in inflationary times, when people were concerned about prices, but in the 1920's, prices were stable. And in the 1930's, prices were deflationary.'' **********In the 1930's, to protect independent merchants from chain stores, states began passing fair-trade laws to prevent retailers from cutting prices. **********''Retailers had to find ways to entice customers and give them price breaks,'' said Sandra Stringer Vance, a historian who specializes in retail history since World War II and a co-author of ''Wal-Mart: A History of Sam Walton's Retail Phenomenon.'' **********The popularity of trading stamps revived, and by the middle of the century, S&H had become a powerful national company whose success was imitated by scores of local companies with names like Gold Bond, Blue Chip and Plaid Stamps, said Jeff R. Lonto, a Minneapolis author who published ''The Trading Stamp Story.'' **********But the climate changed drastically during the 1973 oil embargo. ''At that time, 40,000 gas stations were giving out Green Stamps, but a number of them went out of business or consolidated,'' Mr. Beinecke said. **********The trading stamp craze quickly faded. Although S&H never stopped the program -- even today about 400 independent businesses, including gas stations and travel agents, give out stamps and the company still operates a central customer service center in Atlanta -- Green Stamps disappeared from the public consciousness. **********Mr. Beinecke's family sold the company in 1981, but last year he led a group of investors who bought S&H in the hope of re-inventing the incentive program in a digital economy. **********''Rather than licking and sticking stamps as a family,'' said Rod Parker, president of Greenpoints.com, ''today's family will go to the Web site and see how many points they have and what they can get, and think, 'Wow, this can be rewarding.' It's today's culture. It's fast, it's simple and you never have to leave the house.'' **********But how do you persuade people to abandon the physical sensation of holding and licking a stamp? This is the same question that the E-Stamp Corporation confronted after beginning to sell digital stamps online last year. **********''We found that in the consumer market, people were tied to the physical stamp,'' said Nicole Eagan, E-Stamp's senior vice president for sales and marketing, ''and we actually bridge the electronic and physical worlds, because you can buy the stamps in the e-commerce world but then you can still print them out.'' You can print it on Avery labels and peel it off and stick it on the envelope, or you can print it right on the envelope, or you can print it on a document to show through a window envelope.'' **********Postage, of course, is very palpable: you need it to mail in the bills. But the points and coupons behind Greenpoints.com and a number of other online incentive programs that arrived on the Internet months ago -- like MyPoints.com, ClickRewards.com and FreeRide.com -- are less tangible. **********Greenpoints.com will also offer shoppers offline opportunities to earn points, Mr. Parker said. One merchant, the Foodtown supermarket chain, has started the program in 10 stores in the New York metropolitan area. Shoppers keep track of their points with a card that looks like a credit card, Mr. Parker said, and will be able to redeem both offline and online greenpoints. **********To be successful, the programs have to offer rewards that today's jaded shoppers really believe are worth earning. Airline mileage? Yes. The opportunity to donate your accumulated points to charity? Maybe. Toasters? No. **********Many of the 300 rewards that you could earn when Greenpoints.com began last week (the list keeps growing, and the company plans to offer more than 1,000 rewards online by the end of March) were easy-to-earn items -- like a movie theater ticket (2,400 points) or five $1 gift certificates for Wendy's fast food (2,400 points). But so what if you can accumulate enough points to redeem those items very quickly? You earn 20 greenpoints for each dollar spent. Does that really feel like a reward to today's shoppers? **********''We are wild consumers these days, but we're desensitized to it because we buy so much,'' Mr. Monod said. ''The things that excite people today are terribly, terribly expensive, like travel, which most people consider a luxury, or a new stereo system.'' **********If you manage to accumulate more than 100,000 greenpoints, you could get something of real value, like a 13-inch Panasonic color television (141,600), a travel certificate for a round-trip domestic flight on Continental Airlines (149,000) or a ski vacation in Canada (249,000). **********But at the introductory rate of 20 points per dollar, you would have to spend $12,450 to get the ski vacation. Knowing that, would you be willing to sign up, provide personal information and use the Greenpoints.com home page as a shopping trip starting point so the company can keep track of your purchases? **********I did. I visited www.greenpoints.com -- and was momentarily catapulted into the lost world of a particular spring morning in 1969, the year 80 percent of American households were collecting trading stamps and a trip to the redemption center in the next town meant that my mother first had to wrestle my little brother into ''good clothes.'' **********Signing up -- giving my e-mail address -- earned me 3,000 points. I got an additional 1,000 points for providing personal information like name, sex and number of people in my household, and 500 more by answering a survey question. **********With that many points in the bank, I surveyed some of the possible purchases, many of which were not on any shopper's wish list: I'm thinking, for example, of the potpourri to ''add soft fragrance to any room'' (3,600 points). I decided to hold on to my points. Instead, I scanned the list of 61 partner merchants (as of this week, the number of merchants had increased to 88), which included well-known retailers like OfficeMax.com, Borders.com and LandsEnd.com. **********I had been planning to buy children's bathing suits anyway, and when I clicked on LandsEnd.com, a second browser window appeared on the screen to take me there. I bought eight bathing suits for $170, and when I closed the second browser window I found myself back at Greenpoints.com, which according to my calculations now owed me 3,400 greenpoints. **********Even after my points are credited -- I am still awaiting confirmation -- my 7,900 total will not be enough to get anything I want. Neither the Dr. Talking Clock (7,200 points) nor the rugged 50-foot garden hose (7,200) nor anything else in that range really appealed to me. **********I would not mind earning a free airline ticket, and I might not even lose interest before I bought the necessary 372 bathing suits -- or their equivalents. Now, if Greenpoints.com wanted to send me the equivalent value in actual stamps, I would stay up all night, licking their backs and laboriously pasting them into books. **********But then, I'm sentimental. **********That Was Then, This Is Now **********S&H Green Stamps have been around since the 19th century but reached the height of their popularity during the 1960's. The three items at left are from the S&H catalog of 1962, when approximately 10 stamps were awarded for every $1 spent and each book required 1,200 stamps. The other items are from the Greenpoints.com Web site. The site currently awards 20 greenpoints for every dollar spent, although that figure will drop to 10 points within a few months. **********FROM THE 1962 S&H GREEN STAMPS CATALOG **********General Electric waffle iron and sandwich grill.

Varov, wearing a pistol on his hip, opens the sun roof of his big Mercedes 600 to remove the illegal flashing light he uses to maneuver through traffic on the icy streets of this industrial city in the Ural Mountains. **********He and his colleague, Andrei V. Kabanov, are on the prowl in a poor neighborhood where the heroin addicts are out at dusk searching for dealers in the snowy courtyards and darkened stairwells. ''Look, there's some addicts,'' he says, as the silver sedan careered into the alley next to a dilapidated apartment block. **********Two teenage boys eye their arrival warily. Mr. Varov and Mr. Kabanov jump out and start barking orders in almost one voice. ''Get over here! Show me your arms. Tell me where they are selling drugs, and don't lie.'' Mr. Varov is unfazed by protests from the teenagers -- one is visibly shaking -- that they are not addicts and do not know where drugs are being sold. **********Two other young men approach, believing that they have also been summoned by Mr. Kabonov's repeated shouts to ''get over here!'' But now Mr. Varov wheels toward them. ''What are you doing here? Get out of here or I will break your legs.'' **********Here at the crossroads of Asia and Europe, where the supply lines of opium and heroin out of Central and South Asia run into big population centers near the frontier of the drug trade, a group of tough guys have organized themselves as a foundation called City Without Drugs. They are leading a brutal civic campaign to take the streets of Yekaterinburg back from the drug dealers and the corrupt policemen who are widely believed to be protecting them. **********''We call ourselves the angered public,'' said Mr. Varov, 36, who runs a construction materials company. ''And we are doing this for people who want to be rid of these drug dealers. We go to these drug selling sites with baseball bats and flashlights and find out where the drug dealers are and beat them like wild dogs.'' **********In the lawless vacuum that afflicts much of Russia today, Mr. Varov and Mr. Kabanov regularly incite acts of vigilante violence against drug dealers. They have also founded a drug treatment center where addicts are forced to withdraw from heroin use cold turkey while handcuffed to their beds -- or sometimes just to the nearest radiator. **********They, and a loose knit band of business associates, are a sign of the jarring social transition under way in many parts of the country where vigilante violence and paramilitary organizations have assumed a greater role in policing and guarding Russian business people and ordinary citizens. But sometimes they turn on these people and extort money from them. **********Not long ago, Mr. Varov went on television and said that if the drug idemic raging here ever touched his own family, the top law enforcement officer in the region, Gen. Aleksei A. Krasnikov, ''would not live beyond that day.'' **********They are up-from-nowhere street toughs, gang leaders or sportsmen who in the last decade have muscled their way into one business or another. As their power and wealth have grown, they have embraced religion or taken up public causes. In some cases this was genuine, but in others it was a means to clean up their image and wrap themselves in the mantle of public-spiritedness while staving off prosecutions. **********''We are all for killing drug dealers on the spot without trial because they are poisoning our children,'' says Mr. Kabanov, 40, a onetime professional card player and former heroin addict himself, who built a yacht club for the region's nouveaux riches. **********He dresses in a natty black outfit under a stubble of red beard that enhances his roguish presentation. He and Mr. Varov have determined that the heroin plague that is sweeping across Russia is a conspiracy by Muslim nations and Chechen warlords to lay low their motherland. **********''No one wants a strong Russia,'' Mr. Varov contends, ''including America.'' **********There is no dispute about the problem they confront. The opening of borders and of formerly closed cities in Russia, along with the collapse of the Soviet-era economy, ignited a wave of illicit trade in everything for which there is a market in the world -- arms, drugs and prostitution. **********In the space of less than a decade, the number of heroin addicts here rose to an estimated 60,000 to 80,000 from a few dozen. The number of drug addicts across the country is expected to reach three million in Russia this year. That is well behind the United States, where there are an estimated 12 million drug users, but the rate of growth in Russia is phenomenal. **********In the first half of 1999, heroin use in Russia was up 4.5 times compared with the same period in 1998. And the number of H.I.V. infections, many of them from shared needles, doubled in 1999, according to an Interior Ministry report issued in November. **********In a country where alcoholism already is rampant, a culture of soaring drug addiction is gaining ground, further undermining the basic health of the nation. Russia is suffering such a sharp rise in overall mortality and declining birth rates that the average life expectancy for Russian men has declined to 61.3 years. For women it is 72.9 years. **********''This is one of the most serious problems facing the country because it could take away an entire generation of Russians,'' said Boris M. Tepliakov, a psychiatrist and the head of the state-run hospital here that treats drug addicts. **********The loss of government control, or feckless enforcement by the central and regional law enforcement authorities, has given rise to the spread of gangs and private security that who assert their own authority. On some days, it is difficult to sort out the criminals from the noncriminals. Mr. Varov and his associates say they stepped into the vacuum last summer, when the law enforcement authorities were either overwhelmed or unwilling to act. **********They teamed up with another business syndicate here called Uralmash, and together they sent several hundred security guards from their various enterprises to the Gypsy Village neighborhood that serves as the center of the drug trade in the city. **********The security guards beat some suspected drug dealers and went to the homes of others, threatening to burn them down if drug dealing did not stop. Not long after, Uralmash security guards who patrol an open-air market on the other side of town seized a suspected drug dealer. **********They tied him to a tree, hung a sign on him saying he was poisoning the city's youth, and pulled his pants down and jabbed old hypodermic needles into his hind quarters while a film crew was summoned from a local television station. **********A few weeks ago, City Without Drugs lent its expertise, and perhaps some of its muscle, to a civic group in the nearby town of Reftinski, where 18 suspected drug sellers were taken to a wooded area and severely beaten. **********Though incidents of vigilantism have been aired in the local news media, neither the governor nor the mayor has commented on them. Both declined requests for interviews. **********A senior police official, Fedor S. Anikeyev, said he had received ''unofficial'' reports of vigilantism. The police were powerless to act unless one of the beaten drug dealers walked into the police station to swear out a complaint, which was not likely, he said, because that would only subject him to further threats and beatings. **********By all accounts here, the anti-drug crusade has significant public support -- although it is impossible to measure -- from citizens who are struggling in an economy of high unemployment, industrial contraction and cynicism toward anyone who claims to be working for the public good. **********Mothers of drug-ravaged teenagers have staged rallies and organized drug patrols in courtyards and apartment stairwells. An electronic pager system set up by City Without Drugs to enable the public to inform on drug dealers has received more than 6,000 calls since last fall. **********''It was only when this group got active that the police started to do anything,'' said an elderly taxi driver named Anatoly, who has driven the streets here most of his life. **********One of the most prominent figures supporting City Without Drugs is Aleksandr Khabarov. A decade or so ago he founded the Uralmash gang, reputed to be an organization of small-time racketeers that came from the sports clubs in the industrial neighborhoods near the Uralmash heavy machinery plant here. **********Through the years, Uralmash started many legitimate enterprises, and by 1993 Mr. Khabarov was running for Parliament. He is still running. During last December's balloting, a majority of the voters in his district marked ''none of the above'' and the election was voided. It has been rescheduled for March 26. **********Mr. Khabarov's security forces added their muscle to those mobilized by City Without Drugs for an assault in September on Gypsy Village. **********The building that houses the City Without Drugs clinic is a rundown former kindergarten on a small wooded plot in a village on the outskirts the city. It is surrounded by weathered cottages on whose roofs the late winter snow is heaped like layers of meringue. **********A total of 47 recovering addicts are in residence, making it the largest such facility in the city. The withdrawal regime that begins with bread-and-water rations and handcuffs is free. **********Sergei Kobyakov, 19, is handcuffed to the bed nearest the front window in the dormitory where the addicts spend their first two weeks. He had been shooting up for four years. Getting heroin in his neighborhood, he said, was as easy as ''buying a pack of cigarettes.'' He decided to subject himself to handcuffs because other clinics had failed him and ''because I have a great desire to cure this addiction.'' **********He wants to become a truck driver. His eyes look out from hollowed sockets after four sleepless nights of pain and the insomnia of withdrawal. ''I think my life will get better,'' he says, ''If you lie here in handcuffs, you understand what it is and that you want to end it.'' **********Dr. Tepliakov, the chief narcologist in the regional government, is highly critical of the withdrawal regime at the clinic. ''I thank God that no one has died there,'' he said, ''but if someone does, it is going to be a big scandal.'' He calls the City Without Drugs methods dangerous and ''illiterate,'' and he condemns the vigilantism that is taking hold. **********''For me, let the devil himself fight this evil, but by civilized means,'' he said. **********Back in the city, in the curtained alcove of a restaurant, Natalia Zernova, a journalist who has been chronicling the life of this city for three decades, tried to explain how the explosion of drug addiction here set off not only a vigilante-style response, but also political recriminations over the failure of government. **********''The Russian mentality demands action because we always demand a strong hand,'' Ms. Zernova said, ''It is a tragedy that we have come to vigilantism. Unfortunately, for the people who founded this movement, vigilantism is part of their mentality, and no matter how they try to appear as civilized people, their criminal past is written on their faces and in their actions.'' **********But Ms. Zernova's reservations about the leaders of the anti-drug movement still do not overcome her basic support for their actions, and this was a common thread in interviews conducted during a visit to the city in February. **********''All in all, I think it is better to do something than nothing at all,'' she said. ''In a country where the use of physical violence is the norm, using force against drug dealers is not going to cause any anger.'' **********Added 16-year-old Leonid A. Pavlukov, a lanky student who goes to one of the best high schools here and wants to become a lawyer: ''Thanks to the activities of this foundation, people are afraid of selling drugs. Of course it is not ideal that they are beating people, but Russia is in a period of transition and so long as there are no good laws on the books, and so long as the police are corrupt, it seems to me that it is acceptable to use vigilantism to fight against the drug problem.'' **********Andrei Sannikov is the local television journalist who first put City Without Drugs on the air, including the footage of alleged payments to the police, a broadcast for which he is now under formal investigation by the city prosecutor for possible ''slander'' against the ''honor of the uniform.'' **********''This campaign has created a unity that you won't see in any other sphere of public life,'' Mr. Sannikov said in his studio, from which he has also shown his viewers exclusive footage of vigilante raids. In these raids, masked men burst into the apartments of suspected drug dealers, beating and kicking them in the face, head and groin. **********Mr. Sannikov's program also runs ads for the private business ventures of Mr. Varov and his colleagues at City Without Drugs, in what has become a symbiotic relationship. ''We are in a condition of war in this city, and war is not aesthetic; it is frightening.'' he said. ''If we were to keep silent and not show what was really happening, we would not change the consciousness of the people.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/09/business/mutual-funds-report-putting-new-money-in-emerging-markets-yields-big-winners.html": {"writer_name": "Joanne Legomsky", "pub_date": "2000-01-09", "snippet": "Stock mutual funds that invest mainly abroad outperformed domestic funds in fourth quarter; all major overseas markets participated in climb, with biggest gains coming in emerging markets; fund managers comment; photos (M)", "word_count": 1295, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Putting New Money In Emerging Markets Yields Big Winners", "print_headline": "MUTUAL FUNDS REPORT; Putting New Money In Emerging Markets Yields Big Winners", "body_text": " **********AFTER several years in the shadow of the United States bull market, international stock funds have outperformed diversified domestic funds in back-to-back quarters. **********In the fourth quarter of 1999, the average stock mutual fund that invests primarily abroad rose 25.97 percent, compared with 18.94 percent for domestic funds. All the major overseas markets participated in the climb, including European exchanges that were sluggish earlier in the year. (The foreign funds' average would have been even higher if not for the drag of precious-metals funds, which fell 11.41 percent in the period.) **********But the real action overseas was in emerging markets. General emerging-markets funds climbed 34.69 percent, on average, in the quarter;  those focusing on Latin America were up 38.38 percent. And, just as they did in the United States, technology and telecommunications stocks led the way. **********Within the broad trends, of course, was a wide range of performances among individual markets and funds. And perhaps more today than usual, money managers and investors are asking themselves if the recent pattern offers any reliable guide to the next few quarters. The managers of three top-performing aggressive-growth funds that invest abroad discussed their strategies and where they were putting new money. **********The Japanese Wave **********William R. Andersen, manager of Driehaus International Growth, a $440 million institutional fund, said a surge in Japanese technology was one factor in its recent success. **********The fund had a return of 66.46 percent in the fourth quarter, placing it seventh out of 775 international stock funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. (Although it has a minimum initial purchase of $100,000, smaller investors can take a position indirectly through financial advisers.) **********The fund has a 30-percent weighting in Japanese stocks. Most are in technology, but some are in other sectors, like the Goodwill Group, a temporary-employment pioneer that provides workers for a variety of industries. ''This whole service sector is so nascent,'' Mr. Andersen said. Goodwill's shares gained 48 percent in the quarter. **********Mr. Andersen, who is 40, also credits a timely move into European growth stocks for his fund's success.  In his view, European technology and Internet companies, the prime movers, still have room to climb. ''They have tremendous potential to apply proven business models that worked in the U.S.,'' he said. Such adaptation used to take years, he said, but ''now it happens overnight.'' **********He cited QXL.com, a London-based online auctioneer much like eBay. Though QXL.com's stock has already more than tripled since he bought it, he remains bullish. **********Among emerging markets, he sees promise in Israel, and has already won big there with Check Point Software Technologies, an Internet security services company. Unlike many other Internet companies, Check Point is profitable, and Mr. Andersen expects earnings per share to rise by one-third in 2000. **********He is now looking at Eastern Europe. Though he has not yet committed any capital to the region, he said, ''this area could be the real sleeper success story of the year.'' **********A Sharper Technology Focus **********Technology figured even more prominently in the 64.14 percent fourth-quarter return of Merrill Lynch Global Small Cap, an $85 million fund managed by Ken Chiang. It returned 104.84 percent for the 12 months and 16.75 percent, annualized, over the last five years **********The recent performance came as sweet relief. When he was brought in to refocus the fund in April 1998, ''the portfolio consisted of a hodgepodge of stocks with no unifying strategy,'' said Mr. Chiang, 38. Now, almost 60 percent of the fund's assets are in technology and telecommunications. **********Mr. Chiang looks for companies in high-growth industries that have strong incentives -- usually stock options -- to motivate managers. He prefers companies whose ''franchise value'' or strong brand identity deters would-be competitors. The fund invests globally, weighted 31 percent in Europe, 25 percent in Asia and 38 percent in the United States and Canada, with the remaining 6 percent in cash. **********The turning point for European Internet stocks, Mr. Chiang said, was a November conference in London sponsored by Morgan Stanley. ''The effect of all the positive buzz was immediate,'' he said, for stocks like Tiscali S.p.A., an Italian Internet service provider, whose management has shown that it is willing to spend heavily -- and initially, lose --  to build market share. **********The practice, common in the United States, is rare overseas. ''European firms stress profitability because they need it to secure venture capital financing,'' Mr. Chiang said. Tiscali, he added, ''is among the few companies that understands content and the need for market penetration.'' The shares rocketed more than 400 percent in the quarter. **********Heavy advertising spending by Internet companies made the quarter a strong one for European ad agencies and media companies that reach young adults. Mr. Chiang rode that trend by holding winners like Saatchi & Saatchi, Havas Advertising and M6 Metropole, a French television broadcaster. **********Mr. Chiang predicts that technology and telecommunications stocks will rise further, because investor concerns over high valuations will be more than countered by immense amounts of cash waiting to pour in to the sector after any selloff. **********But he will not be part of any selloff. ''The appetite for these companies is tremendous,'' he said. **********Politics Over Economics **********Alfredo Viegas, co-manager of the Lexington Worldwide Emerging Markets fund, was only half-joking when he said, ''I figure I have two years of job protection.'' Quick adoption of advanced technology and a more hospitable investing climate in these markets may soon entice many Americans to invest directly rather than through a fund, he said. **********Successful bets, meanwhile, on hot markets like Turkey, South Korea and India contributed to the fund's return of 78.49 percent for the quarter, the best among 70 emerging-markets funds and third-highest among all international stock funds tracked by Morningstar. For most of the quarter, the fund had about half its assets in Asia, one-third in the Middle East and Africa and one-tenth in Latin America. Technology and telecommunications issues account for 60 percent of assets; consumer services, financial services and basic industries make up the remainder. **********The fund's managers say they keep a closer watch on politics than on economic trends. ''In emerging markets, politics is the better leading indicator,'' Mr. Viegas said. ''Politics determine the direction of the market.'' The fund got into Turkey with 15 percent of its assets in the second half of 1999 after elections there broke a stalemate and produced a governing majority. **********One of his strongest performers in Turkey was Netas Telecommunications, an equipment maker. The company is controlled by Nortel Networks of Canada; the Turkish military is a part-owner. Netas's stock soared 350 percent in the quarter. **********Another winner was Vestel, originally a video and computer monitor maker but now on its way to becoming Turkey's largest Internet service provider, Mr. Viegas said. The stock now trades at just eight times earnings, but Mr. Viegas predicted that it would ''go through the roof'' if the company gained a Nasdaq listing, as it hopes to do later this year. **********Despite the strong run, Mr. Viegas said, emerging markets still have plenty of catching up to do. They now trade at much lower multiples than their American counterparts, but he expects them to start closing the gap. **********''The Internet has leveled the playing field,'' he said.

Mr. Qurei, the speaker of the Palestinian legislature, is regarded as one of the most powerful figures in the Palestine Liberation Organization. **********The talks would be the highest-level contacts the two sides have acknowledged holding since Camp David and seemed likely to focus on Jerusalem. **********Since Camp David, both sides have marked out seemingly irreconcilable positions on the city, with Mr. Arafat demanding that Israel hand over sovereignty over all of East Jerusalem and Mr. Barak and his aides vowing that Israel will go no further than the compromises suggested by President Clinton and tentatively accepted by Mr. Barak at Camp David. **********As outlined by Israeli and Palestinian officials, those compromises would involve a limited Palestinian foothold at the Muslim holy sites in the Old City as well as control of the old Arab quarter and some Arab villages on the city's eastern periphery. **********Mr. Barak was also said to have agreed that Mr. Arafat could establish a presidential headquarters for a Palestinian state in East Jerusalem, allowing the Palestinians to declare it their capital. **********At today's parliamentary session, Mr. Sharon sought to stir a public groundswell against Mr. Barak with a highly charged speech that depicted Mr. Barak as a usurper ready to trade Israel's control of Jerusalem for a peace agreement. **********Mr. Sharon contended that Mr. Barak, who lost his parliamentary majority when three parties quit his coalition government immediately before the Camp David talks, had no mandate to govern or to negotiate peace with the Palestinians. **********''Barak does not have the right to give up Jerusalem, which the people received as a legacy,'' Mr. Sharon said. **********Aides to Mr. Barak dismissed the parliamentary vote as largely irrelevant to the peace efforts, saying that Mr. Barak, elected prime minister by a wide margin in the popular vote 15 months ago, had a constitutional and political mandate to continue peace negotiations unless ousted in a new election. **********Besides, they said, Mr. Sharon and his parliamentary allies failed to force early elections only two weeks ago, when a no-confidence motion against Mr. Barak's government fell 3 votes short of the 61 votes needed. **********That vote was followed by another on Aug. 2 in which opposition parties succeeded in mustering 61 votes in favor of dissolving Parliament, which would lead to new elections. But Israel's basic law requires such a vote to be approved afterward by a parliamentary committee, then again by the full Parliament, before becoming law -- a process not likely to be completed, if at all, until Parliament ends its summer recess and resumes on Oct. 29. **********Although Mr. Sharon and his aides have been working to win over some members who voted against the no-confidence motion, with a view to trying to topple Mr. Barak during the recess, most Israeli politicians predict that the prime minister will survive at least until the fall session. **********Even if he is defeated then, either in a no-confidence vote or by passage of a law mandating new elections, Mr. Barak will have 90 days before an election to seek a peace accord. **********Israeli political commentators said Mr. Sharon, lacking the numbers for a no-confidence vote, appeared to have settled for the time being on a course intended to undermine public confidence in Mr. Barak. **********In that context, they said, the parliamentary debate later this month seems likely to be largely a forum for more impassioned denunciations of Mr. Barak. All the same, these commentators said, the parliamentary drumbeat against the peace talks is not likely to encourage progress in the negotiations."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/20/business/international-business-european-cities-of-two-minds-on-one-bourse.html": {"writer_name": "Edmund Andrews", "pub_date": "2000-05-20", "snippet": "Pioneering merger of London and Frankfurt stock exchanges is running into heavy resistance in both cities; German regulators and state-owned banks fear Frankfurt will lose control over market for small growth companies, which has been huge success...", "word_count": 806, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "European Cities Of Two Minds On One Bourse", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; European Cities Of Two Minds On One Bourse", "body_text": " **********The pioneering merger of the London and Frankfurt stock exchanges is running into heavy resistance in both cities. **********In Germany, regulators and the nation's state-owned banks fear that Frankfurt will lose control over the market for small growth companies, which has been a huge success here in the last three years. **********In Britain, the fear is that Frankfurt will grab all the good business and that London traders will be left with little except the costs of switching over to Frankfurt's system for electronic trading. **********Some British executives also complain that the merger has been engineered by big American investment banks that want lower trading costs even if London is diminished as a financial center. **********But even some of Europe's biggest trading institutions, which badly want a more efficient pan-European stock market, are complaining that the deal announced two weeks ago has serious problems. **********''Everyone is in favor of getting a single trading system, but this isn't the way to do it,'' said an executive at a London trading institution.

And the Fed chairman said there had been almost no effect on inflation expectations, reducing the chances the oil prices could set off a destabilizing spiral of rising wages and prices. **********In an address here to a conference on monetary policy sponsored by the Cato Institute, a conservative research group, Mr. Greenspan suggested that he saw nothing happening in the economy that would lead the Fed to raise interest rates anytime soon -- or reduce them. **********He repeated his optimistic view that the growth rate of productivity was still accelerating as technological advances work their way through the economy. Higher productivity growth means that companies are producing more with the same amount of labor, allowing them to pay higher wages and maintain or expand profit margins without raising prices. But he warned about long-term challenges to continued prosperity. One is that the surge in productivity will eventually abate. The other is that the benefits to the economy of the federal government's running a large budget surplus are likely to be tempered because the two parties seem intent on using much of the projected surplus for tax cuts or new spending. **********Under Mr. Greenspan, the Fed has bet over the last several years that the economy is capable of higher rates of noninflationary growth than traditional economic theory would allow. The country has been rewarded by a drop in the unemployment rate to 3.9 percent, a 30-year low; rising wages; and subdued inflation. **********But against a backdrop of a rapidly changing economy, Mr. Greenspan said, ''it is essential that we not be deluded into believing that we have somehow discovered the Rosetta stone of monetary policy.'' **********For one thing, economists get reams of data about old-line manufacturing activities but are still struggling to get good information about developments in the technology side of the economy, especially in fields like software development, the Fed chairman said. **********''So it is with some irony that just as we are adapting our old-economy models to the new realities, in drifts an apparition from the past -- a spike in oil prices that has potential implications for economic stability and for monetary policy,'' Mr. Greenspan said.

But American officials strongly deny that charge, saying they are simply acknowledging the reality of what Moscow might do in time of war. **********The launch on warning strategy is essentially this: if a defender detected a nuclear launch, it would send up its own missiles and warheads even before its enemy's could hit the ground. That way, a country would not be left defenseless by having its missiles destroyed while they were still sitting in their submarines and silos. **********Launch on warning was once seen as a way to reinforce the idea that all sides would lose in a nuclear exchange -- and thus deter one -- as modern arms became increasingly accurate. **********The problem, most experts on strategy say, is that it also puts nuclear war on a hair trigger. And it increases the risks of an accidental nuclear exchange because early warning systems are notoriously faulty. In 1995, for instance, the Russians misread the launching of an American weather rocket from Norway as a surprise nuclear attack. If not caught by vigilant humans, such false alerts can start an accidental exchange of nuclear missiles. **********Despite such dangers, the new American documents mention launch on warning in an approving context. They say it would help guarantee that the United States would not strike first in a disarming attack, even if it had a missile defense, which strategists, as well as the Russians, see as destabilizing because in theory it can give one side a protective advantage. **********A Russian policy of launch on warning would thus continue to insure that both sides would lose in any nuclear exchange. **********''It is highly unlikely,'' the documents said, that an enemy with a shield would ever attack Russia because Moscow could launch its missiles on warning of attack, ''which would neutralize the effectiveness of the assault.'' **********The documents also say Russia is keeping its nuclear forces on ''constant alert and apparently will do so'' well into the future. High states of alert are a prerequisite for a policy of launch on warning, but they too can add to the risks of accidental war. **********Critics of an missile defense system say statements like those in the American documents, coming in the context of reassuring Russia about its ability to penetrate any American shield, are encouraging risky strategies and undermining nuclear stability. ''The U.S. position should seek to reduce, not embrace, Russia's readiness to launch on warning,'' said Bruce Blair, president of the Center for Defense Information, a private Washington group. **********John D. Steinbruner, a nuclear expert at the University of Maryland, said the Clinton administration's tacit endorsement of Russian launch on warning was ''pretty bizarre'' because ''we know their warning system is full of holes.'' **********Experts agree that Russia's network of early warning radars, satellites and computers is decaying and increasingly prone to false alerts. **********Lisbeth Gronlund, a scientist at the Security Studies Program of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the documents show that the United States, in exchange for what she characterized as an unworkable antimissile dream, was willing to pay an absurd price: ''the continued threat of Russian unauthorized, accidental and erroneous launches.'' **********Instead, the critics say, Moscow should be encouraged to take its nuclear forces off alert and to disavow launch on warning, and Washington should do likewise. **********Federal officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, denied that the arms negotiators were blessing dangerous practices and said the critics were being naive. The references in the documents, they said, simply conceded military realities and what Russia might do in war. **********''It's not our job to say it's a bad thing,'' a senior official who works intimately with the Russians on military matters said of launch on warning. He said that Washington, eager to lessen the odds of accidental war, is actively working with Moscow to help Russia improve its early-warning systems. **********''We're into lowering the risk'' of war, the official said, ''not raising it.'' He added that in some cases that meant a nation would adopt arguments and strategies that might look risky, but over time would prove beneficial."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/15/world/workers-bid-ill-fated-chernobyl-a-bitter-farewell.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Wines", "pub_date": "2000-12-15", "snippet": "Workers at ill-fated Chernobyl nuclear complex in Ukraine gather to close down last working reactor, and bid bitter goodbye to their jobs as well; photo; map; Pres Leonid Kuchma lays wreath to memory of dead and dying of world's worst nuclear powe...", "word_count": 1186, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Workers Bid Ill-Fated Chernobyl a Bitter Farewell", "print_headline": "Workers Bid Ill-Fated Chernobyl a Bitter Farewell", "body_text": " **********Fourteen years and seven months after an experiment here went unimaginably awry, spewing the radiation of dozens of Hiroshimas across Europe, workers at the Chernobyl nuclear complex gathered today to bid the site's last working nuclear reactor -- and many of their jobs -- a bitter goodbye. **********Standing outdoors before a jet-black statue of Prometheus, the Greek of myth who stole fire from the gods, they watched President Leonid Kuchma lay a wreath in memory of the dead and dying of the world's worst nuclear power disaster and then assure them that they would not be forgotten, either. **********''I want you to know from me and the government that nobody will be ignored,'' Mr. Kuchma told workers in a brief speech. **********Many of them are nevertheless disbelieving. **********''We're hearing a lot of promises, but they're not backed up by finances,'' said Yevgeny Lobtsov, 43, an electrician who began working at Chernobyl two months after the accident. ''I don't know what will be done for my children now.'' **********On Friday, Mr. Kuchma will send an order from his presidential palace in Kiev to shut Unit 3, the lone remaining working part of the Chernobyl complex. **********That reactor is separated by only a wall from Unit 4, which exploded in a ball of flame and dust on April 26, 1986. **********Thirty-one workers died in the immediate aftermath of the blast. Thousands of Ukrainians have since died or contracted thyroid cancer or leukemia directly associated with the spread of radioactivity after the explosion. **********The shutdown order for Friday arrives after a decade of intense pressure by Western nations, led by the United States, that fear that the ancient Soviet-design reactor at Unit 3 is another Chernobyl disaster in waiting. **********But to Ukrainians, the principal effect of the command will be to begin a process already destined to lead within two years to the layoff of 2,200 of the plant's 5,600 operators and 3,000 support workers. **********Many additional workers are widely expected to be gone by 2008, when the last of the reactor's fuel is to be unloaded and what once was the world's mightiest atomic power station will officially become its biggest and most infamous nuclear graveyard. **********Ukrainians are no less horrified by the disaster than others. But they have a huge economic dependence on the complex -- and no small fear that closing the last reactor will remove their best lever to pry loose international aid vital to maintaining the site. **********The closing of Unit 3 will cut off 5 percent of the electricity supply in a nation already deeply in hock to Russia for natural gas and dogged by shortages in its shoddily run power grid. **********The closing will also gradually eliminate the jobs of thousands of Ukrainians whose work depends, directly or indirectly, on Chernobyl's continued operation as a power plant. Beyond the layoffs at the plant itself, thousands of Ukrainians provide goods or services to Chernobyl workers. **********Ukraine also faces immense costs in the future -- $750 million to cover the disaster site with a new dome-shaped sarcophagus, hundreds of additional millions of dollars to remove 180 tons of lethal melted fuel and steel from the damaged core of Unit 4 and to store it safely, millions to build a new heating system and other necessities for the crews that will permanently care for the idle reactor site and millions for solid and liquid waste-processing plants to handle the fuel from the closing of Unit 3. **********The wealthiest industrial nations have pledged much of the money needed to build the new dome and help construct other projects. But they have been reluctant to commit more money, given Ukraine's history of pervasive corruption and mismanagement since the Soviet collapse. **********One key to assuring the shutdown fell into place this month, when Ukraine obtained a $215 million international loan to complete the construction of two long-idled reactor sites that will make up for the loss of Unit 3. **********Mr. Kuchma sought to today to put a good face on the shutdown, traveling to the reactor to honor the dead workers and the Ukrainians sickened by radiation. **********Later, he spoke to workers in Slavutich, a trim city of 30,000 built in the late 1980's for Chernobyl workers who lost their houses in the disaster. **********In both places, he encountered signs of resistance. Some workers at Chernobyl signaled their opposition to the shutdown by wearing black ribbons on their jumpsuits. In Slavutich, knots of workers unfurled banners that called the shutdown a tragedy and declared, ''No!'' to the closing. **********Slavutich residents have been rewarded for their Chernobyl labors with far higher pay and more amenities than most Ukrainians, from more modern apartments to free cable television. The town's future is cast into doubt by closing the plant. **********In the dreams of Soviet planners, Chernobyl was to have been a mammoth array of eight reactors, a wellspring of cheap power for Ukraine and neighboring Belarus. The disaster changed that. **********Today, the unfinished hulk of a fifth reactor -- the last attempted -- sits a few hundred yards from the explosion site. The two other undamaged reactors, Units 1 and 2, were closed years ago. **********Officials have declared everything within 18 miles of the reactor an irradiated no man's land of decaying ghost towns and burial pits for thousands of bulldozers and trucks used in the cleanup and now too radioactive to touch. **********An extensive decontamination effort has rendered the reactor complex itself comparatively secure for workers and visitors, officials insist. **********''It's safe where we are,'' Sergei Saversky, deputy chief of the agency that manages the no man's land, said today. ''Just don't walk where you're not supposed to.'' **********In the ghost city of Pripyat about a mile from the disaster site, a city of 50,000 that the publicity-wary Soviets did not evacuate until 36 hours after the explosion, that means staying on streets blacktopped after the disaster and avoiding the grass. Most safe areas have been paved over or bulldozed, removing the top 40 inches of radioactive soil. **********In a Pripyat scene straight from the apocalyptic novel ''On the Beach,'' blocks of deserted apartment houses faced gardens grown wild and sidewalks cracked by sprouting weeds. Journalists who sought to visit a surreally silent amusement park, its yellow Ferris wheel parked dead still a few hundred yards away, were told that it was too dangerous. **********Although Geiger counter readings that flash around the reactor complex suggest that all is well -- the radiation exposure for visitors today was said to equal that of a two-hour airplane ride -- outside experts are skeptical. **********In particular, they say the hulking steel-and-concrete sarcophagus erected over the blown-apart Unit 4 -- 10,000 tons of material thrown together by remote-control cranes and helicopters -- may be rusting inside and is increasingly vulnerable to collapse. **********Hazards continue to pop up. Last month, a sweep detected a red-hot chunk of melted reactor core eight inches long atop the steel roof of the sarcophagus. How it arrived outside the reactor is unclear. Experts said they suspected that it was somehow spewed upward through the 250-foot smokestack in the initial explosion and went undetected until it fell from atop the stack a few weeks ago. **********Workers are studying how to remove the lethal piece of metal."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/21/business/gillette-earnings-drop-as-retailers-cut-orders.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "2000-04-21", "snippet": "Gillette Co says first-quarter earnings fell 4.1 percent, less than expected; company earned $258 million, compared with $269 million in year-earlier quarter; sales rose 5.5 percent, to $2.05 billion (M)", "word_count": 307, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Gillette Earnings Drop as Retailers Cut Orders", "print_headline": "Gillette Earnings Drop as Retailers Cut Orders", "body_text": " **********Gillette said yesterday that first-quarter earnings fell 4.1 percent, less than expected, as retailers in Europe and Latin America cut orders to clear out excess inventory. **********Gillette warned in October that profit would be hurt as mergers and improved inventory systems led to a surplus of goods in some retailers' warehouses.

How do I install new fonts on my computer? **********A. Adding type fonts to a PC or Macintosh can be very simple, depending on the type of font you want to load. Two common font formats are TrueType and Adobe's Type 1 Font, and you should know which kind of font you are installing. You can usually find that information  when you purchase and download the font from the Web or in the documentation from the vendor who sent your fonts on a CD or floppy disk. **********For Windows 98 systems, one way to load TrueType fonts is to go to the Start menu, then to Settings and Control Panel. Double-click on Fonts and pick Install New Font from the File menu. A box will pop up and ask you where the new fonts are, so navigate to the hard drive folder where you have copied the new fonts. Once you have located the fonts, click on them to add them to your system. (Hold down the Control key to select more than one font at a time.) If you can't see any fonts visible in the folder, go back to the Fonts control panel. Under File, select Fonts to add a check mark, then go back to Install New Font in the menu. **********You can also add most TrueType fonts by dragging them to the Fonts folder in your Windows folder. **********Adobe Type 1 fonts are a little trickier to deal with. Microsoft advises using a font-utility program called Adobe Type Manager to install the Type 1 fonts. There are versions of Adobe Type Manager Deluxe for both Windows and Macintosh, and more information is available at www.adobe.com/products /atm/main.html. The program is sometimes included with your font purchase and sometimes comes bundled with other graphics-related software. **********If you have a Macintosh, one way to add fonts is to close all open programs, then drag the new font files into the Fonts folder in your Mac's System Folder. It is not always necessary to restart the Mac after you make adjustments or add things to the System Folder, but it is a good idea. A TrueType font will generally have only one file to drag. Each Type 1 font usually has two files that need to be dragged to the System Folder:  one for the screen version and one for the printer. **********Trying to install a font in both TrueType and Type 1 formats can cause problems. A font utility program like Adobe Type Manager simplifies font installations and helps you avoid other font-related problems. Font manager programs will let you group fonts into sets that you might want to keep at hand for one project or another and can handle both TrueType and Type 1 fonts. Another program, Suitcase (www .extensis.com/suitcase), will also help you manage your fonts. Suitcase is currently available for only the Macintosh, but a Windows version is being developed. **********When installing fonts on either platform, be sure not to change the name of the font file. Having a large number of fonts installed can also slow your computer when it starts up because it has to load all the font files as it boots.

Any decision to deploy the antimissile shield now seems certain to pass out of President Clinton's hands to his successor's. **********Administration officials had previously said Mr. Clinton would decide this summer on deploying a $60 billion antimissile system that would be ready by 2005. To meet that schedule, the Pentagon has been under heavy pressure for two years to conduct enough flights to show Mr. Clinton and his advisers whether the system was technologically feasible. **********But now officials are signaling that Mr. Clinton merely plans to decide whether to go ahead with the program's initial development. The change follows events that include test failures, opposition from Russia as well as European allies and a legal dispute over how far the system could proceed before violating an important arms control treaty. **********To keep that option of initial development open for Mr. Clinton, the Pentagon has requested bids for initial construction of a radar site in Alaska, setting Sept. 7 as the deadline for technical and cost proposals from contractors. The first contracts would have to be awarded by December to permit building to begin next spring and to have a working system in place by 2005. Under the schedule the Pentagon has set in light of conditions in Alaska, it has to start the process soon, subject to later presidential approval. **********The more politically volatile decision of whether to field the system -- and break the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972 -- would be left to the next administration, whether that of Al Gore or George W. Bush. **********In a sign of this political evolution, senior military officers, including the program's executive officer, Maj. Gen. Willie Nance of the Army, have argued that there is now no reason to rush more tests. Critics of the program have consistently complained that the military was operating on an artificially fast schedule. **********''General Nance is not going to conduct a test unless he's fully confident that everything is fully ready for the test,'' said Lt. Col. Rick Lehner, a spokesman for the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization. **********Mr. Clinton is awaiting a recommendation from Defense Secretary William S. Cohen on the project, and the issue could come to a head as early as next week. Among the issues that Mr. Cohen is weighing are the costs of building the system, the building schedule and the need for more tests. This month, Mr. Cohen delayed his recommendation, primarily because of a dispute between the Pentagon and the State Department over how far work on the limited missile shield could proceed before the United States would be required to give notice that it was withdrawing from the A.B.M. Treaty. **********Russia has vigorously opposed changing the treaty to allow the United States to field even a limited defense, fearing that it would be prelude to a larger system that would undermine Moscow's long-range nuclear force. Mr. Cohen told the Senate Armed Services Committee last month that administration lawyers had reached a consensus that building the radar station on Shemya Island in the western Aleutians could continue until 2002 before the United States would be in violation. **********Policymakers at the State Department and the National Security Council oppose that interpretation, arguing that it is unilateral and sure to anger the Russians. **********Some diplomats doubt that the decision from Mr. Cohen or the White House would be issued next week, saying the administration would want to avoid a confrontation over missile defense during a United Nations gathering of world leaders. **********Mr. Cohen suggested this month that the next system test could slip, from October or November to December. But military officials said today that the date would probably fall into January. **********Pentagon experts are still analyzing why a high-speed interceptor that was supposed to have destroyed a dummy warhead on July 7 failed to separate from its booster rocket. Officials have attributed the cause to an error in the rocket's ''databus,'' equipment that transmits electrical signals to the warhead. **********In addition, the Kwajalein Atoll test range in the Marshall Islands is closed for much of December. Associates said General Nance was inclined to give his staff a breather after two years at a breakneck pace. **********Pentagon officials insist that the test program has enough built-in flexibility to absorb the delays. But the Defense Department's top test official, Phil Coyle, warned top Pentagon officials in a report on Aug. 11 that the system could not reach its goal of 2005 because testing was behind schedule and would not include realistic decoy targets for years. **********''A more aggressive testing program will be necessary to achieve an effective capability by 2005 or for even several years thereafter,'' Mr. Coyle said in an analysis first reported this week by Bloomberg News. **********A spokesman for the Pentagon, Rear Adm. Craig Quigley, said Mr. Coyle was ''supposed to be an independent voice, but that does not change our goal.'' **********''If directed to do so,'' the admiral said, ''we're shooting for 2005.'' **********Intelligence officials have warned that the United States could face a threat from some countries, including North Korea, by that date. **********Privately, though, some Pentagon officials are questioning the schedule in the light of test failures and delays in building a new booster rocket for the missile interceptors. **********''We have always admitted that this was a high-risk program, and part of being high risk is the deployment date,'' the chief Pentagon spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon, said this month. ''We will try our best, we have been trying our best, and we may meet the deployment date.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/16/business/private-sector-hero-of-versailles-it-s-new-york.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-04-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 169, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hero of Versailles?

MICROSOFT: THE OVERVIEW; U.S. JUDGE SAYS MICROSOFT VIOLATED ANTITRUST LAWS WITH PREDATORY BEHAVIOR", "body_text": " **********The Microsoft Corporation violated the nation's antitrust laws through predatory and anticompetitive behavior and kept ''an oppressive thumb on the scale of competitive fortune,'' a federal judge ruled today. **********The judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson of United States District Court, sided with the government on the most important points in its exhaustive antitrust suit, though he surprised lawyers on both sides by ruling for Microsoft in one area. [Excerpts, Page C14.] **********The Justice Department and the 19 states pressing the suit contended that Microsoft had hurt consumers by stifling competition in the software marketplace, particularly at the expense of the Netscape browser. Judge Jackson's findings of fact in the case, issued in November, overwhelmingly supported that view. **********Several experts said today's ruling, applying the antitrust laws to those findings, laid the foundation for a powerful remedy. That will be decided in a separate proceeding to begin within a few weeks. **********Options range from imposing restrictions on Microsoft's conduct to breaking up the company. Senior government officials close to the state and federal officers who are pursuing the case said many were interested in requesting a breakup, though no decision had been made. **********Microsoft made clear it was set for a long fight. Its chairman, William H. Gates, said, ''We believe we have a strong case on appeal.'' **********The ruling came just 48 hours after settlement talks collapsed. On Saturday a court-appointed mediator announced that despite four months of mediation and after consideration of almost 20 drafts of a settlement offer, the gulf between the two sides remained unbridgeable. **********Judge Jackson issued his judgment at 5 p.m., after the stock markets had closed. But reacting to the failure of the settlement talks and in anticipation of the judgment, Microsoft's stock plunged today, losing almost 14 percent of its value. That helped fuel a broad decline in the Nasdaq composite index, which fell 8 percent. [Page C13.] **********In his 43-page conclusions of law, Judge Jackson's final judgment on the evidence, the judge wrote that ''the court concludes that Microsoft maintained its monopoly power by anticompetitive means and attempted to monopolize the Web browser market,'' as well as ''unlawfully tying its Web browser to its operating system'' -- all in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. **********At the same time, the judge ruled that Microsoft's marketing arrangements with other companies to promote its Web browser at Netscape's expense did not have sufficient effect to violate the law. **********Microsoft seemed to take little solace from prevailing on that point. Mr. Gates did not even refer to that point when he announced that Microsoft would appeal. **********''This ruling turns on its head the reality that consumers know -- that our software has helped make PC's more accessible and more affordable to millions,'' Mr. Gates said. **********But Attorney General Janet Reno and other officials seemed delighted. **********''Microsoft has been held accountable for its illegal conduct by a court of law,'' the attorney general said. ''We are pleased that the court agreed with the department that Microsoft abused its monopoly power, that it violated the antitrust laws and that it harmed consumers.'' **********Tom Miller, the attorney general of Iowa, said, ''Judge Jackson's decision is a broad-based and compelling finding of liability, of law-breaking.'' Mr. Miller leads the efforts of the 19 states that are partners with the Justice Department in the case. **********And another plaintiff, Attorney General Richard A. Blumenthal of Connecticut, said the remedy should be ''as far reaching and fundamental as Microsoft's abuse of its monopoly power.'' **********The suit against Microsoft was filed almost two years ago. It accuses the company of using a monopoly in personal computer operating systems to stifle innovation and bully competitors. **********The trial opened in October 1998, and from the opening moments, the government presented a case that embarrassed and damaged Microsoft. Then, when the company offered its own case several months later, many of Microsoft's witnesses were humiliated on the stand. **********Testimony ended last spring. And when the judge issued his findings of fact in November, he found that Microsoft had ''demonstrated that it will use its prodigious market power and immense profits to harm any firm that insists on pursuing initiatives that could intensify competition against one of Microsoft's core products.'' **********With those findings, everyone involved with the case realized that his final judgment -- which would be called a verdict in a criminal case -- was likely to fall heavily against Microsoft, as it did today. **********Still, many lawyers were less certain that the judge would find the company in violation of the provision of the Sherman Act that bears on combining one product with another. **********A central conclusion in the government's case -- and in the judge's findings of fact -- was that Microsoft tied its Web browser to the Windows operating system to gain market share for its browser and put Netscape at a disadvantage. **********But a finding of fact does not necessarily lead to a similar conclusion of law, which says that the action violates antitrust laws. That is particularly so in this case because a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals, overturning an order by Judge Jackson requiring Microsoft to offer a version of Windows without the browser, decided 2 to 1 in 1998 that Microsoft had every right to tie the browser to the operating system, if the company could demonstrate a plausible consumer benefit. **********The Court of Appeals judges also suggested, however, that their opinion might change once they saw the evidence record from a trial. Judge Jackson devoted the largest section of his ruling to defending his judgment of liability on this count. **********The Court of Appeals opinion, he wrote, ''appears to immunize any product design (or at least software product design) from antitrust scrutiny, irrespective of its effect upon competition, if the software developer can postulate any 'plausible claim' of advantage to its arrangement of code.'' **********He cited several Supreme Court decisions that support his view and called them ''indisputably controlling.'' He concluded: ''Microsoft's decision to tie Internet Explorer to Windows cannot truly be explained as an attempt to benefit consumers and improve the efficiency of the software market generally, but rather as part of a larger campaign to quash innovation that threatened its monopoly position.'' **********On other counts, he ruled that Microsoft's campaign against Netscape, as well as its decision to develop its own version of the Java programming language and encourage other companies to use it instead of the authorized version, prevented Netscape and Java from competing on the merits. **********''Because Microsoft achieved this result through exclusionary acts that lacked procompetitive justification,'' the judge wrote, ''the court deems Microsoft's conduct the maintenance of monopoly power by anticompetitive means.'' **********He found in favor of Microsoft on the charge that the company had tried to block Netscape from the market by making exclusive agreements for its browser with computer companies, online services and Internet service providers. **********Judge Jackson wrote: ''The evidence does not support a finding that these agreements completely excluded Netscape from any constituent portion of the worldwide browser market,'' as the law requires for a finding of illegality. **********But the heavy weight of the ruling was against Microsoft, and it included some extraordinarily damning language in parts. **********''Microsoft's anticompetitive actions,'' he wrote, ''trammeled the competitive process through which the computer software industry generally stimulates innovation'' to ''the optimum benefit of consumers.'' **********Some experts said the ruling made it likely that the government would ask for a remedy that would break up the company. **********''It boxes them in,'' said Robert Litan, a former senior official in the Justice Department's antitrust division who dealt with the department's last suit against Microsoft, in 1994. **********In the mediation effort that ended on Saturday, ''Microsoft already made it clear that they would not accept a conduct remedy'' acceptable to the government, he said. And this suggests that, if one were imposed, the government might face difficult enforcement questions. **********''With this strong validation of the case, we now know that only a breakup will address the operating system monopoly'' that is at the heart of the case, Mr. Litan said. He is now with the Brookings Institution and has said he favors breaking up the company into several autonomous parts. **********This evening, representatives of both Microsoft and the government said they remained open to the idea of restarting settlement talks. But when the judge's decision was entered, Microsoft's options narrowed considerably. **********Judge Jackson's findings of fact in November gave plaintiffs' lawyers who were pursuing private suits against Microsoft useful ammunition for their cases. But the findings had only an ambiguous legal standing without the conclusions of law, entered today. **********One of Microsoft's strongest incentives for reaching a settlement before today was that it would have removed the threat of a legal ruling and vacated the findings of fact. But should the litigants reach a settlement in the weeks or months ahead, it is not at all clear that the decision, including its legal conclusion that Microsoft holds a monopoly in personal computer operating system, can be wiped from the records. **********''It's an interesting and unsure question,'' said Andrew I. Gavil, a professor of law at Howard University. ''There's no clear precedent for vacating a ruling after it has been issued.'' But even if Judge Jackson were to agree to vacate his ruling as a condition of a settlement agreement, Mr. Gavil noted that other judges might not feel bound by that. **********''Once the ruling is entered, you lose containment,'' he said. **********Mr. Gavil and other lawyers said they believed private suits against Microsoft would multiply. **********''It gives powerful new ammunition to lawyers pursuing class-action cases,'' said Stephen Houck, who was the chief lawyer for the 19 states that filed suit against Microsoft. He is now in private practice. Mr. Gavil added, ''I think we may well see a new wave of them.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/12/business/merrill-joins-wall-st-rush-to-keep-employees-happy.html": {"writer_name": "Patrick McGeehan", "pub_date": "2000-05-12", "snippet": "Merrill Lynch & Co joins rush of Wall Street firms offering new benefits and risk-free investment opportunities to attract young investment bankers and prevent others from defecting to Internet companies;

For Better or Worse, Wed to Olympic Rings", "print_headline": "BUSINESS; For Better or Worse, Wed to Olympic Rings", "body_text": " **********IT was the Olympic version of ''Say it ain't so, Joe.'' Disgusted by the bidding scandal emanating from Salt Lake City, which will host the 2002 Winter Games, David D'Alessandro, the chief executive of John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance, last year ordered the Olympic rings logo stripped from his company's television ads, its annual report, even its stationery -- all the nifty extras intended to help justify a four-year, $55 million sponsorship. **********With the 2000 Summer Games set to begin next week in Sydney, however, Mr. D'Alessandro has rediscovered the Olympic spirit. Not only have the five interlocked rings returned to John Hancock's documents and advertisements, but Mr. D'Alessandro even committed in February to paying an estimated $65 million to extend the company's sponsorship through 2004. **********No matter what happens on the track, in the pool or on the field, there may be no more dramatic comeback in 2000 than the one the International Olympic Committee has made on the sponsorship front. Committee officials boast of reforms like term limits and an independent ethics commission. But most sponsors and marketing experts instead attribute the turnaround to unique qualities that continue to insulate the Olympics, in commercial terms, from scandals and fee increases alike. **********Sponsorships are the key measure of the Games' financial health. Back in 1995, NBC locked up television rights through 2008, but almost all the marketing deals -- sold globally, and by individual host cities, national committees and even specific teams -- are cut and recut every four years. **********Because the Olympics forbid any commercial signs where the games take place  or on uniforms -- even the Goodyear blimp must cover its logo -- these sponsorships may be the most ephemeral in all of sports. All companies receive is an association with the Olympic movement and whatever they can milk out of it. **********That fact worried many people at the I.O.C. after 18 months of bad news. First were revelations of more than $1 million in cash payments, gifts and inducements surrounding Salt Lake City's bid; then the resignations or expulsions of 10 committee members; and, most recently, two criminal indictments of Utah organizers. **********But the Olympics have emerged stronger than ever financially. ''The negative fallout that you would have expected just didn't happen,'' said Lesa Ukman, editor of IEG Sponsorship Report, a newsletter published by the International Events Group, which monitors sponsorships for corporate clients. **********Ms. Ukman said she had expected the scandals to tarnish the Games, but, she added, ''nothing stuck.'' **********As in the rest of sports, the scoreboard tells the story. Eleven global sponsorships -- the deals exclusive to a business category that cover one cycle of Winter and Summer Games, as well as all 200 national Olympic committees and their teams -- should bring in $605 million for the four years leading up to the Sydney Games, compared with 10 deals worth $400 million for the period leading up to the 1996 Games in Atlanta, according to the International Events Group. Sponsorships cost $55 million now, compared with $40 million for the last cycle. **********More tellingly, 9 of the 11 global sponsors -- ''the Olympic Partners'' or ''TOP'' in committee parlance -- have committed to extending their relationships through 2004, when the Summer Games will be held in Athens. Add the Sema Group of Paris, which has already replaced I.B.M., a 40-year Olympic sponsor that is ending its relationship, after the Sydney Games, not over scandal but over disagreement about how to divide the high-tech category, and the estimated haul from global sponsors for the four years leading up to Athens is $650 million. They are paying $65 million each. **********WHEN it comes to one-time sponsorships, Games held in the United States draw the biggest amounts, usually from domestic companies, for local organizing committees. Atlanta brought in some $700 million, versus about $460 million for Sydney, according to the International Events Group. **********Despite the scandal in Salt Lake City, some 40 one-time sponsorships have been sold by organizers for the Games there, including eight-figure deals with Seiko, General Motors and Anheuser-Busch, which alone is expected to pay $50 million. The 40 deals are twice the number completed for the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano, Japan. **********So where is the outrage? ''What the Games are about is the athletes,'' not about anything that happened in Salt Lake City long before their arrival, said Michael Lynch, vice president for event and sponsorship marketing for Visa USA, an Olympic sponsor for 15 years. **********Visa USA was worried enough, however, to conduct focus groups and surveys, but found that consumers separated the actions of bureaucrats from those of the athletes -- and that they viewed sponsors as backing the athletes. **********Sponsors have concluded that the high costs are worth it, if only because no other event approaches its reach. People in 214 countries watched the Olympics at one time or another in 1996. In the United States, 87 percent of television households tuned in at some point, according to Nielsen Media Research. And I.O.C. officials estimate that 3.7 billion of the world's population of 6 billion will be watching this month. **********Neither of the other global sporting events -- World Cup soccer and Formula One auto racing -- draws audiences of that size, particularly in the United States. Both feature unabashedly professional players in unabashedly commercial settings, leaving the Olympics, even with its problems, on the highest plane of sport in many viewers' eyes. **********''We don't have another platform,'' said Mr. Lynch of Visa. **********Keeping this unique platform away from competitors also contributes to an inelastic demand for Olympic sponsorships. ''Fear drives this in part,'' said John Bevilaqua, who served as vice president for communications at the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles and now runs a sports consulting firm, Creative Marketing Strategies. ''They're caught in a box. They might not like the price, or endorse the scandals or problems, but they feel like they have to continue with this in order to keep their competitors out.'' **********Not that competitors can be removed completely. Ambush marketing was seen all over Atlanta in 1996, as nonsponsors filled the city's billboards and ran demonstration booths and vending outlets next to areas maintained for official sponsors. **********Richard Pound, vice president for marketing and sponsorships for the I.O.C., conceded that Atlanta was ''swallowed up in garishness'' and said that the committee had reacted accordingly. Urged on by the I.O.C., Sydney has restricted who can buy billboards, created a system to produce near-immediate cease-and-desist orders against interlopers and planned public relations counterstrikes against ambushers. **********Of course, while McDonald's might pay $55 million to be a global Olympic sponsor, there is nothing to stop another fast-food chain from buying an ad during NBC's coverage. And while Eastman Kodak is among the most loyal Olympic partners, Fuji Photo Film can say it sponsors USA Track and Field, which oversees the American men's and women's teams. **********At the end of the day, what sponsors receive from an official Olympic affiliation depends on how well they leverage it.  ''You're just buying a ticket to the dance,'' Mr. Bevilaqua said. ''You still have to rent the tuxedo and buy the corsage.'' **********Some sponsors, like Visa and McDonald's, report that the business surges from their Olympic efforts more than cover the fees. Other sponsors, like Samsung, bask in the company of better-known ones like I.B.M. and Xerox and can enhance their images  through association. Kodak, for one, uses the Games to show off new technology, like a Times Square billboard with digitized photographs of historic Olympic events, and to offer special contests that are tied to store  displays. Virtually all the companies entertain top clients at the Games, with 2,500 guests for Kodak alone, tapping into V.I.P. seats and hotel rooms reserved for them in Sydney. **********AND this year, the I.O.C. will introduce a new revenue stream. Four years ago, Unilever approached the committee about starting a line of high-performance personal care products like deodorant, shower gel and after-shave. A licensing deal was struck, and the product line, called Physio Sport, has undergone test-marketing  in Britain for the last two years. The committee gets a royalty from sales, rather than a fixed sponsorship payment. **********The I.O.C. could use such a licensing arrangement to develop its own products or as leverage against current sponsors who balk at higher fees. **********With over $1 billion in sponsorships on display in Sydney, however, the committee is mindful of who is on the team. When told by a reporter that the Physio Sport line sounded like a personal-hygiene version of Gatorade, Mr. Pound concurred, with one exception: ''Make it Powerade,'' he said -- a product of Coca-Cola, a sponsor."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/11/world/hafez-al-assad-who-turned-syria-into-a-power-in-the-middle-east-dies-at-69.html": {"writer_name": "Neil MacFarquhar", "pub_date": "2000-06-11", "snippet": "Hafez al-Assad, who ruled Syria for three decades, dies at age of 69;

He greets the owner, stocks up the Bimbo bread display, collects the money, drives another block and repeats the process. **********Grupo Bimbo is Mexico's largest baking company and the third biggest in the world, with sales of $3 billion last year and profits of $210.5 million. It has succeeded by lavishing attention on the smallest retailers in nearly every nook of Mexico for the last 55 years. **********In Mexico City, with a population of 18 million or more, there are twice as many Bimbo delivery trucks as city police cars. Nationally, the company's 17,250 trucks deliver to many areas that lack running water or plumbing. It now controls nearly 95 percent of Mexico's packaged-bread market. In the minds of many customers, Bimbo bread is as Mexican as a corn tortilla. **********Having conquered Mexico, Bimbo began looking abroad about seven years ago. It now sells bread, snacks and candy in almost every South American country, plans to buy a bakery in Brazil and has opened operations in Texas and California. **********Now, having brought white bread to Mexico, Bimbo wants a bigger slice of the market where white bread has long been a grocery-store fixture: its executives are preparing to spend billions on a major acquisition in the United States. **********In a way, Bimbo's aspirations north of the border represent a belated recognition of the Bimbo name -- a derivative of Bambi, which was a popular American cultural icon in Mexico when the company was founded. **********It is not clear whether Bimbo has the experience to succeed in such a large expansion outside of its own country. But in the United States, where the market for white bread is barely growing and where small bakeries are routinely gobbled by larger ones, Bimbo has made it clear that it will be predator, not prey. **********''We are always looking at opportunities to increase our presence in the Americas, where we are concentrating at the moment,'' said Daniel Servitje, Bimbo's president. ''We are open to looking into ways to strengthen our position in the United States.'' **********In 1993, Bimbo began buying bread bakers all over the Americas, including 4S Bakeries in California and Mrs. Baird's in Texas. In terms of size, Bimbo and its subsidiaries are the dominant players in most of the markets they have entered. But Bimbo executives have found difficulty in turning a profit outside of Mexico. **********THE company's Latin American operations, excluding Mexico, will have operating losses of about $7 million this year on sales of about $250 million, the third consecutive year of losses. In the United States market, Bimbo is only expecting to break even this year. **********''Their secret of success in Mexico has been market dominance,'' said Damian Fraser, an analyst at UBS Warburg in Mexico City.''They don't have that outside Mexico. They've already bitten off more than they can chew. If they expand further, it will only make it more difficult for them.'' **********Responding to rumors that Bimbo was preparing to buy a large bakery in the United States, Deutsche Bank published a report recently suggesting that any such decision would be a mistake. Its authors argued that Bimbo had become significantly bigger in the last three years, but not necessarily more profitable. They said it would be ''challenging for the Mexican company to gobble up such a large company in the U.S. at a time when it is still transitioning towards stability itself.'' **********Doubts about Bimbo's future expansion plans have not been lost on investors. The company's stock price has been in a general decline for more than a year. **********The skepticism partly reflects the decreased popularity of white bread in the United States. Once the choice of the upper class, white bread has lost favor with health-conscious consumers, making bread shelves a highly competitive space at groceries. But Bimbo says it has the ingredients to survive in the United States. **********Mr. Servitje countered every criticism aimed at his company, calling its poor performance in Latin America a result of strategic mistakes and a faltering economy, and attributing the drop in profits in the United States to a recent restructuring in California. Both markets, he predicted, will show earnings gains next year as Latin America continues to industrialize and its consumers turn to the convenience of packaged bread. **********While he acknowledged that the United States market is far different, Mr. Servitje said his company has strong brand recognition among Hispanic consumers. An estimated 20 million Mexicans and Mexican-Americans now live or work in the United States; in Mr. Servitje's opinion, that means 20 million consumers with memories of Bimbo bread on their breakfast tables at home in Mexico. In addition, the Latino food market is growing robustly, at around 6 percent a year. **********''What differentiates us from our competitors is that we are a Mexican-based company that will add products geared to Hispanic markets alongside Anglo products, or general market products,'' Mr. Servitje said. ''One strong difference of our company is that we do have a special interest in the Hispanic market, and we are providing more products geared toward that segment.'' **********Bimbo is already selling its bread and line of tortillas in Latino markets in the United States. Bimbo's wheat-flour tortilla, Tia Rosa, is the fastest-growing tortilla brand in the United States. **********BIMBO'S strategy, Mr. Servitje said, is to buy a company with an extensive, well-developed distribution system, to continue producing the acquired company's existing brands, and to use the distribution channels to promote its own products in Latino markets. **********''There's a greater recognition of Bimbo in the U.S. market,'' said Alberto Bercowsky, investor relations officer at the company. ''We've already gained the two largest Hispanic markets, in Texas and California, and we're planning on moving on.'' **********Mr. Bercowsky said Bimbo, which has $450 million to invest, is looking to buy one of the largest bakeries in the United States: Interstate Bakeries, the maker of Wonder bread and Hostess Twinkies; Earthgrains; Flowers Industries, which controls Keebler and Nature's Own (but recently agreed to sell its Keebler stake to Kellogg); or Bestfoods Baking, whose brands include Entenmann's and Oroweat. **********For months, securities analysts thought that Bimbo was planning to buy Interstate, the largest bakery in the United States, with a distribution system that reaches more than 90 percent of the population. Both companies denied that there had been talks, but Interstate's recent announcement of its 12th consecutive quarter of losses reinvigorated speculation that it could fall into Bimbo's hands. **********''Bimbo's desire to approach companies in the United States has continued to mature,'' Mr. Bercowsky said. ''But it's undecided which of the four it will be. At this point I'd say that Interstate would be an error.'' **********Whatever happens, Mr. Bercowsky said, ''Bimbo is taking an aggressive stance and is looking to acquire, instead of being acquired.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/28/business/technology-briefing-deals-agilent-to-aquire-objective-systems.html": {"writer_name": "Laurie Flynn", "pub_date": "2000-11-28", "snippet": "Agilent Technologies, leading maker of test and measurement devices, announces its purchase of Objective Systems Integrators, maker of communications services software, for $665 million (S)", "word_count": 82, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AGILENT TO AQUIRE OBJECTIVE SYSTEMS", "print_headline": "TECHNOLOGY BRIEFING: DEALS; AGILENT TO AQUIRE OBJECTIVE SYSTEMS", "body_text": " **********Agilent Technologies, a leading maker of test and measurement equipment that was once a division of Hewlett-Packard, said yesterday that it was purchasing Objective Systems Integrators for $665 million.

A precipitous withdrawal could plunge southern Lebanon into chaos. **********The hints could also be aimed at Syria -- to remind the Syrians, whose forces control Lebanon, that they are running out of time to resume peace talks before a withdrawal. Or they could be straightforward expressions of intention. But for the moment, Mr. Barak has indicated that he wants to conduct the withdrawal under the auspices of the United Nations, with full international support. And that would make it less likely that Israel could pull out before July, though still possible. **********United Nations officials already consider time very short to obtain Security Council approval for a plan, organize nations that would contribute peacekeeping forces and make practical arrangements by July 7. **********Israel has been grappling with United Nations requirements for the withdrawal that have provoked intense internal debate in the military and the government. The major issue is a United Nations demand that the Israel-backed South Lebanon Army be dismantled when the withdrawal takes place, and that its Khiam prison, assailed by international human rights groups, be shut down and its detainees released. **********Gen. Antoine Lahad, the commander of the South Lebanon Army, today asked the Lebanese government to grant blanket amnesty to his soliders, who are considered to be traitors and face harsh prison terms or death sentences. General Lahad has maintained that without pardons, his men will choose to stay and fight rather than to emigrate. **********An Israeli official said Israel might seek United Nations intervention on behalf of militia members,  suggesting that persuading Lebanon to revoke their sentences would make it easier to disarm them. **********The Israeli newspaper Maariv reported today that Israel was already scaling back its transfer of arms and ammunition to the South Lebanon Army and that it is considering collecting heavy armaments. **********While Israel expects that United Nations peacekeeping forces will help quell violence after the pullout, it is especially anxious for United Nations help during the withdrawal itself. The United Nations will be called on to certify that Israel has indeed withdrawn from Lebanese territory. That will be important for Israel, which is expected to assert, and seek international backing for its assertion, that the guerrillas can no longer legitimize violent attacks on its northern border. **********The certification will be conditioned on Israel's full withdrawal and its compliance with all demands. **********Mr. Barak showed his inclination to accede to international specifications when he quelled internal debate on two points. Military officials were pressing to keep some outposts directly over the border after the withdrawal, an idea that he, a former general, squelched. And he also quieted disgruntlement about letting an outside force delineate the border line to be used. **********Many Arab leaders are inclined to suspect that Israel will not comply fully. Egypt's foreign minister, Amr Moussa, expressed concerns today that the Israeli withdrawal would not be complete -- ''on land, sea and air.'' **********To determine whether Israel fully withdraws, United Nations officials will use a 1923, internationally recognized line between Israel and Lebanon, with mutually agreed upon amendments. Terje Roed-Larsen, a United Nations peace envoy who is in the region to make preparations for the withdrawal, said he had encountered ''no fundamental disagreement'' over this line. **********But the Lebanese prime minister, Selim al-Hoss, did tell Mr. Larsen that it considered a piece of territory on the edge of the Golan Heights to be Lebanese as well. That demand could cause problems, because if the border is disputed, then the completion of the withdrawal will be, too. **********''It's too early to tell if this is worrisome,'' a United Nations official said.

Fujimori's re-election, arrived in this desert city he was met by the headline in the local newspaper: ''Candidate Offers Tacna Nothing.'' When he toured downtown, Mr. Fujimori's supporters threw eggs and tomatoes at his campaign caravan while the local police stood by and smiled. **********It was a typical day on the campaign trail for Mr. Toledo, the director of a business school, whose challenge is so short on funds that the van transporting a brass band in his campaign caravan ran out of gas before it arrived for a rally in Tacna. **********''This is a David versus Goliath situation,'' Mr. Toledo said with a smile. **********There are actually eight Davids in the race against President Fujimori, hoping to deny him an outright victory in the April 9 vote and to force a runoff. Their low standing is in part explained by Mr. Fujimori's lasting popularity, particularly among Peru's large Indian population, whichcredits the president with defeating two terrorist groups and ending years of hyperinflation. **********But the opposition candidates have also had trouble gaining traction because, in their view and that of international election observers, they are competing on a tilted playing field. **********Mr. Fujimori's challengers are slandered and ridiculed nearly daily by the news media, over which Mr. Fujimori exerts considerable sway. They are followed by undercover police agents, and they dare not discuss campaign strategy on the telephone for fear that the lines are tapped. When they hold rallies in one village, government officials hand out food in a nearby village at the same time. **********''How can we compete when dead people are registered to vote?'' said Beatriz Merino, who is running on a ticket led by the Mayor of Lima, Alberto Andrade, referring to one of the few charges against Mr. Fujimori that has surfaced in the press. ''I'm a vice presidential candidate and only one cable television station will put me on the air -- and that was a month ago at 7 a.m. for 10 minutes.'' **********The Clinton administration, other Western governments and various private groups, like the Atlanta-based Carter Center, are raising daily criticisms of Mr. Fujimori's political methods -- threatening to isolate Peru internationally and weaken the president's ability to govern even if he does win. **********In a recent human rights report on Peru, the State Department charged that ''questions remain about the openness and fairness of the electoral process.'' **********The opposition's legal efforts to uphold the Constitutional ban on a third term for Mr. Fujimori have been squashed by a judiciary, congress and electoral tribunal dominated by the president's allies. **********Among the opposition candidates, Mr. Andrade is credited with cleaning up much of the urban blight in Lima's colonial center. Another, Luis Castaneda Lossio, a former Fujimori aide, is credited with fixing a bankrupt social security system. **********But their inability to unite or to come up with a credible campaign message has so far kept them from together amassing even 40 percent support in most opinion polls. The opposition candidates are already crying fraud, and several are holding private meetings to consider whether to unite their efforts or to withdraw from the race altogether. **********Daily character assassination in the news media, which Mr. Fujimori controls in several ways, has so far been highly effective at reducing the popularity of one opposition candidate after another. Several newspapers are controlled by his political allies or depend on government advertising, as do many television stations, which are subject to lawsuits to be decided by judges aligned with the president. **********The opposition received a rare boost last week when El Comercio, a newspaper read by the elite, published a story quoting witnesses who said that Mr. Fujimori's volunteers had forged one million signatures to put the president on the ballot. Jorge Santistevan, the widely respected independent ombudsman appointed by Congress, called for an investigation. **********But the election board refused to investigate. And several tabloid newspapers believed to receive instructions from Mr. Fujimori's intelligence service ran bold headlines accusing Mr. Santistevan and the owners of El Comercio of being communists. Channel 2, a leading television station, began showing interviews with analysts accusing Mr. Santistevan of purposely trying to destroy Peru's image. The word ''conspiracy'' flashed ominously across the screen. **********Mayor Andrade has been especially badly wounded by the news media attacks. His rallies have been broadcast on television in slow motion or at high speed to the theme song from the television comedy ''Gomer Pyle'' to make him look silly. **********The tabloid press has routinely made fun of Mr. Andrade's weight, nicknaming him ''porky.'' And they have published articles about other candidates, suggesting that they are in the habit of engaging in exotic sexual acts and shady financial deals. **********Opposition rallies are customarily interrupted by protests by Mr. Fujimori's supporters, whom his opponents accuse of being organized by the president's intelligence service. **********Mr. Castaneda, the former social security chief, became so annoyed about being subjected to surveillance that he personally seized a man last December who appeared to be following him and took the man into a police station under ''citizen's arrest.'' The man was subsequently identified as a member of the National Police, but Mr. Castaneda's response backfired when he found himself facing kidnapping charges. **********Mr. Fujimori belittled Mr. Castaneda's action as a publicity stunt, adding, ''There is no political persecution in Peru.'' **********Mr. Castaneda and Mr. Andrade have plunged in the polls, allowing Mr. Toledo to rise as the current best hope to contest Mr. Fujimori in the outside chance there is a second round. In one poll taken of 556 Lima voters last week, Mr. Fujimori won 42 percent to Mr. Toledo's 16 percent, a 9 point gain for the 54-year-old challenger from a comparable poll a month before. **********Analysts note that Mr. Fujimori emerged from single digits in just over two months to win the 1990 presidential election and that Peruvian politics can shift quickly and in unpredictable ways. Nevertheless, analysts say Mr. Fujimori will fall far short of his 1995 re-election total of nearly two-thirds of the vote, and it is doubtful that he will win control of congress again this year. **********Much of Mr. Toledo's appeal comes from his strong Indian appearance and modest upbringing by a father who was a bricklayer and a mother who was a street vendor of fish. He campaigns in a van dubbed ''the Cholomobile'' -- referring to Peruvian slang for a person of Indian blood. **********Aside from allegations that Mr. Fujimori is stealing the election, the campaign so far has been virtually devoid of issues. And some of the opponents have tried to fight fire with fire, raising the issue of Mr. Fujimori's Japanese ancestry. **********Mr. Toledo is not shy about sniping at Mr. Fujimori -- known popularly as ''El Chino'' for his Asian features -- for being of Japanese rather than traditional Peruvian heritage. **********''Any real Peruvian with Peruvian roots would prefer a job to a government handout,'' he told a crowd of several thousand people in Tacna. ''Millions of Peruvian mothers and fathers spend sleepless nights of Chinese torture wondering if they will be able to feed their children the next day.'' **********He smiled widely as his supporters responded with the chant: ''Cholo si, Chino no!''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/25/technology/when-the-internet-moves-faster-than-the-courts.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-02-25", "snippet": "February 25, 2000", "word_count": 1193, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "When the Internet Moves Faster Than the Courts", "print_headline": "When the Internet Moves Faster Than the Courts", "body_text": " **********February 25, 2000 **********By CARL S. KAPLAN When the Internet Moves Faster Than the Courts t is a bedrock principle of the legal world that a trial court sets down the crucial facts of a case and issues a ruling, leaving it up to an appeals court to look down from on high and determine whether any legal errors occurred at trial. **********That basic division of labor works well when the facts described by the trial court do not change very much. But what happens when a legal dispute involves the rapid-fire world of the Internet, where the factual landscape can change in an instant? **********Related Article **********Legal Squabbles in Path of Internet **********(December 9, 1999) Internet speed presents a major problem for senior judges handling Internet-related cases, argues Stuart M. Benjamin, associate professor at the University of San Diego Law School, in a provocative article on the subject that appeared in the Texas Law Review in December. **********Benjamin suggests that judges will find themselves in a sticky situation where the \"facts\" as nailed down by the trial court have become outdated by the time the case lands on the marble doorstep of a federal appeals court, or even the Supreme Court. **********\"In the context of technology cases, the factual landscape changes rapidly and continually,\" Benjamin said in an interview. **********\"Some people might say, 'Well, we don't care if the facts have changed. We want the Supreme Court and Courts of Appeal to make pronouncements of law,'\" he said. But important legal decisions based on stale facts do a disservice to both parties in a dispute, he added. **********Indeed, the Internet's challenge to the entire appellate process is profound, Benjamin said. That is because the idea of appellate decisions as enduring legal precedents may be called into question, since judicial opinions of appellate courts in certain technology cases \"are written in sand,\" Benjamin wrote in his article, \"Stepping into the Same River Twice; Rapidly Changing Facts and the Appellate Process.\" **********Benjamin, 34, who teaches telecommunications law, administrative law and constitutional law, first became interested in this problem when he clerked for Justice Souter at the Supreme Court in 1995 and 1996 -- a time when the most famous Internet case, Reno v. ACLU, was making its way through the federal judicial process. Eventually, in June 1997, the Supreme Court in that case struck down parts of a federal statute that sought to regulate Internet indecency. **********What caught Benjamin's eye was the gap of about a year between the district court's ruling in the Reno case and the Supreme Court ruling. In that interval, key facts about the Internet had changed, he said. **********The Internet's challenge to the entire appellate process is profound. **********Take the issue of age verification systems. In hearings before the district court, the American Civil Liberties Union successfully argued that it was commercially impractical for some Web site owners to use age verification systems to keep children out of indecent sites. Accordingly, the challenged law, which offered a \"safe harbor\" for site owners using screening systems, was problematic. But Benjamin said that by the time the Supreme Court got the case, age verification systems had advanced so much that they could be cheaply and efficiently employed by most all Web site owners. **********Another rapidly changing fact in the Reno case, he said, concerned electronic mailing lists and chat rooms. The district court found that those Internet services were not part of the Web, and thus could not be secured with age verification systems. But by 1997, discussion groups and chat rooms had mushroomed on the Web. **********Benjamin added that it is not hard to foresee a similar problem in the Microsoft antitrust case. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who has already issued his findings of fact, is expected to issue his conclusions of law in the next few weeks, and will eventually rule on what actions should be taken. Benjamin reckons that if the case is appealed, the earliest date for a Supreme Court decision is 2002. **********Plenty could happen in the intervening period. One key fact in Judge Jackson's findings was that Microsoft used its monopoly position in operating systems to solidify its dominance and extend it to other areas, notably the Internet browser market. A critical element of this conclusion is that browsers and operating systems have separate functions. But it is likely that the degree of integration between operating systems and browsers will change dramatically in the next year or so, Benjamin said. **********\"Judge Jackson called them separate products. But it may no longer be meaningful to call them separate products,\" Benjamin said. If that is true, it will be harder to say that Microsoft is practicing improper leveraging, and it might also undercut the rationale for a substantial remedy, like a breakup of the company. **********Benjamin admitted that there is always a tension in the law concerning changing facts. Normally, he said, it is no big deal for a higher court to \"remand\" or send back down a case to a trial court for further fact-finding in light of new circumstances. But because technology and Internet facts tend to change continually, remands are not a great option. A case could be caught in \"an infinite loop\" of remands, he said. **********The best of the unappetizing array of options, Benjamin said, is for the appellate court to \"update\" the facts on its own, if necessary. It could do this by requiring the parties to file extra briefs and exhibits, or it could even hold evidentiary hearings or send the case off for a quick update by a special master. Appellate courts say they do not like to dirty their hands with fact-finding, but it may become necessary in the Internet Age, Benjamin said. And anyway, they do it on some occasions without drawing much attention to it. **********Eugene Volokh, who teaches Internet law at the law school of the University of California at Los Angeles, said Benjamin had put his finger on \"a potential problem\" in the appellate process. \"How big of a potential problem is hard to tell,\" he said. Benjamin's idea of having appeals courts update facts \"is quite plausible, but the devil is in the details,\" he said. **********Internet links of interest to Cyber Law Journal readers **********Barry Steinhardt, associate director of the ACLU, said there may be some truth to Benjamin's argument in the area of economic regulation, because industries can change rapidly. But he was skeptical that facts could outpace appellate review in key First Amendment cases. **********\"The Bill of Rights doesn't change,\" he said. \"In the Reno case, I don't think the facts there have changed very much, even as the technology has been evolving. The fact is, it's still not practical for small, non-commercial content providers on the net to verify the age or other important characteristics of consumers without incurring enormous expenses.\" **********CYBER LAW JOURNAL is published weekly, on Fridays.

Studies have shown the drug could be one of the most potent heart medications on the market. And, in January, regulators at the Food and Drug Administration put the drug on a fast track for approval, saying they thought it was a significant advance over similar drugs. **********The company said yesterday that it planned to continue clinical trials with the drug and expected to resubmit its application for approval early next year. **********''We remain bullish on this drug,'' said Richard J. Lane, president of the company's worldwide medicines group. **********But with yesterday's decision, initial sales of Vanlev will be delayed at least a year. The company's move was another blow to Bristol-Myers, which is also in danger of soon losing its exclusive patent on Taxol, its top-selling cancer drug, after losing a recent court decision. **********Shares of Bristol-Myers plummeted after the announcement, falling $14.625, or 22 percent, to $50.625. **********Company executives said that F.D.A. regulators were concerned about patients in clinical trials who developed a rare side effect called angioedema, which is swelling in the face, throat, lips or tongue. In a conference call yesterday afternoon, company officials said that 44 of 7,000 patients in clinical trials had developed angioedema, but only four of those cases were severe. In those cases, the patients needed to have a tube inserted in their throats to breathe. All four survived, the company said. **********Vanlev was expected to be the first drug approved in a new class of blood pressure drugs known as vasopeptidase inhibitors. **********The drug, known chemically as omapatrilat, has been shown in studies to be more effective than existing drugs in lowering systolic blood pressure, the first and larger of the two numbers obtained when blood pressure is measured. Systolic is the pressure in the arteries when the heart contracts, while diastolic is the pressure when the heart is relaxed. **********Ideal blood pressure is less than 140 over 90. **********Doctors also hope that Vanlev could help black patients, who do not respond as well as white patients to blood pressure drugs now on the market. **********''I'm disappointed that I won't have the drug to use this year,'' said Dr. Henry R. Black, chairman of preventive medicine at Rush-Presbyterian St. Luke's Medical Center in Chicago. ''But if there are safety concerns, they need to be addressed.'' Dr. Black is a consultant to Bristol-Myers Squibb. **********The delay of Vanlev is a life for the company's competitor, Pfizer. Pfizer makes Norvasc, which is now the top-selling hypertension drug. Norvasc had sales last year of more than $3 billion. **********Last year, Bristol-Myers cited studies that found that Vanlev was more effective than Norvasc and Zestril, another blood pressure drug sold by AstraZeneca. **********Bristol-Myers was counting on sales of Vanlev to replace any revenue it may lose from some of its other drugs that will soon lose their patent protection. Bristol-Myers is trying to block a group of drug companies from marketing a generic form of Taxol, which is used to treat breast, ovarian and lung cancers. **********Last month, the Ivax Corporation said it expected to win government approval of its version of Taxol within months.

MICROSOFT; Gates's Statement: The First Day of the Rest of the Case", "body_text": " **********Following is a transcript of the opening statement by William H. Gates, Microsoft's chairman, at a news conference yesterday in Redmond, Wash., as recorded by The New York Times: **********I'm reminded of the old saying that today is the first day of the rest of your life. I believe very strongly that today is the first day of the rest of this case. **********The central issue here is a disagreement between ourselves and the Department of Justice over whether we should have been allowed to support the Internet inside Microsoft Windows. Our inclusion of that support in an integrated way did nothing to exclude Netscape or any other competitor from distributing and improving their technology. In fact, as the court found, Netscape distributed over 160 million copies of its browser in 1998 alone. **********The government's position here on the specific of the browser and on the general question of improving products really flies in the face of the kind of improvements that have benefited consumers from innovation coming out of the technology industry. So today's ruling really represents an unwarranted and unjustified intrusion into the software marketplace, a marketplace that has been an engine of economic growth for America. This ruling would provide that the Internet support in Windows could never be enhanced, it could never be updated to new standards whether they relate to privacy or XML or any other consumer needs. This ruling says to creators of intellectual property that the government can take away what you created if it turns out to be too popular. **********We will be exercising our right to appeal this decision, and we're confident the judicial system will overturn today's ruling. We will also seek a stay of this order so the appeal can move forward without any unnecessary harm to Microsoft and to consumers through the delay or interference with our work on new products. **********I want to make it clear that the Microsoft team worked very hard to try and settle the issues in this case without the need for additional litigation. I also want to make sure that people understand that during the appeal we'll continue to do what we do best, which is building new software. We have many reasons to be confident in our appeal. For example, the ruling is directly inconsistent, as the district court acknowledges, with the appeals court ruling on exactly this topic that was made earlier. **********Also, it's an unreasonable thing to call to break up Microsoft and create these regulatory provisions about how software should be defined. I also think if you just step back from this and look at the paradigm shifts taking place today and the very intense competition in our business, what's being said today flies in the face of the innovation and low prices that consumers are seeing every day, low prices that really arise out of the PC industry and the values that we brought as one of the companies that really fostered the entire PC phenomenon. **********So we have strong legal, factual and procedural arguments. The court adopted the government's plan to break up and regulate Microsoft without a single day of testimony. Microsoft asked for a reasonable opportunity to respond to the government's unprecedented plan, but we were denied that right. **********Here at Microsoft we've assembled a world-class team. For 25 years, that team has brought widespread benefits to the economy and to consumers. We have very exciting plans for that team including things like a breakthrough user interface that involves handwriting and speech recognition. These are efforts that can only be done by a large company with a total focus on taking its R&D and moving those into products. Keeping our team together as one Microsoft is critical to our efforts. **********The values that have guided our efforts throughout our entire history include competing hard, but competing fairly; listening to customers and innovating to meet their needs; and partnering with literally thousands of companies in the hardware, software and services businesses to make our vision of low-cost computing a reality and a reality that has moved forward faster than any sector of the economy. We've got a lot of great new ideas and great new products we're working on for the months and years ahead. In particular we're very excited about the vision of a next generation of services delivered through the Internet. The Internet, as powerful as it is today, can be made easier and far more effective for both consumers and businesses. **********We recognize that as an industry leader we have grave responsibilities in working inside our business. And we accept that. While we disagree with the government on this specific issue, I want to make clear that we respect the role of government and our legal and economic system. And we will, of course, abide by any final judgments reached in this case. We continue to work on a very positive basis with federal and state officials. In fact, just yesterday I was in Washington, D.C., discussing with a great number of legislators issues like improving technology in education, bridging the digital divide and important legislation like that upcoming digital signature bill. **********So in conclusion, today is the start of a new phase of this case, a phase where we'll get review by a higher court. We're confident that the courts will overturn what's happened at the district level. And as the legal team works to resolve this, we're going to focus our energy on building great software for all our customers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/23/world/study-finds-violence-against-journalists-increasing-worldwide.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-03-23", "snippet": "Committee to Protect Journalists issues report on growing number of attacks against press; finds violence against journalists increased last year, as combatants around world increasingly focused on reporters as unwelcome witnesses to war crimes an...", "word_count": 515, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Study Finds Violence Against Journalists Increasing Worldwide", "print_headline": "Study Finds Violence Against Journalists Increasing Worldwide", "body_text": " **********Violence against journalists increased last year, as combatants around the world increasingly focused on reporters as unwelcome witnesses to war crimes and other abuses, a group that advocates press freedom said today. **********Thirty-four journalists were killed in 1999, 10 more than documented in 1998, the group, the Committee to Protect Journalists, wrote in a report on attacks against the press.

Two journalists were killed, and dozens were attacked by militias opposed to East Timorese independence from Indonesia, the report said. **********''In the last few years, government and antigovernment groups alike are trying to directly influence news coverage by attacking journalists,'' the vice chairman of the committee, Terry Anderson, said. **********Mr. Anderson is a former reporter for The Associated Press who was held hostage for 2,454 days in Lebanon by Islamic militants before being freed in December 1991. **********The report found fewer journalists in jail last year than in previous years.

''We do see the Internet as a very exciting tool for press freedom,'' the executive director, Ann K. Cooper, said. **********Aside from killing or imprisoning journalists, repressive governments are adopting subtler tactics, said the committee, which has headquarters in New York City.

Previously, Mrs. Teagarden, who is legally blind, had had the ballot read to her as she made her choices. **********''It sounds silly, but it made the hair on the back of my neck stand up,'' she said, describing her first private vote. ''I didn't realize what a privilege it is to have that right to privacy.'' **********The eSlate system is one of several aids for the disabled that are being tested this year in some states. The eSlate, developed by Hart InterCivic of Austin, Tex., is being used in Tarrant County, where Mrs. Teagarden lives. It is also being tried in another county, which includes parts of Houston, and in two counties in Colorado. The machines have been in use since early voting began in these jurisdictions. (Early voting is available to all registered voters in 13 states. The option, which dates to 1988, is intended to increase turnout.) **********An eSlate is a tablet-size computer with a large display screen and large buttons for scrolling through ballot choices and recording votes, which are stored in memory for later downloading. **********The eSlate can be used by anyone, but because it can sit on a tabletop or be held in the hands, it is especially useful for people in wheelchairs. For the blind or visually impaired, an add-on speech synthesizer is used. The machines cost about $2,500 each, and the synthesizer is another $1,000. **********In California, voters in some jurisdictions are using an electronic system developed by another Texas company, Global Election Systems, that has been adapted for use by the blind. And blind voters in Rhode Island and Nevada will have audio services available when they cast their votes on Election Day. **********Eight counties in California are experimenting with early voting this year and are also testing electronic voting machines made by Global Election Systems of McKinney, Tex., in some precincts. The AccuVote-TS has a touch screen and a 12-key pad, like a push-button telephone's, that can be adapted for audio use with a headset and be used by the blind. **********''We found that blind people are familiar with the phone pad, even more than they are with reading Braille,'' said Larry Ensminger, vice president for business development at Global Election Systems. **********Curtis Chong, technology director of the National Federation of the Blind in Baltimore, said the eSlate is the machine favored by his organization and many blind people like himself who have tested it along with other machines. **********''ESlate is one of the first systems that is being marketed as a viable, real product you can buy today,'' Mr. Chong said. ''Other machines had weaknesses like touch screens that could not verify if you had marked the right place on the ballot. With e-Slate you can hear it click as it rolls through the settings.'' **********In Baltimore, where Mr. Chong votes, blind voters can use the services of a human reader or a partial Braille ballot. Mr. Chong said it is difficult to ignore voice inflections of readers -- whether a friend, a spouse or an elections judge -- while making ballot decisions. **********The eSlate ''cuts across every demographic because of its ease of use,'' said Neil McClure, vice president of the election solutions group at Hart InterCivic in Colorado. **********''It's like a laptop,'' Mr. McClure said, ''but you don't have to know how to use a computer. People are saying it's easy and even fun to use.'' **********In Texas, legislation was signed last year requiring all ballot equipment to be accessible by the disabled, and lever machines and punch card technology can no longer be purchased (most are no longer manufactured). The use, design and purchase of voting systems is usually governed by the secretary of state and done on a county by county basis. **********''This is the next generation of voting equipment technology that is becoming available as computerized systems become more efficient and less expensive,'' said Jerry Meadows, senior vice president of the election solutions group at Hart InterCivic. **********According to the Disability Statistics Center in San Francisco, there are more than 30 million disabled Americans of voting age. The National Federation of the Blind estimates that 1.1 million of those voters are blind or visually impaired. **********John Novotny, 43, of Breckenridge, Colo., is one of a handful of disabled voters in Summit County, which is also testing the eSlate system.

But a State Department official said this evening that American unhappiness with Cuba did not prompt the United States to bar Ricardo Alarcon, the president of the Cuban National Assembly, from attending the session at the United Nations. **********Cuba's treatment of people who want to leave the country is ''beyond misguided'' and constitutes flagrant human-rights violations, the department official, Peter Romero, said. **********Mr. Romero, an assistant secretary of state who specializes in Latin American affairs, said Cuba's oppressive Communist regime and the country's policies toward migration had separated families and had impelled some people to try perilous ocean crossings to the United States, resulting in numerous deaths. **********He said that, when not denying exit permits outright, Cuba has charged as much as $600 for an adult permit and $200 for a child's permit -- sums beyond the reach of most Cubans. **********In recent months, Mr. Romero said, Cuba has repeatedly failed to live up to a 1994 agreement that supposedly provided for the orderly migration of 20,000 Cubans plus their relatives to the United States. Moreover, he said, Cuban officials have refused even to discuss American complaints seriously. **********''We're hoping this note does the trick,'' Mr. Romero said. But he said the denial of a visa to Mr. Alarcon, a former Cuban foreign minister and onetime representative to the United Nations, was not done in retaliation. Mr. Romero said the meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary Union this week was not even sponsored by the United Nations, even though the group is meeting there. **********Mr. Alarcon was among the most prominent backers of the Cuban relatives of Elian Gonzales, the child who was found floating on an inner tube in the ocean last November after his mother and several other people drowned. The boy was returned to Cuba after a prolonged struggle marked by international recriminations and American politics. **********Earlier today, Philip Reeker, a State Department spokesman, said that for privacy reasons, the department does not discuss visa applications or denials. **********Roberto Garcia, an official of the Cuban diplomatic mission in Washington, said today that the United States' ''criminal, immoral and discriminatory'' policy was causing suffering, both on land and on the ocean, by tempting Cubans to try to reach the United States in hopes of being treated better than refugees from other Latin American countries."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/21/world/israel-strikes-back-after-a-school-bus-is-bombed.html": {"writer_name": "Deborah Sontag", "pub_date": "2000-11-21", "snippet": "Powerful roadside bomb rips apart armored school bus filled with Israeli pupils in Gaza Strip, killing two adults and dismembering several children; heavy-caliber mortar shell encased in metal is detonated by remote control as army-escorted bus dr...", "word_count": 1485, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Israel Strikes Back After a School Bus Is Bombed", "print_headline": "Israel Strikes Back After a School Bus Is Bombed", "body_text": " **********A powerful roadside bomb ripped apart an armored school bus used by settlers' children this morning, instantly killing a teacher and a maintenance man and dismembering several young children. **********Tonight, in its most extensive air strikes yet, Israel bombarded military, police and media targets throughout Gaza in retaliation. The rocket attacks killed one Palestinian and critically wounded another, plunged much of Gaza City into darkness and sent ripples of panic through the densely populated area. **********The seven-week-old cycle of violence, which had been interrupted by a relative lull over the weekend, resumed once more, with a vengeance. **********It began early today when a heavy-caliber mortar shell, encased in metal to be especially deadly, was exploded by remote control just as the army-escorted school bus rolled by. The bus was shuttling elementary school pupils from one settlement to another in the Palestinian-ruled Gaza Strip, where the fortress-like Israeli enclaves, some of which occupy prime beachfront property, have met with profound antagonism and recently a spate of violent attacks. **********An Israeli Army medic who boarded the bus right after the explosion said he had encountered a tangle of severed limbs and slid on a blood-slicked floor. Cpl. Yaniv Pitz said he had evacuated the five most severely wounded children, all of whom were missing limbs or parts of limbs, and then took them two at a time into the shelter of his army base. **********''A fighter learns how to give first aid to other fighters, not to little children,'' Corporal Pitz said in an interview a couple of hours later, wearing a camouflage-netted helmet as he descended from his caged guard post. ''A fighter is not trained to face a little girl whose legs and hands have been blown off.'' **********The bus attack came at the end of three days of declining violence in the West Bank and Gaza. Both Israelis and Palestinians had broached the idea that the violence had already reached its apex, preparing the way for a return to negotiations. Such talk disappeared quickly today. **********''This morning, we opened the roads to Palestinian traffic under the assumption that we were in a stage of lull,'' said Brig. Gen. Yair Naveh, commander of the Israeli Army's Gaza division. ''Unfortunately, we are not in a lull; we are in a war.'' **********As in years past, just as diplomatic efforts were increasing, a terror attack succeeded, temporarily at least, in scuttling closed-door conversations about how to find a way back to the peace table. By early tonight, Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, was placing calls to Arab leaders, asking them for support in the ''war'' that Israel had declared. **********Placing blame for the terror attack on Mr. Arafat's Fatah organization, Israel began shelling targets throughout Gaza after night fell. **********Helicopter gunships reportedly devastated the headquarters of the Palestinian preventive security forces, and dropped missiles on Fatah party offices and headquarters of  the Palestinian police, the navy and the presidential security forces. They also struck a Palestinian government television station. **********''God is great, we are being shelled,'' an anchorwoman, wearing a long, traditional embroidered dress, said on the satellite station. ''Save us, Arab nations. Our people are being killed. Save us.'' **********Unlike its notifications before previous air assaults, Israel did not explicitly warn the Palestinians so that specific buildings could be evacuated. But the Palestinians anticipated retaliatory attacks, and they cleared out predictable target sites, and schools and offices closed early. Scores of Palestinians were treated for slight and moderate wounds at Gaza hospital. **********The Palestinian Authority and Fatah denied any connection to the morning's bombing. The Palestinian government said it was opening an investigation into the attack and hinted that it held Islamic groups responsible. Three little-known groups all laid claim to the bombing. **********''We are not responsible for this attack,'' Nabil Aburdeineh, a senior aide to Mr. Arafat, said in an interview. ''We are against any attack that targets civilians on either side.'' **********But the Israelis unequivocally blamed Mr. Arafat's organization for what Nahman Shai, the government spokesman, labeled an attack against ''a symbol of innocence,'' a school bus. **********Prime Minister Ehud Barak also blamed Fatah for a Palestinian security officer's attack on Israeli soldiers guarding the greenhouses outside Kfar Darom over the weekend. One soldier died on Saturday, and a second died tonight of his wounds. The Palestinian officer was killed when his fire was returned. **********Israeli officials offered differing views on whether Mr. Arafat himself was implicated in the bombing. ''We have no doubt, directly or indirectly, that Arafat was there,'' Mr. Shai said. But Ephraim Sneh, the deputy defense minister, said, ''I do not connect him directly, and I do not hold him personally responsible.'' **********Across the political spectrum, Israelis recoiled at the school bus bombing, and even those who did not call for retaliation said they understood why others did. ''The terror attack against a bus full of children is in my opinion the gravest incident to have ever transpired in our relationship with the Palestinian Authority,'' said Dalia Itzik, the environment minister. ''Even a moderate like me, who has called to act wisely and not to act in a heavy-handed manner,'' she continued, ''I understand that we are probably going to have to take further measures.'' **********In addition to conducting the extensive air strikes, Israel pledged to impose tougher economic sanctions on the Palestinians and to tighten the blockade of Palestinian cities. The Israeli government also released a document alleging Palestinian violations of previous agreements. **********Some Israeli ministers lamented the turnabout. **********''If the trend of a reduction in violence had continued, I think that in anticipation of Ramadan, we would have contemplated taking certain steps toward openness,'' Shlomo Ben-Ami, Israel's foreign minister, said, referring to the monthlong Muslim holiday that begins next week. ''This difficult incident ruins that feeling and makes our desire for openness and reconciliation problematic. But still this trend has to be preserved. We have to think about the day after.'' **********In today's attack, three of the severely wounded children were siblings, aged 7, 8 and 12. Their 10-year-old brother, disorganized that morning, had missed the bus, where the others took seats in the front, behind Miriam Amitai, the teacher, and Gavriel Biton, the maintenance man. **********Speaking from a hospital in Beersheva, Noga Cohen, their mother, said she had first been called and told that one daughter was wounded. ''I thought to myself, O.K., I have to deal with this,'' she said. ''Then they suddenly tell me that almost all of my children were injured. I think I haven't yet comprehended it.'' **********Corporal Pitz said he had collected Ms. Amitai's body parts in a black sack so that she could be buried. Her funeral took place in the late afternoon in Ofra, a West Bank settlement. Mr. Biton was buried in his hometown, Yeruham. **********Outside Kfar Darom, Ms. Amitai's students flocked to the bus all day, crying beside it. It sat on the side of the road, with gaping holes and shattered bullet-proof windows. Settlers, railing against the government for not doing enough to protect them, placed a hastily written sign under its windshield: ''Prime minister with blood on his hands.'' **********As they waited for a visit from Mr. Barak that never materialized, many Gaza settlers flocked to an Israeli Army base near the Neve Dekalim settlement to protest. Three schoolgirls got down on their knees to hold a sign that said, ''Our bodies have no legs.'' **********Alongside the route that the bus took, the Israeli Army bulldozed fields of eucalyptus trees and fruit orchards so that there would be no place to hide. Settlers prayed in the middle of a major north-south Gaza road. They laid their machine guns by their feet, and swayed as hundreds of Palestinians gathered to watch on both sides of roadblocks that cut the principal traffic artery. Dozens of heavily armed Israeli soldiers, manning jeeps or atop sand bags, encircled the prayer session. **********It has long been assumed that the settlements in the Gaza Strip would be evacuated as part of a final peace deal with the Palestinians. In the last week, several prominent Israelis and Israeli peace groups have called for the government to shut down some of them now. The recent violence, they claimed, has shown the Gaza settlements, in particular, to be indefensible points of friction. Israeli soldiers, they said, should not risk their lives to defend them, and the settlers themselves should not endanger their children by living there. **********But the settlers themselves have no question that what they are doing is right and is their right. They compare themselves to the Zionist pioneers, and say that if they allow themselves to be chased out of Gaza, the Palestinians will move on to claim the rest of Israel. **********''We're scared, and every day we daven,'' or pray, said Leora Koenigsburg, who has two small children. ''But that doesn't mean we're going to be chicken. We were given permits to live here by the Israeli government. If we leave, the Arabs will push for the next place and the next place.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/19/business/patents-patent-office-fighting-once-again-hold-onto-its-own-revenue-budget.html": {"writer_name": "Sabra Chartrand", "pub_date": "2000-06-19", "snippet": "Patent and Trademark Office battles House subcommittee proposal to keep its budget flat and divert any office revenue above $905 million to other agencies; warns of increased delays in patent processing and approval; proposal comes as office gears...", "word_count": 1049, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The patent office is fighting once again to hold onto its own revenue in the budget battle.", "print_headline": "PATENTS; The patent office is fighting once again to hold onto its own revenue in the budget battle.", "body_text": " **********LONG considered a small, backwater agency, the Patent and Trademark Office has found itself in recent years at the forefront of the new, high-technology economy. Its leaders are happy with the recognition, but they say to hold that place and improve their performance, they need only one thing from the rest of the federal government: to keep all the money the office earns. **********In a letter this month to Congress, the White House made the case for dozens of programs it wants financed in this year's appropriations bill, among them the patents office. But last week, the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State and the Judiciary proposed appropriating $905 million for the patent office, a raise that the subcommittee says includes only an adjustment for inflation, and diverting any patent office revenue above the new level to other agencies. **********The director of the patent office has responded that diverting that money would deny his agency 25 percent of its self-projected revenue, or $295 million, causing hiring freezes and increased delays in patent processing and approval. **********The Patent and Trademark Office believes it should be exempt from such budget battles since it earns enough money to pay its own keep. Yet since 1992, Congress has appropriated some of those earnings for other, unrelated agencies. And so the fight is on. **********The battle is taking place as the patent office fields criticism that it has been slow and clumsy in adapting its policies, hiring practices and training efforts to keep up with the  high-technology economy. The boom in software-related inventions, Internet business patents, and human genome and biotechnology patents has frequently caught the agency off guard and led to controversy, court cases and even patent cancellations. **********Intellectual property has emerged as the centerpiece of many entrepreneurial ventures, since it is an asset suddenly necessary to secure investors and financing. As a result, patent officials say they have more work. **********Trademark registrations are up 40 percent this year, and patent applications have increased 12 percent. Many business method inventions and other technology related innovations are charting new courses in patenting practices that may be challenged in courts. So any hint that the quality of examinations may suffer even as it starts taking longer to award patents gets attention. **********The flat budget proposal also comes just as the patent office is finally gearing up to take its own plunge into the Internet. The office announced this month that it would now accept credit card payments for the basic filing fee for a patent application, patent maintenance fees, and fees for trademark applications for registration or renewal. **********And it has plans to allow inventors to file electronic patent applications. Now the patent office's director says those innovations may be threatened if the office cannot pay for them with money it collects in user fees. **********''All of our revenues, projected to be $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2001, are paid as fees by the knowledge-based high-tech leaders and individual entrepreneurs who rely on us to help them flourish in this economy,'' Q. Todd Dickinson wrote to the subcommittee on intellectual property. ''We are no burden on the American taxpayer.'' **********Members of the Appropriations Subcommittee have said that the patent office has overestimated how much money it will earn in 2001, and how much work it will have next year. So the skimming of the patent revenues that the subcommittee is proposing will be less than 25 percent, they say. In fact, the subcommittee predicts that its appropriation would divert only $167 million from the patent office. But even that would be more than the $116 million diverted in 2000 -- and that amount was a record. **********So far, the patent office is not considering raising user fees. **********The patent office is not alone in relying on user fees, or in having Congress appropriate some of them. The Immigration and Naturalization Service also earns income from customer fees, for example, and some of those are also diverted. **********And patent fees are substantial. Applying for and maintaining a patent can cost thousands of dollars when all is said and done, an amount that many inventors think is too high. In 1999, the patent office issued 265,000 patents and trademarks. **********Mr. Dickinson, naturally, says the subcommittee's proposed appropriation is not enough. He told Congress that such financing lead to the following: ***********A freeze on hiring and overtime for current staff, which in turn might tempt patent examiners, trademark lawyers and others to leave the patent office. ***********The imposition of restrictions on training for examiners and administrators. ***********An increase in the time it takes the agency to take its first action on each patent application from 11 months to 15, and on trademark applications from 4.5 months to 8. ***********A situation in which 150,000 patents are rejected for an initial examination, not allowed or not issued at all. ***********An increase in the time it takes to appeal agency decisions. ***********A Reduction or elimination of the planned electronic filing of patent applications, online searching and upgrades of examiner computer equipment. ***********A risk to the financing of 87 patent and trademark libraries around the country. **********Others apparently agree. Representative Howard Coble, Republican of North Carolina and chairman of the subcommittee on courts and intellectual property, recently introduced legislation that would allow the patent office to keep all of its fees, and Representative Jim Moran, Democrat of Virginia, introduced an amendment to the appropriations bill that would restore the agency's funding to the amount requested by the White House. **********At the same time, the Office of Management and Budget has recommended that President Clinton veto the bill if financing appropriated by the appropriations subcommittee is less than the administration's request. The White House also wants part of the patent office's revenues -- just not as much as Congress. **********All of that is a long way off. It may be months before the appropriations bill winds its way through the House  and Senate to the president's desk, and it is unlikely to get there bearing the same figures hammered out in last week's subcommittee meeting. **********But patent office officials and outside supporters like the Intellectual Property Owners Association and the American Intellectual Property Law Association know that budget appropriations are inevitable. **********''The bottom line for fee payers is that their money is not going to be used for the P.T.O.,'' said Brigid Quinn, a public affairs officer. ''But we will remain hopeful until the final stamp.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/08/world/a-battle-in-south-africa-over-racism-and-press-freedom.html": {"writer_name": "Rachel Swarns", "pub_date": "2000-03-08", "snippet": "South Africa's Human Rights Commission issues 36 subpoenas to editors in investigation of racism in media; photo (M)", "word_count": 1154, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Battle in South Africa Over Racism and Press Freedom", "print_headline": "A Battle in South Africa Over Racism and Press Freedom", "body_text": " **********The subpoena landed on the editor's desk on a Friday afternoon last month. It ordered him to appear before the country's Human Rights Commission, which was investigating racism in the media. It said he must account for his newspaper's reporting or face up to six months in jail. **********All told, the commission issued 36 such subpoenas to editors -- white and black -- of newspapers, radio and television stations. And in a country where freedom of the press was only recently enshrined in the Constitution, where newspapers were frequently closed and journalists arrested under the apartheid government, the subpoenas sent shivers through South Africa's newsrooms. **********''I thought, 'My God,' '' said the editor, Phillip van Niekerk, who is white and who runs the Mail & Guardian, a weekly here. ''I really didn't expect them to go that far. The jackboot approach is something we thought we'd got away from.'' **********In the outcry that ensued, the subpoenas were withdrawn and the editors agreed to appear voluntarily before the commission. Mr. van Niekerk and other white editors say they are willing to discuss the issue; they just don't want to be forced to discuss it. Nonetheless, the hearings on racism in the media, which started this week, have set off a debate over whether the commission and the government of President Thabo Mbeki are trying to stifle criticism and dissent in the press. **********It is no secret that Mr. Mbeki and his ruling party, the African National Congress, remain deeply suspicious of the white-dominated news media. Most of the nation's politically influential newspapers, including Mr. **********van Niekerk's Mail & Guardian, are run by white editors. Party and government officials, who helped write the country's new Constitution, say white journalists seem intent on discrediting the black government and typically disregard issues important to the black majority. **********Mr. Mbeki, the African National Congress and commission members deny that they want to muzzle the media, but they rarely sugarcoat their criticism. The A.N.C. applauded the commission for issuing the subpoenas. Last month, in its annual report, the ruling party described the media as a ''hostile press'' that is ''still primarily owned and controlled by antagonistic forces with minority interests.'' **********Those opinions are increasingly shared by black editors. At today's hearing, five black editors broke ranks with their white colleagues to support the commission's investigation, which has been largely derided by whites. The black editors testified that the media still portrays blacks as corrupt and incompetent, focuses almost exclusively on the white minority and drowns out the stories and concerns of ordinary black people. **********''It is our contention that in a country like South Africa, it simply cannot be right that, because of its dominance in the media, a minority should continue to set the public agenda,'' said Mike Siluma, editor of Sowetan, the nation's largest daily, one of several popular newspapers directed at black readers. **********The black editors said the issue was so important that they would have willingly testified under subpoena, which stunned their white counterparts, who had unanimously attacked the subpoenas as an infringement of press freedom. **********''We talk about a rainbow nation, but we're still living in different places,'' said Mr. van Niekerk. **********Many of the editors, black and white, battled apartheid in South Africa and suffered for it. In 1988, Mr. van Niekerk, who worked at what was then The Weekly Mail, saw his newspaper shuttered temporarily because the government decided it had portrayed A.N.C. guerrillas favorably. **********Peter Sullivan, the white editor of The Star, who then worked for the liberal Rand Daily Mail, was forced to justify his reporting before a government commission in the 1970's. Aggrey Klaaste, the black editor-in-chief of the Sowetan, was jailed for six months in 1977 after the government closed what was then Sunday World. **********All three men run influential newspapers. All agree that the commission's interim report on racism in the media, which was the foundation of the investigation, was seriously flawed. The report, for instance, criticized a photograph of two black birds near an overflowing garbage can, saying the birds depicted Johannesburg's black downtown and the garbage can its decay. **********All agree that the subtle racism and stereotyping described in the report continues to surface in newspapers and television and radio broadcasts. ''We mirror a very racist society,'' Mr. Sullivan said. ''If there was no racism in the media, it would be absolutely astounding.'' **********But that is where the similarities end. The white editors say they are already working hard to hire blacks and to carefully scrutinize coverage, and that the commission's investigation was, for the most part, unnecessary. The black editors disagree. **********After the hearing this week, the commission will present its recommendations to Parliament. ''People must not pretend that things are normal when they are not,'' Mr. Klaaste said. ''The country is run by white people, economy-wise. These newspapers are run by white people. We know that. There's no point in trying to be coy about this kind of thing. They say there is racism in the media, but they say that and do nothing about it.'' **********The commission began looking at the issue two years ago when the Black Lawyers Association and the Association of Black Accountants called for bias inquiries into two papers, including the Mail & Guardian. The groups pointed out that the Mail & Guardian had written 14 times about allegedly corrupt blacks but only 4 times about whites. Journalists counter that that should not be surprising since the most government officials these days are black. **********They also note that the major newspapers have given Mr. Mbeki some favorable coverage. Mr. Mbeki and Trevor Manuel, the finance minister, received rave reviews last month for major speeches. **********According to the commission's statistics, progress has been made in the hiring and promotion of blacks, but whites still overwhelmingly dominate the top tiers of management. Last year, the commission said, about 76 percent of the country's top media managers were white compared with 88 percent in 1994. **********But whites are not the only ones to voice concerns about Mr. Mbeki's commitment to freewheeling discussion and critique. Earlier this year, two black professors complained about what they described as the dampening of dissent within the ruling party in a column in the recently revived Sunday World newspaper. **********And last year, Trevor Ngwane, an African National Congress councilman in Johannesburg, was suspended from his party positions for publicly criticizing the A.N.C.-led council's planned privatization of government services. **********Parks Mankahlana, a spokesman for President Mbeki, said the Human Rights Commission, an independent body that reports to Parliament, is no mouthpiece for Mr. Mbeki. Last year, he noted, the commission sharply criticized the government for seeming to scale back rights of accused criminals and began an investigation into the government's interim policy against distribution of the anti-AIDS drug A.Z.T. **********Mr. Mankahlana emphasized that it was the black government, not the white government, that gave this country its first constitutionally protected rights to free speech. **********''This thing of being intolerant of dissent, it's just not true, '' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/01/world/peres-defeated-for-president-seems-finished-with-politics.html": {"writer_name": "John Burns", "pub_date": "2000-08-01", "snippet": "Shimon Peres, three-time prime minister of Israel and one of most enduring standard-bearers for Middle East peace, is defeated by Iranian-born Moshe Katsav, relatively obscure figure, in contest in parliament to become Israel's eighth president; d...", "word_count": 1286, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Peres, Defeated for President, Seems Finished With Politics", "print_headline": "Peres, Defeated for President, Seems Finished With Politics", "body_text": " **********At the moment today when the announcement of Parliament's first ballot for Israel's next president made it all but certain that he had lost what was most likely the last big battle of his 60-year political career, Shimon Peres, Nobel Prize laureate, three-time prime minister and one of the most enduring standard-bearers for Middle East peace, remained in character. **********The result, with 60 votes for Moshe Katsav, the Iranian-born immigrant who was the eventual winner, 57 votes for Mr. Peres and 3 blank ballots, brought loud groans, slumped shoulders and moist eyes among members of Parliament backing Mr. Peres to become the country's eighth president. **********But Mr. Peres himself, aware that Mr. Katsav's second-ballot victory was a virtual certainty, merely thrust his hands into the trouser pockets of his dark suit, leaned back against the chamber's rear wall and talked studiedly with friends. **********The vote came as Prime Minister Ehud Barak survived a vote on a no-confidence motion pushed by opponents of his peace effort. [Page A8.] **********To those who know Mr. Peres, the 76-year-old statesman appeared today to be nursing a deep private hurt, but in his manner and words he did nothing overt to belie his reputation for courtliness. **********The outcome cannot have been made easier by the fact that Mr. Katsav, 54, was a relatively obscure figure who had never held an office more weighty than tourism minister and whose name would almost certainly draw blanks in the chancelleries and palaces around the world where Mr. Peres's visits have become a fixture. **********''At this moment, the only thing I have to say is to congratulate Moshe Katsav on his election as president,'' Mr. Peres told reporters after the second ballot confirmed Mr. Katsav as the victor by 63 votes to 57. ''I wish him success and all the best.'' **********With no further word for the clamoring throng, Mr. Peres turned and walked away, this time almost certainly into retirement from a political career whose glittering pinnacle was the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize for his role in the Oslo peace accords. He shared the prize with Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister who was assassinated in 1995. **********For all his honors, today's defeat, denying Mr. Peres a five-year term in an office with mainly ceremonial powers, will almost certainly mark him as one of Israel's great losers. **********Even before the vote, the talk in the Parliament hallways was of whether Mr. Peres could shake off the image he has acquired over the last two decades by losing four of five elections for prime minister, as well as leadership battles within the Labor Party that relegated him to runner-up status, first behind Mr. Rabin and then Ehud Barak, the current prime minister. **********While many factors appeared to have combined to secure Mr. Katsav his victory, including the last-minute defection of at least a half-dozen legislators who had assured Mr. Peres of their support, there was no doubt that the perennial loser tag followed him into the vote, and may even have been what sunk him. **********''His reputation as a loser may have been something that influenced some members,'' said a chagrined Yosef Lapid, 68, a veteran lawmaker whose centrist Shinui Party, which has six seats in Parliament, supported Mr. Peres. **********For Mr. Peres, the defeat marked the likely end of a political story that began with his arrival in British-ruled Palestine at age 11, in 1934. As a teenager, he joined Haganah, the  force that protected Jews against Arabs. After 1948, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion assigned him to build up Israel's navy, and he later held more than a dozen top posts. **********Before becoming prime minister for the first time, he had rotated through virtually every important cabinet post, including foreign affairs, finance, defense, transport and information. Israelis count much of the groundwork for the country's nuclear weapons program among his achievements. **********The vacancy in the presidency came with the resignation three weeks ago of Ezer Weizman, 75, a stalwart of the old political elite, who quit midway through his second term after prosecutors issued a report harshly criticizing him for financial improprieties. **********When the day began, accounts in many of Israel's newspapers depicted the presidential vote as a virtual formality. The papers said Mr. Peres's election was more or less assured by his towering reputation as a peacemaker and as a major figure in Israeli governments since the 1960's and by his association, almost from boyhood, with most of the major political icons of Israel's history. **********An eve-of-vote Gallup poll in the newspaper Maariv had Mr. Peres as the popular choice for the post, with 63 percent to 20 percent for Mr. Katsav and 17 percent undecided. **********But political power in Israel has been shifting for years from the old Ashkenazic elite with roots in Eastern Europe that the Polish-born Mr. Peres personifies, and the newspaper forecasts appeared to have underestimated how far the process has gone among the elected members of Parliament. **********In Mr. Katsav, whose first home in Israel was a tent, Parliament chose a man who is not widely known even inside Israel. His home is in Qiryat Malachi, about 30 miles south of Tel Aviv, one of the working-class ''development towns'' that many prosperous Israelis consider deeply unfashionable. But precisely because of this modest background, Mr. Katsav has a strong chance, as president, of turning himself into an icon for many of Israel's six million people. **********When he is sworn in on Tuesday, he will be the first Israeli president from the underclass of Sephardic immigrants who flooded into the country from the Middle East and North Africa in the 1950's. He will also be the first successful presidential nominee from Likud, the rightist party with broad working-class and Sephardic support. **********In the days before the vote, Mr. Katsav campaigned aggressively among the rightist and ultra-Orthodox splinter parties with strong Sephardic support that control crucial blocs of votes in the 120-seat Parliament, tapping the alienation among the have-nots of Israeli society. **********But in victory, he struck a conciliatory note, saying he intended to ''lock up'' his political views during his five-year term and work as ''the loyal representative of all Israeli citizens, of all strata, of all sections, of all classes.'' **********The big question facing Israelis after the presidential vote was what impact it would have on peace efforts. After the huge gains made in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations that have been virtually synonymous with Mr. Peres, the march to a final pact faltered last week after 15 days of negotiations at Camp David. **********One theory about Mr. Peres's loss today was that rightist lawmakers could not stomach the prospect of Mr. Peres as president, despite the office's limited powers. **********Mr. Katsav made widely known his opposition to some of the concessions that Mr. Barak offered Mr. Arafat at Camp David. **********In Parliament hallways, some wondered if the erosion of support for Mr. Peres might have been engineered by Mr. Barak, who has had uneasy relationship with his predecessor as Labor Party leader. But Barak aides said Labor had voted solidly for Mr. Peres, and Mr. Barak himself appeared upset. **********But an even stronger factor than calculations about the peace negotiations appeared to have been played by the growing political power of Sephardic parties, and of political groups that draw their support from among the one million Russian immigrants who have arrived in the last two decades."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/05/world/tight-space-no-privacy-soviet-decor.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Wines", "pub_date": "2000-02-05", "snippet": "Ten million Russians, including one million in St Petersburg, still live in Soviet-era communal flats, makeshift cubicles crammed with people and utterly devoid of privacy; residents share bathrooms, hallways and common kitchen; they are mired in ...", "word_count": 1708, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tight Space.

Soviet Decor.", "body_text": " **********By the identifiably Russian logic of Tanya Konyenko, there is a good reason why she must leave her apartment, trudge five flights downstairs, cross Nevsky Prospekt, the city's prosperous main street, and walk to the local bathhouse, all simply to take a bath. **********Her apartment doesn't have hot water, but that is not why. Actually, her apartment doesn't have a bathtub. But that is not why either. **********The reason is that if her apartment had a bathtub, and if the bathtub had hot water, she would have to share it with two 20-ish men, a 17-year-old girl and her 18-year-old brother, their 40-year-old mother, a 64-year-old woman, her 65-year-old husband, a 70-year-old babushka, that woman's 72-year-old husband and, finally, with her own husband, Yura. **********''If there was a bathtub here I wouldn't use it,'' Mrs. Konyenko said, ''because other people would be washing their dirty underwear in it all day. And I wouldn't like it.'' **********It is the very essence of that most Soviet of Russian institutions, the communal flat: a place so crammed with people and so devoid of privacy that not having a bathtub can be considered an advantage. **********Greta Garbo would have been miserable here. Mrs. Konyenko manages to be alone a little while each day at the bathhouse, and insists she is not. **********''I like it here,'' she said, then paused a beat to reflect on her neighbors. ''Of course, it would be much better if I could poison some of them, and then I would have more room.'' **********''Here'' is flat 7 at Nevsky Prospekt 106, an ornate five-story building constructed roughly 125 years ago to accommodate two floors of stores and three rental units, one on each of the three upper floors. **********There are still two floors of stores. The three remaining floors were carved decades ago into veritable warrens of cubicles linked by corridors of peeling checkerboard linoleum, stuffed to the brim and beyond with lifetimes of musty, precious possessions. **********Once the staircase was an airy wall of glass. Soviet engineers solved that by hanging a steel tube of an elevator outside the staircase, shutting out any light. Outside the flat, graffiti advertise sex and politics; inside, by the front door, a wall scrawl inexplicably depicts a skating mouse named Roller Rat. **********The attic, so thick with a century's dust that the wooden floor is now a thick gray carpet, has become a crash pad for homeless alcoholics. **********Here the Konyenkos -- film critics, chain smokers, sometime actors and jazz buffs in St. Petersburg's distinctly offbeat intelligentsia -- have spent all but 3 of their 22 years of married life. They and their vast collection of records, tapes, CD's and religious art peacefully coexist in a space roughly 12 feet wide and 30 feet long, split into two rooms by a false wall covered with a red carpet. **********This is not their dream home. Like countless St. Petersburgers, the Konyenkos are mired in the communal milieu by inertia, lack of choice and outright poverty. For their patch of a barely habitable building with a two-window view of the Adidas, Carnaby and TJ Collection shops across Nevsky, they pay 140 rubles a month, about $4.50. **********''If we had the money we'd live in the Hermitage,'' Mrs. Konyenko said drily, referring to the czarist palace a few blocks away that houses much of Russia's greatest art. **********Given that they do not, they make do with 360 square feet in the center of downtown, close to the clubs and movies they love, and try to keep the door closed when they are home. **********Real-estate-wise, this makes them the Trumps of flat 7. A few linoleum squares away, past a broken bicycle and a collection of washing tubs and pots, Galina and Boris Semyonovich Korneyev -- 30-year veterans here -- live in a dim room barely 7 feet wide and 14 feet long. **********A little history: Russians have been living dormitory style at least since Peter the Great began building workers' barracks in the 1600's. But it was only in 1918 that the new Soviet government ordered thousands of churches, mansions and private apartments carved up and thrown open to peasants and factory workers, ostensibly to erase all vestiges of class in the new Communist paradise. **********They called it ''uplotneniye'' -- literally, compressing or tightening up -- and with good cause. For eight decades that is how countless millions of Russians have entered the world, lived and died: in makeshift cubicles, sometimes split into two rooms by a false wall, a cupboard or a bedspread hung from a rope, a supposed minimum of 65 square feet per person. **********Accurate figures are hard to come by, but it is how perhaps 10 million Russians still live, including a million in St. Petersburg. **********Residents in the city's kommunalki, as the flats are called, share bathrooms, hallways and a common kitchen, often with several stoves and sinks and a table for each family. A single telephone and, in most cases, a single bathtub serve all tenants. Official Soviet literature and film extolled kommunalki as the epitome of socialist equality and brotherhood: happy group homes where loving families shared all with neighbors and broke bread together in a spirit of harmony and peace. **********There are indeed some Kramden-Norton-style friendships erected on the foundation of communal life, but only some, says Aleksandr Pozdnyakov, a local expert on St. Petersburg architecture and history. For most residents life in a communal flat was -- and remains -- one of the lower rings of purgatory. **********''There's a word, trushchoby,'' he said. ''It's sort of a combination of garbage dump and slum. In Khrushchev's time they called the flats khrushchoby.'' **********There is, for example, the filth that comes from sharing common areas that are no one's responsibility: for years, families brought their own handmade seats to the toilets. And there is the mental anguish of being rubbed raw by neighbors one cannot stand but cannot escape. The common kitchen can be a place to get even by spiking food with urine, salt and even dead mice. **********Families get sick of each other, too, but have fewer options. Husbands and wives can divorce, but even now must live in the same tiny room for years until a neighbor dies, freeing up space, or a private apartment becomes available. **********''Young people want to make love at night,'' Mr. Pozdnyakov said. ''But the babushka is snoring on the other side of the cupboard, and the young baby is screaming. Big problems.'' **********Olga Berggolts, a well-known St. Petersburg writer, described the misery eloquently in a 1960 work: ''Sound carried in the house so ideally that if below, on the third floor, some people were playing blokhi or reading little poems, then on the fifth floor I could already hear everything, including the bad rhyming. These too-close forced relations with each other in incredibly small nooks was very irritating and exhausting.'' **********Tenants have been known to resort to extreme solutions. During Stalin's rule, every kommunalka was peopled with informers, some of whom solved petty disputes by reporting fellow tenants to the secret police. **********After the fingered tenant vanished, sent to the firing squad or a labor camp, the informer was allowed to add the victim's cubicle to his real-estate holdings. Mothers had additional babies or even adopted children to qualify for extra space. **********Not long ago, Mr. Konyenko said, a St. Petersburg man pushed his 82-year-old mother off a kommunalka balcony, then moved his girlfriend into the freed-up living area. ''It's not black humor,'' Mr. Konyenko said. ''It's the truth.'' **********Yet were the plight of most residents of kommunalki not so hapless, it might draw smiles. Mrs. Konyenko, a tall, thin, 44-year-old redhead, first moved into Nevsky 106 when she was 10 -- a brief stay, she thought, while the Soviet government found a real apartment for her father, a military man, and his wife. **********The wait for an apartment stretched 15 years, and by the time father and wife left, Tanya and Yura were ready to inherit the cubicle. At that time, more than 20 people lived in the flat, and the scramble for living space, and the privacy that comes with it, was relentless. **********Mrs. Konyenko recalled the time nearly 30 years ago when the man who inhabited one closet-sized cubicle died. By the time the government sent a new tenant to scout out his new home a few days later, the closet was gone entirely, its wallboard and studs ripped out and its territory seized by the residents of the cubicle next door. **********Then there was the family that inhabited a room near the Konyenko manse: a couple who quickly bore three daughters, who then married and eventually produced offspring of their own before the clan finally split up. Toward the end, nine people in three generations lived in a room roughly 10 by 18 feet. **********When the eldest of the three daughters got married, the Konyenkos gave the newlyweds a gift: the right to spend their wedding night in barely secluded splendor in the second room of their apartment, on a twin bed hard against the rug-covered divider. **********Funny, yes. But the humor is bittersweet. The Konyenkos, an eclectic couple, have turned a half-habitable lemon into stylish lemonade with a plethora of posters and two decades of collectibles. Their money goes not into property, but travel, nightclubs and movies. **********Few kommunalka residents are so carefree. There is talk that the city will soon evict the denizens of Nevsky 106, scattering them to private apartments in the suburbs, as part of larger plan to eliminate the kommunalki by 2003 -- a goal that now seems increasingly out of reach given the state of the economy. **********There are plans for a $300 million trade center in the block, a sparkling collection of renovated offices, luxury apartments, glass-roofed shopping malls and hanging gardens. Mrs. Konyenko has mixed feelings. **********''If you'd give me some flat in the suburbs, I wouldn't have it,'' she said. ''Here I'm close to everything. Yura's office is next door, across the street. There are cinemas. I feel myself in the center of the city.'' **********A few feet down the corridor, Galina Korneyev, the 64-year-old who has spent almost half her life in flat 7, grabs her head, stunned by Mrs. Konyenko's resistance. **********''How can they do it faster?'' she asks, referring to the city's grand plans. ''How can they do it sooner, so we can move sooner?''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/22/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-ikea-moves-account-to-carmichael-lynch.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "2000-12-22", "snippet": "Ikea, home furnishings retailer, chooses Carmichael Lynch to handle its advertising account, with billings estimated at $40 million to $50 million (S)", "word_count": 128, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ikea Moves Account To Carmichael Lynch", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Ikea Moves Account To Carmichael Lynch", "body_text": " **********Ikea, the home furnishings retailer, has chosen Carmichael Lynch in Minneapolis, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, to handle its account, with billings estimated at $40 million to $50 million. **********Joakim Gip, marketing manager at Ikea North America in Plymouth Meeting, Pa., part of Ikea Svenska, said the selection came after a two-month review that had been narrowed to Carmichael Lynch and two other finalists: the Martin Agency in Richmond, Va., part of the Lowe Group unit of Interpublic; and Messner Vetere Berger McNamee Schmetterer/Euro RSCG in New York, part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide unit of Havas Advertising. **********Deutsch in New York, also part of Interpublic, which had handled creative, media, direct marketing and interactive advertising for Ikea for 11 years, did not take part in the review."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/07/business/media-business-advertising-procter-gamble-tries-new-approach-spots-for-pampers.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "2000-02-07", "snippet": "Advertising column describes Procter & Gamble Co's new campaign for Pampers disposable diapers; its agency, D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, is taking light-hearted approach, indicative of efforts by P&G to freshen its ads to appeal to younger, more...", "word_count": 951, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Procter & Gamble tries a new approach in spots for Pampers.", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Procter & Gamble tries a new approach in spots for Pampers.", "body_text": " **********THE push by the Procter & Gamble Company to improve the creativity of its advertising accelerates today with a campaign for one of its most important products, Pampers. **********The longtime Pampers agency, D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles in New York, plans to introduce what is described as the brand's first image campaign, avoiding gurgling infants, shiny package shots, silly jingles, stern-voiced announcers and didactic diapering demonstrations. **********In place of those traditional trappings, emblematic of the hard sell that P.& G. marketing executives once demanded from Madison Avenue, D'Arcy is taking a light-hearted approach for Pampers centered on the affectionate relationships between animals and their offspring. Only the brand's logo appearing in the final moments of television commercials identify the sponsor. **********Even more startling, the song heard in the commercials was recorded for the spots by Rod Stewart, the free-spirited rock star known for asking ''Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?'' **********Those unexpected aspects of the campaign are indicative of the efforts by P.& G., the world's biggest advertiser, to freshen its ads with elements that would appeal to younger, more diverse consumers. That is also evident in the contents of a Web site (www.pampers.com) devoted to what P.& G. calls the Pampers Parenting Institute, offering advice on child care. **********One reason for the marketing makeover for Pampers, which has an annual advertising budget estimated at $50 million, is that mainstream marketers like P.& G. find they must compete for attention with the eye-catching, even eyebrow-raising ads peddling products and services for the new generation of dot-com entrepreneurs. **********Another reason is that decades of denigration of P.& G. as the purveyor of lackluster, formulaic campaigns have taken their toll, particularly as the company strives to stimulate demand for its familiar packaged goods as part of ambitious plans to double sales in five years. **********''This advertising is what we believe we need,'' said Deborah Henretta, vice president and general manager for the North American baby care operations of Procter, which is based in Cincinnati. **********Campaigns for Pampers ''could do a better job of reaching out to the heart strings of new moms and making a better connection,'' she added, and the new tack ''provides some stopping power, breaking through the clutter of baby advertising.'' **********Other P.& G. agencies have already introduced ads meant to signal the company's newfound fondness for creativity, part of an initiative started in 1997 under the rubric of the Agency Renewal Project. **********Saatchi & Saatchi in New York is producing humorous print ads for Tide and Cascade detergents, some even with holiday themes; for instance, a poster for Tide With Bleach proclaims, ''May your Christmas be white.'' Commercials for Bounty paper towels by Jordan McGrath Case & Partners/Euro RSCG in New York, part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide unit of Havas Advertising, no longer compare the brand's performance with Brand X. And a print ad to run in March magazines for Cheer detergent, created by the Leo Burnett Company in Chicago, part of BDM Inc., asserts, ''Life is what happens outside the laundry room.'' **********P.& G. and D'Arcy ''are really pushing the envelope with brand-building ideas and breakthrough creativity,'' said Arthur Selkowitz, chairman and chief executive at D'Arcy, which is also part of BDM, the agency company formed last week by the merger of the Leo Group and the MacManus Group. **********''We have new campaigns coming out for a number of our P.& G. brands in the very near future,'' Mr. Selkowitz said, ''that will also be category firsts.'' Other Procter products handled by D'Arcy, one of the company's four lead worldwide agencies, include mainstays like Charmin bathroom tissue, Crest toothpaste and Folgers coffee. **********''We're trying to elevate the way the Pampers brand is perceived by consumers,'' said Graham Woodall, executive creative director of the D'Arcy New York office. ''We want to find the high ground to compete against Huggies,'' the Kimberly-Clark brand that is the principal Pampers rival. **********Research, he said, showed the best approach would be to present Pampers, introduced in 1961 by a D'Arcy predecessor, Benton & Bowles, as ''more about parenting and less about cleaning up messes, ''which allows us to touch the consumer in a way that's really relevant today.'' **********''When a baby's in a diaper, happy, not crying, there are no problems,'' Mr. Woodall added. ''You can spend more time together. You feel you're a good parent.'' **********That feeling is brought to life in the commercials with footage of an ark's worth of parent and baby animals -- bears, foxes, elephants, lions, monkeys, penguins, seals, zebras -- appearing on screen as Mr. Stewart is heard performing a new version of his hit tune ''Forever Young.'' After he sings the lyric ''But whatever road you choose, I'm right behind you, win or lose,'' these words appear on screen along with the Pampers logo: ''We're right behind you every step of the way.'' **********The phrase ''Every step of the way'' will become the new Pampers campaign theme, replacing ''Pamper the skin they're in.'' **********''The moments the animals so naturally exhibit are magical,'' Ms. Henretta said, ''illustrating the special bond that exists between parents and children.'' **********''They're a little bit easier to capture in the wild than if you stage a mom and a baby in front of a camera,'' she added. ''I'm not sure we could have achieved that through conventional advertising.'' **********Next week, additional TV commercials, along with radio spots and print advertisements, will be introduced, focused on the parenting institute. They will use examples of animal behavior to offer tips on topics like sibling rivalry and discipline. **********''We see this campaign as our drive to be more than a diaper company,'' Ms. Henretta said, ''growing our business by addressing other needs parents have for baby care products and services.'' **********Too bad for Pampers that Gerber  has already claimed ''Babies are our business, our only business.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/15/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-changes-at-the-top-at-post-partners.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "2000-12-15", "snippet": "Principals of Post & Partners in New York and its predecessor agency, Emmerling Post, have new duties; John Emmerling is opening Emmerling Communications in New York, a consulting company; he was chairman and chief creative officer at Emmerling Po...", "word_count": 103, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Changes at the Top At Post & Partners", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Changes at the Top At Post & Partners", "body_text": " **********Principals of Post & Partners in New York and its predecessor agency, Emmerling Post, have new duties. **********John Emmerling, 62, is opening Emmerling Communications in New York, a consulting company.

They said that they hoped to persuade President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, a regional mediator of the Israeli-Palestinian relationship, to change his mind. **********''Of course, I am not happy about the fact that Egypt has decided to recall its ambassador,'' Prime Minister Ehud Barak said. ''I hope that it is for a short period of time. Egypt has a role in the peace process, a positive role, and I don't think that recalling the ambassador is a positive contribution to Egypt's continued role in this capacity.'' **********In Gaza, where Mr. Mubarak's decision was hailed as overdue, Palestinian officials assessed the material damage from Israel's helicopter and gunboat attacks on police and military targets. It ranged from incredibly specific -- the desk of a particular Palestinian officer -- to the more general destruction of the headquarters of the preventive security forces of Muhammad Dahlan. Most of the damage was reparable. **********Israel's bombardment on Monday, which terrified Gazan residents, was in reprisal for the deadly bombing of a school bus of Jewish settlers earlier in the day. Mr. Barak said that it was also meant as a message to the Palestinian Authority, urging it to halt the violence or face further ''determination and forcefulness'' from the Israelis. **********In Gaza today, Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, said, ''They are threatening us to continue their attacks with their heavy weapons, with their rockets.'' **********In Gaza today as well, Mr. Barak addressed soldiers at an army base, speaking to the Israeli people and to the Palestinian leadership. **********''Yesterday we witnessed a despicable, murderous terror attack against children,'' he said. ''We responded last night with a broad operation against Palestinian Authority infrastructure in Gaza. This resolute response has one purpose: to clarify that violence has a price and that we will not tolerate any form of violence.'' **********As Mr. Barak was touring the base, a settler was shot in the head just a couple of miles away. A Palestinian sharpshooter fired a single bullet at the man, Itamar Yefet, 19, who died tonight of his wounds. After the incident, Gazan settlers expressed frustration at what they see as their government's failure to protect them and breathed fury at the Palestinians. **********''In the name of the holy Torah, we are warning you, Arafat, and your friend, Dahlan, beware!'' said Rabbi Yosef Elnekave, spiritual leader of the Gush Katif settlement cluster. ''Dare not touch our children or anyone among us, soldiers or civilians. If you refuse to listen to us, we will pray to our Creator, all of the rabbis, that he take you away. Beware, beware, beware, for your souls are at stake.'' **********The terror attack, which Israel ascribed to Yasir Arafat's Fatah organization, killed two adults and mutilated several children. Three of the children were siblings. Tehila Cohen, 8, has been in and out of the operating room today as doctors try to reattach her legs; her younger brother Yisrael, 7, had his right leg amputated beneath the knee today; and their older sister, Orit, 12, lost part of her foot. **********In a grim mirror of those injuries, a 15-year-old Palestinian boy lost his leg in Israel's missile attacks, which also killed a Palestinian security officer. **********There were few other serious injuries; most of the scores of Gazans who visited local hospitals were treated for shock and bruises. **********Still, with its electricity grid cut, Gaza City plunged into darkness on Monday night, and its residents felt certain that the conflict had escalated into all-out war. Their horror rippled by satellite television across the Arab world, prompting Egypt to take a break from its diplomatic relationship with Israel. Mohammed Bassiouny, who has been Egypt's ambassador to Israel for 18 years, was due to leave Tel Aviv for Cairo on Wednesday. The last time Egypt took such action was in 1982, when it recalled Saad Mortada ''as an expression of resentment'' over the massacre of Palestinian civilians in West Beirut. **********Limor Livnat, an Israeli Likud Party legislator, said Egypt had played a positive role as a ''moderating factor'' during the present conflict. **********But, she said: ''The state of Israel must continue to defend its citizens, even if the price is international problems in relations with our neighbors. It's nicer when our neighbors embrace us and when Europe praises us. But, if this is at the price of killing Jews and children, then it's not worth anything.'' **********Jordan, the other Arab nation with which Israel has made peace, does not have an ambassador in Israel now, either. A new ambassador was appointed two months ago, but his arrival was postponed because of the Israeli-Palestinian clashes. **********Facing rising anti-Israeli sentiment among his people -- an opposition paper published a ''blacklist'' this week of Jordanians doing business with Israel -- King Abdullah today criticized ''Israeli aggression'' and warned that Israel was threatening hopes for peace in the region. **********A senior Palestinian official, Ahmed Abdul Rahman, said more sharply that Israel had ''shot the peace process in the heart'' with its air and sea strikes on Gaza. **********In a sign of the escalating effect of the events on Monday, Palestinian officials declared today that their security officers are now authorized to shoot at Israeli soldiers if the soldiers fire on protesters. Until now, Palestinian paramilitary officers have been doing most of the shooting, although Palestinian security officers have joined in unofficially many times. **********Israeli soldiers shot dead three armed Palestinians just after midnight this morning in two separate incidents, the Israeli Army said. In the first, two Palestinians were trying to break into the Neve Dekalim settlement in southern Gaza, the army said. In the second, a group of Palestinians was trying to plant explosives at the Kissufim checkpoint, near where the bus blew up on Monday, the army said. **********In clashes and exchanges of gunfire throughout the West Bank and Gaza, three other Palestinians were killed, Palestinian officials said. **********Not all Israeli cabinet ministers supported the Monday decision to bombard Gaza. Yossi Beilin, the justice minister, voted against it; Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, the minister for tourism and transportation, and former Prime Minister Shimon Peres abstained. **********Mr. Lipkin-Shahak defined the attack as a warlike action, and several Israeli military experts today said that Israel was inching toward a limited war against the Palestinian Authority. **********Israeli television reported tonight that Israel had decided to stall the start of an international fact-finding committee's work. While Israel agreed in cease-fire understandings that a committee should be established to investigate the violence, Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami has sent a letter to American officials saying that the timing is wrong because the violence is still raging."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/18/world/british-vasectomy-offer-brings-french-outrage.html": {"writer_name": "John Tagliabue", "pub_date": "2000-08-18", "snippet": "British group known as Marie Stopes International, for pioneering champion of birth control, offers vasectomies to Frenchmen, and Bernard Schnakenbourg becomes overnight celebrity by being first to cross Channel and have procedure performed; react...", "word_count": 636, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "British Vasectomy Offer Brings French Outrage", "print_headline": "British Vasectomy Offer Brings French Outrage", "body_text": " **********The French have just banned British pork and are still not letting in British beef. And the talk here now is of a sly reprisal: a campaign to sterilize Frenchmen. **********A British group promoting birth control is offering vasectomies to Frenchmen, even promoting a free one to the first who signed up. The campaign invites Frenchmen to go to Britain on the theory that the Napoleonic Code, dating back to the early 19th century, prohibits vasectomy, as a form of self-mutilation. **********The British group, known as Marie Stopes International for a pioneering British champion of birth control, tried to place advertisements in French newspapers, which refused them, and in the Paris subway, which also turned them away. The Metro evidently concluded that the ads would offend Catholics, since the church teaches that vasectomies are an improper method of birth control. **********So Marie Stopes posted the proposal on its Web site. **********Overnight, Bernard Schnakenbourg became a national celebrity. He traveled to London this month from his home near Paris with his companion and their 2-year old daughter for a vasectomy. **********Afterward, Mr. Schnakenbourg, 47, who works at a national center for scientific research, announced to astonished French reporters: ''I feel great. It's like coming out of the dentist with a local anesthetic.'' **********The reaction in France was a mix of wonder and outrage. ''The appeal from London to sterilize the French,'' read the headline in the leftist daily Liberation. But the paper went on to note that while 6 percent of Frenchwomen of child-bearing age have been sterilized, usually by tubal ligature, fewer than 1 percent of Frenchmen have undergone a vasectomy. **********That compares with 16 percent in Britain, the country with the highest incidence, 11 percent in the Netherlands, and 8 percent in Belgium, according to United Nations statistics. Indeed, the United Nations lists the number performed in France as ''nil or negligible.'' **********The figure appears remarkable in a country that has been a leader in other respects in contraceptive issues, though mostly regarding women. In January, for instance, France started to distribute morning-after contraceptive pills to schoolgirls as young as 12, though since then the issue has fought its way through the courts. And last year the government allowed pharmacists to start selling ordinary birth control pills over the counter without a prescription, making France the only European country to do so. **********But until now sterilization, including vasectomy, has slumbered in a gray zone of dubious legality, one that appears to accommodate the apprehensions of French males. **********A spokesman for the French Ministry of Health dismissed the offer by Marie Stopes as ''essentially, a commercial undertaking.'' In London, Julie Douglas, marketing director at Marie Stopes, denied that the offer, which charges the French the equivalent of $300 for the vasectomy, essentially to cover costs, was intended to make money. ''We don't expect big numbers,'' she said. **********The organization's Web site (www.mariestopes.org.uk) displays the poster rejected by the Metro. Ms. Douglas described it as a ''cheeky ad.'' **********Medical experts agree that French law relegates sterilization to a dubious zone. Last year the law, which bans any ''assault on the integrity of the human body except in case of therapeutic necessity,'' was changed to replace the word ''therapeutic'' with ''medical.'' That was to allow doctors greater leeway in deciding when sterilization is permissible. **********Dr. Stephane Dropy, chief urologist at the Bicetre hospital east of Paris, said resistance by French males to vasectomy was ''partly cultural,'' given French reliance on other forms of contraception. Despite the revision in the text of the law, he acknowledged ''its interpretation remains subjective.'' **********For his part, Mr. Schnakenbourg, at his news conference, could not refrain from a swipe at his countrymen's contraceptive habits. Frenchmen would accept vasectomy, he said, if the alternative meant going on the pill. ''I don't think men would accept swallowing something every day for 30 years,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/15/technology/exmicrosoft-employee-publicizes-a-potential-security-flaw.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "2000-05-15", "snippet": "May 15, 2000", "word_count": 496, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ex-Microsoft Employee Publicizes a Potential Security Flaw", "print_headline": "Ex-Microsoft Employee Publicizes a Potential Security Flaw", "body_text": " **********May 15, 2000 **********Ex-Microsoft Employee Publicizes a Potential Security Flaw By MICHAEL BRICK **********NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com icrosoft said Monday that it was developing a software patch \"as quickly as possible\" after a 21-year-old former employee publicized a potential security flaw in the company's popular Web browser. **********In a conference call with privacy advocates and reporters, Bennett Haselton, the former employee and an active opponent of Internet censorship who lives in Seattle, said he could use the flaw to read the in boxes of HotMail accounts and order products on Amazon.com without the account holders' permission or knowledge. **********All known versions of Microsoft's Internet Explorer are vulnerable, according to Haselton's Web site, peacefire.org. **********The flaw involves cookies, which electronic commerce sites routinely deposit on the computers of Web users in order to keep track of their purchases and for other monitoring purposes. Using a specially constructed uniform resource locator, or URL, a Web site can read the cookies from any domain. **********A spokeswoman for Microsoft said that the flaw could be exploited only if a user is coerced or enticed to visit a Web site operated by someone who intends to exploit the flaw. The company is developing a software patch that will be available shortly, said the spokeswoman, who works for the company's outside public relations firm and asked that she not be identified because of Microsoft's press policies. **********The spokeswoman also said cookies should not contain sensitive data like credit card information or passwords in the first place.

Why subject yourself to a slow-motion transaction through a dial-up modem at home, when you can complete a high-bandwidth purchase at the office? E-commerce executives acknowledge as much, often noting that the bulk of their sales come during daytime hours, when T1 lines and other fast connections are buzzing. So far, 93 percent of the nation's households still connect to the Internet through dial-up modems, according to the research firm Jupiter Media Metrix. **********E-tailing executives also say that high-bandwidth users are most likely to be their best customers, because these shoppers tend to be more prosperous and much more prone to buying things online than those who connect to the Web with dial-up modems. But so far, e-tailers have been hesitant to design their sites with high-resolution photos or video capabilities that might take full advantage of their best customers' high-speed connections -- for fear of alienating dial-up users, who would find such features agonizingly slow to download. **********But as the number of high-bandwidth users grows, analysts said online merchants could do more to serve these shoppers selectively, without driving away bandwidth-challenged customers. **********Part of the hesitance by e-commerce executives is based on doubts that there would be any measurable payback if they invested in video or audio features or rich graphic options for their high-speed customers. **********''You get into the chicken-and-the-egg game,'' said David Court, who leads the marketing practice at the consulting firm McKinsey & Company. If Web sites do not install such features, he said, ''there isn't an increasing customer benefit, so usage is low, and around and around it goes.'' **********Mr. Court estimated that sites were underserving about one-third of broadband users, who commonly are intent on simplicity and convenience. ''With the right broadband content,'' he said, ''you could look at how the dress would really look on you. Or on a travel site, you could have video on what the resort really looks like, to give the consumer confidence to buy.'' **********But, he said, ''until we make developing broadband content cost-effective, the impact on e-commerce will be lower.'' **********Some sites are experimenting with new ways to provide high-bandwidth features. Take GameStop.com, the division of Babbage's Etc. that sells video games. According to John Woodson, GameStop's president, the company recently introduced a feature allowing users to try out video games with a so-called ''streaming demo'' option before they buy. Notably, the feature works only for users with cable modems, digital subscriber lines or other high-speed connections. **********''It's almost out of necessity that I have to do this,'' Mr. Woodson said. While a large percentage of his customers use dial-up modems, he said, ''I also have a lot of hard-core gamers who want the best-looking images and photos so they can study them to death.'' **********He declined to say how much it cost to adopt this feature. According to the company that provides the service, Stream Theory, Web sites pay nothing up front for the capability, instead paying Stream Theory an undisclosed percentage of every sale that follows the preview of a game. The arrangement is paying off nicely for GameStop, according to Mr. Woodson, who said visitors who used this feature were five times more likely to buy than those who did not. **********Of course, features that cater to broadband users only go so far when it comes to other retailer categories. ''I don't need to show a flower blooming or spinning around in 3-D,'' said Chris McCann, president of 1-800-flowers.com. Mr. McCann said the company had nothing in particular with which to cater to high-bandwidth users, even though the site's traffic reaches its peak during the business day ''when people have higher bandwidth access.'' **********If most of his visitors were using high-speed connections, he added, ''We could do more with enhanced imagery, and maybe streaming media. But that population just isn't large enough to justify the expense.'' **********Interestingly, few if any e-tailing executives can track the connection speeds of their visitors with much precision because there is little technology that allows such tracking. Instead, they rely on educated guesses, often based on demographic information and buying habits, and by noting the version of the user's browser software. **********Bluefly.com, which sells discount-price apparel and housewares online, is one example. According to Jonathan Morris, a Bluefly executive vice president, the site recently ran tests making some assumptions about the users' connection speeds, and found that those with high-speed connections made purchases at a greater rate than those who had dial-up modems. **********As a result of that testing, Mr. Morris said, the company is starting to build pages that will perform better for high-bandwidth users. For example, he said, Bluefly recently created a Web page in conjunction with the magazine Harper's Bazaar, in which items are shown with larger, ''graphically more luxurious'' photos. **********''We haven't jumped into that pool head-first, though,'' Mr. Morris said, because the company does not want to annoy lower-speed Web users. **********Indeed, many companies are jumping out of that pool, so fearful are they of losing customers. EddieBauer.com, for one, has ''really taken a step back in the past 12 to 18 months'' when it comes to features with intensive technology, said Mark Staudinger, vice president for Eddie Bauer's interactive media unit. For instance, he said, the company jettisoned its ''virtual dressing room,'' which allowed users to mix and match clothing and colors because it was too slow and unreliable. **********''We were one of the first to do it,'' Mr. Staudinger said. ''It got a lot of p.r., but when you looked at conversion rates,'' he said, referring to the rate at which browsers turned into buyers, ''it was kind of a toy.'' **********EddieBauer.com does offer a feature that lets users see items in 3-D. It is available only to those who have 56,000 kilobit-a-second modems or higher connection speeds, and requires downloading special software. **********''But it's not like we're excluding anybody,'' said Brian Walker, the company's manager of business development. ''It works at lower speeds just fine.'' **********Mr. Staudinger said the Web site's executives would ''have to put a much higher level of consideration into higher-bandwidth options as the base of those users reaches 30 percent'' -- something Jupiter Media Metrix predicts will not happen for several years. ''And even then,'' he said, ''it's got to be something useful. We can't just serve up rich content without a practical purpose.''"}}
