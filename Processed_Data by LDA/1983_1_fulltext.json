Some 14,000 Cypriots are now studying overseas, 3,000 of them in the United States. But since it is increasingly difficult and costly to do so, there are pressures on all sides to establish a university in Cyprus. **********The issue, however, is highly charged politically, as it involves tensions stemming from the division of the island into increasingly estranged zones of Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. Need for University **********For the last two decades, or almost since this island received its independence from Britain in 1960, both Greek and Turkish Cypriots have been saying that there is a need to set up a university. One of the main champions of such an institution for Cyprus is Lellos Demetriades, Mayor of the Greek Cypriot side of the capital, who wants to convert some of the abandoned buildings in the buffer zone separating the two sides into university faculties open to the two communities. **********An interministerial committee set up by the Greek Cypriot Government to study the question concluded in 1976 that a university was both ''necessary and feasible,'' Nicos J. Vakis, a physiologist at the Agricultural Research Institute in Nicosia, said. Dr. Vakis heads a group called the Friends of the University, which includes representatives of Parent-Teacher Associations and students. **********In 1981 the Greek Cypriot House of Representatives adopted a resolution in favor of the university. Last year the Greek Cypriot Ministry of Education said the matter was urgent, and the interministerial committee has now drafted a 14-page amendment to its 1976 report. **********''We hope the university can get off the ground this year,'' Dr.  Vakis said, pointing out that publicly everyone agrees on the need.  Panos Adamides, director general of education, who has headed the interm@inisterial committee from the start, said in a recent interview that agreement had been reached in principle that a university serving both Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots was needed. Goal Is to Open by 1985 **********He said the decisions to date envisioned a university for about 6,000 students, with both Greek and Turkish Cypriots represented in the faculty and administration as well as in the student body. The goal, he said, would be to open by 1985. **********Mr. Adamides said that history and civilization would be taught in Greek and Turkish and that English would be used for ''culturally neutral subjects'' such as the sciences and technology. He said the university would be autonomous, though financially controlled by the state, and situated on a campus accessible to both communities. **********''One question remains,'' he said, adding that it was whether to ''proceed with the declaration of intent to invite the Turkish community to participate when they are ready, or to wait and include the university as another item of negotiation in the intercommunal talks.'' **********He said the ''prevailing attitude'' favored moving ahead without waiting for a political solution of the division of Cyprus into two sectors. Unlikely That Turks Will Join **********But it appears unlikely that the Turkish Cypriots will accept any invitation to join what they see as a Greek Cypriot plan to establish a university. **********''We are ready to discuss the university as an intercommunal institution when we have formed a federal state,'' Rauf Denktash, leader of the Turkish Cypriots, said in a recent interview. ''But how can we start when we cannot even go to the Greek side? What right have they to set it up when they have not even asked us our views?'' **********Mr. Denktash, President of the proclaimed Turkish Federated State of Cyprus, predicted that the Greek side was going to set up a Greek university and suggest that the Turkish Cypriots could respond easily by upgrading the Higher Technological Institute, on the outksirts of the northern port of Famagusta. Now Has 200 Students **********The institute, which began with 78 students in 1979 and now has 200, is situated on a 50-acre stretch of barren land. It consists of five modern blocks, and work has begun to level ground for the administration building. With a present capacity of 600 students, there are plans to build a dormitory and a cafeteria. **********''Few universities have such a wide range of modern equipment,'' Onay Fadil, secretary general of education in the Turkish zone, said as he took visitors on a tour of the electronics, hydraulics, electrical machinery and mechanical laboratories and workshops. He said most of the equipment was American and English and had been bought with a $2.6 million contribution from the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and a $1 million grant from the Islamic Development Bank. **********Mr. Fadil said preparations were under way to introduce a fouryear university program next September.  Ahmet Aker, an adviser to the Turkish Cypriot Department of Education who is on leave from the Johns Hopkins University branch in Bologna, Italy, said he thought it feasible to establish a university on the Turkish Cypriot side for 1,500 to 2,000 students."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/22/business/curb-asked-on-trade-to-soviet.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Farnsworth", "pub_date": "1983-09-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 842, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CURB ASKED ON TRADE TO SOVIET", "print_headline": "CURB ASKED ON TRADE TO SOVIET", "body_text": " **********The President's national security adviser, William P. Clark, has endorsed a proposed tightening of controls over exports to the Soviet Union, Administration officials said today. His action intensifies an interagency conflict over Washington's response to the Soviet downing of a Korean Air Lines plane on Sept. 1. **********Mr. Clark's intervention came in a letter to Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige. The Commerce Department enforces the export controls and heads an interagency committee that makes policy recommendations. **********The Clark letter supported the committee's recommendation of Sept. 13 that a more restrictive export standard be applied to 17 categories of oil and gas equipment. **********A similar letter was sent to Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who reportedly has been furious over the Sept. 13 recommendation. In that letter, dated Sept. 19, Mr. Clark wrote: ''Although this process was proceeding independent of the K.A.L. shootdown, the recommendation for this adjustment for these high-technology strategic items could be timely.'' **********The Administration officials said a Cabinet-level body, called the Senior Interagency Group on International Economic Policy and headed by Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan, planned to take up the matter Friday. **********Secretary Baldrige said through his press spokesman, B. Jay Cooper, ''We won't comment on a classified document.'' Robert B. Sims, the press liaison officer for Mr. Clark, declined comment. **********It was unclear whether Mr. Clark was acting personally or for the President. **********Officials said a tightening of export controls would not affect sales to the Soviet Union of pipe-laying equipment made by the Caterpillar Tractor Company of Peoria, Ill. President Reagan approved the removal of such equipment from the restricted list on Aug. 20, in response to a recommendation from Mr. Baldrige and Mr. Shultz. **********Because Mr. Reagan approved decontrol of the pipelayers, the interagency committee did not include them in its recommended tightening, but it decided not to extend decontrol to related equipment, such as pipe-laying barges.  Contents of Baldrige Letter **********Those who saw copies of the Clark letter to Mr. Baldrige said it urged him to let stand the bulk of the recommendations that were taken Sept. 13 by a sub-Cabinet interagency committee. The chairman of that group was Lawrence J. Brady, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Trade Administration, a leading opponent of trade with the Russians. He has been supported by Richard N. Perle, an Assistant Secretary of Defense. **********Mr. Brady's position is in sharp contrast to that of his superior, Mr. Baldrige. Mr. Baldrige and Secretary Shultz have generally favored trade in all but the most sensitive products on the ground that the Russians can buy most items in other countries. **********Mr. Shultz and Mr. Baldrige have been working with American allies to make export controls international, in order to make them more effective. But Europe and Japan are reluctant to sever trade with the Russians. **********The recommended export policy, unless overturned by the Cabinet and the President, would deny an export license for $40 million worth of oil exploration equipment and would place 17 products for oil and gas exploration under more rigorous national security export controls. **********Under national security controls, the Defense Department, which has generally opposed most trade with the Russians, has a major say. Under foreign policy controls, in which these products are now listed, the State Department has a major say. **********The advisory group that made the recommendations is made up of the Departments of Commerce, Energy, State and Defense, the National Security Council and the Central Intelligence Agency. **********The group's action was originally described as ''technical'' and was taken unanimously. However, two Administration officials, commenting separately and asking that they not be identified, said the impact could be far-reaching.  Earlier Presidential Action **********They explained that the items that would be shifted to the national security control list included many that were banned by President Reagan last year when he tried to discourage European support for the pipeline to bring natural gas from Siberia to Western Europe. **********In June 1982, the President extended a ban on the sale of American pipeline equipment to the licensees and subsidiaries of American companies abroad. Equipment involved included General Electric turbines and Dresser Industries compressors made in Western Europe. **********The European governments then ordered the companies within their jurisdiction to ship the equipment despite the American ban. President Reagan followed by imposing sanctions against the European suppliers.   Compromise Last November **********American relations with the Europeans became increasingly tense until November, when Secretary Shultz worked out a compromise in which the Allies agreed to press for making the controls international through the Coordinating Committee of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. **********A State Department official said: ''I am afraid that we may be embarking on the same course as we were last June.'' **********An official from another agency, who asked that neither he nor the agency be identified, said, ''We were sandbagged by the hawks.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/25/business/l-bell-ruling-134272.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-12-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 114, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bell Ruling", "print_headline": "Bell Ruling", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********Your item recapping Judge Greene's ruling of Dec. 8 could be very misleading to your readers (''Week in Business,'' Dec. 11). **********The focus of the ruling revolves around the obligation of the Bell operating companies to inform customers of the availability of alternate interexchange carriers and the option to predesignate a long-distance carrier for their calls. **********Only after informing customers of the choices available may the new local operating companies route long- distance calls through A.T.& T.'s lines for those customers who have not designated a provider of long-distance service.

Smith, received some unexpected first-hand evidence that the new sports car was quickly becoming a hit. He was awakened at his Bloomfield Hills, Mich., home at 1 A.M. one night by a phone call from an exuberant Corvette buyer in California who wanted to compliment him on G.M.'s newest product. **********The caller is not alone in his admiration for the new car.  Analysts say that not since the Chrysler Corporation reintroduced the convertible in the winter of 1981 has a new American auto sparked such enthusiasm. **********In fact, dealers around the country report difficulties in keeping the expensive car, which carries a base sticker price of $21,800, in the showroom. Even Chevrolet's announcement in early July that it was recalling the first 10,000 1984 Corvettes to replace defective brake components has not appeared to slow sales. **********''All of the Corvettes we've gotten in have been sold out before they even arrived,'' said Russ Barr, a salesman at Mike Maher Chevrolet in Grosse Pointe, Mich. **********And in suburban San Diego, Claude Hunter, a salesman at Dick Grihalva Chevrolet, says: ''We can't keep them in stock. We've got a waiting list. Whenever one comes in, we just call a customer to come down and pick it up.'' He added that since the dealership could not keep a demonstrator on the lot, customers were buying their Corvettes without test-driving them. **********Between April and June, Chevrolet sold 10,110 Corvettes, including some leftover 1982 models. That was up 50.5 percent from sales of 6,717 in the period last year. (The company did not build a 1983 Corvette in anticipation of the early introduction of the 1984 version). **********Including cars in transit to dealers, G.M. had only about a 20-day supply of Corvettes in late June. A 60-day inventory is considered normal in the auto industry. The low supply is one indica-tion of how sold out dealers are, said David Healy, automotive analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert. Output Is Limited **********Chevrolet has added to the tightness in supply by limiting production at its assembly plant in Bowling Green, Ky. As a result, its output of about 100 Corvettes a day is just keeping pace with sales, said Ralph Kramer, a Chevrolet spokesman. Furthermore, the company plans to build only 37,000 Corvettes in the 1984 model year, which extends to the fall of 1984. **********Chevrolet officials say privately that their production plans remain cautious because they are not convinced that the strong demand will continue. **********For G.M., the Corvette represents only a small part of the company's auto output, which is expected to reach more than 3.9 million cars this year. But the Corvette's real value, analysts say, is its ability to lure curious customers into showrooms and at the same time help improve the image of other Chevrolet cars. **********''It does not mean a hell of a lot for G.M.'s profitability,'' said Joseph Philippi, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds. ''But there is no question that it is a traffic builder.'' **********The Corvette, first introduced by Chevrolet in 1953, has long had a cult following. This was true even in the late 1970's and early 1980's, when it became clear that with its dated, rather gaudy design and lackluster performance, the Corvette was losing some of its market to European and Japanese sports cars, such as the Porsche, Datsun 280-Z and the Mazda RX-7. First Big Change Since '68 **********But the long-awaited 1984 Corvette model, the first completely redesigned Corvette since 1968, has been praised by leading auto magazines. With its sleek styling, video-game-style dashboard electronics, and its overhauled engine and drive train, the car is winning back many who had defected to the imports. **********''We're getting people who drive Mercedes and Porsches - doctors and lawyers,'' said Nick Bartos, sales manager at Merollis Chevrolet in East Detroit, Mich. **********Industry analysts agree that it is still too early to gauge whether the Corvette will make permanent inroads in the upper-income market dominated by high-performance European sports cars. **********''I would have been surprised if it hadn't had this kind of initial reception,'' said Harvey Heinbach, auto analyst with Merrill Lynch. ''But I don't think you can judge anything by the first couple of months. The question is staying power.'' The Typical Buyer **********Analysts also wonder whether the new Corvette has not been priced out of its area of traditional strength, the youth-oriented market, and into one of older professionals. Preliminary data indicate that the typical buyer of the 1984 Corvette is a male in his mid-30's or early 40's who earns more than $50,000 a year, said Jack Madejehick, Chevrolet's director of marketing information. **********''Because of the Corvette's price, Chevrolet is going to have to go after higher-income buyers than in the past,'' said David Power, president of J.D. Power & Associates, a consumer research group that specializes in the auto industry. ''And in the long run, I don't think you can steal that many Porsche drivers away.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/21/world/no-word-on-kidnapped-girl-as-deadline-passes-in-rome.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-07-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 97, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "No Word on Kidnapped Girl As Deadline Passes in Rome", "print_headline": "No Word on Kidnapped Girl As Deadline Passes in Rome", "body_text": " **********A midnight deadline passed early today with no word on whether kidnappers had fulfilled their pledge to kill the abducted daughter of a Vatican messenger unless Mehmet Ali Agca, the papal assailant, was freed. **********The abductors had demanded the release of Mr. Agca in their first contact with authorities days after the 15-year-old schoolgirl, Emanuela Orlandi, was seized at a Rome bus stop June 22.

About 5.36 million shares, or about 38.8 percent, were estimated to have been cast for GAF's present management. **********''There may be some duplications and some revocations,'' Mr. Heyman said, adding that he believed the outcome would not be altered even if some shareholders did switch. ''Considering GAF's conduct last week, shareholders may wish to change their votes in our favor,'' he said. **********The bitter proxy contest has focused on the company's recent decision to liquidate by selling its two major businesses: building products and chemicals. Mr. Heyman objects to the proposed sale of the company's building products division to the Southwestern General Corporation for $140 million. He said it is the wrong time, the wrong price and the wrong buyer. He does not object to the sale of the chemical unit to the Allied Corporation for $410 million, although he said the company might possibly have made a better deal if the transaction had not been negotiated during the proxy fight. Stock Price Erosion Cited **********In his statement to shareholders last week, Mr. Werner said that the liquidation plan was aimed at maximizing the value of the company's stock and returning some of the company's value to shareholders. The dissidents charged that during the last 20 years - the period that Mr. Werner has been chief executive of the company - GAF's stock has lost more than 80 percent of its value. **********At the annual meeting on Thursday, Mr. Werner said that GAF would not pay a quarterly dividend on common stock, though it would pay a quarterly dividend of 30 cents to holders of convertible preferred stock. The common dividend omission, Mr. Werner said, resulted from restrictions in the company's loan agreements."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/14/world/fr.html": {"writer_name": "John Vinocur", "pub_date": "1983-12-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 632, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FR", "print_headline": "FR", "body_text": " **********ANCE TIGHTENS SECURITY AROUND ITS TO P OFFICIALS **********PARIS, Dec. 13 - The French Government has taken precautionary measures to head off possible attacks by Middle Eastern squads on President Francois Mitterrand and other leaders. **********Gates at the presidential palace have been shut, and the streets where some officials live are being heavily patrolled. **********At the same time, the Government has given no hint about whether it plans reprisals for the bomb attack Monday on the French Embassy in Kuwait or the ambush in a Beirut street today that took the life a French paratrooper on patrol. **********The Government condemned the ''odious act'' in Kuwait and expressed confidence that the Kuwaiti authorities would hunt down and try the attackers. **********Because the attack caused only two slight injuries at the French Embassy, the French Government's statement calling attention to Kuwait's responsibility was taken here as a sign that no reprisals were contemplated. **********The precautionary measures against a raid in Paris have gradually become apparent since the bomb explosion in Beirut on Oct. 23 that killed 58 French paratroopers. An almost simultaneous explosion at the United States Marine headquarters killed 240 American servicemen. **********Several weeks after the attack, Mr. Mitterrand told a national television audience that it would not go unpunished, and French aircraft struck at the installations of a Shiite militia group near Baalbek in Lebanon a month after the original raid.   One Lane Is for the Palace **********Officials decline to enumerate the new security measures, but the heavy green steel doors at the main entrance to Elysee Palace, the official presidential residence, are now shut at all times, opening only for announced official visitors. Previously, the doors were left open, allowing passers-by on Rue Faubourg St. Honore a glimpse at the comings and goings of guests at the palace, although the public was not allowed to enter. **********Traffic on the street has been routed so that a special lane is for cars entering Elysee Palace. **********The police have also tightened controls for entrance to some ministries and have closed Rue de Bi evre on the Left Bank where Mr. Mitterrand has a private apartment. **********Heavy barricades and police details have also appeared on other small streets, and officials have privately suggested that they relate to tightened security for members of the Cabinet. **********No specific threats against French leaders have been officially reported, although the press here has quoted Teheran newspaper articles containing intimations that more attacks of the kind in Beirut might be expected. **********Since the French contingent joined the multinational force in Lebanon in September 1982, 78 of its members have been killed, according to published totals. The pattern here has been for attacks related to the French presence in the Middle East to raise the level of public interest only briefly. **********Attention in the press has quickly subsided, and no firmly rooted campaign to pull the troops out has developed, although opposition politicians frequently accuse the Government of having no clear policy on Lebanon and of being too closely tied to United States actions there.   Attacks Linked to Gulf War **********Newspaper commentaries and opposition politicians often connect attacks by Shiite or other Islamic militants, such as the bombing of the French Embassy in Kuwait, to French help for Iraq in its war against Iran. **********Mr. Mitterrand has publicly said France is helping Iraq to prevent its defeat by the Iranian Government of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. **********The future of the Palestinians was reported to have been the chief topic of an hourlong conversation today between Mr. Mitterrand and King Hussein of Jordan. **********The King said afterward that Mr. Arafat ''is always welcome, without conditions, in Jordan.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/11/business/last-minute-push-for-ira-s.html": {"writer_name": "William Blair", "pub_date": "1983-04-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 954, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LAST MINUTE PUSH FOR I.R.A.'S", "print_headline": "LAST MINUTE PUSH FOR I.R.A.'S", "body_text": " **********With only five days remaining before the deadline for filing Federal personal income tax returns, financial institutions in New York City and around the country are reporting a last-minute surge in depositors opening Individual Retirement Accounts to qualify for a deduction on 1982 taxes. **********''They've really been coming in in waves, especially since April 1,'' said Cynthia Bailey of the Chase Manhattan Bank. Some other I.R.A.-sponsoring institutions have been reporting averages of 5,000 to 7,000 new accounts a day in recent weeks, as savers seek to beat the April 15 tax deadline. **********The institutions are encouraging this rush to open the retirement accounts in nationwide promotional campaigns. Big newspaper display advertisements and spots on radio and television are touting the investment and tax opportunities offered by I.R.A.'s. **********The ads are getting results: more than half the accounts Merrill Lynch has started since Jan.1 - 171,000, as of late last week - will have been opened in the month before April 15, one executive of the brokerage house estimated. Lures Take Many Forms **********Some securities firms have done more than advertise to lure I.R.A.  investors. In New York City, for example, Merrill Lynch has twice held an ''I.R.A. Night at the Waldorf,'' in the Empire Room at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. A rival brokerage house, Dean Witter Reynolds, is offering a ''round-the-clock'' telephone message center until midnight Friday, for those who wish to sign up for I.R.A.'s and ''reduce your 1982 taxes legally.'' **********Up-to-date figures on how much money has been poured into I.R.A.'s is not available. But by the end of February, investments in I.R.A.'s and Keogh retirement plans totaled $55.4 billion, a 73 percent increase over the same month last year, according to the Federal Reserve Bank. Keogh plans are for the self-employed and represent a small portion of the total. **********Joseph R. Coyne, a spokesman for the Federal Reserve, said its figures represent at least 90 percent of the total money that has been placed in these accounts before March 1. He said that $50.4 billion, or 91 percent of the most recent compilation, had been made in commercial banks and thrift institutions. Such deposits are among those protected by Federal deposit insurance. **********While financial officers were hailing the ''very healthy growth'' in I.R.A. investments, Daniel S. Buser, a spokesman for the American Bankers Association, observed that ''there's still a tremendous potential out there'' because only 1 out of every 10 eligible wageearners had participated. He said that Internal Revenue Service projections for the 1982 tax year indicate that more than 7 million new I.R.A.'s and Keogh plans will be added to the 3.1 million that existed in 1981. **********This year's promotional campaign is far more subdued than at the start of 1982, when the right to open an I.R.A. was extended to all workers with earned income of at least $2,000. Financial advisers have widely recommended that anyone who could afford to open an I.R.A. do so. **********Absent from the current promotions is last year's heavily advertised assertion that a young wage-earner could expect to accumulate more than $1 million by putting aside $2,000 annually for 40 years at an assumed annual interest rate of 12 percent. Today's interest rates for many investments are well below that figure. A Myriad of Options Available **********The financial institutions scrambling to offer I.R.A.'s are commercial banks, savings and loan associations, mutual savings banks, credit unions, insurance companies, mutual fund concerns and brokerage houses. **********These institutions are enticed by the prospect of handling the deposits of 110 million wage-earners, each of whom is permitted to set aside up to $2,000 annually - $2,250 for an individual with a nonworking spouse and $4,000 for a working couple - in the tax-free retirement accounts. **********The earliest that withdrawals can be made from an I.R.A. without penalty is when the saver is 59 1/2 years old. All income earned from I.R.A.'s is taxed at ordinary income rates when withdrawn. Early withdrawals bring an additional 10 percent penalty. **********In order to qualify for a 1982 tax deduction, said Ellen Murphy, a spokesman for the Internal Revenue Service, ''you have to establish the I.R.A. and make the contribution by April 15,'' although an automatic four-month extension to Aug. 15 is available to those who file tax form 4868 by Friday. If a person has already filed a return but wishes to open an I.R.A. before the deadline, the deduction can still be claimed by opening an account and filing an amended return on form 1040X. **********One action not permitted by the I.R.S., Miss Murphy said, is to file a tax return that claims an I.R.A. contribution as a deduction before it has actually been made. She said that no reporting to the agency of an I.R.A. opening is now required. More Information Available **********For the average saver, the right choice to make among a veritable smorgasbord of packaged I.R.A. options can be baffling. There are passbook accounts, fixed or variable rate certificates, mutual funds, money market accounts, insurance annuity contracts, stocks and bonds, or any combination of these from which to choose. **********Cecilia Sobanski, who attended one of Merrill Lynch's I.R.A.  sessions at the Waldorf, said the sponsoring institutions were far better informed than a year ago when she first opened an account. **********''We're really giving high priority this year to providing customer understanding of the basics,'' agreed Cynthia Bailey, who manages a financial advisory program at Chase Manhattan. ''One frequent misconception was that you had to put the maximum $2,000 in every year to have an account.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/14/business/better-sales-help-cbs-net-jump-35.9-in-quarter.html": {"writer_name": "Sandra Salmans", "pub_date": "1983-07-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 529, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BETTER SALES HELP CBS NET JUMP 35.9% IN QUARTER", "print_headline": "BETTER SALES HELP CBS NET JUMP 35.9% IN QUARTER", "body_text": " **********CBS Inc., citing improved sales by its records business and stringent cost controls, yesterday reported significantly higher income for the second quarter. **********The company said its net income for the three months ended June 30 rose 35.9 percent, to $58.7 million, or $1.98 a share, from $43.2 million, or $1.55 a share on fewer shares outstanding, in the same period a year ago. **********Second-quarter revenues rose 6.4 percent, to $1.06 billion, from $996.4 million a year earlier.  The company said its net income in the latest quarter reflected foreign exchange losses of $10 million, of which $8 million occurred in its international records business, mainly in Brazil. The loss was partly offset by increased interest income in Brazil. **********Thomas H. Wyman, CBS's chairman, president and chief executive, said that the results were ahead of company projections and marked the start of ''a solid earnings turnaround at CBS this year.'' **********In last year's second quarter, CBS discontined CBS Cable, a programming venture, and sold Pacific Stereo, a chain of high fidelity retail stores. As a result, income from continuing operations was $48.6 million, or $1.74 a share, a year ago. Earnings Growth from Records **********Most of the earnings growth in the latest quarter came from the records group, which had its best second quarter ever. Pretax income was $28.2 million on revenues of $280.3 million, compared with pretax income of $3.4 million on revenues of $257 million in the same period a year ago. **********Domestic record sales were strong, propelled by such best-selling albums as Michael Jackson's ''Thriller'' and Men at Work, the Australian rock group. But the records group also benefited from several cost-cutting measures taken last year, including plant and branch office closings and layoffs, according to J. Garrett Blowers, a CBS spokesman. **********CBS's broadcast group reported pretax income of $103.3 million on revenues of $563.2 million, compared with $102.7 million in pretax income on revenues of $545.1 million in the second quarter of 1982. Erosion in Television Income **********Television income was eroded because the network, anticipating strong advertising demand last spring, held back an unusually large amount of its inventory - commercial time - rather than selling it before the season began. CBS's gamble failed to pay off when demand proved unexpectedly soft for the held-over time. **********Acknowledging this, Mr. Wyman said that the broadcast group's flat profits in the face of a weak demand for advertising time during the quarter ''demonstrates the effectiveness of the group's cost management efforts.'' In the quarter, the group's expenses rose only 4 percent, an exceptionally low increase. **********''The burning question is whether they can keep costs at 4 percent for the next six months,'' said John McConville of Morgan Stanley.  Cost control may continue to be very important, because advertisers have so far been reluctant to accept the networks' prices and make commitments up front for next season, he said. **********Revenues and profits also improved for the CBS/Columbia group, which includes the Ideal Toy Corporation, acquired last August, and for the publishing group, which includes consumer magazines and textbooks."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/25/world/scientists-dubious-over-missile-plan.html": {"writer_name": "Charles Mohr", "pub_date": "1983-03-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 766, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SCIENTISTS DUBIOUS OVER MISSILE PLAN", "print_headline": "SCIENTISTS DUBIOUS OVER MISSILE PLAN", "body_text": " **********Some scientists said today that President Reagan's proposal to develop a defense against nuclear attack may never be technically feasible, but that it would be strategically ''dangerous'' if it was ever made workable.  Other scientists defended the concept. **********Dr. Wolfgang Panofsky of Stanford University, who was invited to dine at the White House with Mr. Reagan Wednesday night but declined, said he found the President's request that scientists join in an intensive effort to build a workable defensive shield against ballistic missiles to be ''somewhat spiritually troubling.'' **********The President made his request in a speech later Wednesday night.  Dr. Panofsky and a number of other figures in American science said they doubted that scientists could be marshaled into an effort resembling the Manhattan Project that produced the first nuclear weapon in World War II. **********In his speech, Mr. Reagan said he was seeking a ''vision of hope'' that nuclear weapons could be made ''impotent'' by the development of a practical defensive shield. Aides said the President was not betting on any single technology but wanted intensified research both in space-based stations harboring directed-energy weapons that might shoot down missiles and land-based antimissile systems. The President said it might require decades to achieve workable systems. Called 'Extremely Dangerous' **********Dr. Victor Weisskopf of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, one of the scientists who did meet with the President Wednesday night at the White House, said he believed the President's goal would be ''extremely dangerous and destabilizing.'' **********A number of other scientists and nonscientists took the same view.  In contrast to President Reagan's argument that a nuclear warfare defensive system would make for a safer world, these critics argued that any success in developing antimissile defenses would undermine deterrence of nuclear war, lead to a stepped-up arms race and eventually to pre-emptive warfare in space to destroy the proposed defensive platforms there. **********Several of the scientists also expressed the view that present ''support'' or ''benign'' military uses of space that enhance United States military security would be endangered by moves to place weapons and countermeasure devices in space. Such support applications now include the use of satellites for sensor stations to warn of hostile missile launches, highly detailed reconnaisance and surveillance of the Soviet Union and the rest of the world, and a complex network of communications. **********Critics also asserted that the President's plan would endanger the prospects for nuclear arms control agreements with the Soviet Union by undermining the 1972 treaty limiting antiballistic missile defenses and accelerating a race to achieve a workable complex of such defenses. 'Pie in the Sky' **********Jeremy Stone, director of the Federation of American Scientists, said ''the ABM treaty is not only the most important treaty we have, but it is the foundation for future treaties on offensive weapons.'' **********He added: ''If either side thought the other was going to withdraw from the ABM treaty there would be no way at all to get agreement on offensive arms treaties; each side would have to reserve the right to build whatever weapons it needed to penetrate the defense.'' **********As Secretary of Defense in the 1960's, Robert S. McNamara championed the view that it was against the national security interests of both the United States and the Soviet Union to seek a nuclear warfare defense. In a broadcast this morning he called Mr.  Reagan's proposal ''pie in the sky.'' **********Dr. Edward Teller, who led the effort to develop thermonuclear weapons, is one scientist who has urged a program much like that discussed by the President Wednesday night. Dr. Teller is close to Mr. Reagan's science adviser, George Keyworth. Continuing Research Backed **********Even the critical scientists said they approved of past and continuing research and development efforts to explore ballistic missile defense and space-based military applications so as to prevent ''technological surprise'' by the Soviet Union. **********''But,'' said Dr. Weisskopf, ''I can't understand why the President put it on the front burner with so much fanfare unless his purpose was political, to sell his military budget to Congress.'' **********''I won't exclude that such a system might work,'' he added, but said it would not be practical for a very long time. He said that if the Soviet Union developed a missile defense first, ''we would be completely defenseless.'' He added, ''Either side would have to shoot down what the other side had in space -it would be the beginning of a nuclear war.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/13/business/kaiser-shows-wider-deficit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-04-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 181, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Kaiser Shows Wider Deficit", "print_headline": "Kaiser Shows Wider Deficit", "body_text": " **********The Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corporation reported a deepening first-quarter loss today of $28.8 million, compared with a loss of $24.9 million last year.

It is difficult for Washington to reject outright the idea of the Warsaw Pact and North Atlantic Treaty Organization agreeing on renunciation of use of force because NATO has often stated that it is a defensive alliance and would not be the first to attack. **********Moreover, former President Jimmy Carter revealed in his recent memoirs that he made a similar proposal for an East-West ban on the first use of force when he met with Leonid I. Brezhnev, the former Soviet leader, in Vienna in June 1979. Zbigniew Brzezinski, Mr.  Carter's national security adviser, said Mr. Brezhnev showed interest in the idea, but nothing came of it at that time. Idea First Saw Light in 1955 **********The idea for such nonaggression pacts between the rival blocs was first put forth in 1955 at the summit meeting attended by the leaders of the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France. Nikolai V. Bulganin, the Soviet Prime Minister, proposed it as a step toward dissolving both alliances. It was rejected by the Western allies as a ploy to weaken NATO and separate West Germany from the West. **********Mr. Hughes, addressing the Warsaw Pact proposal, observed that as President Reagan said at his news conference on Wednesday night, ''We will consider this proposal in consultation with our allies.'' **********''Peace with justice must always be this nation's highest priority,'' he said. ''We are, and will continue to be, receptive to ideas which would genuinely promote peace and peaceful settlements of disputes. Our discussions with our allies will consider whether this is such a proposal.'' **********Mr. Hughes said that, at the Bonn summit talks last year, the NATO leaders pledged that none of their weapons would ever be used except ''in response to aggression.'' **********''Indeed, the principle of nonagression is a key provision of the United Nations Charter,'' he said. 'We Will Look at It' **********''At first glance, it does not seem to represent anything new,'' Mr. Hughes said of the Warsaw Pact plan, ''but as the President said, we will look at it.'' **********He added: ''We learned from bitter experience between the two world wars that simple declarations of peaceful intent are not enough. What we need are concrete results, which not only reduce the danger of war, but which contribute to an atmosphere of increased trust. To this end, the proposals we have made in the Geneva and Vienna negotiations on both nuclear and conventional forces are designed to achieve genuine, substantial cuts in the arsenals of both sides, as well as measures to enhance mutual confidence.'' **********While the Reagan Administration seemed unenthusiastic about the Warsaw Pact statement, the candidate for Chancellor of West Germany's main opposition party was much more positive. **********Hans-Jochen Vogel, of the Social Democratic Party, in Washington for talks with Mr. Reagan on Friday and Secretary of State George P.  Shultz today, told reporters that the nonaggression proposal was ''in the direction I agree with.'' **********''I have positive feelings, but I have to go into the details,'' Mr. Vogel said. ''Use of military force should be abandoned in all directions.''

It is a geographic pattern repeated across the breadth of the Soviet Union. Such is the tilt of the land that more than four-fifths of the country's 4,300 cubic kilometers of river water flow north into the Arctic - and away from the more southerly heartland, where three-quarters of the Soviet population lives and four-fifths of its industrial and agricultural production is situated. And it is here, in the prototypical Russian landscape of endless fields, slow rivers, ornate cabins and white birches, that Soviet planners have decided to start correcting what has been referred to as nature's ''mistake'' by channeling some of the waters from the unproductive north to the sunny, fertile south. **********Two Decades of Planning **********It is an idea that has intrigued Russian engineers for more than a century, and one on which at least 60 technical institutes have been hard at work for the last two decades. The project - actually two projects, one for each side of the Ural Mountains - is as enticingly simple as it is staggering in scope. If realized, it would rank as one of the boldest manipulations of nature ever attempted. **********On the European side of the Urals, the plan calls for ''throwing'' waters from several major northern rivers across the watershed near Vologda and into the south-flowing Volga River through an array of dams, pumping stations, reservoirs, lakes and canals. **********The Siberian project calls for nothing less than a canal some 1,500 miles long - the distance from New York to New Orleans - to channel water from the Irtysh River, a tribuary of the Ob, south to the parched plains of the republics of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. **********The colossal projects have provoked about as rancorous and public a debate as the Soviet Union has ever known or tolerated. The heated polemics have spilled from the closed rooms of technical institutes and party caucuses and into public halls, the national press, unofficial tracts and the streets. Northerners Resist Plan **********Russians from the economically depressed north have assailed what they see as a crippling blow to the cradle of their culture.  Leaders of the Central Asian republics and the European south have lobbied extraordinarily hard for what they consider their fair share of the country's water, arguing that with it they could become the breadbasket of the Soviet Union while without it they will be unable to sustain a teeming population expected to double by the end of the century. **********Environmentalists have raised the alarm that toying with nature on so monumental a scale will have consequences that no scientist can predict -the Arctic Ocean may ice over, climates will change all across the Soviet Union and Europe, large areas will turn to swamp and others may dry up. **********Economists and scientists have been divided. Proponents speak enthusiastically of each cubic kilometer of diverted water providing 500 million rubles, or about $700 million, in new revenues and 50,000 jobs, of millions of acres of fertile lands brought into production, of saving the shrinking Caspian and Aral seas, of guaranteeing sufficient water for navigation and hydroelectric plants along the Volga. Opponents have accused the others of succumbing to the classic Soviet addiction to gigantism, and they have produced their own figures to argue that the cost of so enormous a project - economic and environmental - will outstrip any conceivable gain. The Go-Ahead Is Given **********Successive party conclaves cautiously authorized more studies and plans - until last May. Then, buried in the Communist Party's Food Program, a long-term agricultural plan, came the almost incidental directive ''to realize by 1990 the construction necessary for the first stage of the diversion of part of the flow of northern rivers to the Volga River basin.'' It was, in effect, the first concrete directive to begin work on the project. **********According to officials and engineers in Vologda, actual work on the dams, canals and pumping stations has yet to begin, and they said it was unlikely the resources would be made available until the next five-year plan starting in 1986. **********But in an interview published recently in the trade union newspaper Trud, Nikolai S. Grishchenko, head of the institute for research and development of the river diversion project, declared that the experts were no longer divided. ''Their conclusions,'' he said, ''are quite definite - the diversion of the flow of northern and Siberian rivers is possible and essential.'' **********Mr. Grishchenko insisted that the impact on the environment and on historical sites would be minimal, but he conceded that some price would be paid. ''First of all,'' he said, ''however we may wish this, we are powerless to stop scientific-technical progress just because it leads to certain changes in the natural balance.'' Lands Sacred to Russians **********Although the first stage envisioned in the food program is a relative drop in the total plan, it is here in northern Russia that resistance to the project has taken some of its strongest and most emotional forms. To Russians, especially those of a nationalist bent, these are sacred lands. It is here, along the endless waterways of the north, that Russian culture took root in the great monasteries whose whitewashed walls still tower over many a lake and stream, and in the towns of fanciful wooden houses still surmounted by innumerable onion domes of former churches. **********Russian artists and writers still flock here to commune with the surviving spirit of ancient Russia, and not surprisingly the most impassioned opponents of the diversions have included writers of rural Russia. Huge Cost an Obstacle **********Many critics have found little comfort in the assurances of experts that historial monuments such as the 14th-century Kirillov Belozersk monastery, whose tall walls rise from the banks of Lake Siverskoye, or the churches of Kargopol, or such local peculiarities as the translucent snetka fish of Lake Beloye will not suffer from the changed water levels.

ABC has $32 million worth of time, or 2 percent of its 4,859 30-second spots, looking for an advertiser. **********That is not bad for broadcasts that are six months away (or, in the case of the summer Olympics, nearly a year) and are charging $260,000 for a 30-second spot in prime time. That compares with $180,000 for 30 seconds on ABC's ratings hit ''Dynasty.'' **********''We're very pleased,'' said John T. Lazarus, the 42-year-old vice president of sports marketing and sales at the ABC Television Network. ''If there were a timetable, we're way ahead.'' **********Altogether, ABC, which paid $315 million for the rights to broadcast the two Olympic Games, expects to raise $625 million in advertising. It still has to pay for producing the Games, A.T.& T. line charges and, of course, agency commissions, but ''somewhere, there will be a nice, fair profit for us,'' the understated Mr. Lazarus said. **********Mr. Lazarus, who has been a media supervisor at both Grey Advertising and Foote, Cone & Belding, joined ABC in 1970 as an account executive for network sports sales. He has been with the network ever since, except for a year out as director of broadcasting for Bowie Kuhn, the baseball commissioner. **********In terms of advertising, the Olympic Games have the longest lead time of any television programming. In 1981, ABC set a price of $215,000 for 30 seconds, for advertisers who got in on the ground floor. Since then, there have been two price increases, ''a combination of supply and demand,'' Mr. Lazarus said. **********At the start, the ABC people drew up a list of potential advertisers who would want to be associated with the Olympics and who would pay accordingly. ''In prime time and daytime, the world is your oyster, but in sports, it's confined to certain kinds of advertisers,'' said Mr. Lazarus's boss, Jake Keever, who is in charge of all advertising sales. ''So you go down the line and come up with a selling plan: how much for beer, how much for soft drinks, and so on.'' For the first time, computer manufacturers made the list. **********Coca-Cola took over the entire soft- drink category, for $42 million. Anheuser-Busch and Miller divided the $40 million beer category, while Sears and K Mart split retailing. For the winter Olympics, the sole car maker will be Chevrolet; for summer, General Motors will share the category with Datsun. **********What role, if any, advertisers will play in the 1988 summer Olympics in South Korea remains to be seen. The Koreans and the Olympic committee are rumored to be putting together a package priced at $750 million to $1 billion. That is not strictly comparable to the $225 million Los Angeles price tag since it would include a number of additional revenue sources, such as sponsors' licenses to use the Olympics logotype. **********Still, the notion of a $1 billion Olympics has led some people to speculate that Los Angeles might be the last summer Olympics on advertiser-supported free television. (The 1988 winter Olympic Games from Calgary, Alberta, are expected to be handled traditionally.) ''It isn't reasonable to think that a network could spend that kind of money and make a profit,'' Mr. Lazarus said. Furthermore, Seoul's distance from the United States will mean a 24-hour broadcast delay, conceivably reducing viewer interest. **********One solution could be a joint venture between a network and a cable channel, such as ABC and ESPN, the man from ABC said. Each would show exclusive and original programming, but such major attractions as women's gymnastics, say, would be reserved for ESPN subscribers. ''It's still the Olympic Games, and it's only every four years,'' Mr. Lazarus said.

Sher, acting director of the Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations, who arrived in Israel today. Rumania has not indicated its position, he said. ''We've been in contact with a lot of different countries,'' he explained. ''We are working very, very hard to try to find a place.'' **********Israeli Says U.S. Asked **********Mr. Sher declined to say whether Israel had been approached, but Yitzhak Feinberg, the spokesman for Israel's Justice Ministry, said the request had been made and that Israeli officials would meet with Mr. Sher to discuss this and other cases in the next few days. **********(In Washington, John Russell, a Justice Department spokesman, said that Mr. Sher was in Israel for a variety of reasons, one of which was to ask the Israelis to take Archbishop Trifa.) **********The Israelis will make a decision, Mr. Feinberg explained, only after examining the evidence to see if Archbishop Trifa could be tried here, as was Adolf Eichmann, Hitler's chief of operations, in 1961. The Hitler aide was kidnapped by Israeli intelligence agents in Argentina and brought by force to Israel, where he was executed. **********''It would be foolish to bring over somebody knowing you have no case against him,'' Mr. Feinberg added.  An Israeli involved in gathering evidence against former Nazis said that the Justice Ministry's initial decision, now being reconsidered, was to reject the American request. Mr. Feinberg denied the report.  ''When they turned to Israel,'' he said, ''we didn't say no. We can't say no to something like this. And we started to look into the matter.'' **********American law has no provision for prosecuting former Nazis unless they committed crimes against the United States or against American citizens. Therefore, since the Office of Special Investigations was set up in 1979 to hunt down former Nazis who had taken refuge in the United States, it has sought to show that the individuals made false declarations - hiding their Nazi past -when entering the United States. **********This has served as a basis for stripping them of their naturalized citizenship. A subsequent step has been to seek deportation orders against them. More than 200 individuals are being investigated. **********Consequently, if Israel agrees to receive the deported Archbishop Trifa, the case could be only the first in a long series.  Efraim Zuroff, a researcher here for the Justice Department, said the next one is likely to be Ivan John Demjanjuk, a Ukrainian who has been stripped of his citizenship for having operated the gas chamber at the Treblinka death camp. Now living in Cleveland, he is due to receive a court ruling soon on his deportation. **********Archbishop Trifa, now in his late 60's, is the spiritual leader of 35,000 members of the Rumanian Orthodox Episcopate, based in Grass Lake, Mich. **********The Government produced evidence that in 1941, when he was active in an anti-Semitic Bucharest organization called the Iron Guard, he wrote inflammatory newspaper articles and gave speeches that incited pogroms. Corpses of Jews were hung in a slaughterhouse and labeled, ''kosher meat,'' according to Mr. Zuroff, although there has been no finding that Archbishop Trifa killed anyone himself. Membership Concealed **********The Government showed that when he entered the United States in 1950, he concealed his membership in the Iron Guard and said that he had been confined in Nazi concentration camps. In fact, the Government maintained, he had lived in Nazi Germany in comfortable housing. **********Although he fought the denaturalization proceedings in a protracted court battle, he dropped his resistance to deportation last October and asked Switzerland to accept him.

The sentence was a result of plea bargaining that suddenly cut short the trial of nine people charged with being underground activists of the outlawed Pan Africanist Congress. **********The journalist, Joe Thloloe, a former reporter whose newspaper career had been suspended by a Government ''banning'' order that made it a crime for him to write for publication, had originally faced far more serious charges of conspiracy to commit terrorism and furthering the aims of an illegal organization. **********Of the eight people charged with him, seven had reportedly given the police statements after being held without charge for interrogation. One, a former exile, had pleaded guilty to being sent back into the country by the Pan Africanist Congress to help lay the groundwork for acts of sabotage. **********The trial was regarded as having unusual significance, for it was the first in several years involving the activities of the Pan Africanist Congress, a rival as a movement of resistance to white rule of the more prominent African National Congress.

In that year, as a youth of only 17, he was arrested and charged with the Pan Africanist Congress's founder and leader, the late Robert Sobukwe, in a protest march against the law the requires blacks to carry special passes, or ''reference books,'' when they are in supposedly ''white'' areas. **********The terrorism charges, which he denied, said a small machine gun had been found hidden in the roof of his home in the black township of Soweto at the time of his arrest last June. **********But the elaborate machinery of prosecution stalled when the first witness, Sipho Ntshingane, indicated he was prepared to testify that he had been tortured by the security police until he agreed to put his name to a false statement. **********In a highly unusual verdict scarcely two weeks before Mr.  Ntshingane indicated his readiness to defy the police, a magistrate in a suburb called Kempton Park acquitted four blacks on terrorism charges on the ground that state witnesses had been assaulted or otherwise intimidated to give evidence against them. **********In an effort to avoid further embarrassment to the police in the Thloloe case, the prosecution agreed to drop charges against five of the accused, including Harrison Nogqekele, the man who had originally pleaded guilty, if the remaining four would plead guilty to the lesser charge of possessing banned books.

This transformation is an effort to accommodate the instability and uncertainty that has marked the economic environment of the last 10 years. **********It represents the abandonment of a strategy of mass production of standardized products for stable, mass markets in favor of more flexible and adaptable systems of production and marketing. This in turn requires a reorientation in our thinking about national economic policy. It is too early to assess the full implications of this change in business strategy, but some things are already clear. **********First, the pressures producing these changes are not inevitable or irreversible. The business environment of the earlier postwar period was produced by an institutional structure designed to stabilize the domestic economy and insure its expansion. The instability of recent years is largely attributable to the increasing internationalization of markets and the absence of institutions capable of stabilizing the world economy. **********Through the debt crisis of the major developing countries, the United States has now acquired the leverage to impose the requisite stability on the international ecomomic order. But we have used that leverage to thwart the development of stabilizing institutions. **********We have opposed measures that would stabilize commodity markets, restore fixed exchange rates and promote international expansion, insisting instead on policies of restraint and contraction. We have thus favored an environment in which American business organization as now constituted is least able to compete and, in this way, we have forced the reorientation of organization and productive technology now under way. **********Second, protectionism will not remove the pressures generating these changes. The problem is that United States markets are too small, too unstable and growing too slowly to sustain existing organizational and technological structures. More trade, not less, would thus be required to make those structures viable. **********To the extent that protectionism is incomplete, moreover, it is likely to increase the advantage of competitors like Japan, whose technology and organization already have the flexibility that our businesses are seeking to introduce. On the other hand, given the reorientation now under way, protection is unlikely to have the dire consequences for our standard of living that its opponents foresee. As the structural changes are completed, our industry will be increasingly less dependent for productivity gains on economies of scale that only large international markets can sustain. **********Third, given the direction in which we are moving, ''industrial policy'' in the form of a Federal effort to provide direction to national economic development does not make sense either. Such a policy would be meaningful as part of an effort to restore the dynamic of mass production through a new international economic order and to negotiate the United States position within it. **********Without this effort, what is required is a social policy to ease the transition away from mass production to the emergent alternative. The inherent flexibility and adaptability of this alternative obviates the need for the kind of national planning that the concept of industrial policy implies. **********What is required for the success of the emergent economic alternative is the reassertion of the legitimacy of much more conventional forms of communal activity and governmental action. The new structures appear to require institutional supports modeled on traditional structures now under attack: the public educational system, land grant colleges, the agricultural extension service, Social Security, the national railroad and highway programs, and the protections the Federal Government has provided in the past for trade union organization. **********The policy of the Reagan Administration is one reason to be concerned about such communal institutions. But a more profound reason for concern is the incentive structure inherent in the emergent forms of organization and technology compared to that inherent in the old. Two aspects of those incentives are important. **********First, in mass production, both equipment and labor skills are highly specialized to a particular make and model and production occurs in large, integrated organizations. This enables the organization to capture the returns to investments in training, research and development and the provision of much of the overhead capital. Since the business concern reaps the return, it is generally willing to make the investments. **********In flexible forms of production, labor and equipment are more general, organizational units are smaller, and both labor and technology circulate more freely among different enterprises. The private incentive to provide training and research is thus much weaker and these things must be provided by the community if they are to be provided at all. **********Second, communal institutions are required to channel competition. Competitive pressure is much greater in the new economic environment than it was in the old. The pressure will lead to growth only if business responds through innovations in the product and in the production process. Such innovation, moreover, requires a close collaboration between labor and management and between contractors and subcontractors. The importance of collaboration is underscored by Japan, which provides the model for the organizational reforms under way. **********But the competitive pressures are such that unless limited by communal institutions like trade unions and social regulations, they sooner or later force business to cut wages to labor and payments to subcontractors. Competition through exploitation then becomes an alternative to genuine innovation and destroys the collaborative relationship required for such innovation to occur. The kind of market pressure that public policy is now seeking to promote will thus prove destructive of economic progress in the long run.

Early in the week, a drop in the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market to 9 1/8 percent, plus predictions of a large decline in money supply, was enough for some analysts to conclude that the Fed was easing monetary policy. As a result, the 12 percent Treasury bonds due in 2013 rose to as high as 104 19/32, to yield 11.43 percent. **********By late Friday, however, the Fed had dashed hopes of an easing by temporarily draining reserves from the banking system on Thursday and then announcing a much smaller than expected $200 million decline in the basic money supply. By the end of the week, the 12 percent Treasury bond was offered at 102 14/32, to yield 11.69 percent.   Markets 'Overreacting' **********''While the Fed has been trying to steer a steady course,'' said Victor Change, director of marketing and research at Ehrlich-Bober Government Securities Inc., ''the markets have been overreacting in both directions.'' While last week's speculation centered on the possibility that the Fed was easing, as recently as late July and early August there had been widespread concern that the Fed might tighten policy and send overnight interest rates above 10 percent in an effort to reduce money supply growth. **********Mr. Change described last week's euphoria about a Fed easing as ''a bubble based on unrealistic expectations about how fast the Fed would change policy.'' **********Imperfect Guide **********The fluctuations in the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market - to 9.17 percent Aug. 25 from 9.85 percent Aug. 15 - should remind investors that trading in the Federal funds market is not a perfect guide to the central bank's monetary policy. Because Federal funds are traded in a market where borrowers and lenders are influenced by expectations of future rate changes, the rate on any particular day may not be the same as the rate that will eventually emerge from the Fed's policy. **********''The weekly Federal funds rate will probably trade a bit under 9 1/2 percent when fears of Fed tightening subside and slightly above 9 1/2 percent when concerns over Fed tightening reappear,'' David Jones, an economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, said in an Aug. 29 newsletter. For the near future, Mr. Jones said he expects the Fed to hold policy stable while it waits for more data about money supply growth and the economy. **********Attitudes Slower to Change **********While traders focus on the short- term outlook, investor attitudes do not change so rapidly. Since early August, there has been heavy buying of Treasury bonds at yields ranging from 12 1/8 percent to 11 3/4 percent, and analysts say that many buyers are still optimistic that yields will go lower. So long as the economy does not seem likely to overheat and rekindle inflation, the primary roadblock to lower interest rates is the Federal budget deficit and huge Treasury borrowings. **********Already many analysts are anticipating the late September sales of 4- ,7- and 20-year Treasury issues totaling $14 billion or more. If the auctions come after a few weeks of rapid money supply growth, they worry about a sharp increase in interest rates to the levels of early August or higher. **********Among those analysts who expect interest rates to come down, Michael Bazdarich, a vice president at Claremont Economic Institute, estimated that yields on Treasury bonds could drop to 10.8 percent by early October and as low as 9 percent during this business cycle. ''A slowdown in the recovery with no surge of inflation still point to lower yields,'' he said. **********But, Mr. Bazdarich said, the decline in yields have been slow to come ''because investors need evidence that their fears are not as bad as the reality.'' The Claremont economist acknowledged fears about excessive money supply growth in September ''could make for a dead market for the next few weeks or so.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/12/world/4-senators-see-reagan-at-mideast-crossroads.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-09-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 230, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "4 Senators See Reagan At Mideast Crossroads", "print_headline": "4 Senators See Reagan At Mideast Crossroads", "body_text": " **********Four senators said today that President Reagan's Middle East policy had reached a crossroads, but expressed doubt Congress would order United States Marines out of Lebanon. **********The four senators, in various television interviews, expressed concern that Mr. Reagan had not clearly or adequately defined the purpose of the American troops committed to peacekeeping duty and the consequences of recent United States casualties. **********Questions have also been raised about whether the Marines' assignment falls under the limits of the 1973 War Powers Resolution. **********''The last thing America wants is to get embroiled in their civil war,'' said Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas. **********Senator Howard H.

Small bottlers do it. Even the bakers and ketchup makers do it. With prices for sugar in the United States three times as high as the world price, industrial users are finding ingenious ways around domestic sugar quotas - one example of how protectionist fences erected by the Government are sometimes circumvented. **********In this instance, the trick is blending. Only imports of pure sugar, defined as 100 percent sucrose, are governed by quotas, which were reimposed by President Reagan last May to reinforce a domestic structure of higher prices. But if the sugar enters as 94 percent sucrose and 6 percent fructose, or 90 percent sucrose and 10 percent dextrose - blends making up much of the imports from Canada - it is just another sweetener, as far as Customs is concerned, and there is no limit to the amount that can enter the United States. **********Many American companies are taking advantage of that fact. They are using the Canadian connection to bring in liquid and dry blends from such refiners as Atlantic Sugar Ltd. of Saint John, New Brunswick; Red Path Sugars Ltd. of Toronto, and West Cane Ltd. of Oshawa, Ontario. Buffalo and Detroit are the main points of entry. **********The growing traffic in blended sugar to avoid the import restrictions is eliciting complaints from American sugar producers who want the White House to shore up the sagging quota system.  Canada, on the other hand, defends the sugar blend traffic. **********What makes it worthwhile for sugar users to go to the trouble of ordering special blends is the difference in prices between domestic sugar and imported sugar. The domestic support price for raw sugar is 21 cents a pound, compared with less than 7 cents a pound for the world price. Quotas had last been in effect in 1974 when they were dismantled during a world shortage that sent prices much higher. **********There are no limits to the imagination of the operators who have explored this loophole. The sucrose has been mixed with honey, chocolate, corn syrup and even fresh maple syrup. **********The importer pays a small tariff of 2.4 percent, and suddenly he has a product in the United States that is considerably cheaper than, and nearly equivalent to, the sugar he would otherwise have to buy from an American refiner. **********Market specialists said the blends were being offered in this country for a nickel to a dime a pound less than comparable sugar from American refiners, who have to process the high-priced domestic raw sugar. 'Windfall' Profits **********Not only are there savings for American users but there are also big ''windfall'' profits for the Canadian refiners. Canada has no quotas and minuscule tariffs on imported sugar. **********Latest import numbers show that in February, nearly as much blended sugar came into the United States as in all of 1982. The February total of 9,206 metric tons compared with 6,562 tons in January and only 10,300 tons in all of 1982. In January 1982 the total was 5 tons. Most came in from Canada. Very small but increasing amounts were also coming from Mexico, trade officials said. A metric ton is about 2,204 pounds. **********The numbers are still relatively small compared with the 2.9 million tons that enter under quota, and with total American consumption of about 10 million tons. **********But the sharp rise in imports is causing alarm in the councils of domestic growers and refiners. ''If we don't put a stop to this, it will mushroom,'' said Nicholas A. Kominus, president of the United States Cane Sugar Refiners' Association. ''It is having an adverse effect on the whole sugar trade.'' 'Trade Barriers' Opposed **********Not surprisingly, Canadian officials are quietly lobbying to keep the gates open. ''We don't want any more trade barriers,'' one Canadian representative said. **********''It's really an example of the complexities involved in trying to manage a market as diverse and slippery as the U.S. sweetener market,'' said Thomas C. Earley, vice president of Schnittker Associates, a consulting firm of agricultural economists based in Washington. **********President Reagan is being asked by the domestic industry to close the loophole by ordering quotas on the blended sugar on top of the quotas on the raw sugar. **********The White House announced Monday that the President was reviewing quotas governing imports of sugar from Central America, and some officials expect that the issue of blended sugar will be taken up as well in this review. **********Agriculture Department officials said they had begun an investigation of the blended sugar question but had not yet made a recommendation to the President. **********Many analysts, however, expect that the department will ask the President to take emergency action under Section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, which authorizes the President to mandate relief against anything seen as undermining domestic price supports. **********The United States International Trade Commission is already gearing for action. The 1933 statute requires that it make a recommendation to the President. But the law empowers the President to take immediate, emergency action without waiting for a commission recommendation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/20/world/for-a-soviet-envoy-and-son-what-a-week-finally-ends.html": {"writer_name": "David Shribman", "pub_date": "1983-08-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 735, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FOR A SOVIET ENVOY AND SON, 'WHAT A WEEK' FINALLY ENDS", "print_headline": "FOR A SOVIET ENVOY AND SON, 'WHAT A WEEK' FINALLY ENDS", "body_text": " **********After the Berezhkovs arrived in Moscow, the Government issued a protest over the incident.

Mr. Berezhkov, who has just finished a five-year tour as a First Secretary at the Soviet Embassy in Washington, was sitting in the 12th row. Beside him was his 16- year-old son, Andrei, who eight days ago disppeared with the family car, touching off an international incident over the issue of whether this was an attempt to defect.  Andrei, with his mother, Valeriya, and a Soviet official sitting behind him, smoked cigarette after cigarette. He sipped soft drinks, twirled his hair between his fingers, adjusted his stereo headset. **********''It will be good to get away,'' Andrei's father said. ''There has been too much publicity, too much for a lifetime. It will be quiet now. Life will be normal.'' **********'I'm a Russian Kid' **********According to an account provided by the Soviet Embassy, Andrei, who had been visiting his parents in Washington for the summer, returned home with the car in less than a day. Hours later a handwritten letter that began, ''I'm a Russian kid,'' was delivered to The New York Times. It contained a plea for help to remain in the United States and was signed ''Andy Berzhkov.'' **********The father said his son had not written the letter, which went on, ''I hate my country and it's rules and I love your country.'' The whole thing, Mr. Berezhkov said, was some terrible mistake. His son would be ''all right,'' the family would endure. **********But Mr. Berezhkov was determined to set something to rest - the reports in the American press that there had been trouble between him and his son. ''There is no conflict between us,'' he said to the members of the press aboard the flight, who numbered fewer than 10. ''There is no generation gap. Certainly I was always very busy - writing, traveling and working hard. Sometimes I would not see him for a month. But we were always close.'' **********''I think now we're even closer,'' he continued, running his fingers through his white hair. ''This was a great experience for him, for us, for everybody. In general, I am sorry for the fact that many of our friends have spent so much time on this instead of on so many problems that really exist in the world. As if there was nothing more important than this silly thing.''  'E.T.' and the Rolling Stones **********As the hours passed, the son wearied of his headphones and began to talk, speaking of tennis and soccer, of Loretta Lynn and science fiction, of television, Home Box Office and friends. He talked about ''E.T.,'' a movie he said he had seen four times, and about the Rolling Stones, whom he heard in concert in Landover, Md., and about going home to Moscow and learning to be an actor. **********''It has always been my dream,'' he said. ''I like many professions, and only an actor can be in many professions. They play all different professions.'' **********He said he had been in a movie, a documentary of sorts, a film about ''trade between our country and some American millionaire.'' He played the millionaire's grandson. **********''I'm tired,'' he said later. ''It's so strange. I'm only a child. It's been too much.'' **********Just as the family was settling into its seats, a passenger slipped a note into Mr. Berezhkov's pocket. Midway through the flight, he unfolded it. ''We wish you well,'' an acquaintance had written. ''We will see you in the Soviet Union.'' **********Mr. Berezhkov smiled. He said he would go back to the Institute of the United States and Canada, the Soviet research and consulting center, where he had worked before.

Pressing for Aid Increase **********The religious groups and private American aid agencies have been pressing the Reagan Administration to increase aid since December, when field workers and United Nations agencies warned that conditions were deteriorating rapidly and could develop into a widespread famine. **********Initially, the Administration was reluctant to involve itself further because the Ethiopian Government has close ties to the Soviet Union and continues to buy Soviet arms to try to put down the nationalist movements in the north. The United States was helping Ethiopian refugees who had fled to Somalia and the Sudan and was conducting a feeding program for 138,000 women and children in Ethiopia. **********The Administration reassessed its position in June and decided to provide an additional $3 million for aid. In August the Agency for International Development authorized another $6.7 million for humanitarian assistance. Some of that money will be used for transportation; an airlift to reach remote areas in mountainous Tigre Province is under discussion. Fighting Impedes Distribution **********A number of United Nations agencies are trying to improve the distribution of relief supplies but report the fighting has impeded their efforts.

Mr. Goldenson, 77, founded ABC and is the company's largest stockholder. **********Just as William S. Paley has been closely identified with CBS, so has Mr. Goldenson been the most visible executive at ABC since its formation in 1953.

Mr. Goldenson would phone him every day at 4 P.M. to ask how much advertising had been sold during the previous 24 hours. It was Mr. Goldenson's way of charting the network's fortunes, a ritual akin to box-office tallies in the film business. **********After that initial contact, Mr. Pierce moved up rapidly, holding 13 jobs in 18 years, until he arrived at the presidency of ABC television in 1974. **********Although he worked with little publicity, he was instrumental in ABC's rise to first place in the prime time ratings in 1976, after years in third place. Analysts said he did this largely by bringing action series, such as ''Baretta'' and ''S.W.A.T.,'' to the network.  He also hired Fred Silverman as president of ABC Entertainment in 1975, luring him away from CBS, where he had been a highly successful programming chief, a role he repeated at ABC. **********ABC Television lost its top ranking to CBS during the 1979-1980 season.

''He indicated very strongly that Fred Pierce was the heir-apparent to the top corporate responsibilities,'' said a senior ABC official, who declined to be identified. **********Neither Mr. Pierce nor Mr. Rule would comment on the reports of Mr. Pierce's impending appointment.  In the past few years, Mr. Pierce, who was trained as an accountant, has been responsible for the corporation's expansion into new video technologies, such as developing cable programming in news, the arts and daytime talk and information shows.

That was the day when I.B.M. announced two powerful new microcomputers - one that could be linked to I.B.M. mainframes, and another with a multiple-function screen. Oct. 18 was also the day that mighty Digital Equipment stock dropped $21 a share, because of all the money it was losing in personal computers. **********That double-barreled blast sent stocks of other personal computer companies tumbling, even though they already had been on the skids since early summer. More than that, the events of Oct. 18 epitomized investor concern about the intense competition in the industry, I.B.M.'s juggernaut presence and the inevitable shakeout that is already in its nascent stages. **********Indeed, few stock groups have performed as poorly over the past six months as the dozen or so publicly owned companies that primarily build computers in the $1,000 to $5,000 price range. Even the best and the brightest of the personal computer industry are suffering. **********Apple Computer, for instance, is down from $63.25 a share to less than $20. Convergent Technologies is up from its low, but at $25 is still $15 off its high for the year. And the stocks of half a dozen concerns that went public within the last year are now at or near their bottoms. They include Altos Computer, Fortune Systems, Victor Technologies, TeleVideo and Eagle Computer. **********Most investors are still too jumpy to do any bargain hunting in the personal computer minefield. But several Wall Street analysts say they are getting a clearer picture of where some companies went wrong and which ones are doing the right things to insure that they will be around tomorrow. Peter Wright, director of research for the Gartner Group in Stamford, Conn., said he was impressed with Apple's new business strategy, as well as by the big line-up of orders that Convergent Technologies has to build microcomputers for Burroughs, N.C.R. and a number of other computer giants to sell under their labels. **********Other analysts, such as David Lawrence of Montgomery Securities, San Francisco, favor TeleVideo because as a low-cost producer it could survive price wars that may well break out a year or so from now. In addition, at the upcoming Comdex computer exposition in Las Vegas next week, Mr. Lawrence expects TeleVideo to introduce two new products that are ''perfectly'' compatible with I.B.M. software. **********To be sure, the market for personal business computers is huge and growing fast. By the end of 1988, it will be a $24 billion-a-year market in the United States, compared with the $6 billion of business personal computers that will be sold this year, according to William Ablondi, vice president of Future Computing, a research firm in Richardson, Tex. **********The trouble is that such growth has attracted most of the established office-equipment manufacturers as well as a host of newcomers. At latest count, more than 150 companies were producing personal computers for the business market. **********I.B.M., despite entering the field in late 1981, is already generating almost one-third of the industry's revenues. And some analysts expect that it will continue to gain market share. **********There is little doubt that the wayside will be littered with fallen companies. ''The P.C. business is an exploding growth market, but the whole vendor side of it is imploding,'' said Mr. Wright. **********Peter Labe of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company estimates that the business can support only up to five ''mainline'' players, of which I.B.M. is already one. Only a relative handful will survive and prosper, Mr. Labe believes, because in the corporate environment, I.B.M. already has the dominant presence and the decision-makers are not likely to consider more than a few alternatives. Similarly, he noted, ''at the retail level, only a limited number of lines can be inventoried and sold knowledgeably.'' MANY of the personal computer companies have gotten in trouble because they either tried to grow too fast or their market strategy was off-target. Digital Equipment, say analysts, has stumbled because of overly ambitious plans to tap business customers beyond its traditional base. Apple, they say, relied too much on the strength of its name to reach users. **********Victor Technologies, on the other hand, spent too much building up its own direct-sales marketing force, when it should have been wooing dealers to sell its products. (Last week Victor reported a $37 million third-quarter loss.) And Fortune Systems has learned the hard way that a company should not promise software for its computers if it cannot deliver on time. **********Some P.C. companies, however, are not showing much in the way of earnings because they are plowing everything into building a stronger base for the future. Eagle Computer, said Gregory Kelsey, senior technology analyst with Hambrecht & Quist, San Francisco, is ''spending a lot of money for research and development and marketing rather than maximizing quarterly earnings.'' In addition to Eagle's range of I.B.M.-compatible products, Mr. Kelsey is impressed by the company's emphasis on lining up big distribution chains such as Businessland on the West Coast to carry its products. He is not recommending Eagle or any of the other P.C. stocks until he sees further developments, including what is revealed at the upcoming Comdex show. **********Apple Computer is also now on the right track, according to some analysts. Although the company's earnings will be depressed over the next two quarters by heavy research and development and marketing outlays, James McCamant, co-editor of the California Technology Stock Letter, a San Francisco advisory newsletter, said he was ''recommending aggressive purchase.'' **********Mr. McCamant also considers Apple's planned introduction of its McIntosh computer in January to be the industry's ''next new exciting product.'' Expected to retail for $2,500 to $3,000, it will be compatible with I.B.M.'s P.C., plus it will have its own software and it will offer all the ease-of-use features pioneered by Apple's Lisa model, he said. Mr. Lawrence of Montgomery, however, remains negative. on Apple. He sees the ''real possibility'' that it will lose money in the next quarter and that sales of the McIntosh, which he considers critical to Apple's future, will be disappointing. **********Until the dust settles, of course, investors may be reluctant to go back into Apple or one of the hot new issues that they have been burned on. **********But a true test of whether their appetite is sated for new offerings should come up in a few weeks. That is when Compaq, the thus-far successful maker of I.B.M.-compatible portable computers, will go public. The deal is slated to raise at least $90 million. And last week, its underwriters, L. F. Rothschild and E. F. Hutton were priming the market with road-show meetings between management and potential investors. **********Fred R.

Fetzer, the winery's 36-year-old president, said, more with a touch of guilt than surprise. ''We're trying to get the new wine into bottles and start selling again.'' **********Shipments Up 18.5% **********The winery's shipments are up 18.5 percent this year, while the California wine industry over all is having a much tougher time, with analysts projecting a disappointing 4 percent gain over the flat level of 1982. **********The state's wine inventories swelled with a record grape crop in 1982 as sales flattened during the recession. Moreover, the strong dollar made European labels more affordable for Americans. **********Fetzer is riding high in part because of a widening reputation, one it shares with other midsized wineries such as Chateau St. Jean, Sonoma Vineyards, Beaulieu and Ridge, for palate-pleasing yet inexpensive premium table wines. Fetzer's two most popular wines are Sundail chardonnay at $6.50 a bottle and Lake County cabernet at $4.99 a bottle. **********Growing Loyalty **********Robert Berning, wine buyer for Trader Joe's Inc., the biggest specialty retailer for wine in southern California, said more of Trader Joe's ''intellectually affluent, budget-conscious'' customers are growing loyal to the Fetzer label. **********''We'll do about 50 cases a week in Fetzer, compared with 15 for Paul Masson,'' he said. ''They are really on top of what's happening.'' **********The Seagram Company owns Paul Masson, and together with the Wine Spectrum, which it acquired last month, is the second-largest wine marketer in California. Paul Masson is a big seller in supermarkets, where Fetzer is rarely found, along with labels from E.& J. Gallo, the industry leader, which expects to ship 62.4 million cases this year. **********Fetzer has been unusually aggressive, unconventional and disciplined for a winery its size, according to Ed Everett, a wine wholesaler and importer who also edits a newsletter, The Wine Trade. **********''They have a reputation for being very buttoned-down,'' Mr. Everett said. ''Given the youth of these kids, it's amazing to see how professional they are.'' **********The winery, situated about 120 miles north of San Francisco, has grown at about 20 percent a year for eight years, Mr. Fetzer said. Marvin Shanken, an industry analyst and publisher of Market Watch, a wine trade magazine, expects Fetzer to top $34 million in sales this year and he anticipates another 20 percent jump in 1984, to 560,000 cases. Fetzer does not disclose sales and profits. **********Fetzer now ranks No. 25 among California's 600 wineries, a surprisingly rapid ascent for a family-run company that got into the business 15 years ago. Forty percent of Fetzer's sales are to restaurants, which helps its premium image. This year, half of its sales are coming from outside California, compared with an average of about 30 percent for California wineries, according to Mr. Fetzer. **********Growing Northeast Market **********''The Northeast is our big thrust for next year, New York especially,'' he added. That is a tall order. European imports have grabbed a bigger share of the East Coast wine business with extraordinarly low prices. Nationally, shipments of imported wine are up 7 percent. **********The Fetzer family has bucked the industry pattern by creating its own sales force. This bypasses the single- broker channel favored by most small wineries, and keeps Fetzer in closer touch with retailers than many of the state's major wineries, Mr. Berning said. **********They regularly install advanced wine-making machinery, scouted out in Europe by James Fetzer, 32 years old, the wine-making operations manager, to cut labor costs and increase output. **********Distinctive Operations **********Fetzer was one of the first wineries to segregate the crush of red and white wines into separate wine-making equipment, which the Fetzers believe improves the clarity of the bouquet.  The winery buys about three- fourths of its grapes from other vineyards, a ratio meant to keep its land costs and interest costs in check. **********Fetzer is also among a handful of wineries that identify wines not only by the grape but also by the vineyard. It has five zinfandels, for instance, and three chardonnays. ''The consumer looking for something more distinctive gets attracted to these wines,'' said Paul Gillette, publisher of the Wine Investor. **********Still, the proliferation of wines under its Fetzer and Bel Arbres labels - the total is 25 - gives Fetzer a problem in vying for retailer shelf space. **********The Fetzers blend their wines for a sweeter taste than most wineries, ''because although people talk dry, they drink sweet,'' James Fetzer said. **********He put a wine glass to a tap at the side of tall, steel storage tank in one of the winery's cavernous warehouses, a tank filled with chilled gew \"urztraminer, and drew a sample for a visitor. Gew\"urztraminer is a semisweet grape, native to the Alsace region of West Germany. **********Marketing Problems **********The Fetzer clan got into the winery business in 1968, after the mail-order grapes they sold from their 230-acre ranch here drew rave reviews. **********The family patriarch, a regional executive for the Masonite Corporation named Bernard Fetzer, was a stickler for frugality and hard work. Analysts said he had a good grasp of production, but like most smaller wineries, lacked a feel for marketing. **********Mr. Fetzer died, from a heart attack, in 1981. John Fetzer has put much more effort into marketing since then, Mr. Gillette said. **********''It was one of those situations where the father imposed his will,'' he said. ''John had his own ideas and now he's really moving to execute. It's a sound, really well-run operation.'' John Fetzer, however, said he is merely following through on his father's original concept. **********The wine business has brought failure to many small vineyards and wineries that have misjudged its high costs for labor, machinery and and wine barrels for aging, according to George Vare, an industry analyst in San Francisco. **********The Fetzers say they overcame the odds by stressing reinvestment in new machinery and capacity, limiting their own grape harvest and by holding back on personal luxuries - aside from the Mercedes cars that some members of the family drive, James Fetzer said. **********''We can afford the costs of the bu siness and still keep our prices low because we put profits back into expansion without taking much out for ourselves,'' he added. ''This is really a first generation business and we want to see it grow.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/27/business/business-digest-monday-june-27-1983-the-economy.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-06-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 451, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MONDAY, JUNE 27, 1983; The Economy", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST; MONDAY, JUNE 27, 1983; The Economy", "body_text": " **********Machine tool orders, a key industrial barometer, rose 14 percent in May from April and 28 percent from the 1982 level.

Shultz has apparently made little headway in his effort to find a formula for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon. **********Mr. Shultz flew here today for a meeting Wednesday with President Hafez al-Assad after receiving a modest endorsement of his efforts from Saudi Arabia this morning and a gentle prod from Lebanon later to get Israel to move ahead with its agreement to withdraw from Lebanon. **********Mr. Shultz, in his public comments, struck an upbeat note about his meetings with Saudi and Lebanese leaders and spoke favorably about the prospects for talks with Syria on ''mutual interests that go beyond'' the issue of Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon. **********But senior American officials traveling with Mr. Shultz said that they saw little prospect of breaking the impasse over the withdrawal of foreign forces from Lebanon. They suggested that barring some unexpected concession from Mr. Assad, Mr. Shultz would return to Washington on Friday with a fairly bleak assessment of the situation. **********Syria has refused to discuss withdrawal with Lebanon the way Israel did this year. Mr. Shultz was an intermediary in the Lebanese-Israeli talks, which led to a security agreement between the two nations and a commitment by Israel to pull its forces out of Lebanon if Syria and the Palestine Liberation Organization did also. Talks in Saudi Arabia **********Early today, Mr. Shultz met in Saudi Arabia with King Fahd. Mr.  Shultz later described the talks, which took place from midnight to 2 A.M., as ''worthwhile and constructive.'' He said, ''It was gratifying to see with King Fahd that we continue to share the objectives of the removal of all foreign forces from Lebanon.'' **********The United States has sought Saudi help in trying to bring Syria to the bargaining table. In brief remarks at the Jidda airport before Mr. Shultz left, the Saudi Foreign Minister, Saud al-Faisal, said that his nation ''has cooperated in the past and will cooperate in the future'' in efforts to help Lebanon achieve ''its independence and territorial integrity.'' **********But as he had done when Mr. Shultz arrived on Monday, Prince Saud pointedly mentioned an Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon as an important step in the peace process but did not talk about a Syrian withdrawal. **********Asked why he had singled out Israel, Prince Saud said: ''We don't equate the two forces. The Israel forces are occupying forces.'' The comment was consistent with previous Saudi statements that reflect the view among Arab nations that Syrian forces in Lebanon were invited in by the Lebanese Government to restore order and should not be treated the same in withdrawal talks as Israeli troops.  'Engaged' but Unenthusiastic **********Mr. Shultz, speaking to reporters on the flight from Saudi Arabia to Lebanon, described the Saudis as ''fully engaged'' in the effort to achieve a withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon. But officials traveling with Mr. Shultz said the Saudis were less than enthusiastic participants. **********Specifically, they said, the Saudis object privately to the Israeli-Lebanese security agreement because it contains elements of official recognition of Israel and calls for trade and other commercial ties between Israel and Lebanon. **********The Saudis, however, according to the American officials, do want to see the restoration of an independent Lebanon and are willing, up to a point, to press Syria to get out. **********Mr. Shultz landed in Beirut amid tight security provided in part by United States marines in the multinational force there. During his four-hour visit, Mr. Shultz met with Lebanese leaders, including President Amin Gemayel and Foreign Minister Elie Salem. **********A senior Lebanese official who briefed reporters while the meetings were in progress indicated that Lebanon was growing impatient about carrying out the agreement with Israel, which was signed in May. **********''We'd like to hear from the United States on proper measures to have the agreement implemented,'' the official said. He added, ''We have no doubt about U.S. intentions or objectives, but we'd like to see the measures and a clear strategy.'' 'For Total Withdrawal' **********The official said Lebanon did not want Israel to withdraw just part of its forces on its own unless such a step was the first stage of a full withdrawal. The Reagan Administration has considered setting a schedule for a step-by-step Israeli withdrawal in the hope that this would increase the pressure on Syria to withdraw as well. **********The official said, ''Sentimentally, we are for any withdrawal, but we are for total withdrawal.'' After the official talks, Mr. Salem, while praising the United States for its help on the withdrawal issue, said he hoped Mr.  Shultz's visit might produce ''speedier results.'' **********Mr. Shultz, discussing the possible form of Syrian withdrawal talks, said on the flight to Beirut that such negotiations would probably involve direct talks between Syria and Lebanon without the United States serving as an intermediary. **********He said that any Syrian-Lebanese talks would not require changes in the agreement between Israel and Lebanon. ''We don't have any intention to go back and urge anyone to renegotiate the agreement,'' he said. **********Asked whether the Reagan Administration was prepared to offer Syria aid or other inducements to negotiate, Mr. Shultz said: ''The Syrians have said publicly that they look forward to more of a dialogue with the U.S. I want to see that too.'' **********But Mr. Shultz, who looked weary by the end of the day, added, ''I don't have a basket of things to offer or anything of that kind.''

''This is a success and people don't want to hear about mistakes that were made,'' said a Senate Republican leadership aide, requesting anonymity. **********Last week some in Congress began to question the legality of the action or whether Americans in Grenada were actually in danger before the invasion. But some officials say that faded after pictures were published of returning students kissing American soil and after Administration claims that American forces had uncovered warehouses of Soviet-supplied arms. **********Nonetheless, the Senate voted 60-to- 24 last Friday and the House voted 403- to-23 on Tuesday to impose a 60-day deadline on involvement of American troops in Grenada. Now many members describe those votes not as opposition to President Reagan's action but assertions of Congressional prerogatives and pressure on the Administration not to make an open-ended commitment of forces.   Withdrawal Is an Issue **********''People wanted to go on record as wanting to get American troops out,'' said Senator Mathias. ''They want to keep the sword of Damocles over the President's head so that if there were any temptation to stay, that idea would be nipped in the bud.'' **********As President Reagan suggested to reporters this morning, the Administration hopes to defuse that issue now that the fighting has ended, by getting American troops out of Grenada by the end of this month. **********A successful military operation, many legislators agree, has put President Reagan more confidently on the offensive and less ready to brook criticism. This morning he seemed visibly irked at any comparison between the American invasion of Grenada and the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. ''Well, for heaven's sake,'' he retorted heatedly, ''anyone who would link Afghanistan to this operation. . .'' His anger trailed off. **********In Congress, some Democratic and Republican Congressional leaders anticipate more favorable attitudes toward Administration positions on Central American policy generally if the Grenadian operation is quickly concluded.   Nicaragua Issue Shelved **********For example, Senate opponents of covert aid to Nicaraguan rebels decided in the current climate not to make a fight against that program on the Senate floor. Even on Lebanon the Administration got new backing Wednesday from a lopsided majority in the House that defeated an effort to cut off funds for the Marine Corps presence next March 1. **********Members of the President's commission on Central America assert that new evidence of heavy Cuban involvement in Grenada may cause the commission to make bolder proposals on security and military aid to Central American countries than they would have otherwise done. **********Over the longer run, some politicians warn that diplomatic problems with Western Europe, Latin America and at the United Nations may cut into the Administration's political and diplomatic gains. **********''The President had a major uplift from Grenada,'' said Robert Strauss, former Democratic national chairman and member of Mr. Reagan's Central American commission. ''He's doing better in this country politically, but worse in Europe,'' he added. ''When you look at the reaction of Canada, Helmut Kohl in Germany, Margaret Thatcher in Britain, we paid a very heavy price.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/02/business/no-headline-138872.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-09-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 803, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "No Headline", "print_headline": "No Headline", "body_text": " **********uf916 **********Elizabeth E.

I believe that the recent deregulation experience can provide three helpful lessons. **********Lesson 1: There must be a consensus that incrementalism will not work, that a large change toward a new economic arrangement must be undertaken. In the regulatory process, well-intentioned people had mapped out airline routes based on the technology of railroads. Carriers were granted linear east-west or north-south route systems. **********But the technology of air transportation is such that economic efficiency leads to sunbursts of hubs-and-spokes rather than linear systems. This is just one example of well-meaning government intervention that induced productivity loss. **********In setting the stage for reform, there had to be a recognition that the heavy hand of government was harming productivity. There also had to be a critical stock of knowledge about unintended perverse effects of regulation. **********Lesson 2: There must be a basis for change within the institutional structure. In the case of deregulation, new ideas were accommodated within the existing political process and within the existing regulatory agencies. **********One method used in the deregulation movement was to appoint as heads of the regulatory commissions persons whose backgrounds were suited to making the called-for changes. Economists were found to preside at both the Civil Aeronautics Board and the Interstate Commerce Commission during the critical reform periods. Such leadership meant not only that reform from within could proceed but also that there was an openness to ideas that would eventually change the nature of the institutions. **********Lesson 3: Major change proceeds more effectively if there is a basis for change in ideas. Advances in applied micro-economics research provided valuable insights to policy makers as well as to professional economists about how to go about deregulating. Take the idea of ''contestable markets.'' **********Traditionally in economics the strength of competition has been perceived to be a function of numbers - the fewer the number of actual competitors, the more the discipline of market forces is diminished. The new theory of ''contestable markets'' finds that where exit and entry are cheap and easy, even an oligopoly company must behave like a competitive one, for it is vulnerable to entry by competitors.  The ease of entry or exit depends not on the absolute costs of capital required for entry but on how much capital must be invested that cannot be easily moved elsewhere. If the requirements for sunk capital are high, new competitors are less likely to enter a market, and this may signal the need for regulatory intervention. **********By contrast, where large capital equipment is mobile or resalable, the new theory tells us that regulation should be unncessary. This theory was readily translated into practice in the airline industry. **********These lessons may be pertinent to the problem of converting science into technology. There appears to be a consensus that incremental improvements in the speed of introducing new technology will not restore American economic primacy. **********Thus Lesson 1 is in place. Lessons 2 and 3 are more difficult. **********The relation between the Government and the companies it regulates is a lot clearer than the relationship between universities and industry. New institutional arrangements, such as joint ventures between the two groups, are only in their formative stages. New management paradigms also appear to be necessary. **********Industry and academe have been more comfortable with analysis of how to move in a measured fashion to nearby techniques rather than with planning for a wholly new technology or a wholly new idea of how to deliver a product. **********We need ideas for how to take a quantum leap. The Japanese are providing a few. The challenge is to search further for solutions that will work within our institutions even as the institutions, in turn, are altered."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/11/business/from-fcc-to-law-firm.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-05-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 144, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "From F.C.C. to Law Firm", "print_headline": "From F.C.C. to Law Firm", "body_text": " **********Joseph R.

But on Wednesday, they are expected to put frugality aside for a day and bid furiously at a Federal auction of oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico. **********The sale, to be held here, will be the first in the Gulf under the Interior Department's accelerated leasing program, which is intended to reduce the nation's reliance on foreign oil by making more acreage available for drilling in Unites States waters. **********Oil industry executives say the auction, focused on the central Gulf, promises to be the most important lease sale in the United States this year and could be the biggest ever in terms of tracts leased. **********''There's a very broad interest in this sale,'' said Philip Oxley, president of the Tenneco Exploration and Production Company, a division of Tenneco Inc. D.G. Garrott, a manager of exploration operations for the Exxon Company U.S.A., agreed that the auction would be ''very significant.'' 'Open-Leasing' Policy **********One reason for the excitement is that the oil companies, through years of drilling, have become intimately familiar with the central Gulf, and feel confident that they know where the good prospects are. The Government's new ''open-leasing'' policy is another reason. **********In the past, bidding at lease sales was limited to a specific number of tracts, typically 75 to 175, selected by Interior Department officials from nominations by the oil companies. But under the new rules, which were first applied at a sale of leases off the Middle Atlantic coast in April, companies can substitute their judgment for the Government's and bid on any unleased tracts in large, designated areas. **********At Wednesday's sale, exploration companies are expected to submit bids on 400 to 500 tracts, industry officials said. According to the Interior Department, the record for the number of tracts leased at an auction is 411, set at a two-day Gulf sale in 1962. **********A total of 7,300 tracts, covering 39.9 million acres off the coast of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, will be offered at the sale.  But oilmen said that most of the acreage was in water deeper than they were accustomed to working in and would be too expensive to try to develop now. Strategies Changed **********Nonetheless, the sheer volume of available tracts has changed the procedures and strategies in preparing bids at many companies, industry officials said. In recent months, some companies have formed special committees to evaluate the tracts. Industry officials said the tracts included in Wednesday's sale contained mostly natural gas prospects, but also had a few significant oil deposits. **********The companies are also approaching the sale with a ''now-ornever'' attitude. They believe the most promising tracts will be taken this year. Thus they feel that if they do not act now they will be bidding only for less desirable tracts in the future. **********''This creates a great deal of concern,'' said Tenneco's Mr. Oxley. ''You don't want to overlook things that the other guys see and buy up.'' **********One question is whether the industry slump and apprehension about future oil and gas prices will temper enthusiasm at the sale.  A recent survey of more than a dozen oil companies by Ruddick Research International Inc., a Tulsa, Okla., consulting firm, quoted several executives as saying that current price uncertainties would not affect their bidding because it would take four to seven years to put any of the tracts into production. Other executives, however, said that concern about future prices might prompt them to submit lower bids. 'Golden Years' **********Oil service companies, suffering from depressed conditions in the Gulf this year, are counting on the lease sales to spark a revival in drilling activity for the next several years. **********In the late 1980's, ''I would imagine that the Gulf of Mexico ought to see its golden years,'' said Earl A. Stolz, an oil service analyst at Howard, Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs, a New Orleans brokerage house. **********A sale of leases in the western Gulf in August is also expected to draw significant interest, although not as much as the central Gulf sale on Wednesday. A sale of eastern Gulf leases in November is not expected to attract much bidding because companies have not had much success in that area. **********The Interior Department has also scheduled lease sales this year for acreage in the South Atlantic and off central and northern California. Federal officials also plan to hold sales in 1984 off Alaska and southern California, and in the North Atlantic. **********In all, the Interior Department plans to offer one billion acres for lease over the next five years. By contrast, only 56 million acres have been offered since the Federal leasing program began in 1954. But industry officials said that only a fraction of the total acreage offered would be leased over the next five years, mainly because much of it lies in risky frontier areas or in very deep water. **********At a lease sale, the companies make cash offers for the right to drill on specific tracts. If they find oil or gas, they also pay royalties to the Government. Typically the leases have stipulated that companies must begin drilling within five years or forfeit the lease. To encourage drilling in the very deep or risky areas, the Government will also offer 10-year leasing periods at Wednesday's sale on tracts in 2,800 feet of water or deeper."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/16/world/around-the-world-belgian-civil-servants-protest-austerity-plan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-09-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 157, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Belgian Civil Servants Protest Austerity Plan", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Belgian Civil Servants Protest Austerity Plan", "body_text": " **********Civil servants across Belgium went on strike today to protest a Government austerity plan.

Yesterday, it rose 1/2 for the day, to 36 3/4, **********The company's rapid earnings growth in recent years, noted Standard & Poor's, has been supported by an aggressive acquisition program. **********Hillenbrand Industries, a leading maker of burial coffins, saw its stock rise on the Big Board from 13 1/8 three years ago to a record high of 47 3/4 last month. Yesterday, it fell 1/2, to 44 1/2. **********Amedco Inc., smaller in size than the other two companies, also supplies products and services for the funeral industry. Last week, Amedco reported 1982 profits of $1.30 a share, up from $1.27 the previous year. Six years ago, the stock sold under $1 a share. It recently hit a record price of 31 3/8 on the American Stock Exchange. Yesterday, Amedco was unchanged at 30. **********Climbing stock prices have produced higher price-earnings ratios than usual for these companies. However, the Value Line Investment Survey still believes that Service Corporation and Hillenbrand will outperform the market over the next 12 months. Value Line does not follow Amedco. **********Two basic considerations have worked in favor of the funeral business. In terms of sheer demographics, the death rate per 1,000 people is projected by the Bureau of the Census to continue increasing for the remainder of this century. Second, the funeral companies have taken various steps, including acquisitions, to improve their profitability. **********For the fiscal year ending April 30, Value Line estimates that Service Corporation will earn $2.15 a share, up from $1.86 the previous year. ''Service Corporation is riding a tidal wave of success,'' said Eliot S. Laurence, an analyst for the investment advisory service. ''Because the funeral service business has high fixed costs, operating profits generally grow faster than volume. We think the company's funeral service business can support at least 10 to 15 percent annual earnings growth by itself.'' **********In addition, Mr. Laurence views the profit potential of the company's ''pre-need sales'' as outstanding. ''A pre-need sale allows the consumer to lock in his funeral service costs at current prices, so that inflation is no longer a worry,'' he said. ''Service Corporation invests the money generated by these sales in long-term investments - through its life insurance subsidiary - and flows the dividend and interest income, after subtracting its indirect selling costs, down to the bottom line.'' **********Hillenbrand earned $3.09 a share in the 1982 calendar year. Value Line estimates profits for this year at $3.05 a share. Coffins - one company trademark for this line is called Omega - generally provide most of the company's earnings. But Hillenbrand is also a major manufacturer of equipment for furnishing hospital patient rooms. Its American Tourister division is an important factor in the luggage manufacturing field. **********Elliot Schlang, a senior vice president with the Cleveland-based brokerage firm of Prescott, Ball & Turben, has been recommending Hillenbrand to clients since March 1981, when the stock was trading at the equivalent price of 18. ''I still regard it as a core holding for growth-oriented accounts,'' he said this week. ''The company has a strong balance sheet and earnings should do very well, thanks to the four-year, $40 million expansion program at its casket division that was funded internally and is now nearing completion.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/01/business/heizer-liquidation.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-12-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 95, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Heizer Liquidation", "print_headline": "Heizer Liquidation", "body_text": " **********The Heizer Corporation said its directors at a special meeting concluded that a complete or partial liquidation of the company might be in the best interests of shareholders. **********Heizer's treasurer, Neil Hamilton, said he could not say when further action might be expected.

''It isn't going to happen again. Climbing up the ladder to become an industrialized nation by exporting manufactured goods will be far more difficult for South Korea.'' **********Economic Reforms **********To overcome the obstacles, the South Korean Government has begun major economic reforms. It is opening up the country's sheltered domestic market to foreigners. It is prodding companies and investors to shift away from export-oriented industries, such as construction, steel and shipbuilding, that have fueled its rapid growth, and toward high-technology industries such as semiconductors, computers and telecommunications. **********And gradually, it is moving away from a centrally controlled economy of five-year plans with funds channeled into strategic industries - a Government-business partnership that has been called Korea Inc., much like Japan Inc. - and toward an economy in which the private sector has greater control. **********''The circumstances have changed, so our industrial strategy must change,'' said Sakong Il, president of the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Technology, a Government-backed research organization. ''Before, we had a Government- led development strategy. But now that our economy is becoming more complex, the market is a better mechanism for making decisions. We have to undo some of what we have done in the past.'' **********In the past, however, South Korea's strategy has served it well. Since the early 1960's, when the country was still agrarian, per-capita income of its 40 million people has jumped twentyfold. No. 2 Shipbuilder **********More than Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore - the other so-called ''new Japans'' - South Korea has developed its heavy industry. It is the world's No. 2 shipbuilder, after Japan. Its steel industry is growing rapidly and increasingly competing successfully against Japanese companies. **********The country's young auto industry is projected to triple its output by 1986, to 288,000 vehicles, according to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. In 1985, Korean-made cars are scheduled to make their debut in the American market. **********To pay for the industrial buildup, South Korea has borrowed heavily. Its foreign debt of $37.4 billion is the highest in Asia. **********To attain the growth necessary to meet its debt, keep unemployment down and maintain a high level of military spending in its face-off with Communist North Korea, South Korea must constantly increase its exports. To grow at 5 or 6 percent a year, economists estimate, export volume will have to expand to $100 billion a year by the early 1990's, up from $21 billion last year. **********To achieve this, analysts say, South Korea must take two key steps. First, it must improve the competitiveness of its goods and, as labor costs rise, move into higher-technology fields to become less dependent on industries where competitiveness depends on cheap labor. Second, it must open its market to foreign goods and services if it hopes to get continued access to markets abroad. Ban Ended on 200 Items **********To open the country's market, The Government last month removed more than 200 items from its list of banned foreign goods. The ratio of goods that can be imported to all those offered is now 80 percent. By 1986, the Government says, it will be more than 90 percent. **********Once an item is removed from the ban, however, it is typically protected with high tariffs. Still, as a Western diplomat said, ''This is certainly a step in the right direction.'' In other respects, too, the Government is relinquishing control over the economy. To increase competition and efficiency in the financial sector, the Government has sold its majority interest in the country's leading commercial banks. **********Last March, South Korea's first joint-venture bank, the Koram Bank, was opened. The Government approved the venture, which includes Bank of America and several Korean investors, because it hopes the American management will modernize Korean banking. Support for High Technology **********Most of the Government supports for heavy industry have been dropped. But Government help for high-technology industries, especially new ventures, will be given. Last month, for example, the Government announced that as many as 500 venture companies in high-technology fields would receive financial and technical assistance. **********With Government encouragement, major Korean corporations are starting to spend heavily to develop semiconductors, computers and telecommunications equipment. Three large companies - Daewoo, Gold Star and Samsung - already make semiconductors, mostly such simple types as diodes and transistors, and some basic integrated circuits. **********Particularly notable among the newcomers is Hyundai, which plans to become a large producer of sophisticated memory chips. **********Few oppose the Government's plans to open up the Korean market and to give the private sector more responsibility for economic development. But there is considerable debate about the pace at which the transition should occur. The Two Views **********The strongest advocates of the new program are a group of Western-educated free-market economists, both inside and outside of government. Asked which businesses should still be considered ''infant'' industries and remain protected, Kim Duk-Choong, a professor of economics at Sogang University, said, ''I don't think you should protect anything. With no protection, the needed process of industrial adjustment is much faster.'' **********On the other side are those who advise slow import liberalization and who are quite reluctant to see a wholesale transfer of economic power from the Government to private companies. **********''I am not in favor of transferring everything to the private sector,'' said Lee Kyung-Hoon, president of the Daewoo Corporation, one of the country's leading industrial groups. ''How can the private sector develop a five-year economic plan? That is the job of the Government.'' **********One of the aims of the Government's economic reforms is to promote small and medium-sized businesses. During the 1970's the stress on heavy industry worked to the advantage of Korea's industrial groups, concentrating economic power in a small number of organizations. The Japanese Competition **********In a few key fields, Korean industrialists believe they have already caught up to Japan. Shipbuilding is one such area, according to Mr. Chung of Hyundai. ''In technology, productivity and price, we are competitive with anyone, including Japan,'' he said. **********Yet precisely because it is following most closely in Japan's footsteps, South Korea is likely to have a difficult time. The West's trade barriers, erected against the Japanese, will also keep out some Korean goods. Furthermore, ''the last country in the world that wants another Japan is Japan,'' said a Western diplomat in Seoul. ''The Japanese will cut off Korea if they can.'' **********One way for Japan to do that is to stop the flow of its technology to South Korea. One test of Japan's position on this issue will involve a planned second steel mill for South Korea, to be built for the Pohang Iron and Steel Company. **********For the first steel works in Pohang, 290 miles southeast of Seoul on the Sea of Japan, Japanese steelmakers supplied much of the technology. Now, however, many are opposed to doing so."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/27/business/federal-screw-works-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-01-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 43, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FEDERAL SCREW WORKS reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "FEDERAL SCREW WORKS reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/17/business/commoditiesh-j-maidenberg-outlook-for-crop-demand.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-10-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 769, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CommoditiesH.

Will the higher prices caused by the smaller harvests reduce demand by in effect rationing supplies? **********Based on current projections, the corn supply will be more than ample to meet the reduced domestic and export needs between now and the 1984 harvest, while the soybean supply may just barely cover projected demand. **********Most of the wheat crop was unaffected by the acreage reduction programs and had been largely harvested when the drought took hold in mid-July, so supplies are considered more than sufficient. **********Last Tuesday, the Agriculture Department's estimates, based on Oct. 1 conditions, put the corn crop at a 10- year low of 4.26 billion bushels, compared with the record 8.4 billion in 1982, and the soybean crop at 1.52 billion bushels, down from the year-ago record 2.27 billion. The 1983 wheat crops totaled 2.41 billion bushels, compared with the record 2.81 billion harvested in 1982. **********The figures matched those issued a few days earlier by Conrad Leslie, a leading crop forecaster associated with E. F. Hutton & Company, who noted: **********''When the statistical corn year ended Sept. 30, there were 3.4 billion bushels on hand from the previous years' harvests, giving us a total supply of nearly 7.8 billion bushels. The soybean situation is something else.'' **********Indeed, on Aug. 31, when the soybean year ended, the carryover was only 387 million bushels, which means a total supply of 1.9 billion bushels. The nation's fats and oils manufacturers and livestock feed processors use about 100 million bushels a month. **********Even with reduced soybean and bean product exports, the carryover next Aug. 31 is expected to be a mere 69 million bushels, less than one month's domestic usage. **********John A. Schnittker, who heads a Washington consulting organization, said Friday that he expected several factors to cut demand in addition to the relatively high prices. **********''It is ironic that today has been designated as World Food Day by the Agriculture Department, because our Government has drastically cut back shipments of grain to needy lands overseas and replaced the food with loads of advice on how to provide their own foodstuffs. Many have taken this advice.'' **********For example, he said, the Soviet Union will again buy 80 percent of Argentina's feed-grain crops when they are harvested next February and March. Mr. Schnittker added: **********''I would not be overly concerned about the supply-demand situation, because we expect American farmers to plant fence-to-fence next spring, just as the winter wheat growers are doing now. The next figures to watch are those from the Southern Hemisphere, where the harvests will begin next February.'' **********Another leading expert who expects a dramatic rise in food output next year, barring natural or political disasters, is Emil S. Finley, president and chief executive officer of the International Commodities Export Corporation, a leading exporter of fertilizers and farm chemicals, who said Friday: **********''After three sales years that could at best be described as dismal, we have begun to see sizable foreign orders, particularly from India, Pakistan, China and Ethiopia. Our friends in the domestic fertilizer business also report a sharp rise in demand, which started with the winter wheat planting season late in August'' **********But the sudden surge in demand for fertilizers and chemicals used to combat weeds, insects and plant deseases has caught the manufacturers unprepared, Mr. Finley said. **********''Many fertilizer and farm chemical plants were either shut down or had their output reduced during the past three years because domestic farmers were squeezed between rising interest rates and falling prices for the record crops they produced,'' he said. ''Foreign buyers said they didn't have the dollars.'' **********Now that grain and soybean prices are strong and the Federal acreage reduction programs appear to have been shelved, domestic farmers are expected to vastly increase their plantings, just as the winter wheat growers have. **********After three years of cutting back, domestic farmers can no longer count on residual amounts of fertilizers in their soils to sustain the kind of yields they now want. But farmers now face fertilizer costs running 10 to 25 percent above the levels of only five weeks ago, Mr. Finley said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/17/world/excerpts-from-gromyko-speech-reviewing-soviet-union-s-foreign-policy.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-06-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2867, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Text", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXCERPTS FROM GROMYKO SPEECH REVIEWING SOVIET UNION'S FOREIGN POLICY", "print_headline": "EXCERPTS FROM GROMYKO SPEECH REVIEWING SOVIET UNION'S FOREIGN POLICY", "body_text": " **********Following are excerpts from a speech by Foreign Minister Andrei A.  Gromyko before the Supreme Soviet yesterday, as distributed in translation by Tass, the Soviet press agency. **********The special importance of the Soviet-American accords in the field of strategic arms that were reached before the coming to power of the present Administration in the United States, should be stressed.  Operating to this day is the treaty on the limitation of antiballistic missile systems and the treaty on the limitation of strategic arms (SALT I). As to the SALT II treaty, which today is being heaped with abuse in Washington by its opponents, it also could have become a serious accomplishment both for the Soviet Union and for the United States, and for the whole world. **********As before, the Soviet Union comes out for normalizing relations with the People's Republic of China on the basis of reciprocity, searching for possibilities of a gradual expansion of bilateral ties and contacts. We stand for continuing the Soviet-Chinese political consultations that have begun and would like them to lead to positive results. We are convinced that normalization and improvement of relations between them accords with the cardinal interests of the peoples of both countries. **********The class adversary is placing stress on weakening and, if possible, splitting the socialist community, and although this invariably ends in failure, there is no end to importunate attempts to achieve this aim. Ideological Subversion Assailed **********Hostile actions of a political and economic nature are being taken against the countries of socialism, ideological subversion is being carried out against them, and resort is made to subversive actions and other methods that are impermissible in the practice of intercourse among states. This is seen with particular clarity in the policy of the West with respect to the Polish People's Republic. **********Poland, as it has been stressed by its leadership, and this has been repeatedly stated also on behalf of its allies, the countries of the Warsaw Treaty, has been and remains an inalienable part of the socialist community. Only those who have become hopelessly ossified in their hostility to socialism can fail to understand this. This hostility impairs their sight and obscures the real state of affairs from them. **********Despite the desire of the imperialist circles for military superiority over the countries of socialism throughout the postwar period, a balance of forces has been achieved between the Warsaw Treaty Organization and NATO. It is this military-strategic parity that has served and continues to serve as a reliable guarantee of international stability. Need for Arms Curbs Avowed **********The Soviet Union is in favor of proceeding, on the basis of the existing parity, along the road of arms limitation and reduction so that at any given moment the balance is preserved but on an increasingly lower level. This would mean using the existing parity for purposes of peace and not letting slip by the truly historic opportunity it offers. **********Our country is doing and will continue to do everything to maintain parity. This was once again affirmed by Yuri V. Andropov at the Central Committee meeting just ended. This position is realistic, politically and scientifically substantiated, and meets the interests of both sides. **********It would seem that all those who bear the responsibility for resolving the acute problems arising before mankind would adopt a similar stance. Those in Washington, however, think not in terms of parity, but in terms of superiority. They count on changing the strategic alignment of forces in their favor. **********They should know that there will be no winners in a nuclear war.  This is the opinion of scientists, of serious political figures, and of all those who, without hiding the truth, take a realistic approach to assessing the formidable danger of a nuclear conflict. 'Militarist Intoxication' in U.S. **********Today a militarist intoxication, one may say, pervades the political atmosphere in the United States. Nuclear war is pronounced to be permissible and even feasible. The thought being hammered into the heads of people is that such war would not be so horrifying. **********The antinuclear and antiwar movement that has arisen in the West is a kind of a popular referendum. Its participants have no hesitation when it comes to issues of war and peace. They pronounce themselves for peace, against preparations for war and against continuation of the mad arms race. **********It has been suggested that this movement heeds the hand of Moscow.  To us, naturally, it is flattering that actions for peace should be associated with the policy of the Soviet Union. But the hand of Moscow has nothing to do with it. The broad public circles engaged in antiwar actions spontaneously reflect the people's desire to defend their right to live. **********The Soviet Union rejects the very idea of nuclear war as reckless, and the calls for it as criminal. We proceed from the assumption that everything must be done to keep nuclear weapons from ever being used. This is the conviction of the Soviet leadership, of the whole of our party, and of the whole of the Soviet people. U.S. Record on War and Peace **********And what is the record in this respect that the United States can show today?  It has derailed the SALT II treaty and broken off a whole set of negotiations that were gathering momentum or were close to achieving practical results. **********It refuses to resume talks on the complete and universal prohibition of nuclear weapon tests, on limiting the shipments and sales to other countries of conventional weapons, on limiting military activity in the Indian Ocean and on a number of other issues. **********It simply does not want to engage in negotiations. And this is precisely what it says: We do not want to and that's that! This alone speaks for itself. **********From what has been said about the difficulties encountered in the struggle to end the arms race and to achieve disarmament, it does not at all follow that this struggle must be relaxed. On the contrary, it must be pursued with even greater energy and persistence; we and our allies have both. The problems that remain outstanding and the existence of the threat to peace obligate us to this. **********The U.S.S.R. has repeatedly stated and states once again that in the present situation it would be senseless for anyone to count on attaining military superiority. The U.S.S.R. has never striven and does not strive for this. And we do not recognize any other's right to military superiority. Our country has all the necessary resources - material and intellectual -to prevent this from happening. And the Soviet Union shall prevent it. Need for Acceptable Solutions **********For responsible leaders, the more so for those standing at the helm of the policy of states, it should be clear that there is no other reasonable road and that mutually acceptable solutions must be sought and found. Only such a path is reliable. **********The main condition is to conduct honest talks, not to try to outwit the partner, not to try to present deceit for truth and vice versa.  Agreements must be based on the principle of equality and equal security. The Soviet Union will not retreat from this principle. And it would be good if those in Washington realized this. **********It is impossible to overstate the importance of solving problems of limiting and reducing strategic arms, and also of limiting nuclear arms in Europe. The United States Administration is pursuing an obstructionist line at the Soviet-American talks on these questions that are going on in Geneva. To counter our position of deep mutual reductions in delivery vehicles and warheads to agreedupon levels, the Soviet Union is being offered unacceptable unilateral disarmament. **********Couched in the same spirit is the renovated position on strategic arms that was announced recently by the American President in an attempt to present it as an expression of flexibility at the talks.  This position is tailored entirely to suit the current expansion of American military programs. Selective Approach by U.S. **********Washington's approach remains unchanged: to apply limitations only to those components of strategic forces that suit the American side while leaving other components outside the framework of agreement, simply turning a blind eye to them. In effect, the United states would like to disrupt the existing structure of the Soviet strategic potential while retaining a free hand to build up its own corresponding armaments. **********So the flexibility here is purely for show. The American position does not offer a path to mutually acceptable agreements. Judging by everything, no such aim is set in the first place. The plan is to lull, to be more precise, to deceive public opinion, to neutralize the mounting opposition to Washington's militaristic preparations. **********Neither can the proposals on confidence-building measures advertised by Washington gloss over the unconstructive and lopsided nature of the line pursued by the United States. The point is that the American proposals, as opposed to the much more far-reaching proposals made by us, do not limit the military activity of the sides in any way and come down simply to an exchange of information between them on some types of activity. Soviet Proposals Rejected **********Besides, the American side hushes up the fact that it is rejecting the U.S.S.R.'s proposals, which provide for preventing the origination of crisis situations and for the strengthening of trust. **********In short, the Soviet Union stands for preventing dangers and crisis situations, while the United States proposes simply to exchange information. **********It is becoming increasingly clear that the present American Administration is pursuing a course not of reaching agreements but of fulfilling its programs of building up strategic arms and deploying new medium-range missiles in Western Europe. **********This course is clearly visible also in the statement adopted late in May at the meeting in Williamsburg and in the communique of the just ended session of the NATO Council. They contain many pompous words about the West's striving for talks with the Soviet Union, for arms reductions and for lessening the danger of war. But these words do not change the militaristic, aggressive essence of the course steered by the United States and NATO. **********The interests of the security of the U.S.S.R. and its allies compel us, as the Soviet Government warned in its statement of May 28, to take measures in response to strengthen our defense capability. Retaliatory Measures Explained **********These, however, are forced measures. Their sole aim is to prevent a disruption of the existing balance of forces. While making this warning, the Soviet Union at the same time affirms its unvarying, principled approach both to the limitation and reduction of strategic arms and to the limitation of medium-range nuclear arms in Europe. **********It is not too late to stop the dangerous development of the international situation if the United States and its NATO allies were to respond to the constructive proposals of the U.S.S.R. We would like to hope that the common sense of our partners will prevail. **********The Soviet Union thinks that mesures must be taken to prevent the arms race from developing in new directions. We proposed this to the United States Government: Let Soviet and American scientists, specialists in the field, get together and discuss the possible implications of establishing a large-scale ABM system. So far we have received no answer from the United States Administration. **********It would be a tragedy for mankind if outer space became a source of quarrels between states, and, worse still, a sphere of military clashes. Only with a total misunderstanding of one's grave responsibility and extreme recklessness can one pursue the line that would make the space above the head of mankind carry a threat to its existence. Need for Curbs on Space Arms **********The priority task in this connection is to conclude an international treaty on the nondeployment of weapons of any kind in outer space, as proposed by the Soviet Union. We are prepared to go even further - to agree on banning in general the use of force both in space, and from space against the earth. We are prepared to enter such talks without a moment's delay. **********The realities of the present international situation call for the exercise of restraint not only in the field of arms and military policy, but in all spheres of relations between states, above all between countries with different social systems. **********Neither group of states - nor the world as a whole, for that matter -stands to benefit if, in the relations between them, antagonism is artificially fueled, different kinds of provocations and unseemly methods are used, mistrust and suspicion are sown, and when even a minimum accepted comity is not observed in relations between states. **********Concern for peace should now be put above everything else. It is the duty of all those who are involved in taking major political decisions. The world expects the leadership of the United States to show greater responsibility and common sense. The solution of acute international problems can be achieved only by ending the arms race and improving the world political climate, by the relaxation of tension. Need for Normal Relations **********Attempts to offer approaches that meet only the interests of the United States and the NATO bloc and prejudice the legitimate interests of the U.S.S.R. and its allies are hopeless. **********The Soviet Union is consistently advocating normal and stable relations with capitalist countries. These relations benefit both those states and us. **********We want smoother relations with the United States in the knowledge that this is important to prevent war. It is our belief that the United States should also proceed from the objective need to maintain normal relations with the U.S.S.R. The common interests of both countries would be promoted by the removal of the threat of nuclear catastrophe. All the peoples, the states on all continents have a vital interest in this. **********Attempts to impose anti-Arab deals and to advance plans for a Middle Eastern settlement that ignore the legitimate interest of the Palestinian people are causing growing Arab opposition. This policy has brought about the situation in which Lebanon is being torn apart before everyone's eyes and in which it has been forced at gunpoint into capitulatory agreements with Israel. **********Syria, which is strengthening its defenses and pursuing a principled policy in the Middle East, has become a target of pressure and open threats. Soviet Not Merely an Onlooker **********The role of the Soviet Union in that region, adjacent to our borders, is not merely that of a passive onlooker. Our country has formulated fair principles for a political settlement, including the proposal to convene an international conference on the Middle East.  They are known to the whole world. **********Washington and Tel Aviv are creating obstacles in the way to a Middle Eastern settlement. Peace can be brought to the Middle East by a settlement that, instead of imperialist arbitrariness and Israel's actions with impunity, backed by expansionist ambitions, would produce the liberation of all occupied Arab lands and insure the establishment of an independent Arab Palestinian state. Much depends on the Arab countries themselves, on their cohesion in the struggle against the forces of aggression. **********The conflict between Iran and Iraq is senseless. The continuation of the conflict only plays into the hands of the imperialist forces who have an interest in the weakening of both states. For Amity With Iraq and Iran **********We are linked by relations of friendship with Iraq. We stand for normal relations of friendship with Iran as well. The Soviet Union would like to continue to see it an independent state and has always striven for relations of goodneighborliness with it. Regrettably, actions like those recently taken by the Iranian side with regard to a group of employees of Soviet missions in Iran do not at all contribute to the development of such contacts between our countries.

Braniff can amend its reorganization plan as long as the changes are made within 60 days, and still allow time for the 50,000 Braniff creditors to vote on it. **********The action means that the directors, management and secured and unsecured creditors of the airline may continue further negotiations on a proposal by Jay Pritzker, chairman of the Hyatt Corporation, to revive the airline and rehire about 2,000 Braniff workers. **********The plan of reorganization was approved during a directors meeting held in Braniff's headquarters at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. At a news conference afterward, Braniff's chairman, Howard D. Putnam, said the airline was still open to an offer by Mr. Pritzker. **********''If a flight operation can be put together, it will be added to the reorganization plan,'' Phillip Guthrie, Braniff's chief financial officer, said at the news conference, Dissatisfaction With Proposal **********Both Mr. Putnam and Braniff's secured creditors have been dissatisfied with a proposal made by Mr. Pritzker last Friday in a meeting with the secured creditors at the Union League Club in Manhattan. **********The 39 secured creditors, who hold $467.5 million of Braniff's debt, have taken a particularly tough stance toward the sweetened proposal. ''There is a strong feeling that he is not putting up enough,'' one of the creditors said. **********He also said that Mr. Putnam and other Braniff executives had told the secured creditors last Friday that there were several attractive offers from other airlines for the 31 planes that remain in Braniff's fleet. **********The creditor, who spoke with the understanding that he would not be identified, said that the cash offers were higher than the $4.2 million a plane that People Express last month agreed to pay for 20 Braniff aircraft. **********''The market has changed,'' he said, referring to an upturn in airline traffic and a decline in fuel prices in the past several months that have made the planes a more attractive buy. **********Thus the secured creditors have the attractive option of supporting liquidation and selling the planes, the source said, unless Mr. Pritzker considerably improves his offer of last Friday. **********He added that the creditors did not want to put up the $10 million that Mr. Pritzker has sought and want a more favorable arrangement for leasing the 31 planes. New Holding Company **********At the meeting last Friday, Mr. Pritzker increased the amount of money he would invest, from his original offer of $10 million, to $20 million plus $15 million in loans. **********According to creditors and sources close to Mr. Pritzker, the $20 million would be lent to a new Braniff International, which as a holding company would buy $20 million worth of stock in a new subsidiary, Braniff Airways. The subsidiary would operate the airline; Mr. Pritzker would own 80 percent of the new stock. **********He would also lend $15 million to Braniff Airways, but it would be secured by engines and other Braniff collateral such as an Eastern Airlines note issued for equipment purchases. **********To reach the estimated $60 million that would be needed to start up the airline by next July, Mr. Pritzker asked the secured creditors to put up $10 million and the unsecured creditors $15 million. **********Mr. Pritzker's proposal, according to creditors and those close to the negotiations, seeks to lease the planes from the secured creditors for $70,000 a plane per month and 17.5 percent of the profits, up to $100,000 a plane per month. **********It is basically the same offer that was made earlier this year by PSA Inc., an airline based in California. That bid was barred by an appeals court because the emerging airline would have been a subsidiary of PSA and not entitled to Braniff landing slots at Dallas-Fort Worth. **********According to sources close to Mr. Pritzker, he structured the deal to resemble the PSA offer, since Braniff's directors and the two creditor groups had approved the PSA offer and thus he expected they would be favorably disposed toward his plan."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/12/world/around-the-world-morocco-reports-repelling-sahara-rebels.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-07-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 131, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Morocco Reports Repelling Sahara Rebels", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Morocco Reports Repelling Sahara Rebels", "body_text": " **********Moroccan forces killed 50 Polisario guerrillas and wounded many others who attacked Moroccan positions in Western Sahara, the official Moroccan press agency reported today. **********It said two Moroccan soldiers were killed and 30 wounded. **********The attack began early Sunday along a Moroccan line about nine miles south of the town of Messeied, the agency said.

The newest posters date from last month's municipal elections, in which the governing coalition of Social Democrats, Christian Democrats and Monarchists lost ground to the Socialists of Mario Soares. **********With tensions rising in the coalition because of its poor showing and with the economy deteriorating, Francisco Pinto Balsemao, a Social Democrat, resigned as Prime Minister two weeks ago. His was the 14th Government Portugal has had since 1974. **********Now the coalition itself appears to be falling apart. Diogo Freitas do Amaral, the Christian Democratic leader, who is said to dislike Mr. Balsemao's relaxed political style, rejected his selection of Vitor Pereira Crespo, a former Education Minister, as the next Prime Minister and resigned the leadership of his party in protest. Another Election Is Urged **********''I do not think it is a choice that is likely to reignite public enthusiasm and confidence,'' Mr. Freitas do Amaral wrote in his letter of resignation. **********The worsening crisis has also brought immediate opposition calls for President Antonio Ramalho Eanes to dissolve Parliament and call yet another election, even though the coalition still has a comfortable majority and a mandate to govern until 1984. **********The conservative daily O Dia said the resignation had ''left the alliance adrift'' and made new elections '' almost inevitable.'' The Communist paper O Diario said new elections were justified because the ruling alliance was ''without any of its founders and historic leaders.'' **********''The crisis is unfortunate because it delays what has to be done,'' said Jacinto Nunes, the governor of the Portugese Central Bank. He was speaking of the interruption of the Balsemao coalition's campaign to reinvigorate Portugal's flagging economy and to undo what it has denounced as the left-wing excesses of the 1974 revolution. **********This nation of barely 10 million inhabitants has the highest inflation rate in Europe - 26 percent - and a ballooning trade deficit. Moreover, the Portuguese people have the lowest standard of living in Western Europe, with an average annual income of only $1,790. Budget Is a Casualty **********The first casualty of Portugal's latest political upheaval is the austerity budget that the Balsemao Government planned to introduce this year. The budget was intended to strengthen the economy by curbing the explosive growth of public spending that has taken place since the 1974 revolution, reduce inflation and bring the country's $3 billion a year external deficit under control. **********''Austerity is needed for the economy's good, but when will it start?'' asked J.M. Ferreira do Amaral, vice president of the Foreign Invesment Institute. **********Another casualty is the coalition's campaign to roll back the vast wave of nationalizations that began after the 1974 revolution, when most of the country's basic industries, banks, insurance companies and many shops and other businesses were all taken over by the Government. Big farms were occupied by the workers. **********At the same time, Portugal adopted a Constitution under which the decisions of an elected Parliament were subject to veto by the President and a Revolutionary Council of left-wing officers. **********During the Balsemao administration's two years in power, the Constitution was revised, depriving the President of much of his power and abolishing the Revolutionary Council. In addition, the Balsemao Government committed Portugal to a free-enterprise economy and membership in the European Common Market. Nationalization Is Pledged **********To obtain Socialist support for these changes, it was forced to concede ''irreversible'' state ownership of nationalized companies in seven sectors, including banking, brewing, steelmaking and transportation. But Mr. Balsemao reportedly planned to water this down by selling off other nationalized companies belonging to the banks, by allowing new private banks and companies to compete with state ones and by inviting private firms to manage companies ''irreversibly'' nationalized in return for a share of their profits. **********This policy was described by Mr. Ferreira do Amaral as ''backdoor denationalization.'' The future of this denationalization program appears in doubt as a result of the Government's fall. Sales of some state-owned companies have begun, but it is uncertain whether they will continue. **********Mr. Nunes, the Central bank governor, said that without new legislation he could not authorize any of the 30-odd applications on his desk from foreign banks eager to set up shop in Portugal in competition with the nationalized institutions. **********Private bids have already been invited for a contract to manage the state-owned Settenave shipyards.

Mrs. Milgrom said that the letter was a great relief, but that the heart pains he mentioned worried her because her husband died three years ago of heart disease. **********Mr. Shcharansky, an activist in the human rights and Jewish emigration movements, was arrested March 1977 and sentenced to three years in prison followed by 10 years in labor camps. After he was transferred to a camp, he was repeatedly incarcerated in a punishment cell and finally, in late 1981, was sentenced to spend three more years of his term in prison ''for failing to work at rehabilitation and continuing to consider himself innocent.'' **********Mrs. Milgrom said letters had been cut off soon after he was transferred back to Chistopol.

Chickens and crab grass compete for the space among the debris these days but, not long ago, the villa was home to Joshua Nkomo, Zimbabwe's opposition leader, who fled his own country this week. **********Lusaka, the tranquil Zambian capital, was his headquarters during the seven years of guerrilla war that preceded Zimbabwe's independence in 1980. But from the perspective of Zambia and others among southern Africa's ''frontline'' countries, Mr. Nkomo's political fortunes, like his onetime residence, are beyond repair and, officials said, he would not be welcome if he eventually tried to return here. **********Once supported by a broad front of nations, Mr. Nkomo, many officials say, has now become an embarrassment. The risks involved in embracing him are too great and, in the African context, there is rarely a place in the conclaves of the victor for those who have faltered in the struggle for power. Neither are there many African leaders who are prepared to entertain their neighbor's foes, since the fear is that such hospitality could draw unwelcome reciprocation. It is also a guiding principle of the Organization of African Unity that a neighbor's affairs should not be interfered with lest vengeance be taken and wider frailties be exposed. Zambia Arrests Nkomo Followers **********Two rival nationalist guerrilla forces fought for Zimbabwe's independence. Zambia and Botswana were associated mainly with Mr.  Nkomo; Mozambique and Tanzania were more closely aligned with Robert Mugabe, who is now Prime Minister. **********Since Zimbabwe's independence, a Western diplomat said, President Kenneth D. Kaunda of Zambia has ''leaned over backward'' to try to convince Mr. Mugabe of his good faith and to assure him that his support for Mr. Nkomo in the war will not be transformed into backing for subversion in times of peace. **********Lately, Western sources said, Zambia has arrested up to 50 of Mr.  Nkomo's followers who have tried to cross the Zambezi River and seek sanctuary in their former rear base in Zambia. Some are in custody and others, the sources said, have been handed over to Zimbabwe. **********But still, Zimbabwe's suspicions linger, confronting Zambia, a poor and landlocked former British possession, with a potential problem.  ''Nkomo must not embroil Zambia,'' a senior Zambian official said when asked whether the Zimbabwean might eventually find refuge here. Dependent on Railway Line **********Zambia is dependent on the rail line that runs south from its copper mines, through Zimbabwe, to South African ports and the arteries of world trade. **********There is an alternative line - the Chinese-built Tazara railway running northeast to Dar es Salaam, the Tanzanian port and capital, but it is unreliable and cannot carry all Zambia's imports and exports. **********Zaire, too, is heavily dependent on the ''southern route'' and Western diplomats said the Government of President Mobutu Sese Seko there is also deeply concerned about events unfolding in Zimbabwe. **********Over the last year Zambia has been increasingly concerned by the threat to the route posed by an insurgency in Zimbabwe's southwestern province of Matabeleland where renegade soldiers who once fought under Mr. Nkomo's banner in the war against white rule have killed more than 120 people, while Government forces, in a campaign against them, are reported to have killed a thousand civilians. The railroad runs straight through the troubled province, and Bulawayo, the focal point of Mr. Nkomo's support, is the hub of the Zimbabwean rail network. **********''In the last month or two, Zambia has been more and more nervous'' about the situation in Matabeleland, a Western diplomat said, for the fear is that dissident sabotage, or full-scale civil war, could sever the lifeline. 'Sad and Tangled Mess' **********The depth of Zambia's worries was illustrated in an editorial today in the officially owned Times of Zambia. ''It would be grossly wrong for Zambia to embroil itself in the already sad and tangled mess'' surrounding Mr. Nkomo's self-exile, the newspaper said. **********During the war, Mr. Nkomo was hailed here as the patriarch of the Zimbabwean nationalist movement, but attitudes toward him have hardened. ''He cannot come here,'' a Zambian businessman said. ''We did enough for him during the war.'' **********The allusion was to Rhodesian raids and reprisals that Zambia attracted by harboring Mr. Nkomo's Soviet-supported guerrilla force.  It was during a Rhodesian raid in 1979 that Mr. Nkomo's house, a bare half-mile from Dr. Kaunda's official residence, was wrecked. Later a demolition squad razed it."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/26/business/daon-s-bid-to-raise-new-cash.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-09-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 854, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DAON'S BID TO RAISE NEW CASH", "print_headline": "DAON'S BID TO RAISE NEW CASH", "body_text": " **********The financially troubled Daon Development Corporation, one of the high-flying Canadian realty groups that expanded aggressively into the United States in the mid-1970's, has surprised the property market in Canada with its plans to raise $165 million (Canadian) of new capital following a reorganization of its debt. A Canadian dollar is worth about 81 United States cents. **********Analysts are questioning why investors should be prepared to put up new cash for a company near bankruptcy that, to survive, is offering shares to its bankers and debenture holders in place of interest payments. **********''It's so flabbergasting,'' said Ira Gluskin, property analyst with Brown, Baldwin & Nisker, a Toronto stock brokerage firm. **********'Rights Issue' **********Daon, based in Vancouver, is planning to raise the money from a ''rights issue'' - one offered first to shareholders and then, if they are not interested, to institutions. The issue would be put together outside Canada, with a London merchant banker, Kleinwort Benson, acting as lead manager and Laurie Millbank as the broker. **********Analysts say that given the complex structure of Daon's $1.9 billion of debt, it was an achievement for the company to have worked out the restructuring with its major lenders. ''To add to it some foreign investors prepared to put up $165 million is a noble effort,'' Mr. Gluskin said. **********The rights issue will only go ahead if the restructuring program is agreed upon, but analysts believe Daon's creditors have little choice but to approve it. **********Daon's debt is backed by equity of only $72 million. Its stock now trades at around $1.80 a share; the price has been as high as $13.62 a share. The company ceased paying dividends and repurchasing preference shares more than a year ago. **********Arrangements with its major bankers for the restructuring of its debt take account of the priority that would have been given to differing classes of creditors had the company been forced into a formal receivership. Interest and some principal repayments arising between Aug. 1, 1982, and Oct. 31, 1986, are to be satisfied by the issue of new common shares. Later principal payments are to be part of a new debt schedule and debenture holders are to be given an option to convert into the new shares. Better Balance Sheet **********Meetings to approve the plan are proposed for mid-October. If it goes through, Daon's balance sheet will be improved, but the company will still carry a heavy debt burden. **********However, William H. Levine, the company's executive vice president and chief financial officer, said in a telephone interview from Vancouver that after the restructuring the company will have a significant value. **********''Our properties are good properties,'' he added. ''Our problem has been too much debt.'' **********Daon's problems arose as its rapid debt-financed expansion ran into the high interest rates of 1981, which saw the Canadian prime rate rise to 23 percent. Its strategy was to use debt to finance property and land sales in an inflationary market, using profits from trading on the increased values of land and apartments to service debts while building up a substantial, high value, income-producing commercial portfolio. **********For a while the strategy worked. In 1980, residential sales were 49 percent of revenues and land sales 29 percent, while profits, at $51.3 million that year, had grown from $10.3 million in 1977. Led by Jack W. Poole, its president and chief executive officer, Daon's assets increased fivefold, to $2.37 billion, between 1977 and 1981. Move into United States **********In the mid-70's, Daon began its aggressive move into the United States, acquiring residential apartments in California, across the Sun Belt and in Florida. The apartments were converted into condominiums and sold. At the same time, the company built up land banks in California and in the fast-growing, oil-rich Canadian province of Alberta. **********''They did very well for a number of years, but they held on for too long,'' said Harry Ranala, property analyst of Merrill Lynch Royal Securities. **********Daon was buying and developing its commercial portfolio at what proved to be the top of the market. In 1981, it continued to invest heavily, buying a 47-story office block in Montreal for $85 million, a 40-story office block in Philadelphia and a half-interest in the Omni complex in Atlanta. **********While interest rates were soaring, Daon was still using debt to increase its assets that year by 41 percent. Then the bottom dropped out of condominium sales, both in Canada and the United States, land sales dropped off in California, and the oil and gas boom in Alberta collapsed. By August 1982, the company could no longer service its loans, and for the year it lost $85.5 million. **********Negotiations over the restructuring of the debt have taken 18 months, during which the company has been realizing cash by selling nearly all of its residential properties. **********Analysts say Daon retains some quality commercial properties and potentially salable land, but they are awaiting the detailed restructuring plan to assess the company's prospects."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/08/business/ex-typist-for-wachtell-accused-of-insider-tips.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-07-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1294, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EX-TYPIST FOR WACHTELL ACCUSED OF INSIDER TIPS", "print_headline": "EX-TYPIST FOR WACHTELL ACCUSED OF INSIDER TIPS", "body_text": " **********A former typist at a New York law firm that is one of the nation's specialists in corporate mergers was accused today of illegally passing tips about pending mergers to friends and relatives who were said to have used the information to make $2.7 million in the stock market. **********The Securities and Exchange Commission brought the charge principally against Manohar Lal Madan, 48 years old, who joined Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz in the 1970's as a typist, a job he held until his dismissal last November. **********The commission said, in effect, that Mr. Lal Madan passed information about planned mergers that he came across as he typed.  The S.E.C. also filed charges against the friends and relatives. **********The friends and relatives, using this information, were able to buy stocks in companies soon to be the targets of takeover bids, the S.E.C. said. When the bids were announced, the stocks of these companies rose in price and Mr. Lal Madan's group sold at a profit, the commission charged. They traded in the stocks of 29 companies this way and earned the $2.7 million over five years, the S.E.C.  said. **********The commission said Mr. Lal Madan had an agreement with the others under which he shared in the profits from the transactions, which it said were based on illegally obtained insider information. In one instance, the S.E.C. said, one of those involved paid Mr. Lal Madan about $25,000. Pabst and Marshall Field **********The companies he was said to have recommended included such recent takeover targets as the Pabst Brewing Company and Marshall Field & Company. The 29 companies were either clients of Wachtell or were under consideration by clients as possible targets of tender offers or mergers, the commission said. **********The S.E.C. began investigating Mr. Lal Madan last fall, after receiving an anonymous tip that his son had traded in Pabst stock while the law firm was representing the brewery, a Wachtell spokesman said. **********Just before Thanksgiving, the S.E.C. notified Wachtell officials that it was beginning an investigation. It also asked for and received information on Mr. Lal Madan's assignments for the firm, according to the firm's spokesman. On Nov.30, Mr. Lal Madan was dismissed by Washtell in the course of its own investigation. **********According to Wachtell, Mr. Lal Madan was hired in May 1976 and had previously worked for two other New York law firms - Simpson Thacher & Bartlett and Poletti Freidin Prashker Feldman & Gartner. Wachtell said lawyers from those firms sent ''very good'' letters of recommendation about Mr. Lal Madan. Wachtell also said that Mr.  Madan was born in Pakistan and, according to his resume, had once worked as an ''assistant/secretary'' for senior government officials in India. Assets Frozen **********This afternoon, Federal Judge Morris Lasker of the United States District Court in New York granted the commission's request for a temporary freeze on the assets of the defendants. The agency is also seeking an injunction against further violations of the Federal securities laws, and wants the defendants to give up any illegal profits. **********In rare instances, the S.E.C. has recommended criminal prosecution for insider trading.  In addition to Mr. Lal Madan, the defendants, as listed in the S.E.C. complaint, included Darshan Madan, his wife, and their son, Akshay Madan, all of Queens; Sudesh and Vishvinder Madan, Melville, L.I., residents who are not related to Mr. Lal Madan, and Romesh and Satish Wadhwa, brothers, and Amul Shah and Mahendra Shah, said to be friends of Mr. Lal Madan. Romesh Wadhwa lives in Downers Grove, Ill., and Satish Wadhwa lives in Rochester, Minn. Amul Shah lives in Queens and Mahendra Shah lives in Manhattan. The Shahs are not kin. **********Also named were Asha Enterprises, a travel agency owned by Amul Shah and Mahendra Shah, and its subsidiaries, Asha Investors and Avm Investors; Krishan Taneja, of Queens, and L.R. Chadda, the father-inlaw of Mr. Taneja. **********All of the individuals named in the complaint, except Mr. Chadda, are either naturalized citizens or permanent residents of the United States. Mr. Chadda was last known to be living in London. All of the defendants were born in either Pakistan or India. Dirks Decision Recalled **********Gary L. Lynch, associate director of the agency's enforcement division, said today in a telephone interview: ''The commission believes that the theories that are being advanced in this case are consistent with the language set in the Supreme Court's decision in Dirks.'' **********Last week, in the Dirks decision, the High Court set new limits on the legal liability of those who make use of nonpublic information they receive from a corporate insider, usually an officer, director or major stockholder. The Court said the duty of a person who receives an insider tip depends entirely on whether the source of the tip has himself breached a legal duty to the corporation's shareholders. **********Whether the insider has breached a duty, the Court said, depends in turn on his motive and on whether he stands to gain from passing the information further along the chain. **********According to the S.E.C.'s complaint, from May 1976 through Nov.30, 1982, Mr. Lal Madan routinely typed drafts of documents related to possible mergers. **********The complaint specifically noted that Mr. Lal Madan knew that Wachtell maintained ''stringent policies concering the confidentiality of client information.'' It added that he ''made Wachtell a victim of the fraud perpetrated by him.'' **********The long S.E,C. complaint lists numerous transactions in which the defendants jointly participated. For example, in late 1982, Wachtell began drafting documents relating to a proposed merger between Pabst, its client, and the G. Heileman Brewing Company, in which Heileman would make a tender offer for Pabst. **********On Oct.21, 1982, and continuing intermittently through November, the complaint charges, Mr. Lal Madan worked on documents related to the proposed offer. During this period, the S.E.C. said, he disclosed to the other defendants information of the takeover, and they purchased large quantities of Pabst shares. **********One defendant, Romesh Wadhwa, for example, was said to have purchased $115,949 in shares and, following Heileman's announcement of its tender offer, sold the shares for $150,023. **********Steven Barna, a partner with Watctell, said in a telephone interview, ''Unfortunately, no rule, no matter how strict, can provide an insurance policy against this kind of conduct by a person who is willing to run the risk of violating the securities laws.'' Chiarella v. U.S. **********In 1980, in another, somewhat similar insider case before the Supreme Court, Chiarella v. U.S., the Court reversed the securities fraud conviction of a printer who profited from his advance knowledge of takeover bids from documents he handled. **********The defendant in that case, Vincent F. Chiarella, had, over a 14-month period, made $30,000 by buying stock in the target companies and then selling the shares as soon as the takeover bids were made public. **********The Court ruled, however, that insider trading violates the securities laws only if the trader breaches a pre-existing relationship of trust with the other party to the transaction. **********Mr. Chiarella, said Associate Justice Lewis F. Powell, ''was not a fiduciary, he was not a person in whom the sellers had placed their trust and confidence. He was, in fact, a complete stranger who dealt with the sellers only through impersonal market transactions.'' **********Apparently in an attempt to distinguish the case against Mr. Lal Madan from Chiarella, the S.E.C. said today that Mr. Lal Madan ''enjoyed a special relationship of trust and confidence with Wachtell and its clients.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/28/world/operation-on-grenada-how-forces-performed.html": {"writer_name": "Drew Middleton", "pub_date": "1983-10-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 857, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "OPERATION ON GRENADA: HOW FORCES PERFORMED", "print_headline": "OPERATION ON GRENADA: HOW FORCES PERFORMED", "body_text": " **********MilitaryAnalysis **********With resistance on Grenada apparently lessening, United States intelligence and operations officers are about to reassess the strengths and weaknesses of the armed services that took part in the invasion of the island.  One question likely to be raised, according to an officer who did not wish to be identified, is why it took the Americans more than two days to defeat a thousand Cubans and a Grenadian Army of just over 2,000 soldiers. After the 800 men of the 82d Airborne Division landed Wednesday, there were nearly 3,000 American soldiers and marines deployed, backed by helicopter gunships. **********The 300 men contributed by seven Caribbean nations were reportedly used for police duties. **********A military rule of thumb is that an attacking force should have a superiority of 3 to 1. The Americans, in numbers at least, had no such advantage when they landed. But they did have more and better weapons and had undergone long training.   Error in Intelligence Is Seen Some officers suggested that there had been an intelligence error. American officials said about 1,000 Cubans had been discovered in Grenada, 400 more than were said to have been engaged in building the Point Salines Airport. The Cubans proved to be well-trained and fought stubbornly. **********Some of them were construction workers probably drawn from the Youth Labor Army, a component of the armed forces that numbers 100,000 men. But the soldiers who gave the Americans the most trouble apparently were regulars stationed in Grenada. **********Some informants said the large amounts of military equipment and ammunition found in Grenada were evidence that Cuba intended to strengthen its garrison. The conclusion they drew was that the American invasion had come just in time. **********The Cubans apparently lacked the one weapon that could have checked the assault. They reportedly did not have, or at least did not use, portable, heat-seeking antiaircraft missiles.   Copters Operate With Impunity **********As a result, American helicopter gunships were said to have operated with impunity, destroying, with heavy casualties, the main Cuban position at the Point Salines airfield, at the southwest tip of the island. **********The Grenadian Army had reportedly been equipped with Soviet-made mobile antiaircraft guns. But these were not employed either against the helicopters or against the transports that fed the attacking forces with ammunition, reinforcements and supplies. **********Another factor likely to be studied is the behavior of troops who had previously had little or no combat experience. **********Many senior noncommissioned officers had served in the Vietnam War. So did many of the officers from the rank of major up. But the enlisted men of that war have been replaced by volunteers, most of whom have entered the Army and the Marine Corps in the last four to six years. **********Officers say that these men are ready for any mission. But the officers point out that the first shock of combat is likely to slow reactions and occasionally force mistakes.   Best Units in West Germany **********The consensus among the Atlantic allies is that the United States Army's best units are with the Seventh Army in West Germany. One exception is the 82d Airborne Division, which is considered one of the best such divisions. **********The Americans did fight under a handicap. Strongpoints in the area of St. George's, the Grenadian capital, such as Fort Frederick and Richmond Hill prison, could have fallen earlier had the invaders been able to call in bombers or use heavy artillery. But senior officers ruled out the use of such weapons to avoid killing civilians. **********The helicopter gunships gave the infantry the support it needed when it faced Cuban strongpoints. C-130 and C-5A transports landing at the new Point Salines Airport provided logistical support. **********In this respect it was a picture book operation. Officers say the operation would have been more difficult and the role of the United States Air Force more constrained if Soviet-made MIG jets had been deployed on the new airstrip or antiaircraft missiles had been used.   Cuban Threat Called Averted **********Defense officials said that, if the United States had not invaded Grenada and Cuban planes had begun to use the 9,000-foot runway at Point Salines, the strategic balance in the Caribbean could have changed. Fighter operations could then have expanded to cover Central America and parts of northern South America. This, the officials said, would have required a reinforcement of United States Air Force resources in the area. **********Some allied officers questioned the size of the American force deployed and in reserve. They used the word ''overkill.'' **********But Americans responded by pointing out that no country ever lost a battle by being too strong. In the case of Grenada, the Americans argue, the vigor of the Cuban resistance showed that the Pentagon was correct in employing a relatively large force with abundant reinforcements. **********No one, an officer said, has forgotten the lesson of the abortive rescue attempt in Iran in April 1980. That lesson, he said, was ''too little and too late.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/29/business/business-digest-004752.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-10-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 692, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********SATURDAY, OCTOBER 29, 1983 **********Companies Texas Instruments is halting production of its 99/4A home computer and withdrawing from the field.

Gallagher, the chairman of Dome Petroleum. **********Mr. Gallagher, who was called ''Smiling Jack,'' is now gone, Beaufort oil seems, at best, a dream deferred, and Dome's prospects are no brighter. **********This summer marked the shortest Beaufort drilling season ever, with ice allowing only 76 days for it, 50 fewer than last year. And last year was also disappointing. **********Thus, after more than a decade of drilling, enough oil to justify commercial exploitation has not yet been found. Known reserves total only 700 million barrels, against a potential estimated at more than nine billion, nearly the size of Alaska's Prudhoe Bay. **********''We haven't been quite as successful as we'd anticipated,'' R. A. W. Hoos, a Dome executive, said recently, conceding that the company's earlier hope of beginning Beaufort production by 1985 or 1986 was now impossible. **********Which would require large amounts of oil revenue, of course, and that possibility seems to be fast receding. Evidence of the changed view is a skittishness among smaller companies involved in the Beaufort. Canterra Energy Ltd., for instance, recently pulled out of its small share of Gulf Canada's $75 million well in the Pitsiulak region. **********''Until results show forth, the Beaufort will not command the high profile it once did,'' said Ian M. Doig, a Calgary, Alberta, oil analyst. **********Environmental Review **********The hearing here was testimony to an earlier vision of the Beaufort. In the expectation of a bonanza by the mid-1980's, the principal companies operating in the area - Dome, Imperial Oil and Gulf Canada - three years ago asked the Canadian Government to begin a major review of the environmental effects of a huge program to pump and ship the oil. So far, the companies say they have spent $20 million, and the Government several million more for the the review. Hearings are being held across the Arctic. **********The hearing here was limited to environmental issues, but the discussion behind the scenes revolved around economic issues. ''The question should be is it economic?'' said Murray Coolican, an Arctic expert working with the Inuit Tapirisat, one of the main groups of Arctic natives opposing development. **********The answer, companies agree, is that it would not be economic without the huge grants given by the Canadian Government, under the Petroleum Incentive Payments program, to promote Canadian exploration in frontier areas. **********Last year, Ottawa gave companies $501 million to drill in the Beaufort, more than double the previous year's outlay of $244 million. The Beaufort grants in 1982 were 38 percent of the total incentive payments program of $1.3 billion. And an increase in spending is expected this year. **********''We would not be exploring in the Beaufort at the rate and level we are'' without the grants, said Patrick Shaw, an Imperial spokesman. **********A Drilling Disappointment **********Obviously, a big discovery could reverse the equation, but last year's conclusive results were worse than this year's inconclusive ones. Five wildcat wells were completed last year to test unexplored formations. Only two encountered oil, and only one found enough to generate any enthusiasm. That was the Nerlerk structure, covering 90,000 acres and needing further appraisal. **********That Dome success, however, was overshadowed by the disappointment of the Tarsiut formation, where an evaluation well last year failed to find any oil. Mr. Hoos said that if the well had proved successful, Dome would have had a billion-barrel oilfield instead of its present estimate of 350 million barrels. **********Mr. Hoos said that would be enough to be commercial in milder environments, but he added that, in combination with three other fields, ranging from 50 million to 200 million barrels, some type of development might be possible sooner that most analysts expected. The prevailing view has been that it would take at least one big find to allow for the construction of a transportation system that would permit overall Beaufort development to proceed. **********''We're now looking at ways of optimizing recovery from a grouping of small fields,'' Mr. Hoos said. ''There are several options available to us.'' **********Imperial's Gains **********Gulf is involved with Dome in Tarsiut and several other Beaufort efforts. But in the view of many analysts, it is Imperial, 70 percent of which is owned by the Exxon Corporation, that has been most successful. **********Since the mid-1960's, Imperial has drilled on the MacKenzie River Delta, creeping slowly into the Beaufort. Its many small discoveries are estimated by outsiders to be capable of producing about 40,000 barrels of oil a day, and represent the only firm success in the Beaufort to date. **********''It could be 15 to 20 years before anybody but Imperial produces any oil,'' said Stanley Kanik, a Canadian Government geologist attending the hearing. **********Although Imperial says it is willing to use tankers if that would offer the greatest benefit to all oil drillers, many analysts suggest that the company is most interested in a pipeline. They estimate oil could be flowing to an Edmonton refinery by 1990 through such a line. **********Mr. Kanik says Imperial has been more successful because it apparently has a better appreciation of how oil accumulates under delta regions. He says oil tends to gather in small pools in and near deltas, citing the mouths of the Niger and the Mississippi as examples. **********Canada's Arctic oil thrust is related to a Government estimate that 75 Arctic wells might produce as much crude as 22,000 in Alberta, Canada's main petroleum province. But the discovery rate has picked up in Alberta, while expectations have not been met in the Northwest Territories. **********Moreover, the pace of oil sands development in Alberta has been picking up. This has led to questions about the wisdom of concentrating so much drilling resources and Government money in the Beaufort. **********''No matter how you cut it, Alberta is where our oil and gas supplies are for the foreseeable future,'' Jim Grey, executive vice president of Canadian Hunter Exploration Ltd., said when asked about the Beaufort. ''We just have staggering amounts.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/28/business/briefs-debt-ratings.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-12-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 587, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": " Debt Ratings", "print_headline": "BRIEFS;  Debt Ratings", "body_text": " ***********  American Hoist and Derrick Co.'s ratings on its Duluth and St. Paul, Minn., industrial revenue bonds was lowered to Ba2, from Baa3, by Moody's Investors Service, which also reduced the company's rating on its two subordinated debentures to B1, from Ba2. ***********  United Brands Co.'s rating on its subordinated debentures was raised to B2, from B3, by Moody's Investors Service, which said the change, affecting about $173 million of outstanding debt, ''reflects the earnings improvement being realized after the company's restructuring of its banana business.'' **********Common Stock ***********  Computer Synergy Inc., an Oakland, Calif., producer of integrated computer software systems for acute-care hospitals, filed for an offering of 625,000 shares, at an anticipated price of between $6 and $8 a share, through Van Kasper & Co., San Francisco. ***********  Environmental Technology Inc.  filed for a proposed initial public offering of 900,000 common shares, through underwriters led by Laidlaw Adams & Peck Inc. ***********  Dow B.

But in a highly unusual statement included in the court documents, the S.E.C. said it was continuing its ''private investigation'' of the company. **********The complaint filed today did not name any of AM's past or current management, accountants or outside auditors in the reportedly fraudulent practices. But it dealt with the 1980 and 1981 fiscal years. During most of that the company was headed by Roy L. Ash. Mr.  Ash was chief executive of AM for four years, and before that served as director of the Office of Management and Budget from 1972 through 1975 in the Nixon and Ford Administrations. **********He resigned from AM International in February 1981, following a clash with directors over acquisition policies that have also been blamed for AM's financial difficulties. **********Mr. Ash was succeeded by Richard B. Black, a turnaround specialists who attempted to put AM International back on its feet, in part through divestiture of some of Mr. Ash's acquisitions. But Mr. Black resigned 13 months later after filing a suit against AM International. The suit accused AM, Price Waterhouse and several former AM executives of misrepresenting the company's finances, inducing him to join AM and personally invest $3 million in its stock. **********Reached at his New York home, Mr. Black said that he had not seen the S.E.C. charges and had not talked to the investigators. He added that he did not believe the findings had anything to do with his tenure at the company, which started six months before the end of the 1981 fiscal year, but that they may bolster his charges. ''There was just massive misrepresentation there,'' he said. **********Mr. Ash could not be reached for comment.  The financial troubles of the Chicago-based company, one of the nation's oldest and best-known suppliers of office equipment and information processing systems, began with its inability to keep up with the technology war in the mid-1960's among makers of electronic addressing machines and copiers.

In response to these pressures, the S.E.C. charges, various divisions of the company ''engaged in widespread and pervasive accounting irregularities.'' Throughout this period, the company's corporate headquarters learned of numerous instances of accounting irregularies, but continued to pressure its divisions, according to the S.E.C. **********Among the improper accounting techniques employed, the S.E.C.  charges, was the practice of recording products that had not yet been shipped as sales.

During this period, the complaint charges, Jacquard recognized about $1 million in revenues as a result of improperly keeping its books open.

WALL STREET'' himself, the legendary Sidney J. Weinberg, made his reputation by being one of the canniest wizards of finance and also by sitting on no fewer than 35 boards of directors. In his 60-year career, he watched over the management of the bluest of the blue chips, a list that included such giants as General Electric, Ford and B. F. Goodrich. **********The reputation of Mr. Weinberg, a partner in Goldman, Sachs & Co. until his death in 1969, may live on. But his practice of sitting on dozens of boards - as many as 31 at one time - has not. Even his sons don't come close. One son, John L. Weinberg, co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs, today sits on a mere six boards, while his other son, Sidney J. Weinberg Jr., a Goldman, Sachs partner, sits on only five. **********Boards of directors have changed, and so have those who sit on them. Busy executives have cut down on their board engagements, not only to concentrate their effectiveness but also because board responsibilities have become weightier. Outside directors - those with no financial ties to the company - have increased in number with a corresponding decrease in insider directors. Board committees, particularly the audit and nominating committees, have become more common and more important. And new groups - minorities, women and academics - are showing up more and more. **********Whether these changes have caused boards to become more critical and vigilant overseers of a company's management is open to question - and it is a question that is impossible to answer since most board actions take place behind closed doors. Clearly, management has the upper hand since it has the day-to-day knowledge of the company's inner workings while directors spend only a limited number of hours a month on their board tasks. **********Moreover, much of the information directors receive is prepared by management, and only a diligent director will make inquiries beyond these management presentations. Yet, some say the mere fact that these structural changes in boards are slowly coming about makes substantive changes in the quality of board actions inevitable. **********''The changes in peformance have been rather modest, but in a constructive direction,'' said Elliott J. Weiss, a visiting professor of law at the Cornell Law School and a specialist in corporate responsibility. ''The way people think about boards and those who serve as directors make it likely that boards are a bit more assertive, a bit less compliant, a bit more inclined to ask questions. But how big of a bit it is, I just don't know.'' **********Many of the changes that have taken place resulted from widespread discussion in the mid-1970's about corporate governance - the public responsibilities of a corporation and its board - which focused more attention on what directors should do. **********This followed disclosures that some American companies, such as Lockheed and Exxon, made questionable payments to foreign governments, raising the issue of whether directors of those companies knew about the payments and, if so, what they should have done. At the same time, some consumer activist groups were demanding broader representation on corporate boards, and Harold M. Williams, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission from 1977 to 1981 and an advocate of outside directors, was campaigning to increase the oversight responsibilities of corporate boards. **********The discussion in the mid-70's ''contributed to the independence of directors,'' Mr. Williams said. ''My main hope now is that individual boards look at themselves, reassess their responsibility and how well they are discharging it.'' **********Jeremy Bacon, a senior research associate at The Conference Board, points to three changes that have taken place since the mid-1970's: The increase in outside directors, greater use of committees and a change in attitude in which more corporations feel that a strong, independent board is a concept whose time has come. **********''This is something that's very widespread,'' said Mr. Bacon. ''Chief executives at corporations now talk with greater conviction of improving boards.'' **********Said Kenneth R. Andrews, editor in chief of the Harvard Business Review: ''Boards today may often be selected by the chief executive officer, but they are not beholden to him.'' **********To assess how these changes have affected certain aspects of board membership, The New York Times, using information compiled by Disclosure Inc., a computerized data base of S.E.C. documents, surveyed 8,500 publicly held companies to see how many people sit on multiple boards. Unlike the senior Mr. Weinberg's era, it is rare to find any person on more than a dozen boards. In the Disclosure survey, no one was found on more than 11 public boards - and there were only 17 people with 8 or more directorships. Of this group, a large proportion are retired executives, while a smaller proportion are active executives. **********The list of 17 includes Fred R. Sullivan, the retired chairman of Kidde Inc.; Samuel A. Casey, retired chairman of the Great Northern Nekoosa Company, and George Kozmetsky, former dean of the University of Texas business school. One black - Jerome H. Holland, chairman of the American Red Cross and former Ambassador to Sweden - and one woman - Juanita M. Kreps, former Secretary of Commerce - were also in the top 17. **********The list indicates that more outsiders are sitting on boards. The argument against inside directors - those from management as well as lawyers and investment bankers hired by the company - is that they cannot offer truly objective views. And, even more so, the growth of committees has been heralded by some as a way of, structurally at least, shifting important duties away from corporate insiders. The audit committee, for instance, oversees the audit of the company's books by an outside firm, the nominating committee recommends new directors and the executive compensation committee examines the compensation of top management. **********A survey by Korn/Ferry International, an executive search firm, of 660 major corporate boards shows that senior executives are still the most common board members - 88.2 percent of all - but the proportion has remained flat over the years. The survey also shows a drop in the percentage of directors with close ties to the company - between 1973 and 1982, attorneys hired by the company on whose boards they served fell to 28.2 percent from 51.7 percent; commercial bankers fell to 33.6 percent from 55.4 percent; investment bankers to 23.7 percent from 37.3 percent, and major shareholders to 30.4 percent from 43.1 percent. **********At the same time, other groups rose: Women board members increased to 41.2 percent from 10.7 percent; minorities to 23.2 percent from 8.9 percent, and academics to 50.4 percent from 34.9 percent. **********Still, some question whether it is all simply window dressing. Robert C. Townsend, author of ''Up the Organization,'' and former chief executive of Avis Inc., claims that in the 80 hours a year or so that board members devote to their activities, it is impossible properly to oversee a company. Indeed, he sees boards as meaningless, at best a gathering spot for retired executives. ''Boards are pastures for old horses in business,'' he said. ''They're uncomfortable anywhere but on the board or playing golf. All they are really doing is enjoying a form of a country club.'' **********Although most companies still prefer to choose executives of high standing - preferably chief executives - that's not always the best way, some say. **********William H. Donaldson, founder of the brokerage firm of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette and former dean of the Yale School of Management, feels that corporations should look beyond the top executive in seeking board members. ''Companies should dip down and take someone who is not a chief executive,'' he said. ''An executive vice president, for instance, often has more time to give than a chief executive and can be more effective.'' **********But, cautions Gerald Roach, president and chairman of Heidrick & Struggles, an executive search firm, many companies resist that argument and stick with tradition. ''You worry about having unknowns because you are loath to have surprises,'' he said. ''You don't want an irascible individual who's a constant irritant and always throwing in a monkey wrench. Yet almost every board has one.'' **********Chief Executives **********Communications entrepreneur Karl Eller, now chairman and chief executive of the Circle K Corporation, a Phoenix-based chain of 1,200 convenience stories, is an active chief executives who serves on six boards. He says he likes strong boards whose members are ''willing to comment and speak up.'' **********He finds being an active chief executive important. ''I learn new ways of doing financing, new approaches to the business, new ways of doing acquisitions,'' he said. ''You learn a lot from being on boards that help you with your own company.'' **********The board taking up most of his energy right now is Eastern Air Lines, which is facing severe financial problems. ''When something like that happens, you become more involved,'' he said. ''Meetings are tripled or quadrupled and we help management make key decisions. We're a sounding board for management - trying to keep them in the right directions, adding a little bit of stability and still trying to protect the shareholder.'' **********Blacks, Women **********When Andrew F. Brimmer left the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve to start his own economic consulting firm in 1974, he had 57 offers to sit on corporate boards. He ultimately chose six. Jerome H. Holland, the former president of the Hampton Institute in Virginia, was invited to sit on 60 boards after he stepped down as United States Ambassador to Sweden. He chose 10 of these. **********The two have somewhat different views on minority board memberships. ''Members of corporate boards are members of an institution that is designed to make money and not to be an instrument of social change,'' said Mr. Brimmer. ''When a company is faced with a question of investing in new plants and equipment, I don't see how a member could take a different view depending on whether they are white or black, man or woman,'' he said. **********Mr. Holland, however, said that he has added a black perspective to his boards. ''There are times when I felt the recruitment of minority students has not been aggressive enough and I met with the personnel people,'' he said. ''This work is something I've been interested in for years. But when I graduated from college, the corporate world was virtually closed.'' **********Juanita M. Kreps, former Secretary of Commerce, who sits on 10 boards, said the ''point is past'' when corporations sought women for boards simply because they ''wanted representation from both sexes. Being a woman does a certain amount of signalling,'' she said, ''but the issues that one deals with are corporate issues and, for the most part, boards do not deal with sex-related questions.'' **********Retirees Donald S. Perkins, former chairman of the Jewel Companies, a Midwest chain of supermarkets, and Samuel A. Casey, the retired chairman of Great Northern Nekoosa, are typical of many retired executives who prefer flying to board meetings to a more sedate retirement. **********Mr. Perkins finds his board activities so time consuming that he has trouble getting away for a vacation. ''Being involved gives you pespective,'' he said. ''What you see in one area, can be helpful in another.'' Mr. Perkins added he ''doesn't want to be on a board unless the chief executive wants help,'' Nor is he afraid of the exposure to risk: ''I worry a lot more about the quality of management. I don't spend a lot of time worrying about shareholders suits.'' **********Mr. Casey proclaims to have ''no great natural aptitude for golf or fishing and I find membership on boards stimulating.'' He recoils at those who dismiss board memberships. ''If I felt I were a rubber stamp, I wouldn't serve,'' he said. ''I think the concept that board memberships are a fraternity is greatly exaggerated. Board memberships are important and serious and I work hard at it.'' **********REASON ANDPRUDENCE **********The main task of directors is to oversee the management of the companies they serve. No Federal statutes specifically define a board's duties, but most states have laws generally saying that a director must exercise ''due care'' or act as a ''reasonable and prudent person.'' **********Directors are protected from liability by ''business judgment'' case law, which suggests that a director who uses a rational basis for a decision is not liable if that decision proves wrong. **********Federal laws affect directors indirectly. The Securities and Exchange Commission, for example, requires directors to sign registration statements every time their company issues securities, and also governs directors' use of insider information. **********For all this, plus the dozen or so board meetings a year they attend, directors are paid, on average, about $30,000. Fees range from about $15,000 for small companies to $70,000 for major ones."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/03/business/lama-tony-co-inc-reports-earnings-for-yr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-03-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 36, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LAMA, TONY, CO INC reports earnings for Yr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "LAMA, TONY, CO INC reports earnings for Yr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/09/business/iacocca-gets-bonus-to-stay-at-chrysler.html": {"writer_name": "John Holusha", "pub_date": "1983-12-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 538, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "IACOCCA GETS BONUS TO STAY AT CHRYSLER", "print_headline": "IACOCCA GETS BONUS TO STAY AT CHRYSLER", "body_text": " **********Lee A.

''Back when they were in trouble, the television commercials he did and the leadership he provided in cutting the company in half without killing it was essential.'' **********Mr. Iacocca's appearance in TV ads for Chrysler-made cars apparently helped the company's sales when its prospects looked bleak. **********First Big Chrysler Payoff **********The stock bonuses three years hence will be the first big payoff Mr. Iacocca will receive from Chrysler. He was given a bonus of $1.5 million to join the company, but that merely replaced benefits he had accumulated as president of the Ford Motor Company and had to leave behind in moving to a rival company. **********From Sept. 1, 1979, to Sept. 1, 1980, during the worst of Chrysler's financial crisis, he worked for $1 a year.  Then he resumed his salary of $360,000 a year.

Edward C. Meyer, the Army's Chief of Staff, said today that he would oppose sending United States combat forces to El Salvador because Americans would not support them and Salvadorans were not fully committed to defeating leftist insurgents there. **********The general, in response to a series of questions during a breakfast meeting with reporters, said the United States might have to consider intervention with troops if there was turmoil after the elections in El Salvador later this year. **********But he said that option should be considered only if there was a clear identification of political purposes, statement of military objectives, and public understanding of the costs in military manpower, weapons, money and time. **********The general said his views reflected those of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the military advisers to the President. His comments were the most forthright public expression so far of the reasons senior military officers have opposed sending combat forces to Central America. **********Reaction to Vietnam Recalled **********Drawing on the lessons of Vietnam, General Meyer said it would be wrong to have ''soldiers at the end of the string without having the support of the American people.'' He said that support does not exist now, and that he would protest to the President if he saw a move toward sending troops to Central America. **********General Meyer told reporters the United States could not defeat an insurgency where ''that nation isn't fully committed to the resolution of its internal problem.'' That commitment has not been evident in Salvador, he said. **********The Reagan Administration has said American troops would not be sent to Central America except as trainers and advisers. But members of Congress and others have expressed fears that the United States would edge into Central America as it did into Vietnam 20 years ago. **********General Meyer, who will step down on June 21 after four years as the Army's top officer, said that he would recommend sending troops if he thought that would solve the guerrilla problem, but that economic assistance was more important now. **********The general, who fought in the wars in Korea and Vietnam, said: ''If I thought the 82d Airborne going there would be a solution to the problem, I would probably recommend that right now. I don't think it would be.'' **********He said that having been in a guerrilla war in Vietnam, ''I realize that unless you have the commitment of the people, of the indigenous forces, you're not going to solve a guerrilla war.'' **********General Meyer said publicly what other military officers have said privately that ''there has been a crying need to pull together the economic, political, as well as the military arms of government so that we're applying to Central America coherent programs.'' **********He said the President ''is headed in that direction'' with the naming of a special envoy for Central America and other shuffling within the Administration. The overall approach, the general said, was to wean Nicaragua from Havana and Moscow; to assist Honduras, Costa Rica and Panama to ward off leftist incursions, and to assist El Salvador through political, military and economic aid. Economic Aid 'Very Critical' **********He said that economic assistance ''is very critical because guerrilla war is based on the legitimate concerns of the people.'' He said that ''the better the nations in that area are able to respond to those legitimate needs,'' the better they would be able to prevent insurgency. **********Referring to the reluctance of Congress to approve more economic aid for Central America, General Meyer said he thought that was equally or more important than military aid. ''That's why I worry about the inability to get the economic package through that will provide support to countries in that region,'' he said. **********General Meyer contended that limiting the number of United States military advisers in El Salvador, as they are limited now to 55, was a mistake. ''I don't believe that there should be a stated ceiling on how many military go down there,'' he said. ''That provides everybody with a fixed view of exactly how you're going to handle the problem.'' **********He added that if the military needed ''sufficient advisers to do a specific job, you ought to put in that number of advisers.'' He said that the military should be able to ''surge to a larger number when you needed to perform a specific training mission.'' Consensus Called Vital **********Questioned closely on the issue of sending combat forces to El Salvador, General Meyer said, ''There should be no uncertainty in the minds of those involved that whatever is necessary, if that poses a threat to us, we are willing to do.'' **********But he said ''there will have to be a consensus within the United States populace that what we are doing is sufficiently important that American soldiers go to war.'' He added: ''You can't send soldiers off to war without having the support of the American people.'' **********He said that if the military services are not permitted to employ sufficient forces, ''then we should stand up and say we can't do that with the forces involved.'' **********''We didn't do that in Vietnam,'' General Meyer said. ''We inched our way in. Then all of a sudden we were there.'' The general, who served twice as a field officer in Vietnam, said, ''I was a bit confused as to why I was over there.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/15/business/g-w-fills-chairman-post.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-12-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 149, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "G.& W.

The decline was wider than expected and was welcomed by economists and the credit market. **********In effect, the decline came close to erasing the jump in the money supply announced a week earlier. That unexpected increase, revised yesterday by the central bank, brought $2.6 billion of new money into the nation's financial system. **********''Last week's number was a surprise on the upside and this week we have a surprise on the downside,'' said Robert A. Schwartz, senior financial economist for Merrill Lynch & Company. **********He added that the decline in M-1 - a measure that includes currency in circulation and checking and check- like deposits - may have been influenced by a change in Federal banking regulations. As of Oct. 1, the interest- rate ceiling on most certificates of deposits was removed, encouraging transfers of funds from checking accounts, which fall in to the M-1 category, into high-yielding certificates of deposit, which do not. **********Nonetheless most analysts, including Mr. Schwartz, said they had expected a smaller decline. **********''I don't expect this to trigger any immediate change in Fed policy, but it has to be regarded as good news,'' said Maury Harris, economist at Paine Webber Inc. **********In the credit market, response to the drop in money supply was subdued, with traders saying they were reluctant to expand their holdings now because of a major offering of Government securities scheduled for next week. In a regular quarterly sale, or refunding, of securities, the Treasury Department is expected to offer $16 billion in bonds. **********'Too Much Paper to Unload' **********''The reaction was muted because of the Treasury issues coming to market soon,'' said one trader. ''This is too much paper to unload at these prices, and there is not enough investor demand for it yet.'' **********But in a modest price reaction to the Fed's announcement, the bellwether 12 percent bond due in 2003 was offered at 102 12/32 for a yield of about 11.71 percent, compared to 11.69 percent on Thursday. **********The securities that will be offered in the refunding were mostly unchanged, with the three-year note offered at 10.89 percent late yesterday, the same as on Thursday. The 10-year note was offered at 11.66 percent, down from 11.68 percent, and the 12 percent bonds were quoted with a yield of 11.73 percent, unchanged. **********3-Month Bill at 8.58% **********The rates on the shorter Treasury issues moved slightly lower, with the three-month bill offered late yesterday at 8.58 percent, down from 8.61 percent. The one-year bill was offered at 8.95 percent, down from 9 percent late Thurday. **********The $2.4 billion decline in the money supply, which lowered the total M-1 to $517.4 billion, leaves the nation's basic supply of currency on the low end of the target range set by the Fed. The target is for an annualized growth rate of between 5 and 9 percent, starting at the end of the second quarter. The decline reported yesterday means that the rate of M-1 growth, which had previously been at 7 percent, is now running at 5.7 percent. **********''It means we are into the lower end of the target and gives the Fed greater latitude in easing credit,'' Mr. Schwartz said. But while lower interest rates would be welcomed by many businessmen, Mr. Schwartz and other economists said they did not expect the Fed to make any moves to ease credit soon because the economy was expanding rapidly and because lower interests might spark higher levels of inflation. **********The economists pointed to yesterday's Commerce Department report that the nation's index of leading economic indicators for September had accelerated from the previous two months, advancing nine-tenths of 1 percent in September, a signal of strong expansion. **********''If we see another decline of over $2 billion'' in M-1, ''people will start speculating about the Fed easing credit,'' Mr. Harris said. But, he added, ''slow money growth is only one prerequisite. You have to see a slowdown in the economy as well.'' **********'Good News' for Short Term **********Kathleen Cooper, a senior economist for the Security Pacific Bank in Los Angeles, characterized the decline in the money supply as ''good news, but probably only for the short term.'' She said she expected the money supply to expand in the coming weeks, thus eliminating any rationale that the Fed might have for easing credit.  ''Most likely, the gains we have seen this week will be lost over the next two weeks,'' she said. **********Separately, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said yesterday that United States commercial and industrial loans fell $458 million in the week ended Oct. 18, to $215.45 billion."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/02/world/lebanon-irked-withdraws-invitation-to-koch.html": {"writer_name": "David Shipler", "pub_date": "1983-03-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 632, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LEBANON, IRKED, WITHDRAWS INVITATION TO KOCH", "print_headline": "LEBANON, IRKED, WITHDRAWS INVITATION TO KOCH", "body_text": " **********Mayor Koch said today that the Lebanese Government had withdrawn its invitation to visit Beirut because he entered southern Lebanon today in an Israeli Army helicopter without clearance from the Lebanese authorities. **********Speaking by telephone from Haifa, the New York City Mayor said that he had been informed of the Lebanese decision by the United States Embassy in Tel Aviv. **********The State Department had reportedly warned him that he would get no official reception in Beirut if he entered Lebanon through Israel.  The Lebanese Government is sensitive to the symbolic nature of tours conducted by the Israelis, whose forces have been occupying southern Lebanon since June. **********To solve the problem, the State Department had arranged for Mayor Koch to fly Friday by helicopter to a United States aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean, and from there to Beirut. Today's visit to southern Lebanon was a separate trip, which the Mayor said had been arranged and announced eight days ago, before the Lebanese Government extended its invitation. **********The Lebanese authorities told him today, he said, that he could still visit Beirut, but only as a private citizen, without any official meetings. **********''This would not be as productive,'' he declared, adding that he had been hoping to meet with a cross-section of leaders in Lebanon, as he has in Israel, where he arrived Friday. Without such an opportunity, he felt, he might as well go back to New York. **********Mr. Koch said Monday, after a meeting with Prime Minister Menachem Begin, that he found good sense in Israel's position on Lebanon - both in the rationale for the invasion to end the Palestinian threat to northern Israel and in the determination now to withdraw simultaneously with Syria. **********He said that he was impressed, on his visit today to the Israeli border town of Qiryat Shmona, with the difference between the tranquil life at present and the town's previous vulnerability to rocket attacks from across the Lebanese border. He said he had visited an underground shelter and heard accounts of the attacks that plagued the community in years past. **********An Israeli helicopter then took him to Nabatiye, Sidon and Tyre, but the Mayor portrayed his encounters with some of the Lebanese officials under Israeli occupation as uninformative. In Nabatiye, he said, Mayor Mustafa Jaber was ''not very communicative,'' and Lebanese reporters who questioned Mr. Koch were ''quite hostile.'' **********In Sidon, he said, ''the Mayor didn't show.'' A Deputy Mayor did appear, but Mr. Koch said that ''no matter what I asked, he was noncommittal, saying, 'I don't know.'

Teletext, which presents words on a screen without graphics, is already available for home computer owners. Knight-Ridder and other publishers planning entries into videotex are convinced that the addition of full-color graphics will make videotex more attractive to both advertisers and consumers. **********After seven years of development, Viewtron became available to the public last week. The ad campaign that started today to promote the system is being supported equally by Knight-Ridder and A.T.& T. **********Knight-Ridder hopes to sign up 5,000 customers during the first year in three south Florida counties, which have a population of three million. The $600 terminal, named Sceptre, is being sold at department stores, A.T.& T. Phone Center stores and video and computer retailers. **********In addition to the terminal, customers pay $12 a month to Viewdata for the Viewtron service and $1 an hour to Southern Bell, the local telephone company, for access to the system. **********Uncertainty Over Prospects **********Industry analysts are uncertain of the prospects for Viewtron, which is competing with teletext systems available to home computer owners. Home computers cost less and are more versatile than the Sceptre, according to some analysts. **********''A knowledgeable buyer would not buy a Sceptre terminal because it's expensive and will soon be obsolete,'' said Mark R. Kriss, an analyst with the Yankee Group in Boston. ''If Sceptre were selling for $79.95, I would have a very different overall assessment of Viewtron.'' **********''I don't think the Sceptre terminal has a very long life,'' added David Simons, a consultant with Digital Video Corporation of New York. ''By 1987, virtually every home computer on the market will have videotex capabilities.'' **********But Albert J. Gillen, president of Viewdata, said market tests in 1980 and 1981 showed that customers would be willing to pay $600 for a Viewtron terminal. Also, he noted, Viewtron provided the equivalent of $1,400 to $1,800 a month in programming for just $12. **********Turnover Rate and Daily Use **********The measure of Viewtron's success, industry watchers say, will be the subscriber turnover rate and the amount of daily use once the initial ''novelty effect'' wears off. **********Viewdata executives and industry analysts agree, however, that Videotex will undergo many changes in the next few years. **********''Viewtron is a beautiful baby, but by the time it grows up the industry will look very different,'' said Gary Arlen, publisher of International Videotex Teletext News in Bethesda, Md. Knight-Ridder has tentative agreements with newspaper publishers in 17 other cities to expand Viewtron if the south Florida system draws sufficient consumer interest. **********Keycom, a videotex system developed by Field Enterprises Inc., publisher of The Chicago Sun Times, the Centel Corporation and the Honeywell Corporation, is scheduled to start on April 15 in the Chicago area. **********The Times-Mirror Corporation, publisher of The Los Angeles Times, and Infomart of Toronto are planning a Videotex system named Gateway in Orange County, Calif., in mid-1984."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/16/jobs/the-regional-outlook-on-employment.html": {"writer_name": "Susan Saiter", "pub_date": "1983-10-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 3602, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Job Market", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE REGIONAL OUTLOOK ON EMPLOYMENT", "print_headline": "THE REGIONAL OUTLOOK ON EMPLOYMENT", "body_text": " **********HIGH TECHNOLOGY and military spending are providing new jobs in the New England states, but some other industries have yet to experience a recovery, according to economic experts. **********''There are definite signs of strength, but the boom times are not here just yet,'' said Dennis M. McSweeney, assistant regional commissioner at the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics in Boston. The July unemployment rate for all of New England was 6.8 percent, according to the bureau's figures, 2.6 percent below the national figure. **********Nashua, N.H., and Burlington, Vt. - both centers for high-technology companies - have experienced strong job growth over the last several months. Massachusetts, with its strong high-technology and service industries, has the lowest unemployment rate of the 10 largest industrial states - about 5.6 percent. **********Job prospects in Massachusetts are good for accountants, auditors, high-technology consultants, nurses and doctors; such services are growing the fastest of any sector, according to Mr. McSweeney.  According to the Massachusetts Division of Employment Security, the outlook through 1990 is also very good for electrical engineers, systems analysts and computer programmers. **********Massachusetts still has pockets of high unemployment, however. Fall River, an old textile mill town, and Pittsfield, a machine-manufacturing center, still have double-digit jobless rates. **********Employment in the machinery and fabricated-metals industries remains low, affecting skilled blue-collar workers in western Massachusetts as well as much of Connecticut, New Hampshire and Vermont. Lynn E. Browne, vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said such durable-goods manufacturing was ''associated with investment spending and so typically lags in a recovery.'' **********Mrs. Browne said New England's recovery was lagging partly because the recession was not very severe here to begin with, and partly because the region is active in exports, which have been low. **********Many companies with military contracts, however, are doing well. General Dynamics is expanding its Quincy, Mass., shipyard and hiring some experienced workers in Rhode Island and Connecticut, according to a company spokesman. Bath Ironworks in Maine, a Navy contractor, laid off 700 workers in the last few months, a company spokesman said. But he added that its new repair facility in Portland would open next month and by 1986 hire 1,000 people, from systems analysts to shipfitters. **********Construction is also beginning to pick up elsewhere in Maine, which should benefit not only carpenters and painters but also workers in the state's lumber industry, according to Carl E. Veazie, a research economist at the University of Southern Maine. He said the wood and paper industry, which employs highly skilled machine operators, lost some 500 jobs in the year ending in July.  Janelle Conaway **********THIS region is one of the more diverse economic sections of the country, ranging from the bustling high-technology Baltimore- Washington corridor with its concentration of aerospace-research centers dubbed ''Satellite Alley'' to the hard-hit northwestern section of Pennsylvania, where communities are still waiting for the steel industry to bounce back.  Maryland and Virginia, with a heavy dependence on Federal contracts that tend to make them recession-proof, are both doing well with the Reagan Administration's emphasis on a military build-up. But officials in most states are preoccupied with taking advantage of the growth in high technology to decrease unemployment. **********In Virginia, for example, Gov. Charles S. Robb is devising plans for a center for innovative technology in the northern part of his state. And in Pennsylvania, Gov. Richard L. Thornburgh has announced a $38 million Ben Franklin Partnership plan, where the state's top universities help small businesses with new technology. **********But high technology is not without its critics. Norman Robertson, chief economist at Pittsburgh's Mellon Bank, said he did not believe that high technology offered ''the sort of employmant panacea that many people seem to believe.'' **********''The high-technology industries really do not generate that many employment opportunities, and, what's more, the pay scales of those jobs are often very much below the manufacturing ones that they may have displaced.'' he said. **********Brooks Robinson, president of the Regional Industrial Development Corporation in Pittsburgh, said that the northwestern part of Pennsylvania was still doing poorly, but that some small businesses - those taking advantage of high technology - were thriving. **********Some of the states have also tried encouraging businesses to relocate to their more depressed sections, often by restructuring their tax codes to offer businesses financial attractions, as Governor Thornburgh is trying to do. ''In a time of recession, it doesn't make sense to increase business taxes,'' said Walter Plosila, a deputy secretary in Pennsylvania's Department of Commerce. Evan Schuman **********RECOVERY in the Middle West is not quite keeping up with the pace in the rest of the nation.  Service and high-technology industries are gradually filling the employment gap left by heavy-industry shutdowns or slowdowns. But openings for new jobs in general are expected to be below the national average, according to the Manpower Inc. Employment Outlook Survey. **********But the publication also states that ''hiring intentions in the Midwest are far ahead of past fourth quarter figures,''and ''are much better than those of one year ago.'' **********The strongest surge is expected to be in wholesaling and retailing, with a third of the businesses in those categories expected to hire more employees, said Manpower Inc. **********The region is busy with job-retraining programs for many of the 2.6 million unemployed workers - nearly a fourth of the nation's total - in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin. **********Service jobs that some companies considered ''frills'' during hard times are making a comeback, according to Ellen Kirk, president of the Plaza Inc. employment agency, which specializes in advertising, marketing and public relations. ''Now, they're saying, 'We need to catch up,' '' she said, ''and specialists in this area are being courted in 60 different directions.'' **********Michigan, with 13 percent unemployment, has a lion's share of the region's long-term unemployed. About a quarter of its 300,000 jobless having been out of work for more than six months. **********Von Logan, director of the Bureau of Research and Statistics for the Michigan Employment Security Commission, said those going into or switching to the expanding high-technology and service industries will be more likely to find jobs if they go beyond basic training. Among the growing employment categories are equipment-repair services, secretarial, especially for those with word-processing skills; engineering and health But, he cautioned,''I don't want to leave the impression that anyone who is trained in those areas is going to just walk into a job.'' **********In Indiana, Theodore Popoff, of the Indiana Occupational Information Coordinating Committee, is somewhat more optimistic. ''Employment is picking up,'' he said. Communications, including computer information, is a a growing field, he said, and agribusiness needs more workers in nurseries, gardening, farm-equipment sales and repair. **********Mr. Popoff said that while manufacturing jobs were not increasing, robotization had not made the dent in the work force that was expected. ''We're finding that we still need people who know how to watch the robots,'' he said. Also, he noted, smaller firms find that if they robotize one section of a plant, it can create a jam up in other areas, ''because the robots work faster.'' **********In Minnesota, a 40 percent growth by 1985 is expected in the need for for architects, health aides, office machine and radio and television repairers, buyers and shippers of farm products, retail buyers, bankers, legal and medical secretaries, dental hygienists and child-care workers, among other fields. **********Things are ''picking up a little'' in Wisconsin, said Tom Rondou of the state's Department of Industry, Labor and Human Relations. The best prospects are in the service industries and retail sales, and the state's heavy-machinery and paper-manufacturing industries are showing a small increase. Susan Saiter **********WITH some exceptions, job prospects in the Southwest will remain dim for as long as the slump in the oil industry continues. And most economic observers are cautious about how long that will be. ''There will be some improvement, but anyone who's expecting a remarkable turnaround is kidding himself,'' said Robert Fumston, director of the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission. **********The decline in the once fast-growing and highly attractive regional job market could not have been more striking. Last year, for example, the number of jobs in Texas fell by 110,500, after having increased at an average annual rate of close to 200,000 the previous four years. In July, the unemployment picture was glum throughout the region with a 12.4 percent jobless rate in Louisiana the worst. **********The biggest losses continue to come in the energy-related fields. Everyone from petroleum engineers to finance managers who do business with oil companies to geologists has been hit hard. **********Droughts have dealt heavy blows to once promising farming job opportunities in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisana and Arkansas. And along the Mexico-United States border, the devaluation of the peso has all but devastated border towns like Laredo, Tex., where unemployment stood at 26.2 percent last July, the highest in the nation. **********But the Southwest has not lost its luster entirely, particularly in areas with economies not tied to the energy industry. In Arkansas, for example, manufactoring jobs are up for the first time in two years. Arizona is making a comeback in construction and tourism and is also experiencing a boom of sorts in high technology. **********A similar boom is being felt along the so- called ''Silicon Gulch'' corridor running from Dallas to San Antonio, where electronics engineers, computer technologists and skilled assembly-line workers are in demand.  Even many of the more economically troubled sections of the Southwest are beginning to benefit from an array of personal-service jobs spurred by the region's spiraling population. **********Opportunities in health care, accounting, wholesale and retail sales and real estate are emerging in some cities that are otherwise suffering. Nurses and health-care specialists are in sharp demand in the major medical centers in Houston and New Orleans. **********Still, the predominant economic force in the region is energy, an industry battered by softening oil pices and by the national recession. Few economists are holding out much hope for a speedy recovery and point to such companies as Hughes Tool Inc. of Houston, an oilfield-equipment producer that has been forced to lay off 7,000 employees the last 14 months. Jonathan Dahl **********ECONOMISTS in this region agree that the Southeastern seabord states were less affected by the national recession and will recover more quickly. Unemployment rates in these states fell below the 9.3 percent national level. However, while the three inland states of Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee showed some improvement, they remained in the double- digit range. **********Economists disagree on how long the current rally will last. Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting project at the Atlanta-based Georgia State University, sees it waning rapidly. On the other hand, Lewis R. Jones, associate economist for The Trust Company of Georgia, predicts it will run a good year and a half. **********The total job force in the Southeast is about 14.5 million up a little less than a 1/4 million over last year (and a good 3 million shy of a 1978 Labor Department report that asserted that come 1985 some 17.5 million people would be employed in the region). ''Nobody predicted the severity of the recession, '' says Donald M. Cruse, Atlanta- based regional commissioner of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. **********On the positive side, the national surge in housing construction has brought record employment in the carpeting business centered on Dalton in northern Georgia (up 10 percent in July from a December level of 27,500 workers). It augurs well for the lumber and wood-products industry mainly in Florida (up 8.5 percent this August over last August's figure of 13,000). The furniture industry in Tennessee and the Carolinas also made substantial gains (up 5.8 percent over the August l982 work force of 150,700). **********However, textiles, especially important in North Carolina, have not snapped back as much as expected (up only 2 percent this past July from December's 219,000 workers). The reason is a decline in exports traceable to the strength of the dollar. **********Even in the most troubled areas, with 75 percent of the population covered either by government or private insurance plans, employment in health services is doing well. **********Because of Florida's demographics - a large elderly population that is the most frequent consumer of medical care - that state is again the leader in this field. Out of 900,000 service-sector jobs, 250,000 are in health-related areas. Most of the new workers are low-paid attendants in extended-care facilities such as nursing homes. There is also a big demand for practical nurses. **********Other expanding fields include work for defense contractors and business products such as computers, which are expected to grow by 10 percent in Florida over the next five years. Also, as the economic scene begins to clear, experts once again expect improvement in manufacturing with a slow comeback of industrial machinery in Mississippi and small appliances in Tennessee. Continued growth in the service sector, finance and insurance is also expected. Kerry Gruson **********THE shutdown of huge energy development and mining projects in the Rocky Mountain West has spun the region into the downside of its historic pattern of boom and bust. Some states have been hurt worse than others. **********Wyoming, for instance, has had to ''bite the bullet,'' according to Charles Skinner, a statistical analyst for the Employment Security Commission in Casper. **********''Wyoming depends heavily on oil, gas, coal and uranium,'' said Mr. Skinner. ''Now, because of surpluses and because the public has been screaming against nuclear energy, the other states aren't calling for us. We lag behind the rest of the country by 6 to 18 months. He noted that Wyoming's unemployment rate, the lowest in the nation until 1981, is now between 10 and 11 percent. **********In Colorado, where Exxon canceled the largest shale-oil development in the country, energy unemployment runs high. ''There is a redundancy of geologists and engineers,'' said Kenneth McNulty, an economist with the Division of Employment Training. Yet Colorado, with a projected economic growth rate of 3 percent in the next year, fares better than its neighbors because its economy is more diversified. **********Mr. McNulty said the state would experience vigorous growth in the health-services and business-services sectors. Computer and information-systems companies will remain strong, he said. The mining industry is expected to remain depressed for at least another 12 months, Mr. McNulty said, although he predicted a growth rate of nearly 2 percent. ''Juxtaposed against recent past growth rates of 10 to 15 percent, that's not very good,'' Mr. McNulty said. **********Utah is ''coming slowly out of the recession,'' according to Ronald Ahlstrom, supervising economist of the occupational division of the state's Labor Market Information office. Unemployment is down from a high last October of 9 percent to 7.2 percent as of August, and an unemployment rate of about 7.8 percent is anticipated in the coming year. ''All areas are recovering except for the mining of primary metals such as copper,'' Mr. Ahlstrom said. **********In Idaho, James Day, research director of the state's Department of Employment, said that ''we have been hit by the worst depression since the 1930's,'' The lack of demand for the state's lumber because of rising interest rates and declining construction pushed the unemployment figures in some areas to about 50 percent, Mr. Day said. Idaho's best growth has been in the computer field, and the Boise-based Hewlett-Packard operation has expanded its work force every year. Dyan Zaslowsky **********AFTER months of battering by a recession that bruised even the traditionally stable industries, the job market in the Western states is showing new signs of life. Modest turnarounds in key manufacturing and gaming industries in California and Nevada have buoyed the related service and business fields that employ the bulk of the region's workers. **********Employment prospects in California look best for those with skills in high-technology, electronics and health-care fields. With its seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 9.8 percent in August, down from the previous August's 10.3 percent, the state has few areas that have shown absolute gains. **********But in recent months, the slides in manufacturing and construction have leveled off, and wholesale and retail trade have nearly returned to their record highs of 1981. Aerospace and technology industries, helped by government contracts and resurging markets, expect to leave last year's slump behind. **********National Semiconductor, a ''Silicon Valley'' giant that lost 1,000 total jobs last year, has hired back most of those laid off in the area and currently has about 650 job openings. It also has announced plans for a new $75 million research center. ''Things look very, very high now,'' said Susan Peterson, employment manager. **********Northrop Corporation, an aircraft, electronics and aerospace firm, has opened its new $52 million expansion in its electronics division, and has broken ground for an electro-mechanical laboratory in Orange County. **********''We've experienced growth in all three sectors,'' said Maria Oharenko, a company spokesman. ''There are openings throughout the company, mostly for engineers and skilled assemblers.'' **********Nevada's unemployment rate, after peaking in January at 11.9 percent, has dropped to 9.3 percent, and analysts expect the downward trend to continue. ''We found for the first time that the recession did affect the gaming industry, but it was the last area of the state to go,'' said Jim Avance, chairman of the state's Gaming Control Board. **********''Tourism has picked up dramatically, as shown by sales-tax revenues and tourist indicators,'' said Robert Murdock, a state labor analyst. Gaming and its related services such as hotels, restaurants and recreation employ 45 percent of all workers statewide. ''Construction permits have skyrocketed, and even though that doesn't translate into dollars spent, it's a good sign.'' **********Mr. Murdock said the job slump had caused the state to reassess its marketing, and many businesses are competing for the renewed flow of tourist dollars. Several hotels and casinos, including the Hilton, the Mint, the Sahara Tahoe and the Union Plaza, are remodeling or expanding. **********''We think the recession has bottomed out, and that things should go up slowly from here,'' Mr. Murdock said. **********Pauline Yoshihashi **********THE Northwest is slowly pulling out of its economic slump, but creation of new jobs is not expected in the near future. A year ago the region's unemployment was one of the highest in the nation, and its major industries - aerospace, forest products, construction and agriculture - wallowed in a severe downturn. Those industries, however, are starting to show modest rebounds with the upturn in the nation's economy. **********In July 1982 unemployment in the state of Washington was the sixth highest in the nation as a result of the recession. This summer the state recovered a bit, moving up to 13th in percentage of unemployed. **********But employment consultants advise that because of the 10.5 percent jobless rate, industries that are taking on personnel in months to come most likely will be rehiring those laid off earlier. Creation of new jobs is not expected until well into 1984. ''Job availability is improving,'' said Ron Wahlers, an economist with the Washington State Employment Security Office. ''We are in a lot better shape now than last year at this time,'' **********The slight upturn in housing nationally should help accelerate the moderate pickup that the Northwest's forest-products industries are experiencing. The growth depends on low interest rates nationally, and job growth in this industry could ebb if interest rates rise in the months ahead. **********Electronics, a new industry for the Northwest, is also experiencing a moderate upturn. But creation of new technical jobs is not yet in sight. Most electronics jobs today are at the entry level, and companies prefer to train people for the available jobs - mostly assembly-line work. **********Moderate improvement also is expected in the construction industry, but labor analysts are unenthusiastic about the immediate outlook for jobs. Local hires are expected first, and out-of-state workers are not expected to be drawn to the region for another year, when work picks up on highway construction. **********Demand for experienced nuclear-plant craftsmen and technical workers could develop in 1984 if construction resumes on one nuclear reactor of the Washington Public Power Supply system, on which construction has been slowed. Short-term layoffs will continue on the state's financially beleaguered nuclear-plant construction program. The only jobs being created are for lawyers: virtually every major law firm in the Northwest is enmeshed in a myriad of lawsuits surrounding the Supply System in the wake of its default on $2.25 billion in bonds floated to construct two nuclear plants. **********Health services still remain strong, with a demand for nurses and clerical support staff. Industries such as aluminum also are showing upturns. Retail and service sectors are showing steady improvement as the region slowly pulls out of the recession. **********Mr. Wahlers said, ''Aerospace seems to be our only big problem right now.'' Layoffs have nearly bottomed out at the Boeing Company in Seattle, where 8,800 people have been furloughed so far this year, and an increase in airplane orders is expected only to stabilize the existing aerospace work force rather than create new jobs.

The bank, supported by contributions from both Western and Asian countries, provides development assistance in Asia. **********Washington has decided that as part of its normalization accord with Peking in 1979, it must support Peking's application to represent the Chinese people in the bank. But it has informed the bank's board of directors that it regards Taiwan as a major economic force in Asia and that this should be recognized. **********Moreover, in 1980 Congress passed a joint resolution requiring a review of American participation and financing for the Asian bank if Taiwan were expelled. 'Serious Implications' **********''How this issue will be resolved is not clear,'' a State Department official said today. ''However, we have made it clear that the expulsion of Taiwan would have serious implications for continued United States participation and funding for the Asian Development Bank,'' he added. **********The comments represented the first expression of American policy on the matter since the Chinese made their request known through bank channels several months ago. **********The United States has contributed $1.4 billion since the bank's founding in 1966, of which $274 million was actually paid to the bank. The rest was so-called callable capital, which does not leave the United States Treasury but serves as collateral for private loans. **********In addition, the United States has paid $774 million in cash to the Asian Development Fund, which provides so-called soft loans to developing nations at a 1 percent interest rate. The bank itself provides so-called hard loans at 11 percent. **********The American contributions to both the Asian Development Bank and the Asian Development Fund amount to 16.3 percent of the capital. U.S. Argument **********China has succeeded in expelling Taiwan from both the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. **********But Administration officials said there was a difference in trying to remove Taiwan from the Asian Development Bank. They said that Taiwan, or the Republic of China, as it officially calls itself, was a member of the I.M.F. and World Bank when they were founded at the end of World War II, and the Nationalists were the legal Government of all China. **********Thus, they said, an argument could be made, as it was in the United Nations when Peking replaced Taiwan in 1971, that the Peking Government should replace Taiwan since it represented the bulk of the Chinese population. **********But the Administration officials said that the Nationalist Government had helped to found the Asian bank in 1966, when it controlled only Taiwan and some other islands, and was clearly not in control of the mainland. Thus, they said, Peking cannot claim that Taiwan is posing as the representative of all the Chinese people. **********Nevertheless, Peking seems eager to replace Taiwan in all international organizations. And a State Department official said, ''The United States recognizes the People's Republic of China as the sole, legal government of China and as the representative of China in international organizations.'' **********''According to the bank, the P.R.C. meets the criteria for membership in the bank,'' it said.

The move adds 100 stocks to the 84 already trading in the advanced system. **********The N.A.S.D. regulates the over-the-counter market in unlisted securities and, through its Nasdaq subsidiary, operates an electronic communications network for 3,700 stocks. **********But the national market system, called NMS, is the more revolutionary sector. Far more than a communications network, it provides trade reports within 90 seconds of a transaction as well as current volume. Until the system went into operation last April, this type of data was available only for securities traded on stock exchanges. **********Quotations for the 3,500 other Nasdaq stocks are disseminated through dealers acting as market makers.  Starting yesterday, The New York Times began carrying the daily volume, trading range, last price and net change from the previous trading day for stocks on the enlarged list. **********Newcomers to NMS include such diverse companies as Genentech, Goulds Pumps, Bob Evans Farms, Rival Manufacturing, Longview Fibre, Micom Systems, Equity Oil, Olympia Brewing and Kinder-Care Learning Centers. **********Already on board were, among others, Intel, Pabst Brewing, Tampax, Apple Computer and MCI Communications (the undisputed volume champion of over-the-counter issues). **********Stocks are selected for the list if they maintain certain levels of trading volume at prices above $5 a share at year-end.  ''The powerful appeal of NMS is that it gives companies and investors the best of both worlds,'' said Gordon S. Macklin, president of the N.A.S.D., when he announced the expanded roster.  ''It provides the continuous transaction data of the exchanges and the vigorous competition among multiple market makers that is the unique strength of Nasdaq.'' **********But, as often happens, responses toward any structural change - to use a phrase favored by Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan when he headed Merrill Lynch -''depend upon whose ox is gored.'' **********In this case, many over-the-counter dealers who negotiate the transactions are decidedly unhappy about the Nasdaq national market system. **********''They'd better come up with a better system,'' said one irate trader for a large member firm of the New York Stock Exchange. ''This one hurts the traders and it confuses the public. ''The last-sale price in the NMS often does not truly reflect the inside market of bid-and-asked prices.'' **********Another complaint is that pension funds and other institutional investors sometimes use the last-sale data as negotiating leverage when they want to transact business. ''Such tactics,'' an N.A.S.D.  official acknowledged, ''do not improve the profitability of traders.'' **********At another large brokerage firm, the head of the over-the-counter trading desk complained that the national market system had led to much narrower spreads between bid and asked prices for some stocks - a development that impairs dealer' profits but often means better prices for investors. **********''We trade a lot of MCI Communications with a spread of one-eighth of a point, and it's basically become a loss leader for us,'' he said. ''When you get an over-the-counter stock that has to be researched and then promoted, you want, say, a half-point spread as an incentive to do business.'' **********The system, furthermore, requires the constant entry of trade reports, which consumes employee time but does nothing to enhance profits for a brokerage house. **********The litany of complaints at trading desks in Wall Street and elsewhere even extends to the equipment. ''There's an awful lot of down time on the terminals,'' one trader said. **********Some institutional investors, however, offer praise for NMS.  ''It's much easier to get a feel for the trend of a stock through the volume and last-sale reports,'' a trader for a bank trust department said. ''However, maybe 5 or 10 percent of the time the reported last sale is not reflective of the true market in a stock.  I'd have to say that last-sale prices on the New York Stock Exchange are more within the framework of the actual market.'' **********Despite the complaints, the Nasdaq national market system is here to stay, and it seems destined to expand. Meanwhile, it is the expressed long-range aim of Congress for listed and unlisted securities meeting certain criteria to be traded competitively by both exchange specialists and off-board market makers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/09/business/trinity-resources-ltd-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-03-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 71, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TRINITY RESOURCES LTD reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "TRINITY RESOURCES LTD reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/05/world/around-the-world-turkey-tightens-curbs-on-political-foes.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-06-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 120, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Around the World; Turkey Tightens Curbs On Political Foes", "print_headline": "Around the World; Turkey Tightens Curbs On Political Foes", "body_text": " **********Turkey's ruling generals today gave local martial law commanders the power to expel from their areas people they regard as a threat to national security or public order. **********The new law appeared intended to stop political activity by suspected extremists or banned politicians before a general election scheduled for Nov. 6. **********It allows local commanders to confine people to their home districts or to other restricted areas.

Andropov, the Soviet leader: **********The Androvpov interview contains several elements. It contains certain proposals regarding I.N.F. negotiations about which we will seek additional information and clarification when they are presented in Geneva. **********The public presentation of these proposals before they were presented in the negotiations in Geneva shows that the Soviet intention is to split the allies and their public. **********In other respects, the interview appears to have little new and continues to misrepresent the facts and to attach unacceptable conditions for any agreement. **********Regarding the specifics in the Andropov statement: **********The offer for a freeze on Soviet SS- 20 levels in the Asian U.S.S.R. seems to entail Soviet acceptance of our longstanding views that L.R. I.N.F. missiles must be treated on a global basis. **********The proposal regarding aircraft is too vague to evaluate at this point. As the President said in September, we are prepared to explore possible limitations on I.N.F. aircraft and to hear Soviet views on how such limitations could be formulated within the framework of our criteria for an agreement. Thus we hope the Soviets will be prepared to explain the Andropov statement on aircraft. **********However, the Soviet position outlined by Andropov contains a number of critical shortcomings: **********It involves no change whatsoever from the Soviet position that there should be no U.S. deployments and that the Soviets must be compensated for British and French forces. **********The Soviet offer to reduce to about 140 missiles in Europe suggests Soviet recognition that a balance does not now exist, and should be established through Soviet reductions. The Soviet Union still seeks however, a monopoly on I.N.F. missiles which would leave it with some 750 warheads on launchers while the U.S. had none. **********It seeks to legitimatize the buildup of SS-20's in the Far East. There is no justification whatever for the Soviet SS-20 buildup in Asia. The offer of a freeze additionally contains a number of loopholes and ambiguities which make it unclear that Soviet deployments would actually be affected. **********On the offer for unilateral reductions of I.N.F. missiles, if the U.S. and allies accepted a delay in their own deployment schedule, the Soviet offer would apply only to obsolescent SS-4 missiles, which are in any case being removed, not the SS-20's. Given the apparent Soviet concept of a moratorium, the Soviets whould be free to continue deploying SS-20's within range of Europe. **********Finally, the Soviet threat to end the negotiations with the appearance of U.S. missiles in Europe is totally unjustified."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/02/business/kroy-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-july-2.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-08-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 32, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "KROY INC reports earnings for Qtr to July 2", "print_headline": "KROY INC reports earnings for Qtr to July 2", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/28/world/around-the-world-iraq-reports-24-killed-in-shelling-by-iran.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-10-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 105, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Iraq Reports 24 Killed In Shelling by Iran", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Iraq Reports 24 Killed In Shelling by Iran", "body_text": " **********Twenty-four Iraqis were killed and 17 wounded today when Iranian forces shelled two Iraqi border villages in the northern sector of the battlefront, Baghdad radio reported. **********Quoting a military communique, the radio in the Iraqi capital reported the Iranians shelled the villages of Sayed Sadeq and Chandri.

According to many analysts, the Treasury market had rallied too far too fast, leading many traders to sell their holdings and lock in profits. As recently as April 4, the 10 3/8 percent bond was offered as low as 97 1/2 to yield 10.65 percent.

While the drop in prices was an obvious sign that there were more sellers than buyers yesterday, many participants in the Treasury market said that the price changes came on modest volume. Bleak Budget Outlook **********Many traders and salesmen attributed the price declines to the Federal budget impasse between legislators and the President. The already bleak outlook for reducing Federal deficits from the $210 billion expected in the fiscal year 1984 was made even bleaker by reports that the Administration might try to run the Government without agreement on a budget resolution setting spending limits for the fiscal year 1984. **********''Without the resolution, you don't know the big picture because Government spending will be done item by item, appropriation by appropriation,'' said Maury Harris, an economist at Paine Webber Inc. ''It tells me that the Government is not working like it is supposed to.'' **********The budget problems reminded market participants that the current lull in Treasury financing would not last long. After today's auction of $7.75 billion of new two-year Treasury notes, which were offered to yield 9.61 percent late yesterday, Government securities dealers will begin preparing for a major financing in early May. On April 27, they expect the Treasury to announce plans to sell about $6.5 billion of three-year notes, $4.5 billion of 10-year notes and $3.5 billion of 30-year bonds. Volcker Reports Cited **********News reports - later denied - that Paul A. Volcker would not be reappointed as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board were also cited as a reason for lower prices for debt securities. Although many investors are still not fully convinced that the economic recovery can be achieved with price stability, they approve of Mr. Volcker's anti-inflationary monetary policy during the last four years. **********Analysts also had a host of technical reasons why the credit markets weakened. First, they noted that the cost of financing inventories of Treasury securities rose modestly to 8 3/4 percent. **********Also, they said that the failure of the Federal Reserve to buy Treasury notes and bonds for its own account was a disappointment to some who were hoping that the Fed's purchases would reduce their inventories. Although it is still possible that the Fed might buy securities later this week, hopes are fading. Analysts said that the Fed's decision on whether to buy would probably not be a signal of any shifting of monetary policy. **********Instead, they said it depended on how much credit was drained from the banking system by the buildup of the Treasury's balances. The Fed traditionally buys securities about this time of year to supply reserves to the banking system and offset the funds that are drained by tax collections. **********In the tax-exempt market, underwriters at Merrill Lynch have still not announced terms for a $460 million issue of Aa-rated Alabama bonds. Investment bankers said that the underwriters wanted to wait until the bonds could be sold with a maximum yield of about 8 3/8 percent for the 2001 maturity. **********In secondary market activity, prices of long-term tax-exempt bonds fell about half a point."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/28/business/aluminum-s-modest-upturn.html": {"writer_name": "David Sanger", "pub_date": "1983-07-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1197, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ALUMINUM'S MODEST UPTURN", "print_headline": "ALUMINUM'S MODEST UPTURN", "body_text": " **********In the 1850's, when aluminum sold for $545 a pound, Napoleon III used it to serve royalty at state dinners, relegating lesser guests to gold and silver. Later in the century, after two young men hit upon a process for producing the metal in quantity, the price plummeted to 57 cents a pound - a level that made aluminum better suited to soda cans than dinner service. **********While far less dramatic than a century ago, sharp price fluctuations are still the bane of aluminum manufacturers. Now, as the industry enjoys a sharp upturn after its deepest recession in more than three decades, company executives and industry analysts say that maintaining stable, relatively high prices is crucial to sustain the industry's recovery. **********''Everything seems to be headed in the right direction,'' said A.S. Hutchcraft Jr., president of the Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corporation, one of the companies hardest-hit by the downturn in aluminum prices over the past two years. Prices Rebound **********Indeed, prices - which dropped below 43 cents for a pound of ingot, or unfabricated aluminum, last year from more than 90 cents a pound in 1980 - have rebounded strongly in recent months. At 76 cents a pound, some potlines - where raw alumina is converted into aluminum - are again operating at a profit. Worldwide aluminum inventories have declined sharply since January. Most major producers have restarted many of the potlines idled two years ago. **********Alcoa, the industry giant, is now running at 91 percent of capacity, and it started buying aluminum on the spot market in recent weeks to fill its heavy orders. Thomas G. Langton, director of metal services at Chase Econometrics, says, ''The outlook is for continued price increases,'' particularly if demand for new housing, automobiles and consumer durables remains strong. **********More evidence of recovery came last week, when Alcoa reported second-quarter earnings of $34.6 million, up 129 percent from the comparable quarter in 1982. **********The Reynolds Metals Company, the nation's second-largest aluminum manufacturer, lost $69.1 million but $52.7 million was a one-time write-off for discontinued plants. The company said its orders trend suggested a return to profitability in the second half of the year. **********Kaiser, running at about 40 percent of capacity, lost $51.3 million, but that was an improvement over recent quarters, and the company said it should become profitable in the fourth quarter. **********While the results are less than lustrous, they look better when compared with those in other metals industries. Copper orders have remained depressed, for example, and the steel industry, still reeling from record losses last year, has shown few signs of improvement. 'A Tremendous Problem' **********Still, aluminum manufacturers are plagued by doubts, most of which center on the volatility of prices. **********''It has been a tremendous problem, particularly in the past few years,'' said C. Fred Fetterolf, Alcoa's president. ''Aluminum has acted more and more like a commodity.'' He attributes the recent increase in price instability largely to the fact that there are now more government-owned aluminum smelters around the world. At such facilities, ''it is definitely in the interest of the owners to run the potlines even when the price falls off,'' he said. **********Without the profit motive to regulate worldwide supply and demand, Mr. Fetterolf and other executives say, aluminum inventories have soared even when orders have stopped. As a result, price instability grew more extreme. **********Analysts agree that government ownership has caused problems, both for the aluminum industry and the copper industry. But some also blame the manufacturers for their apparent inability to predict demand and adjust their production accordingly. **********Only four years ago, demand was so strong that Alcoa stopped accepting orders for ingots from new customers. When aluminum fetched 90 cents a pound in early 1980, a modern high, manufacturers kept all potlines running full time, and continued the pace even after mounting evidence of a coming recession. In 1981, they misjudged the brief recovery, and kept producing at high levels well into the second, and more severe, phase of the recession. **********''There is no question that they set themselves up for a fall,'' said George Cleaver, a vice president of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith. Concerns About Recovery **********Should the current recovery last only 12 or 18 months, like the one that followed the 1980 recession, Mr. Cleaver and other experts say the industry's most recent crisis could be repeated. ''If this is a short cycle, it's going to be trouble,'' Mr. Cleaver said. ''But if it is a long cycle, by the top of it the aluminum companies should be making a pile of money.'' **********Industry officials deny they are repeating past mistakes. ''I don't think the industry is bringing capacity on too rapidly,'' said Mr.  Hutchcraft of Kaiser. ''I think everybody believes that the price increases we are seeing are real and lasting.'' **********Still, companies are seeking to protect themselves from price instability. Kaiser has been expanding its activities in chemicals, oil and gas. Alcoa is placing greater emphasis on its fabricating operations. The company plans to step up manufacturing of containers and packaging. **********But there are sharp differences over the industry's ability to expand its markets significantly in the next decade, also considered a hedge against price fluctuations. **********Mr. Langton of Chase Econometrics, echoing the view of most analysts, says that ''there is no question that the industry has matured.'' While aluminum manufacturing grew quickly in the 1960's, on the strength of new markets for beverage cans and lightweight parts for autos, ''we do not see any new, large markets in the future,'' he said. Most predictions for annual growth rates in the next 10 years average around 3 percent. Overseas Growth Seen **********In contrast, Mr. Fetterolf and other industry executives say that food storage cans and other new markets may spur significant growth.  And in South America and Japan, he said, ''there are still relatively few aluminum beverage cans. These are areas of great potential.'' **********The other imponderable is the cost of energy, mostly hydroelectric power. Alcan, the Canadian-based producer that sells much of its aluminum in the United States, enjoys hydroelectic rates of about 4 cents per pound of aluminum, less than a quarter of rates in the United States. Thus, its profit margins may be among the best in the industry with the recent upturn in aluminum prices. **********Alcoa, Reynolds and Kaiser have also benefited from lower power costs in the past few months. Caught with an excess of water spilling over its hydroelectric dams, the Bonneville Power Administration offered to sell additional power to aluminum manufacturers at less than half the normal rate if they restarted their potlines. **********As for the industry's outlook, analysts expect aluminum to lead other metals in the recovery. ''There is no doubt that in the next 12 months it looks better for aluminum than for copper, zinc and the others,'' Mr. Cleaver said. ''That is not to say it looks very good.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/03/business/data-architects-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-nov-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-03-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 70, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DATA ARCHITECTS INC reports earnings for Qtr to Nov 30", "print_headline": "DATA ARCHITECTS INC reports earnings for Qtr to Nov 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/03/business/kearney-national-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 71, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "KEARNEY-NATIONAL INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "KEARNEY-NATIONAL INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/26/business/company-reports-bemis-co-n.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-04-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 28, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "** Company Reports ** BEMIS CO (N)", "print_headline": "** Company Reports ** BEMIS CO (N)", "body_text": " **********Qtr to March 31 1983 1982 Sales 170,622,000 168,845,000 Net inc b2,639,000 1,671,000 Share earns .70 .44 b-Including a gain of $851,000 from the sale of a subsidiary."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/20/world/china-s-prey-spiritual-pollution-proves-elusive.html": {"writer_name": "Christopher Wren", "pub_date": "1983-12-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1120, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CHINA'S PREY, 'SPIRITUAL POLLUTION,' PROVES ELUSIVE", "print_headline": "CHINA'S PREY, 'SPIRITUAL POLLUTION,' PROVES ELUSIVE", "body_text": " **********A visitor to a Peking municipal office was recently barred from entering because her hair touched her shoulders. The doorkeeper, in justification, pointed to a posted edict that said women who work in the office must not wear long hair, makeup or jewelry. **********The woman protested that she did not work there, but the doorkeeper let her through only after she had pulled her hair back and fastened it with a rubber band that he provided. When she finished her call, he took back the rubber band. **********A columnist named Zhang Wen, who related the story in The China Daily, said the woman asked him afterward: ''Why is a rubber band so important in judging my ideology? Do you think that black, straight hair hanging loose on my shoulders is poisonous to others' minds?'' **********Mr. Zhang acknowledged that he had no reply, since the newspaper China Youth had just assured its readers that nothing was wrong with fashionable hairdos and bright clothing.   Painful Memories Stirred **********The incident suggested the extent of confusion engendered by a war on ''spiritual pollution.'' Actual casualties have been few, and some diplomats have already concluded that the campaign is a flop. But it has given leftists a pretext for acting against Western influences and has unsettled intellectuals with painful memories of the Cultural Revolution. **********China's paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, started the war on spiritual pollution two months ago, apparently to show that his new economic policies, which have swept China into uncharted terrain, would not undercut the totalitarian primacy enjoyed by the party for the last 34 years. **********Some diplomats say they believe that Mr. Deng devised the campaign to pre- empt the opposition of leftists who will be targets of a new ''rectification'' campaign, or bloodless purge of the party. Other diplomats contend that it shows the real sentiments of the 79- year-old leader.   Leadership Seemingly Unsure **********Definitions of ''spiritual pollution'' have been so muddled as to suggest that the leadership is not sure what it wants, beyond a return to conformity and selective nostalgia for Chinese customs. People's Daily quoted Mr. Deng as telling the party's Central Committee in an otherwise unpublished speech in October that ''spiritual pollution essentially means the spreading of various decadent and declining ideologies of the bourgeoisie and other exploiting classes, and the spreading of sentiments of distrust regarding the cause of socialism and Communism and the leadership of the Communist Party.'' **********A lot of time has since been spent restraining those who took the call to arms too seriously and decided all Western influence was the enemy. The State Science and Technology Commission has declared that Western scientific ideas and technology, which are key to China's modernization strategy, must not be considered ideological contamination. China's President, Li Xiannian assured the visiting Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev. Robert Runcie, that religion and cultural contamination were altogether different. **********In the most sweeping exclusion, the party's senior propagandist, Deng Liqun, announced that the spiritual pollution campaign would not extend to the countryside, leaving China's 800 million peasants free to pursue their mandate to get rich.   Disagreement on What's Left **********The leadership has been unable to agree on what is left to attack, beyond pornography and anti-Communism. Peng Zhen, chairman of China's nominal Parliament, the National People's Congress, said this month that a standing committee was adjourning without enacting guidelines for the spiritual pollution campaign because conditions were not ripe for such an important decision. **********The criticism of the spiritually polluted has not been vindictive. Zhou Yang, an elderly cultural minister, confessed that he had acted too hastily in writing that alienation could exist in China's Marxist society, but he never really recanted his thesis. Some minor literary magazines have been closed, and a few writers have been castigated for unseemly individualism. **********The most excitement was caused by last month's shake-up at People's Daily, in which its director, Hu Jiwei, and the deputy chief editor, Wang Ruoshui, were replaced. No motive was given, but there were rumors that Mr. Hu objected to the spiritual pollution campaign and that Mr. Wang was responsible for reprinting Zhou Yang's offending article on alienation in People's Daily in March. Some diplomats speculated that the party organ had become too independent for the old guard, including Mr. Deng.   Pornography Is Attacked **********The hard-liners have taken the campaign as a license to condemn whatever they do not like. Enough denunciations of pornography have appeared to suggest that China is awash in smut, though some exists in the eye of the beholder. A worker named Zhang Jun complained to the newspaper China Youth that his boss had seized his book of famous paintings and ordered him to make a self-criticism because it included works like Botticelli's ''The Birth of Venus.'' **********The newspaper assured Mr. Zhang that his director ''doesn't study policy very well,'' since Western art was not spiritual pollution. But it also suggested that ''if you buy these paintings just for reference, you had better keep them at home.'' **********''If you show them openly,'' the paper said, ''deviating from the sober themes the paintings express, it would not be proper.'' **********Sillier salvos have been fired in the war on spiritual pollution. A radio announcer was criticized by his trade union boss for playing the ''Blue Danube'' and other waltzes. Some army company commanders have been tearing pictures of attractive young women out of magazines sent to their units so the troops will not become contaminated.   'Weak-Willed Youths' **********Wang Zhaoguo, the head of the Communist Youth League, explained that the campaign was necessary to protect ''weak-willed youths'' who are ''easily affected by bourgeois ideas.'' But it also seems to have contributed to their cynicism. **********A man returning from a southern city said the local movie theater there was jammed every night after it was rumored that the Japanese feature film would be withdrawn because it was spiritually polluting. He and his friends lined up, too, he said, though the film was not very good. The theater subsequently extended the film for another month to meet the increased demand. **********''The spiritual pollution campaign has been a disaster,'' a Western European diplomat said. ''If it was meant to criticize the rightists, it has failed. If it was meant to draw out the leftists and cut them off at the roots, it has failed.'' **********One Chinese said that some work units overdid the campaign and that others ignored it. He said he expected the Government to let it grind on for another month or so and then declare a face-saving victory."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/16/business/company-reports-parker-pen-co-n.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-04-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 29, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "** Company Reports ** PARKER PEN CO (N)", "print_headline": "** Company Reports ** PARKER PEN CO (N)", "body_text": " **********Qtr to Feb 28 1983 1982 Sales 150,752,000 154,968,000 Net loss 9,828,000 b381,000 Share earns .02 Yr sales 635,278,000 679,372,000 Net loss 13,598,000 b15,713,000 Share earns .92 b-Net income."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/06/business/world-airways-loss-narrows.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-08-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 97, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "World Airways Loss Narrows", "print_headline": "World Airways Loss Narrows", "body_text": " **********World Airways said today that its second-quarter loss narrowed to $9.5 million from $15.5 million the year before. **********Operating revenue fell 16 percent, to $62.6 million from $74.2 million, and operating expenses were cut 19 percent, to $63.6 million from $78.5 million.

And because of the rush, many buyers may succumb to the purchase of illegal, dubious or uneconomic shelters this year that they will deeply regret in the future. **********''A good number of the public deals that come out late in the year are lousy,'' said Donald Ercole, a partner of the certified public accounting firm of Arthur Young & Company. ''The shelter industry knows that people who examine shelters do it earlier in the year.'' **********The pressure to buy at this time is especially heightened by deals offering write-offs as large as 8 to 1, which are prominently featured in newspaper ads for such shelters in real estate, oil and gas and equipment leasing. A tax-shelter write-off is a current deduction that persons claim on their tax returns against investments. A 1-to-1 write-off means $1 deducted for every $1 invested, while an 8-to-1 write-off means $8 deducted per $1 invested.  Many financial advisers warn that those looking for shelters should stay away from such high write-offs because they are unrealistic. Some say that even late offers with write-offs as low as 2 to 1 should be spurned because of the inability of most people to investigate the economic aspects of the transaction in this brief year-end period. **********''You should concentrate on the economic or financial aspects of the investments before you even take a look at the tax benefits,'' said William G. Brennan, publisher of Brennan Reports, a tax shelter newsletter. ''Some shelters require investors to assume an awful lot of liability.'' **********This liability is sometimes in the form of a commitment to make further payments after the initial funds are invested, if the tax shelter itself does not generate sufficient cash to do so. ''You may be lulled into thinking that the deal is going to throw off enough cash to pay the debt, but more than likely, it is not going to happen,'' Mr. Brennan added. **********For example, one person who invested $50,000 in an end-of-the-year cattle tax shelter was faced with a bill from the promoter the next year for an additional $80,000. He negotiated a postponement of that liabiity with the hope that the shelter would soon thereafter become economically viable, but such was not to be the case. **********His debt in the following year increased to a whopping $125,000, which he could not afford to pay. As a result, he lost his cattle and his tax shelter - and was still obligated to the promoter for more cash. **********The difficulties of last-minute tax shelter investments have been exacerbated, moreover, by the strict new penalties imposed by the 1982 tax law. Effective for 1983, involvement in an abusive shelter - essentially an artificial transaction with little or no economic reality - is more hazardous than ever. **********If a tax return is examined by the Internal Revenue Service and a tax deficiency is assessed, the taxpayer is responsible not only for the tax due and interest on the underpayment, but also for significant penalties. And when that possibility is combined with the new nationwide program by the I.R.S. to identify and investigate abusive shelters at their marketing stage, this type of investment has undoubtedly become riskier. **********''The anticipated tax benefits of the tax shelter in a particular situation may not always be realized,'' Mr. Ercole said. Referring to investors in the 50 percent tax bracket, he said, ''I would rather pay the Government my 50 cents at the most because at least I'd still have 50 cents in my pocket.'' **********Thus, the year-end urgency to participate in a tax shelter frequently becomes an exercise in futility. Perhaps most people with an interest in a tax shelter would do better to use the remainder of 1983 to plan their investments for 1984. **********Next: Securities trading."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/14/world/china-and-britain-plan-more-talks-on-hong-kong.html": {"writer_name": "Christopher Wren", "pub_date": "1983-07-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 487, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CHINA AND BRITAIN PLAN MORE TALKS ON HONG KONG", "print_headline": "CHINA AND BRITAIN PLAN MORE TALKS ON HONG KONG", "body_text": " **********China and Britain today ended a two-day round of talks on the future of Hong Kong with an announcement that their delegations would meet here again in two weeks. **********Both sides refused to reveal any details of the sensitive negotiations, which are aimed at reaching an eventual consensus on Hong Kong's status after the British lease over most of the colony runs out in 1997. **********The agreement to hold another round of talks was expected and did not necessarily signal progress on what is considered the most difficult issue in Chinese-British relations. But the decision to meet later this month after the two delegations have reviewed the results of the latest session suggested some slight movement beyond the stalemate that originally existed. **********After the talks, which went on for three hours today in a state guest house that was once the Hungarian Embassy, Deputy Foreign Minister Yao Guang, who heads the Chinese delegation, emerged to tell waiting reporters, ''All I can say is that the talks are useful and constructive and we'll resume our talks on July 25 and 26 in Peking.''

'Second Phase' of Talks **********The current talks were described in an earlier joint announcement as a ''second phase'' in the search for a solution that got under way after Mrs. Thatcher paid an official visit to China last September. **********Because of the complexity of the Hong Kong issue, the talks are not expected to produce any substantial agreement in the near future.

Relying largely on official, once-confidential documents and the diaries of politicians and civil servants, the book, ''None Is Too Many,'' published by Lester & Orpen Denys, establishes that from 1933 to 1945 Canada, a huge land then thought of as underpopulated, admitted only a trickle of the millions of Jews who hoped to flee Europe. **********During the same period, the authors, Mr. Troper and Irving Abella, wrote, ''the United States accepted more than 200,000 Jewish refugees; Palestine, 125,000; embattled Britain, 70,000; Argentina, 50,000; penurious Brazil, 27,000; distant China, 25,000; tiny Bolivia and Chile, 14,000 each.'' **********'Holier-Than-Thou Mythology' **********''At the moment,'' Mr. Troper, who teaches history of immigration at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, said in an interview, ''there is a lot of historical revisionism going on, and one of the Canadian myths has been that as a nation we have been more tolerant, less bigoted than the Americans. Now, as we are examining our dealings with native peoples, with the Japanese who we detained and banished during the war, we are puncturing that holier-than-thou mythology. **********''Our book, which is selling beyond the Jewish community, touches on these national attitudes and that probably accounts for its popularity. We certainly didn't expect this kind of response for what is after all an academic effort with 30 pages of footnotes.'' **********The book, now in its fourth printing, has been on both major national best seller lists for three months. It has been serialized in The Globe and Mail, Canada's nationally distributed newspaper. It continues to be discussed on radio talk programs. As a result of the research, the annual report of the Ministry of Immigration deleted a section it had regularly included citing Canada's contribution to the refugee problems caused by World War II. **********Mr. Abella, who teaches labor history at York University, said that there had been many responses to the book. 'Worst Record' of Western Nations **********''After all,'' he said, ''it is quite shocking for people who rightfully pride themselves on having provided refuge to more than 30,000 Hungarians after the suppression of the 1956 uprising and to more than 60,000 Vietnamese, to learn that their Government and their leaders had the worst record of any Western country for providing refuge for European Jewry.'' **********The authors, both 40-year-old Canadian-born Jews, acknowledged that they themselves had been shocked by their findings. Mr. Troper said that though he had been stunned by ''the attitude of the Canadian Government from 1933 to 1939, when Jewish fears were being dismissed as alarmist,'' he had been even more appalled to discover that the objections to Jewish immigration had persisted even when accounts of the death camps became known. **********The book cites scores of individual cases in which even wealthy and influential Canadian Jews failed in attempts to have relatives admitted. Among these was the case of two aunts of the United States Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, who sought Canadian visas to escape from Vienna. Though an appeal was made by United States diplomats to the Canadian authorities, it, like many others, was denied. Applicants Rebuffed **********Applicants who said they would work as farmers or as domestic servants were told by Canadian consulates that they were unacceptable because Jews would always gravitate to urban centers. One high-level civil servant is quoted as having urged that Jewish migration be stemmed ''lest it might foment an anti-Semitic problem.'' **********The authors, however, assert that despite the bigotry and anti-Semitism of key civil servants and Anglophiles, the major blame for the policies lay with top officials - Prime Minister W.L.  Mackenzie King, Vincent Massey, the patrician Ambassador to Britain who was to become Canada's first native-born Governor General, and Lester W. Pearson, then a diplomat who later became Canada's internationalist Prime Minister. **********The book depicts Mr. Mackenzie King as a cunning and cynical politician eager to appease what the authors describe as widespread anti-Semitism in Quebec. He did so, the authors say, by continuing to consult with Jewish organizations, holding out hope and making pious pronouncements but working behind the scenes to block any attempts to bring Jewish refugees to Canada. Massey Depicted as Anti-Semite **********Mr. Massey is depicted as a snobbish anti-Semite who once urged Canada to offer sanctuary to the ''Aryan Sudeten Germans'' after Hitler's annexation of the Czech region because ''it would put us in a much stronger position in relation to later appeals from and on behalf of non-Aryans.'' **********As for Mr. Pearson, his role appeared limited to blocking discussions with allied nations on the question of Jewish immigration. Mr. Troper said in his interview that he felt that Mr.  Pearson, at this stage, appeared to be an ambitious civil servant who avoided counseling politicians with anything they did not want to hear."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/22/business/seven-sue-exxon-unit-on-sex-discrimination.html": {"writer_name": "Tamar Lewin", "pub_date": "1983-10-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 605, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SEVEN SUE EXXON UNIT ON SEX DISCRIMINATION", "print_headline": "SEVEN SUE EXXON UNIT ON SEX DISCRIMINATION", "body_text": " **********Seven women, present and former employees of Exxon Office Systems, have filed a class action lawsuit against the company, charging a pattern of sex discrimination in pay and promotions. **********Lawyers for the women say the suit could affect thousands of past, present and future employees of the company or its three predecessor companies, Qwip Systems, Qyx and Vydec, which merged in January 1981, to form Exxon Office Systems. **********According to the complaint, filed earlier this month in Federal District Court in Hartford, Exxon Office Systems gave its male employees better promotions, better pay and better sales territories than its female employees. **********The complaint asks for back pay, punitive damages and the development of an affirmative action program. **********''We won't discuss matters in litigation, but obviously we think the allegations are without merit,'' said a spokesman for Exxon Enterprises.  Exxon Office Systems is a division of Exxon Enterprises, which is a division of the Exxon Corporation. **********James Morakis, head of media relations for Exxon, said he was not aware of any other large sex discrimination suits against Exxon, either past or present. **********Sexual Harassment Charged According to the complaint, one of the women named, Gioia Ambrette, was told there were no managerial openings available at a time when six such positions opened and were given to men with inferior sales records, usually through what the complaint calls ''a male-oriented company grapevine.'' In addition, the complaint says, Miss Ambrette was sexually harassed by a male marketing manager and a branch office manager. **********''What's going on at that company is a crime,'' said Kathleen Douel, another woman named in the complaint under her former name, Kathleen Davis. ''Many women who have left are still so scarred and hurt about what happened to them that they are afraid to come forward and talk about their experiences. Over the last two years, I've talked to a good 50 or 75 women with their own stories of sex discrimination at Exxon, and if I've talked to that many, I'm sure there are double or triple the number who don't know this case has been filed, and haven't had a chance to tell their own stories yet.'' **********''When I was first interviewing for a job as a sales representative, it took seven interviews for me to get serious consideration, because I was a divorced female,'' said Mrs. Douel, who has left Exxon to set up her own business. ''What the interviewers wanted to talk about was what would happen if my ex-husband called and wanted to come back - wouldn't I leave the job?'' **********According to the complaint, Mrs. Douel acted as branch manager of the company's Baltimore Qwip office from December 1979 until October 1980, without getting the pay and benefits of the male branch managers at other branches. And even after October 1980, when she was officially given the title of branch manager, the complaint says, Mrs. Douel was still not paid as much as the male branch managers. Then, at the time of the merger, the complaint says, Mrs. Douel applied to be the manager of the merged office, but the job went to a less-qualified man. **********''When the three companies merged, Exxon looked around to see who should staff the new management jobs, and they turned overwhelmingly to males,'' said Herbert Teitelbaum, one of the lawyers representing the women. ''I have never seen so many competent women so angry at the treatment they received at the hands of their employer. If the court agrees with only part of what these women are alleging, the recovery will be very substantial.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/11/business/key-rates-158041.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-05-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 122, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/14/world/cambodians-tell-of-horror.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-04-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 268, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CAMBODIANS TELL OF HORROR", "print_headline": "CAMBODIANS TELL OF HORROR", "body_text": " **********It is still impossible to say how many civilians died this month at O Smach, a Cambodian refugee and guerrilla camp that was shelled and overrun by Vietnamese troops.

Major retailers and the oil companies, which account for about one-third of corporate profits, have not begun to report, for example. But earnings reports released thus far have led economists and other analysts to project that after-tax profits in the first quarter are likely to register the first year-to-year increase since the second quarter of 1981. **********''The economy is better, and final sales are picking up slightly,'' said Donald Ratajczak, director of economic forecasting at Georgia State University. ''Production schedules are still below desired levels, but are higher than they were. And a lot of fat has been taken out of management and distribution systems.'' Annualized $129 Billion **********As a result, Mr. Ratajczak estimates that after-tax corporate profits were an annualized $129 billion in the first quarter, up 9 percent from the fourth quarter and 12 percent from a year earlier. **********M. Kathyrn Eickoff, executive vice president at Townsend-Greenspan & Company, an economic consulting firm, said that many companies benefited from an improved foreign exhange position. **********''Some people really got hurt by their exposures in countries like Mexico during the second half of last year,'' she said. ''In some cases in the first quarter foreign exchange losses were far less than what had orignially been anticipated.'' **********The profits picture may be brighter, but it is far from uniform. Lingering Effects **********The recession's lingering effects are most easily seen among primary metal and steel producers, where product prices and operating rates are still at low levels and companies are still deep in the red. Chemical manufacturers are making money, but weak domestic and international demand kept earnings well below the levels of a year earlier. And analysts said that the oil companies, whose earnings reports should begin to appear this week, had a particularly dismal quarter. **********Much of the good news on earnings has come from two of the recession's most prominent victims: autos and housing. In those sectors, profits of many companies were up sharply. **********Improvement was not limited to those areas, however, as some high technolgy companies saw earnings rise sharply and major drug companies continued to post healthy gains. Financial service companies continued to ride the wave that began last August, when stock prices began their big climb. Reflecting the Administration's military priorities, some defense-related companies chalked up large earnings gains. **********Following is a breakdown of some important sectors: Autos **********The effects of cost-cutting on profits are perhaps best seen in Detroit, where the General Motors Cororation and the Chrysler Corporation both reported sharp increases in earnings despite only a modest increase in the number of units sold. **********At Chrysler, earnings for the first quarter were the highest on record, $172.1 million, up 14.8 percent from a year before, despite a mere 3.8 percent increase in auto sales. At G.M., auto sales rose just 2.2 percent from the first quarter of 1982, but the company made $653 million in the latest quarter, its largest quarterly profit in more than four years. Analysts expect that this week the Ford Motor Company will report earnings of about $200 million for the period. **********''There is some evidence of recovery here,'' said Maryann N.  Keller, an analyst at Paine Webber Mitchell Hutchins. ''But you cannot dismiss the fact that a meaningful proportion of the earnings at Chrysler and G.M. came from non-auto related sources like interest income and their financing companies.'' Housing **********The sharp increase in housing activity was dramatically reflected in the earnings reports of a number of housing-related companies in the first quarter. **********The U.S. Home Corporation, for example, lost $1.4 million in the first quarter last year, but it reported net income of $8.6 million in the latest quarter. Willamette Industries Inc., a wood and paper products manufacuter that lost $4.6 million in the first quarter of 1982, reported net income of $3.7 million for the latest quarter. And the Boise Cascade Corporation said its net income rose 98.2 percent from the first quarter of last year, to $11.1 million. **********Profits at the Georgia-Pacific Corporation, however, plunged 80.6 percent, to $30 million, and the Weyerhaeuser Company reported that earnings dropped 78%, to $22.5 million. Steel **********Despite increases in production and the number of employed steelworkers, weak product prices are keeping the nation's steel manufacturers in the red. **********To date, four of the eight major companies - Armco Inc., the Inland Steel Company, the National Steel Corporation and the Republic Steel Corporation - have reported a combined loss of $218.6 million for the first quarter. Analysts said that when the other four - the U.S.  Steel Corporation, the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, the Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corporation and Jones & Laughlin Steel Inc., a unit of the LTV Corporation -announce results this week, the size of the industry's loss will almost certainly rise. High Technology **********High technology companies posted mixed results for the first quarter.  At one end of the spectrum were such companies as the International Business Machines Corporation, which posted a 23.7 percent earnings gain from a year before, to $976 million; Apple Computer Inc., up 73.2 percent, to $23.9 million, and Wang Laboratories Inc., up 44.9 percent, to $36.8 million. **********But the Control Data Corporation saw its profits drop 12.5 percent, to $33.5 million. Net income at Honeywell Inc. fell 60 percent, to $22.2 million, and the Burroughs Corporation reported that net income declined 47.2 percent, to $29.8 million. Military Contractors **********The Rockwell International Corporation and the Lockheed Corporation, two major military contractors, reported strong earnings growth in the first quarter from a year earlier. Two others, the Martin Marietta Corporation and the Raytheon Company, saw profits slip. **********Lockheed's advance was the most impressive. Net income rose 37.6 percent, to $51.6 million. At Rockwell, earnings topped $100 million, a 5.8 percent rise from a year earlier. Martin Marietta's earnings dropped 12.7 percent, to $13.8 million, while Raytheon reported net income of $73 million, down 8.1 percent. Consumer-Oriented **********The somewhat sluggish expansion in retail sales in the first quarter was big enough to benefit the bottom line of many manufacturers of consumer durable and nondurable items. **********At the General Electric Corporation, profits were up 12.7 percent from last year's first quarter, to $425 million. The Whirlpool Corporation recorded a 43.6 percent rise in earnings, to $40.5 million. The Tandy Corporation's net income rose 26.4 percent, to $57.4 million. And Rubbermaid Inc., the housewares manufacturer, registered a 23.1 percent increase in net income, to $8 million. Financial Services **********With record-setting volume accompanying the stock market's rally, earnings on Wall Street continued to surge.  Thus far, the E.F. Hutton Group Inc. has claim to the most spectacular individual gain: first quarter earnings for the brokerage house rose more than twelvefold from a year before, to $37.3 million. Paine Webber Inc. recorded a more than sixfold increase, with profits rising to $23.1 million. The American Express Company said net income in the first quarter rose more than 37 percent from a year before, to $162 million."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/16/world/16-killed-at-ugandan-funeral.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-04-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 31, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "16 Killed at Ugandan Funeral", "print_headline": "16 Killed at Ugandan Funeral", "body_text": " **********A Ugandan special forces policeman went berserk and shot and killed 16 people at the funeral of a colleague before committing suicide, the police said today."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/15/world/around-the-world-sudan-reports-discovery-of-arms-cache-for-coup.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-03-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 77, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sudan Reports Discovery Of Arms Cache for Coup", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Sudan Reports Discovery Of Arms Cache for Coup", "body_text": " **********The authorities have seized 70 tons of arms, ammunition and explosives that Libyan agents smuggled into the Sudan last month in an effort to topple President Gaafar al-Nimeiry, the Sudanese press agency reported. **********The report, which was issued Sunday and quoted Sudanese intelligence sources, said the Sudanese Navy had intercepted a ship carrying weapons and explosives and arrested five crew members, including a Libyan agent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/02/business/siliconix-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 69, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SILICONIX INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "SILICONIX INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/02/business/grant-industries-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-june-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-08-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 68, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GRANT INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "print_headline": "GRANT INDUSTRIES INC reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/01/business/empire-of-carolina-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-03-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 53, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EMPIRE OF CAROLINA INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "EMPIRE OF CAROLINA INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/02/business/jacobs-engineering-group-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 36, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "JACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "JACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/28/world/7-dead-in-lisbon-in-armenian-raid.html": {"writer_name": "John Darnton", "pub_date": "1983-07-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1047, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "7 DEAD IN LISBON IN ARMENIAN RAID", "print_headline": "7 DEAD IN LISBON IN ARMENIAN RAID", "body_text": " **********Gunmen identified as Armenians stormed the Turkish Ambassador's residence here today and, after keeping Portuguese policemen at bay with gunfire for an hour and a half, blew it up.

The Ambassador, Ismail Soysal, had completed his tour of duty and returned to Turkey on July 17. **********Witnesses said the gunmen arrived at about 10:30 A.M. in two cars, a red one that remained out front and a white Ford Escort that entered the driveway. The Ford Escort aroused the suspicions of a Portuguese security guard because it had been there the day before. **********On that occasion, according to Turkish Embassy sources, two men emerged from the car. When challenged by the Ambassador's bodyguard, they said they had come for visas. But when asked to produce their passports, they left hurriedly. Turks Asked Extra Protection **********Because of this incident, the Turkish Embassy requested extra police protection from the Portuguese authorities, the sources said.  One additional policeman was stationed on the road outside early today. **********The Turkish bodyguard was alerted by the Portuguese security man when the white car returned today. As he approached it, an exchange of gunfire took place. One gunman died on the spot and a policeman was wounded by submachine-gun fire. **********The gunmen then regrouped to take the nearby residence, where they found their hostages. A force of some 170 riot policemen surrounded the building, cordoning off the area and hiding behind cars and trees to avoid sporadic gunfire from within. One report said the gunmen had threatened over the telephone to blow up the building if the police tried to retake it. **********What happened next is not altogether clear, but at about noon an explosion occurred. It was followed by two or three lesser explosions, witnesses said, and the building went up in flames. Cabinet in Emergency Session **********The Portuguese Cabinet, under the new Prime Minister, Mario Soares, went into an emergency session during the siege and decided to send in an elite police detachment, the Special Operational Group. It was the first time that this British-trained force, which was formed last autumn, had been used. **********The group began an assault on the burning building at 1:40 P.M. and found five bodies on the upper floor. One of them turned out to be a policeman, identified as Manuel Pacheco. **********A spokesman for the Interior Ministry said later that the policeman, who was familiar with the embassy, had rushed to the scene after hearing about the attack over his radio. He climbed into the room where the gunmen had taken refuge, the spokesman said. Whether this might have prompted them to detonate the explosion could not be determined. **********The ministry said later that the two cars were filled with food and explosives, suggesting that the gunmen had laid in preparations for a long siege. **********The last attack on Turkish diplomats in Lisbon occurred in June 1982. Then the commercial attache, Erkut Ackbay, was shot and killed outside his home. His wife was wounded in the attack, for which Armenian terrorists claimed responsibility. **********One embassy official theorized that the terrorists had chosen Lisbon because it was ''an easy target.'' The embassy, built 10 years ago, has seven full-time employees."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/16/business/eurobonds-up-slightly-in-price.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 116, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Eurobonds Up Slightly in Price", "print_headline": "Eurobonds Up Slightly in Price", "body_text": " **********Fixed-interest dollar Eurobonds rose slightly today.

This is in part because Nicaragua continues to receive assistance from the Soviet bloc and a number of Western European countries, including France. **********Nicaragua's fears of a major step-up in activity against it by the Reagan Administration apparently motivated a conciliatory gesture last Tuesday, when the Government announced it was now willing to take part in regional peace talks and no longer insisted on direct talks with Honduras. The gesture, diplomats here said, appeared to be aimed at broadening support in the United States Congress and among Nicaragua's sympathizers in Western Europe and Latin America. **********''We are in more danger now because the 'contras' are being repulsed,'' a senior Nicaraguan official said, referring to the rebels. ''The U.S. will need to choose options that guarantee success.'' **********Several key foreign diplomats said they shared this view. They said the rebel campaign, designed to employ rapid action and based on the assumption that it would gain wide popular support, instead was becoming more like a long but very limited war of attrition. **********These diplomats, who were openly critical of the Sandinista Government, said they believed that the overall strategy of the Reagan Administration in Nicaragua was faltering and that the lack of rebel success was an important part of the process. **********''It was stupid for Washington to think they could mount a successful campaign in one year,'' said one diplomat who said he had no sympathy for the Nicaraguan revolution. ''The Sandinistas will probably not change enough to resolve the situation in the area, but the whole concept of fast diplomatic, financial and rebel pressure could never do the trick. There's no short-term solution here.'' **********President Reagan, in a news conference last Thursday, said it would be ''extremely difficult'' to bring stability to the area if the Sandinistas remained in power. **********In the eyes of the Sandinista leadership, the United States is already at war with Nicaragua through the ''contras.'' In late 1979, the rebels were formed from among the defeated remnants of the National Guard that had served the regime of Anastasio Somoza Debayle before it was overthrown earlier that year.  They have grown into a well-trained and well-equipped fighting force estimated at 7,000 former guardsmen, peasants and Indians. **********With the encouragement of the United States, several small groups founded the Nicaraguan Democratic Front in 1981. The front's political leaders include former supporters of the Somoza regime, lawyers and businessmen who opposed the Sandinistas' leftist policies. The fighting force took serious form in early 1982, after the Reagan Administration approved $19 million for ''covert action'' to support it . **********Since then the rebels, by their own admission often with support from the Honduran Army, have attacked military and civilian targets and destroyed bridges, farms and equipment in a broad area along Nicaragua's northern frontier. **********But the task forces that ventured deeper into Nicaragua on at least four occasions in the past seven months have been stopped by the Sandinista military from achieving their aim of controlling towns or strategic areas, Nicaraugan officials say. **********Foreign diplomats monitoring the war said the Sandinistas at first sent poorly trained militia to fight along the border areas. But since last March, the diplomats say, the response has been on a larger scale, at times involving up to 6,000 of the Government's 22,000 troops. **********The Government has described the rebels in the north as its primary problem, and few troops have been sent to the southern border, where the former Sandinista commander Eden Pastora Gomez operates with a rebel force he has said numbers 2,200 men. **********One senior military official said the rebels in the south posed ''no serious threat'' because during the Sandinista guerrilla war, the nearly impassable swamps and jungles in the south obliged them to move elsewhere."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/11/business/week-in-business.html": {"writer_name": "Nathaniel Nash", "pub_date": "1983-09-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1057, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WEEK IN BUSINESS", "print_headline": "WEEK IN BUSINESS", "body_text": " **********A reported $2 billion drop in the money supply delighted the credit markets late last week; bond prices soared and interest rates plunged almost a third of a percentage point. Most market participants had expected a jump in the money supply of as much as $1 billion. The drop in M-1 - currency in circulation plus all check-like deposits - placed money growth within the Fed's current target range. It seemed to allay fears that the central bank would have to tighten credit and boded well for those looking for lower interest rates. ''This is the best money-supply picture we've had in the last 12 months; everything is on target,'' was the reaction of one market analyst. **********The stock market also put in a positive week, approaching its record highs. Despite fairly quiet trading, the Dow Jones industrial average closed up more than 24 points, to 1,240.04. **********Kiss and Make Up. **********After breaking off talks in July, Chrysler and the United Auto Workers agreed on a new wage package that will raise union workers' pay by $2.42 an hour over the next two years. The settlement was $1.01 an hour higher than Chrysler's previous offer, but it still gives the No. 3 auto maker a slight labor- cost advantage over G.M. and Ford. Chrysler's primary concern was avoiding any work stoppage in January, when it plans to introduce two new models. And even though the increase will amount to about 29 percent over two years, the auto industry revival and Chrysler's new-found profitability should offset it. **********To the chagrin of Lee Iacocca, the Treasury is going ahead with its sale of 14.4 million Chrysler warrants, which allow the holder to buy Chrysler stock for $13 a share. Chrysler's chairman had all but pleaded with the Government to sell the warrants back to the company, but to no avail. The sale will take place Tuesday at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. **********The summer's drought and scorching heat is affecting wholesale prices faster than anticipated. The Producer Price Index rose four-tenths of 1 percent in August, driven by a similar increase in food prices. Analysts had predicted that food prices would not be pushed up until next year and were surprised by August's figures. Yet, for the first eight months of this year, producer prices have been flat, and 1983 could see the slowest price rise since the mid-1960's.  Shuttle Econonics. **********It's a lucrative job, cleaning up the space shuttle between flights. In fact, over the next six years it will be worth about $2 billion to Lockheed and Grumman. After a bidding contest with a group of companies led by Rockwell International - the shuttle's original builder - NASA awarded the Lockheed group the contract for launching and landing services, now done by 15 separate contractors. The job could extend as long as 15 years, with a value of $6 billion. Analysts were not completely surprised by the outcome. The Government has had a number of complaints against Rockwell about overcharging for shuttle work.  Boeing Economics. **********The world's largest maker of commercial airliners received a $640 million order from Australia's Qantas Airways for six 767's and three 747's. Particularly pleasing to Boeing was the fact that four airlines traveling the so-called silk route - between the Middle East and the Far East - will now be flying the 767, which has had very stiff competition from Airbus.  General Economics. **********In another huge aerospace contract, Turkey decided to buy 160 F-16 fighter jets from General Dynamics over a 10-year period. The contract will be worth between $3.5 billion and $5 billion. It was the first time in almost a decade that the F-16 had won a major international contract over the McDonnell Douglas F-18. But other contests are coming up. Greece should decide soon on an order for as many as 125 fighter planes. The F-16, F-18 and France's Mirage 2000 are in the running. **********Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts struck again, making another leveraged buyout bid. This time the target was the Hyster Company, a maker of forklifts and other heavy equipment. The price: $383 million, or $63 for each of Hyster's 6.1 million shares outstanding. Though Kohlberg was mum on why it was interested in Hyster - just last July it was bidding for Norton Simon - analysts noted that Hyster's balance sheet was almost irresistible, with $43 million in cash and very modest debt. **********The takeover of Biscayne Federal Savings and Loan by the Federal Home Loan Bank board was ruled an abuse of the bank board's authority. The decision by a Federal district judge came in a case filed by Kaufman & Broad, a Biscayne shareholder, after the bank board seized Florida's sixth-largest thrift unit on April 6 and placed it in receivership. The seizure did not jeopardize the thrift's deposits, but reduced the value of its stock to nothing. The judge ordered shareholders and bank board officials to meet and try to reach an agreement on returning ownership of Biscayne to the shareholders. **********Coleco's long-awaited Adam computer was at last ushered on stage. Coleco will charge about $600 for the home computer, which comes with a slow, letter-quality printer, computer console, keyboard and tape-driven memory system. The company said demand was so great that it halted production of its popular ColecoVision video games to open production capacity so it could fill the 400,000 firm orders it already has for Adam. But Coleco did not know for sure when it would begin shipments. It has yet to get approval from the F.C.C. **********One day after the Adam announcement, Coleco and A.T.& T. announced a joint venture to market video games and entertainment software to consumers by telephone. Dakota or Bust. **********BankAmerica, joining Citibank, Security Pacific and First Interstate, has applied for a charter in South Dakota to buy a bank and begin insurance operations. Recent legislation there allows out-of- state banks to buy local units and permits those local banks to underwrite insurance.

That was three and a half years ago, when she was Canada's first Speaker of the House of Commons to be a woman. There was, some recalled, a palpable atmosphere of resentment toward her in the male-dominated lower house. **********The 61-year-old Mrs. Sauve was widely viewed as something of an outsider, a former member of the Cabinet with no great knowledge of procedural rules nor any close ties to the clubby fraternity that had administered the bureaucracy around Parliament. **********But Mrs. Sauve, who will take over the largely ceremonial viceregal duties when Edward R. Schreyer ends his five-year term in January, has through her often stormy term as Speaker won the admiration even of backbench politicians who once sent her opera glasses to dramatize their complaint that she never called on them to speak.   Born in Saskatchewan Mrs. Sauve was born Jeanne Benoit on April 26, 1922, in Prud'Homme, Saskatchewan, and, after a convent education and studies at the Universities of Ottawa and Paris, she settled into the fashionable society of Montreal in the 1950's, working as a journalist. In 1948 she married Maurice Sauve, a businessman and Liberal politician who was a Member of Parliament before her and once served as Minister of Mines and Rural Development. They have one son, who is 24. **********After working with organizations of writers and actors, she was herself first elected to the House in 1972. After a very short backbench career she was named to the Cabinet by Mr. Trudeau. She served as Minister of Environment, Minister of Communication and junior Minister of State for Science and Technology before being installed as Speaker on April 14, 1980. **********On that day, as she walked down the center aisle of the House dressed in a black wool Speaker's uniform she had designed by Serge de Real of Montreal, the resentment against her may have had more to do with her Cabinet ties than her gender. **********The bureaucracy around the Cabinet had grown in size and power under Mr. Trudeau and the Commons was feeling itself subordinated to the executive. In a Liberal Party convention Mrs. Sauve had backed John Turner, a rival of Mr. Trudeau for the leadership, and there was some thought that she was being banished to the Speaker's job with an idea of further humiliating the Members of Parliament, who, Mr. Trudeau once remarked, were ''just nobodies'' once they were 50 yards from Parliament Hill.   Maintenance of Order **********In the first two years of her term, Mrs. Sauve, whose duties as Speaker involved maintaining order in the chamber, may have agreed that someone was being humiliated. **********Parliamentary experts barraged her with points of order and points of privilege to the point of distraction. Although it is traditional never to criticize the Speaker, according to Ian Deans, a Member of Parliament, ''The fact that she's a woman clouded the objectivity of certain members. They would never have questioned a man's judgment in the same way.'' **********At the same time Mrs. Sauve did her homework. At one point she studied photographs of the 282 members of the House so she could call on them by name and constituency. She memorized the hundreds of standing orders and parliamentary procedures of the Commons, and eventually adopted her own system of keeping tabs on who had spoken. The worst moments came in March of 1982 when the Progressive Conservative opposition paralyzed the House for two weeks by quorum calls. ''I felt I couldn't act,'' she has recalled, ''because it would have looked as though I tipped my hand in one direction or another.'' **********She endured criticism and went on to win wide respect. ''She doesn't brook much nonsense now,'' said Walter Baker, once one of her major Conservative critics. **********In addition to her highly visible role as Speaker in the televised Commons procedings, Mrs. Sauve has also had to administer a burauacracy of 3,000 people, which just after she took office was the subject of a highly critical Government audit. Within two years, Mrs. Sauve was able to trim $18 million from her budget and had pared the payroll by 100 workers. **********In her new post as Governor General, to which she will be formally appointed by Queen Elizabeth II, Mrs. Sauve can expect little controversy.

They said Ethnos had links with the ''disinfomation department'' of the K.G.B., the Soviet intelligence service, and that the publisher, George Bobolas, was ''an agent of influence'' for the Soviet Union. **********Journalists Had Protested **********Ethnos said in an editorial Saturday that the witnesses for Mr. Anastasiades had been ''moving easily under the protective cloak of international journalism while in reality being organs of dark forces who are viciously fighting the freedom and interests of the Greek people.'' **********The journalists protested to the Foreign Press Association here on Monday, and the association made a formal protest on their behalf to the Government of Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou. The reply was delivered today to the six journalists - Michael Skapinker of Maclean's Magazine of Canada, Albert Coerant of Dutch Radio and Television, John Rigos of United Press International, Werner Rieder of Der Tagesspiegel of Berlin, Lee Stokes of The London Sunday Mail and U.S.A. Today, and this correspondent. **********The Government's reply was contained in a letter to the Foreign Press Association by the Under Secretary of Press and Information, Dimitris Maroudas. It said of the journalists: **********''There is no evidence whatsoever to support allegations that they exercise any profession or activity other than that of correspondent. **********''The Government does not approve of these allegations. But on the contrary the Government disapproves of the attacks which occur from time to time against foreign correspondents, and it is determined to defend their integrity of all accredited foreign correspondents and the free exercise of their profession in this country.'' **********The journalists' protest to the Foreign Press Association cited what they described as their unfair treatment at the trial and the ''tendentious and incorrect'' reports by Ethnos. **********The penal court trial was held as a result of a libel and defamation suit brought by Mr. Bobolas, whose attorneys denounced the defendant as a ''foreigner'' with no right to comment on Greek newspapers. **********Mr. Anastasiades writes under the name Paul Anastasi as a correspondent for The Daily Telegraph of London and a part-time correspondent for The New York Times. Along with his witnesses, he was accused by Mr. Bobolas's attorneys of being a foreign agent implicated in a plot against the Greek people. **********One of the attorneys, Stathis Alexandris, a former Minister of Justice in the Papandreou Government, described Mr. Anastasiades's witnesses as petty agents representing suspect publications and said there should be an investigation of their presence in Greece. **********After a four-day trial, the three judges convicted Mr. Anastasiades of slanderous defamation, or spreading libel knowing that it was untrue. The court did not contest the evidence in the defendant's book but ruled there was insufficient proof to conclude that the Ethnos publisher was ''an agent of influence'' for the Soviet Union. **********Countersuit Is Rejected **********The court also rejected a countersuit brought by Mr. Anastasiades charging character defamation. It ruled that articles in Ethnos calling Mr. Anastasiades a conspirator and an agent of the United States Central Intelligence Agency could be viewed as justified indignation over the book. **********In Greek law, a libel suit may come before a civil or criminal court. In a civil action, if the defendent is found guilty, he must pay damages, but the case can drag on. In a criminal court, verdicts are usually speedy, and the plaintiff who wins gets the satisfaction of sending his defamer to jail. **********Mr. Anastasiades, 33 years old, is free pending appeal of his sentence, which includes symbolic damages of $300. He said in a recent interview that he would urge the Foreign Press Association, the Greek Journalists Union and the London-based International Press Institute to send observers to the proceedings of the Court of Appeals, expected to begin in three months. **********Ethnos, Greece's first mass tabloid, has a national circulation of 200,000. It was started in 1981 by Mr. Bobolas, a businessman who has been involved in large trade deals with the Russians. **********Mr. Anastasiades wrote that its three main foreign correspondents were all associated with Communist parties and that its reports about Soviet-bloc countries were usually highly favorable while its coverage of the United States and its policies was negative. **********He said his main source for charges of links between the publisher and the Soviet Union was Mr. Bobolas's former partner, Yannis Yannikos, a Communist Party member.

About 300 United States soldiers are carrying out mostly police duties along with 500 members of the seven-nation Caribbean force that joined in the invasion and 250 Grenadian policemen. **********The chairman of Grenada's interim Government, Nicholas Braithwaite, said in an interview that the police had confirmed that former members of the Grenadian military underground were holding meetings. **********''We have their names, and some of them have recently been released from detention,'' he said. ''The record of these people convinces one that we cannot ignore the possibility of subversive action.'' Though their numbers are believed to be small, he said, ''you will appreciate that in a country as small as this, 100 people with guns could cause a great deal of confusion.'' **********Mr. Braithwaite said Grenadian police leave had been canceled for the holiday period and the United States Ambassador, Charles A. Gillespie, said United States and Caribbean forces were on ''increased alert'' in the light of ''reports of possible violence.'' **********Since the fighting that accompanied the Oct. 25 United States-led invasion ended in early November, there have been no reports of armed resistance by supporters of the old Government. The invasion began days after a hard-line faction toppled the Government of Prime Minister Maurice Bishop, who was later killed by Grenadian soldiers. **********Most members of the People's Revolutionary Army, the military arm of the former Government, have been released after being detained and questioned.

Those proposals, advanced in the last decade in forums of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, include giving governments a right to force the press to report positively about government actions and licensing journalists as a way to protect them in war zones. **********In a move broadly criticized by press groups, the Defense Department barred reporters from covering the first two days of fighting in Grenada and then provided limited guided tours of some parts of the island for two more days. The Pentagon said the limitations were initially needed to prevent advance disclosure of the operation and were later retained because the military could not assure the safety of correspondents. **********On Sunday, the man who approved the news restrictions, Gen. John W. Vessey Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he would create a panel of officers and journaliists to review the restrictions in the first days of the invasion.

Sussman, executive of director of Freedom House, a New York organization that has fought against press restrictions, said he anticipated the news controls in Grenada would be cited this week at the Unesco conference in Paris. Mr. Sussman is a member of the United States delegation to that meeting, which is scheduled to discuss a range of communications proposals, including a Soviet resolution that among other things affirms the right of governments to control some kinds of news. **********An official in the State Department's Office of Communications and Unesco Affairs said the delegation to the Paris meeting had been instructed on the Grenada news-control question because ''it is likely some mention will be made'' of the issue. He declined to say what the instructions were. **********Mr. Sussman said that although he thought the controls were wrong, he intended to respond to any criticism by noting that the controls were less restrictive than those routinely imposed by other nations and that they were finally lifted after an ''uproar in the press of the kind that only happens in a free society.'' He said the issue would be raised ''more as a matter of rhetoric by countries that are year-round censors themselves.''  'Prejudices the Position' **********Seymour Topping, managing editor of The New York Times, said, ''The extraordinary restriction imposed on the press in the coverage of the Grenada invasion prejudices the position the United States has taken in international forums on freedom of the press.'' Mr. Topping is chairman of the international communications committee of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, which, like other press groups, protested the controls. **********He said the Western arguments to be made in Paris ''inevitably will suffer as a consequence of the example set by the Defense Department in denying access to correspondents in the coverage of the Grenada operation.'' **********''We cannot effectively preach freedom of the press abroad unless we practice it at home,'' Mr. Topping said.   Resistance to Information Order **********The Reagan Administration, like its predecessors, has resisted the ''new world information order'' that has repeatedly been proposed by third-world and Soviet bloc nations in Unesco meetings. By coincidence, on the first day American marines landed in Grenada, Mr. Reagan repeated his stand that ''accurate, objective information is necessary to the preservation of democracy and freedom.'' **********In a message congratulating the Foreign Press Association on its 65th anniversary, Mr. Reagan noted his opposition to ''restrictions on the right of journalists to report events and information as they see fit, free of authoritarian restrictions and official or ideological guidelines.'' **********Journalists were particularly critical of the Defense Department's reasoning that reporters should not be allowed in Grenada until their safety could be assured. Unesco has debated the issue of identification cards to journalists as a way to protect them in combat zones, but the Western press has said, as it did in Grenada, that reporters are responsible for their own security and that the proposed cards could easily turn into a system for governmental licensing of journalists.   An Insult, Publisher Says **********R. M. White 2d, publisher of The Mexico (Mo.) Ledger and chairman of the American Committee of the International Press Institute, said the idea of protecting journalists was an insult to the memory of war correspondents killed ''so that the American public could have an accurate accounting'' of the progress of fighting. **********Dana R. Bullen, executive director of the World Press Freedom Committe, based in Washington, said the Grenada invasion was a reminder that press curbs ''are bad whether its our Government or Zimbabwe.'' **********The restrictions surprised the Western press because in other situations the press has had almost totally free access to scenes of fighting. In the battles around Beirut, for example, American correspondents have been able to reach both sides. Some reporters interviewed Druse militiamen under fire from American warships. **********In Grenada, however, almost all foreign reporters were expelled after Prime Minister Maurice Bishop was overthrown a week before the invasion. **********Dwight Whylie, a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reporter, filed reports until he was expelled the day before the invasion.

Jose Guillermo Garcia, and the province commander, Lieut. Col. Sigifredo Ochoa Perez, had complicated the issue of certification, which is required every six months by Congress as a condition for continuing aid to Salvador. But they said there was virtual unanimity at the moment in the State Department and White House on supporting certification. **********''I don't see a basis for opposing certification at this point,'' a ranking State Department official said. The Administration must make its certification decision by Jan. 28.

The Defense Minister's departure, one official said, would be a setback for United States efforts in El Salvador. **********''We would not like to see him lose his post,'' he said.  At the moment, according to the official, United States diplomats in El Salvador are ''still betting on Garcia, but the bets are hedged.'' **********''He's still got a majority of high commanders with him, but the question is whether that support will erode.'' The State Department was reported surprised by the rebellion of Colonel Ochoa. ''Nobody saw this coming,'' an official said.  The colonel began his rebellion Thursday after receiving orders transferring him to a diplomatic post in Uruguay. He declared he no longer recognized the authority of General Garcia and demanded his resignation for the way he had handled the three-year-old guerrilla war. 'Internal Army Dispute' **********Officials here are concerned over Colonel Ochoa's apparent links to the Salvadoran rightist leader, Roberto d'Aubuisson, the president of the Constituent Assembly. Mr. d'Aubuisson strongly opposes land redistribution and other changes and his name has been linked to the violent activities of rightist squads. **********The present conflict, an official said, ''seems to be an internal army dispute involving institutional and military officials.'' Even if General Garcia leaves his defense post - he is to complete 30 years of military service this month -it is doubted here that it will solidify the power of the rightists and lead to Colonel Ochoa's advancement, at least for the moment. **********One official said that Mr. d'Aubuisson was not especially popular with senior army officers and that ''one of the things going against Ochoa is that he's too close to d'Aubuisson.'' The official said Colonel Ochoa, in attacking the institutional authority of General Garcia, weakened his own position in the military. **********Some human rights activists and Latin American experts disagree, saying that General Garcia's departure would buoy Mr. d'Aubuisson and Colonel Ochoa and bring an upheaval in the armed forces at a time when leftist guerrillas appear to be pressing their offensive in the countryside. Some Criticism Expected **********President Reagan's planned certification of aid to El Salvador is expected to be criticized by some human rights activists as well as members of Congress and will also meet the opposition of the A.F.L.- C.I.O. An affiliate of the labor group, the American Institute for Free Labor Development, has been involved in El Salvador for years, especially in efforts among peasants to reorganize the land system. **********Jack J. Heberle, a spokesman for the institute, said today that the organization would oppose certification because of a ''lack of progress'' in the murder of two Americans working for the A.F.L.- C.I.O. and a Salvadoran union leader who headed the land redistribution effort. The three were fatally shot at the Sheraton Hotel in San Salvador. **********Two former Salvadoran corporals have confessed to the killings, but two officers and a businessman who have been implicated in the murders - and who are well-connected to Salvadoran military and judicial figures - have gone unpunished. Salvador Rights Group Speaks Out **********SAN SALVADOR, Jan. 10 (AP) -The Salvadoran Human Rights Commission asked President Reagan today to stop putting arms in ''assassins' hands.'' **********In a letter made public here, the group urged Mr. Reagan not to certify that the Salvadoran Government was making progress in its human rights record. **********The rights group appealed to Mr. Reagan to support negotiations to end the war. The letter said such support would be a ''sign of hope that the war might reach an end.'' **********It said 38,000 civilians had been killed since the start of the war and 5,000 were reported missing.  The commission, which the Salvadoran Government says favors the leftists, attributed nearly all the deaths and disappearances to the Salvadoran armed forces. **********Commission members, many of whom live in exile, are mostly former professionals who were forced to abandon their regular jobs because of the civil war. **********The letter said American support for the Salvadoran Government made it ''responsible for tens of thousands of families suffering from the absence of at least one of its members.'' **********It added that political persecution had caused almost half a million people to flee for refuge in other countries."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/28/business/head-of-realty-concern-dismissed-after-11-days.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1983-05-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 386, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HEAD OF REALTY CONCERN DISMISSED AFTER 11 DAYS", "print_headline": "HEAD OF REALTY CONCERN DISMISSED AFTER 11 DAYS", "body_text": " **********William D.

Everywhere the remains of dismantled blast furnaces lie like the bleached bones of dinosaurs in knee-high weeds. The Ruhr, once the powerful engine of Germany's industrial juggernaut, has run out of steam. **********Just 10 years ago, businessmen from around the world flocked to the grimy cities of this valley to buy the huge machines and equipment that have made its name synonymous with industrial quality. Oberhausen, the gray and gritty home of 240,000 people, is one of those cities. Back then, Thyssen, Germany's biggest steel company, kept 14,000 workers busy turning out heavy steel plate, light steel sections and wire for machine builders, shipyards and construction companies. **********But then the world plunged into a troubled era of high energy costs, recession and stop-go growth from which it has yet to emerge. Cash-strapped customers from the developing nations put their expansion plans in limbo and stopped buying. The West European building slump squeezed demand for sections and wire, and the decline of the Continent's shipyards and oil refineries slimmed demand for the heavy plate used to build hulls and storage tanks. **********Today, despite reducing the work week to a bare 20 hours, Thyssen has had to pare its workforce at Oberhausen to 6,000. And on Friday, the steel giant approved plans to shut down a press works. The company tried to soften the blow by adding that it would keep steel plate production going ''for the time being.'' Thyssen says the decision will mean the loss of 600 jobs but union leaders figure 2,100 jobs will eventually be lost. That would be a harsh blow to this town where the unemployment rate already is 15.9 percent. **********The Oberhausen pattern is repeated throughout the depressed Ruhr, a patch of hill country - no bigger than Washington, D.C. - that tucks into the angle of northwestern Germany created by the borders of the Netherlands and Belgium. The region's huge steel companies - Thyssen, Hoesch, and Krupp - are cutting back their basic operations and have even talked merger. Ruhrkhole, the big energy company whose coal mines fire the steel mills, will lose $226 million this year because of falling demand. More than 13 percent of the Ruhr's workers, some 255,000 people, are unemployed. **********The fundamental question confronting West Germany's economic strategists is whether the Ruhr's afflictions are cyclical, and thus likely to be remedied by the arrival one day of a sustained economic recovery, or structural, and therefore destined to remain a problem no matter what good turns the business cycle should take. **********Those who espouse the latter view say the Ruhr's misfortunes are symptomatic of a malaise afflicting other basic **********German industries such as textiles and shipbuilding, which have been doubly hurt in recent years by recession at home and fierce competition from lower-cost producers abroad. They also view the Ruhr as a mirror of troubles afflicting most developed nations today - the United States included - which are struggling to salvage heavy, basic industries under attack from low-cost foreign producers and from substitute materials, such as plastic and aluminum. **********If the structuralists are right, the Ruhr must sharply reduce its dependence upon its weakened basic industries and diversify into more sophisticated industries with greater growth potential. Policy has begun to take baby steps in this direction. Bonn and the State Government of North Rhine-Westphalia, where the Ruhr flows on its way to the Rhine, are pumping several billion dollars into subsidies for existing industries and into efforts to attract high technology companies to the region. **********For politicians, the Ruhr's fate could turn out to be critically important. The right-wing Government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl won a landslide victory in national elections last March on the promise to revive West Germany's flagging economy and create jobs. Many Ruhr workers, who traditionally lean to the political left, apparently voted for the conservatives in desperation. If the Ruhr continues to slide they may switch back to the Socialist Democrats. **********The Ruhr, of course, has been down and out before. During World War II, British and American bombers flattened the huge steel and armament producing plants situated in the Those raids destroyed roughly 30 percent of the region's steel mills and damaged other factories beyond repair. To prevent the resurgence of what Allied leaders had come to view as militaristic Germany's industrial Hydra, Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. sent a memorandum to President Franklin D. Roosevelt proposing that the Ruhr be totally de- industrialized by tearing down all of its industries and returning the valley to farming and sheep grazing. **********Resistance to the plan by European leaders, mainly in Britain and the Netherlands (roughly three-fourths of the port of Rotterdam's traffic before the war involved goods from the Ruhr), enabled the valley to revive and help fuel the remarkable economic growth that West Germany generated after its recovery from the ruins of World War II. High-quality iron ores from Sweden, Brazil and Australia came barging down the Rhine to Duisburg, whose maze of docks and arching cranes make it Europe's biggest inland port - a clearing house for raw materials coming in and finished steel and industrial goods going out. **********The post-World War II era was marked by a curious entangling of the industrial and political forces that controlled the region. The Ruhr's steel barons increasingly had to share their power with the powerful Social Democratic Party and its close allies, the labor unions. Thus Dortmund's Social Democratic mayor, G\"unter Samtlebe, is an influential union member and an employee of Hoesch, the steel concern. The Social Democrats' parliament member from Duisburg is an engineer at Thyssen.  The most pernicious effect of this paternalistic control was the atrophy of small innovative business in the shadow of the coal and steel giants, says Theo Siepert, business editor of the Neue Ruhr Zeitung, the region's most influential daily. The steel giants, moreover, failed in the 1970's to develop the new technologies required to compete against the steel industries of such emerging industrial nations as Spain, Brazil, and South Korea. In addition, the relentlessly blue-collar tinge of the region mitigated against the development of institutions of higher education in the valley. The first university in the Ruhr was not founded until the 1960's. **********The ramifications of that coalition are now ravaging the Ruhr. ''If we cannot get the drive back into the region,'' said Dieter Hockel, an economist at Germany's trade union Federation in D\"usseldorf, ''then Morgenthau has won out in the end.'' **********To remedy what they believe to be structural problems, policy makers like Reimut Jochimsen, the economics minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, are backing a five-year, $2.7-billion, government program to transform the valley by attracting high- tech companies with cash grants, low-cost property and improved university facilities that, it is hoped, will eventually spew forth new research and a skilled work force. ''A region that was founded on basic products - steel, coal, ores - a key region for 150 years, is now in a process of adjustment at a time of slow growth,'' says Mr. Jochimsen - and it needs Government help. **********BUT if the problem is primarily cyclical, as some West Germans still believe, such sweeping changes may not be needed. Industries that are suppliers for machinery and machine tool makers, automobile and plant builders could be expected to burst back to life automatically once the West German economy revives. **********''The giant steel companies have some dead branches, but they have lively products too, with state-of-the- art technology,'' says Theo Siepert, of the Neue Ruhr Zeitung, an optimist in the current debate. ''The Ruhr is not Belgium. It is not dead or in intensive care.'' **********Analysts of Mr. Siepert's stripe argue that the Ruhr's traditional businesses must be kept largely intact to take advantage of eventual economic recovery. And recover it must, they believe, if West Germany is to remain the industrial powerhouse of Europe. **********The farmers and their sheep are unlikely to reclaim control of the Ruhr any time soon. But the industrial barons and those other post- World War II powers in the Ruhr, the trade unions, have lost some of their once unshakable grip. The steel fiefdoms of Thyssen and Krupp are particularly shaky. Their mighty mills will produce barely 30 million tons of steel this year, a far cry from the postwar peak of 53 million tons in 1974. And even tougher times lie ahead. Thyssen, for example, plans to slash its annual crude steel capacity of 16 million metric tons by about one- third. Krupp, another of the region's major steel producers, has announced capacity cuts that will eliminate 4,000 of its 34,000 steelmaking jobs by the end of 1985. What's more, steel company executives predict that the industry will lose about $1.2 billion, or roughly $40 for every ton it produces in 1983. **********STEEL'S problems have spread **********to other industries. The coal **********mining industry, too, is in deep trouble, despite huge Government subsidies - $235 million this year alone. Industry leaders and Government officials agree that lower demand from steelmakers and utilities has built up such huge coal reserves that production cuts and worker layoffs are inevitable. **********In steel towns like Dortmund and Duisburg - trim, modern cities that still reflect three decades of unbroken prosperity - unemployment is above 15 percent, nearly twice the national average. Now it seems bound to rise even higher **********That jobless figure is rendered all the more dramatic by the wave of emigration that has drained the Ruhr in recent years. During the 1960's, when cheap oil from the Middle East began to undercut the viability of the Ruhr coal industry, some 300,000 people left the region for jobs in the faster-growing south German cities of Stuttgart and Munich, where electrical companies like Siemens or Bosch and auto makers like Daimler-Benz were thriving. Between 1970 and 1980 a further quarter of a million Ruhrites followed suit. **********The unemployment picture is likely to get worse before its gets better. The steelmakers are slashing the production of bulk steel and other traditional items that can no longer compete on world markets. (Like most West German industries, steel is heavily dependent upon the export market.) To take up the slack, the companies are concentrating upon sophisticated, higher value-added products, ranging from precision machinery and electronics to turnkey factories. But world markets for even these products remains soft. **********The program to attract high-tech companies is enjoying some success. Although its major production facilities will remain in southern Germany, Hewlett-Packard has opened a regional center near D\"usseldorf, and a new service center in Dortmund. Also in Dortmund, Hoesch Steel expanded its software consulting subsidiary, M.B.P., helping to triple the number of jobs in the region's computer industry, to 1,500, since 1975.Farther to the east, the 3M Company is expanding a factory it built in Kamen in the 1970's to make plastic jackets for computer diskettes and video cassettes. **********But even ardent supporters of such tactics concede that the high-tech newcomers have had minimal effect in easing unemployment. Reinhard Bischof, vice president of the Economic Development Corporation for North Rhine-Westphalia, an agency that helps settle companies in depressed areas like the Ruhr, said an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 steelworkers could be laid off over the next three to four years. ''We don't know how to replace those jobs,'' he said. ''We need new companies with 200 to 300 employees. Those we're getting average 20 to 100.'' **********Much more needs to be done before the strategy to attract high-tech companies can be fairly judged, say its proponents. Andreas Schlieper, an economist with the Essen-based Federation of Ruhr Cities, would have the region's banks supply more of the venture capital small companies need in high-risk sectors like electronics or bioengineering. In addition, he wants local governments to imitate the British by creating ''sheltered environments'' for companies, by offering low tax rates and other business benefits. He also suggests expanding the region's cable communication and transportation networks, thus creating both new investment and jobs. **********German economists who lean to the cyclical argument warn against moving too far from the region's traditional industries. ''Policy that starts with the employment rate of individual concerns is dangerous,'' contends Willi Lamberts, an economist at the Rhenish-Westphalian Research Institute located in Essen. ''My fear is that the adjustments we are undertaking are having the effect of destroying the structure of the region. It is de-industrialization.'' **********Those of Mr. Lamberts' persuasion believe that selective surgery rather than wholesale industrial transplanting is all that is needed in the region. They say that too sweeping a dismantling of the Ruhr's traditional industries could sap the big companies' strength, rendering them unable to meet the needs of West Germany's sophisticated automobile, shipbuilding and construction industries, if the world economy returned to sustained growth. **********As in Youngstown, Liverpool, in Britain, or Charleroi, in Belgium's steelmaking Meuse Valley, a sense of helplessness is spreading. Yet so far, the Ruhr has accepted its blows quietly. In Belgium, barely 100 miles to the west, red banners and occupations of factories have become commonplace. Here, discontent finds its voice in an occasional demonstration and, in last March's general election, a marked shift at the polls to the conservative Christian Democrats, whose promises of austerity evidently struck many workers as a useful remedy for West Germany's, and the Ruhr's, economic ills. **********ONE possible reason is the inborn caution that comes from living under the protective wings of strong companies, unions and political parties. Another possible explanation is the almost total financial support that the unemployed in West Germany receive in the first year off the job. The former employer and the local municipality provide benefits and the federal Government pays 68 percent of the last year's salary. **********Long accustomed to secure jobs, company housing, and the generous health and pension plans that were the result of a far-reaching consensus between business and labor, the Ruhr's workers tend to look patiently to employers and unions for solutions. Now, however, there is a spreading sense that corporate profitability is being maintained at the expense of jobs. Moreover, as the unemployed remain without jobs for more than a year, their benefits diminish markedly. **********''We don't want soup kitchens like in Detroit,'' said Friedrich Kinnigkeit, a former coal miner who is the Deputy Mayor of Essen. ''In the 20's and 30's, the Ruhr was a center of unrest. Today it's a stabilizing factor. But that could change if hopelessness spreads. We cannot pull ourselves out of this mess by our own hair.'' **********Will the Ruhr recover? As on the remedies, so do opinions vary vaguely on the long-term prognosis. ''The Ruhr's importance will persist,'' said Gangolf Weiler, a Thyssen executive in Duisburg. ''There will be financial and fiscal problems. The cities may have to close swimming pools, theaters and ice rinks. But the Rhine is there and will always be there. There are first-class highways and rail lines. The people are realists - dry, perhaps, but good workers.'' **********Others are less sure. ''What do people in Detroit do?'' another steel executive asked. ''They go South, they go to California. People will insist that Dortmund or Oberhausen must remain steel cities. They say that's where the Ruhr was born. I can only say, 'Why?' '' **********FLOWERS AMIDFOUNDRIES **********BONN Mention the Ruhr to most Americans and they think of those smoke-belching blast furnaces and sooty gray settlements for coal miners and foundry hands that Allied bombers strafed in old B-movies. And there is no denying that even today, the Ruhr does have its scruffier corners, like rundown areas of Gelsenkirchen or backwater neighborhoods of Duisburg that are favored by the area's Turkish migrant workers for their cheap rents and proximity to the mills. **********But the Ruhr has its attractive side. The ride up Route 52 from D\"usseldorf to Essen, crossing the meandering Ruhr River near a town called Kettwig, evokes the pastoral serenity of the Sawmill River Parkway rather than the industrial grittiness of the Pulaski Skyway. **********The steel cities themselves, most of them rural farming towns in the 19th century, have spent heavily on parks, flowers and trees. Years ago, public-spirited city fathers enacted tough laws on the recovery of coal mining land and the foresting of the mountainous refuse dumps created by the coaling coke furnaces of the steel mills. **********This year, Duisburg, the biggest inland port on the Rhine and the gateway to the Ruhr basin, was host to the European sculling championships on a stretch of harbor water whose lush green backdrop must have reminded even Britain's Oxford-based oarsmen of home. **********By their own admission, some of the Ruhr's cities don't shy from deviousness to achieve their greening. When Dortmund recently applied for Federal funds to put some of its jobless to work on public projects, the money was granted on condition that nothing be produced that would compete with local industry. To comply, the city set its unemployed to work planting trees and flowers in local parks. **********The project did not do much to prevent unemployment from climbing to its current 16 percent level, concedes G\"unter Samtlebe, Dortmund's Mayor. On the other hand, he adds, ''We're probably the city in the Ruhr with by far the most trees per square mile.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/02/business/advertising-people.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1983-08-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 15, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "People", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; People", "body_text": " **********Charles F.

It could fill the missing link.'' **********Everything but Cash **********That link is getting cash to Citicorp's five million or so credit card holders across the country. Through the cards, the mail, and toll-free phone numbers, Citicorp already offers its customers just about any other banking service. **********For the past two years, it has been soliciting deposits through the mail by offering high-yielding money market accounts. And through its credit cards, Citicorp customers around the country can automatically get loans, some as large as $50,000. Federal laws that prohibit interstate banking merely bar banks from taking deposits through out-of-state offices. **********A few years ago that seemed like a major problem. But today, with mail and phone solicitation, ''taking deposits through a retail branch is a relatively minor function,'' said Mr. Wooden of Merrill Lynch. The big problem now is getting cash to the public, and an automated teller machine, or A.T.M., is one solution. **********For the supermarkets, the primary motive is to lure more customers into their stores. Supermarkets are making their A.T.M.'s available to all financial institutions that agree to pay a fee for each transaction. Thus, a single machine in one supermarket could be used by customers of many financial institutions nationwide. **********'We Know More About Lettuce' **********''We're not doing it because we want to be a bank, but because we want to be a better grocer,'' said Shaun P. Pond, consumer financial services coordinator for Safeway. ''We know more about lettuce than banking, we just want something to bring more people into our stores and give them better service. It's a feature we'd like to see in as many of our 1,900 stores as possible.'' **********Publix, one of the biggest supermarket chains in Florida, has installed 183 A.T.M.'s and plans to install another 120 or so within a year. ''We thought we'd give our customers additional service,'' said Howard Jenkins, vice president. **********Mr. Jenkins said the program has cost Publix about $10 million. The chain, he said, charges banks between 30 and 40 cents per cash withdrawal. More than 300 banks, savings and loan associations and credit unions within Florida have joined the Publix network. There also are two out-of-state participants, Citicorp and the American Express Company. **********Unlike Publix, Safeway does not own or maintain the machines itself. It merely provides space to an outside company, National Transactions Systems Inc., of El Segundo, Calif., which was formed in 1982 by Frederick W. Field, an heir to the Marshall Field fortune. **********So far, National Transactions has installed 50 machines in Safeway stores in Southern California. It soon will install another 50 in the Bay Area. It splits the fees it receives from the financial institutions with Safeway. The fees are 75 cents for each withdrawal, 40 cents for each account transfer and 20 cents for each balance inquiry. Each financial institution decides whether to pass these costs on to the consumer. **********Trend Said to Be Growing **********James W. Brubaker, National Transactions' chief executive officer, said the trend toward cash machines in supermarkets and other retail outlets is growing. His company, he said, has reached agreement to install teller machines in Safeway stores in Arizona, and talks are being held with a ''convenience store and a major department store in California.'' **********Mr. Brubaker also said that National Transactions is holding talks with a large supermarket chain in the New York metropolitan area and that Citicorp already has agreed to participate if that arrangement materialized. Mr. Brubaker declined to name the chain. Citicorp confirmed Mr. Brubaker's information, but also declined to identify the chain. **********For some banks, the installation of teller machines in retail stores is both a threat and an opportunity. It allows banks to vastly expand cash-dispensing and money-transfer services without having to invest millions of dollars. And it gives small banks the opportunity to have large networks they could not otherwise afford."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/12/business/canada-surplus-shrinks.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-01-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 29, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Canada Surplus Shrinks", "print_headline": "Canada Surplus Shrinks", "body_text": " **********Canada's trade surplus in November narrowed to a seasonally adjusted $1.567 billion (Canadian) from $1.66 billion in October, the Government agency Statistics Canada said today."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/20/business/advertising-switch-at-playboy.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1983-09-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 63, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Switch at Playboy", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Switch at Playboy", "body_text": " **********To replace Henry W.

Another factor working in favor of the leftist coalition is that while their policies are not especially popular, the polls indicate that the ideas and leading personalities of the opposition are not too popular, either. **********Poor January Figures **********The Socialists' campaign was jolted this weekend by the release of two statistics: Government figures showed that prices rose ninetenths of 1 percent in January, which project an annual inflation rate of more than 10 percent, suggesting that it will be difficult for Finance Minister Jacques Delors to meet his objective of holding inflation to 8 percent for 1983. And the deficit in the country's balance of trade in January was 9.58 billion francs, about $1.4 billion, up from 5.9 billion francs in December. **********The opposition immediately seized on the numbers, which are expected to play a major role in their final campaign salvos against the Government. **********''The latest public indices confirm our worries: France is in a bad state,'' former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing declared today during a campaign swing in Vincennes. ''It is sad when dreams are disappointed, but we can replace the dream with confidence.'' **********The elections will be held in two rounds, the first on March 6 and a runoff on the 13th in cities and districts where no party list gets a first-round majority. The first round is expected to be decisive in many localities; in most cities, the Communists and Socialists are running as a single ticket against right-of-center slates that include neo-Gaullists, Giscard followers and centrists. Left Goes on Defense **********In almost every city and town, the neo-Gaullists led by the Mayor of Paris, Jacques Chirac, have erected billboards declaring: ''City by city, let us win back France.'' **********In the past, conservatives argued that the municipal elections were local matters. This was a natural argument for the right to make, since conservative local politicians are usually well-known ''notables'' who do better on their own than as part of a national movement. This year, however, the center-right has, in the parlance here, ''politicized'' the local balloting around national issues, sensing a trend against the Socialists. **********On the other side, the Communist Party has put out posters calling for ''a union against the right.'' Two years ago, the catch phrase was ''the union of the left,'' and the shift to negative and defensive campaigning tells something about the state of the Government's popularity. **********The left alliance is faced with the problem of defending a sharp turnaround in its economic policy.  When he first took office, President Mitterrand began by nationalizing key sectors of the economy and embarked on a program of active Government intervention in the economy in an effort to stimulate it. Shift to Austerity Measures **********The Government program included increasing the buying power of lower middle class Frenchmen by raising the minimum wage, cutting the workweek by an hour, increasing taxes on the well-to-do and giving workers new rights. This policy did result in economic growth, but also drew in a flood of imports, aggravating the country's trade deficit. **********So the Government shifted to an austerity policy, including wage and price controls and some budget cuts. The Government has argued that overall, it has managed to reduce inflation, while holding the unemployment rate below that of other Western countries. **********But most French economic analysts and voters expect still more austerity after the election, and possibly another devaluation of the franc. And from a political standpoint, the Government's shift in policy appears to have alienated some of its working class supporters. Government Faces Trouble **********Christophe Riboud, president of a French polling agency, said the Government faces political trouble on both fronts.  First there are the ''disappointed voters,'' mainly the young and blue collar workers. Both groups hoped for major improvements in their standard of living, improvements which by and large did not materialize. For the young, continuing high unemployment is a particular burden. **********''But these voters won't necessarily switch sides,'' Mr. Riboud said. Most workers will still vote for the left, and those who are unhappy will protest by staying home. **********However, Mr. Riboud said the right is likely to pick up votes among the younger ''new middle class'' professionals. These voters, particularly working women, liked the sound of Mr. Mitterrand's promises for social change, but may now be ready to realign with the traditional middle class, Mr. Riboud said. **********The main battles are being fought in the 219 cities in France with populations of 30,000 or more. The left alliance posted major gains in the 1977 municpal elections and now controls 154 of these cities.  Just over half of these have Socialist mayors or the center-left Movement of Left Radicals; the rest are led by Communists. **********Pierre Martin, a top Socialist campaign official, argues that the left coalition did so well in 1977 that losses are inevitable. This line of reasoning will help the Socialists rationalize anything but a catastrophic loss - something over 50 cities."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/25/world/palestinians-and-israelis-welcome-their-prisoners-freed-in-exchange.html": {"writer_name": "David Shipler", "pub_date": "1983-11-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1282, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PALESTINIANS AND ISRAELIS WELCOME THEIR PRISONERS FREED IN EXCHANGE", "print_headline": "PALESTINIANS AND ISRAELIS WELCOME THEIR PRISONERS FREED IN EXCHANGE", "body_text": " **********Six Israeli soldiers, held prisoner for more than 14 months by the Palestine Liberation Organization in Lebanon, returned home today to a tumultuous, passionate welcome. **********Crowds of family and friends hugged the returning soldiers, poured champagne on their heads and carried them above the throngs after they flew into Sde Dov Airport near Tel Aviv. **********In exchange, Israel completed the release of 4,500 Arab prisoners, including some who were serving life sentences for terrorist attacks on Israeli civilians. It also closed the Ansar camp, a detention center built in southern Lebanon after the 1982 invasion. **********Freed in Algeria and Lebanon **********About 3,400 Arab prisoners were set free in Lebanon, and 1,100 were flown in three Air France jumbo jets to Algeria, the Israeli Army said. The P.L.O.'s archives, seized in West Beirut during the 1982 Israeli invasion, were also returned. **********The release of so many Palestinian guerrillas prompted Israeli reporters to ask Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir if the move nullified the gains of Israel's invasion of Lebanon, which sought to destroy the P.L.O. and reduce terrorism.  ''We paid a high price for the release of the six,'' Mr. Shamir replied, ''but in the negotiations we were faced with the fact that their lives were in peril, and that at any moment the worst could happen.'' The six soldiers were being held in Tripoli, Lebanon, by the forces of Yasir Arafat, chairman of the P.L.O., who has been under fierce attack from rival Syrian-backed rebel Palestinians. **********Whether broader political strategies figured in the Israeli decision could not be immediately determined. The sudden release of thousands of guerrillas could bolster the Arafat forces in their fight against the rebels in Tripoli, but it was not clear whether this was an Israeli goal. **********At a news conference in Tel Aviv, Defense Minister Moshe Arens said the releases could exacerbate Israel's security problems in southern Lebanon. ''This certainly is a cause for concern,'' Mr. Arens said, ''but it was a decision we had to take, and any delay in bringing them back could have been disastrous. We have problems, we will have problems, and we don't rule out the possibility that they will be harder.'' **********Deputy Foreign Minister Yehuda Ben-Meir said Israel's willingness to free a large number of guerrillas underscored ''the value which is at the heart of the uniqueness of the Israel Defense Forces, the fact that every soldier knows that no matter what may happen, the entire people of Israel and the Government of Israel, with all the might and ability and resources that we have, will stand behind him and that we will go to all lengths in the world to bring him home.'' **********Today's release left at least five Israelis and 300 Syrians still in captivity as a result of the Lebanon fighting. Two or three Israelis are being held in Damascus by a radical P.L.O. faction led by Ahmed Jabril, and three are prisoners of Syria, the army says, and are reportedly being held in severe conditions. Five Israelis are missing. Israel has said that it is anxious to exchange the 300 Syrians.   Red Cross Aid **********The Red Cross evacuated the Israelis early this morning, and also took charge of the Palestinian prisoners being released from Israel and from Ansar. **********The Army's announcement said that a second stage would involve discussion with the Jabril faction on the release of the Israelis being held by that group. **********Today's prisoner exchange followed the pattern of such exchanges in past wars. After the 1967 war, according to the army's figures, 6,718 Arabs were exchanged for 15 captured Israelis. After the 1973 war, 8,811 Arabs were released for 299 Israelis. **********Initially, Israel demanded the return of all prisoners at once, but changed tactics as fighting flared in Tripoli and threatened the lives of the six, Mr. Arens said. **********Negotiations were conducted in Geneva under the auspices of the International Committee of the Red Cross, an Israeli Army announcement said. The Israeli delegation was led by former Justice Minister Shmuel Tamir and Brig. Gen. Amos Yaron, head of manpower for the Israeli Army. A Red Cross official also traveled between Tripoli and Tel Aviv, serving as an intermediary between Mr. Arafat and Mr. Arens, the Israeli radio reported.   Release Recommended **********Mr. Tamir, speaking at a news conference in Tel Aviv, said that one of the six prisoners had suffered psychological problems during recent shelling. Under the terms of the Geneva Convention, he was examined by two Red Cross doctors and two from the P.L.O., all of whom recommended his release, Mr. Tamir said. but the P.L.O. did not comply. General Yaron identified the man as Private Danny Gilboa, 20 years old, but said he was now all right. **********All the men, ranging in age from 19 to 21, were captured in September 1982 when their outpost north of Bhamdun, in central Lebanon, was overrun. They were taken by fishing boat in the early hours of this morning from Tripoli to a French vessel, then transferred to an Israeli naval vessel, which docked in Haifa. From there, they were flown by helicopter to Sde Dov. They looked thin, pale and exhausted, and they replied to reporters' questions mostly with one-word answers. **********According to Mr. Tamir, the P.L.O. initially demanded that in addition to the approximately 4,400 prisoners held at the Ansar camp, another 1,250 convicted Palestinian terrorists be freed from Israeli prisons. The final swap included 100 such prisoners, 37 of whom had been seized recently by the Israeli Navy as they tried to make their way from Cyprus to Tripoli. **********Neither Mr. Arens nor other officials would give the names of any of the other 63, who were serving sentences for terrorist attacks. But Bishara Bahbah, editor-in-chief of Al Fajr, a Palestinian newspaper based in East Jerusalem, said that his reporters had been told by relatives that several well- known figures were among those freed.   Bombing, Hijacking Figures **********According to Dr. Bahbah, they included Ziad Abu Eian, who was extradited from the United States in December 1981 and sentenced to life in prison for a bombing in Tiberias that killed 2 Israeli teenagers and wounded 36 other people. **********Another of those freed, Dr. Bahbah said, was Therese Halasse, whom he identified as a hijacker of a Sabena airliner to Israel in 1972. The editor's information could not be confirmed. **********Other Palestinian journalists reported the release of three of the four P.L.O. terrorists who attacked a crowd of Jewish worshipers in Hebron in 1980, killing 6 and wounding 16. Those freed were said to include Adnan Jaber, the squad's commander, who was trained in the Soviet Union. Israeli officials would not comment on the reports. **********The P.L.O. archives, which were captured when the Israeli Army entered West Beirut in September 1982, were turned over to the Red Cross, the army said. **********The head of the P.L.O.'s research center in Beirut, Sabry Juryis, had said the files contained only historical information on Arab families and villages in pre-1948 Palestine, and he said that microfilms had been made of everything except some old and valuable books. **********The Israelis have said that the research center was less an academic than an intelligence organization, and that much of the data could be used in planning terrorist attacks. **********In any event, Israel's concessions caused considerable pain here. ''It hurt to see the terrorists climb the Air France gangway,'' said General Yaron, ''because I know how much it has cost us to bring the terrorists to Ansar or to Israeli prisons.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/26/business/company-reports-acme-united-corp.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-04-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 35, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "** Company Reports ** ACME UNITED CORP", "print_headline": "** Company Reports ** ACME UNITED CORP", "body_text": " **********Qtr to April 1 1983 1982 Sales 10,531,363 8,818,672 Net inc 640,078 512,799 Share earns .27 .21 Results are for 13 weeks in the latest first quarter and 12 weeks in the year-ago first quarter."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/04/world/around-the-world-forces-in-zimbabwe-searching-for-rebels.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-01-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 79, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Forces in Zimbabwe Searching for Rebels", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Forces in Zimbabwe Searching for Rebels", "body_text": " **********Thousands of troops and policemen using armored cars, helicopter gunships and planes are combing western Zimbabwe for armed rebels in the biggest military operation since the war for black rule ended three years ago. **********The rebels, believed to be former guerrillas loyal to Joshua Nkomo, the opposition leader, have killed 12 people, including two children, and wounded at least 21 in ambushes since Dec. 21, the authorities say."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/03/world/us-eases-some-curbs-against-poland.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-11-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 538, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. EASES SOME CURBS AGAINST POLAND", "print_headline": "U.S. EASES SOME CURBS AGAINST POLAND", "body_text": " **********The White House announced today what it called ''two limited steps'' easing the economic sanctions against Poland imposed in the days after the imposition of martial law in December 1981.

FUND GROUP", "body_text": " **********Beginning in 1940, salesmen from Investors Diversified Services Inc. fanned out through America, urging people to save for their future by buying mutual funds. The pitch worked, and through the 1960's and early 1970's the company was the nation's largest mutual fund group. **********I.D.S., the main subsidiary of the Alleghany Corporation, ultimately lost that distinction when it failed to keep pace in a rapidly evolving financial world. But now the American Express Company, in buying Alleghany's businesses, is adding a financial services concern that some analysts think has successfully diversified into insurance and may be on the rebound. **********''I think it's a dynamic company,'' said Michael A. Lipper of Lipper Analytical Services, which follows mutual funds. However, in a reference to the brokerage arm of American Express, he added: ''It's not as entrepreneurial as Shearson.'' **********American Express yesterday announced that it would issue common stock, worth $1.01 billion at yesterday's closing price, to buy two Alleghany businesses: Investors Diversified Services, the main attraction to American Express, and MSL Industries, a steel products company. 13 Employees at Headquarters **********Alleghany, which has only 13 employees at its New York headquarters and has always been very decentralized, will continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange, although virtually its only assets, at least for the time being, would consist of 15.25 million shares of American Express. **********Last year, Alleghany reported net income of $62.8 million, or $6.38 a share, down from $68.1 million, or $6.47, in 1981. Revenue slipped to $1.35 billion, from $1.37 billion. Financial services contributed 71 percent of revenues and 95 percent of profits. **********I.D.S., based in Minneapolis, runs 14 mutual funds with total assets of $9 billion, and manages another $4.1 billion in pension money. It also has $13.5 billion worth of insurance in force, and outstanding investment certificates with a face value of $2.5 billion. **********Investment certificates were the company's original product, first sold in 1894. People would invest a certain amount of money and be able to cash in the certificate 10 to 50 years later for the principal, plus a fixed amount interest. But their popularity has declined because of changes in tax rules. **********Despite its years of leadership, I.D.S. today ranks only eighth in mutual fund assets - both stock and money market funds - according to the Investment Company Institute. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc., for comparison, runs stock and money market mutual funds with more than four times the assets in the I.D.S. funds. Slow to Change **********Although all mutual funds took a beating during the slow stock market of the late 1970's, I.D.S. in particular lost ground when it was slow to diversify into money market funds, which attracted billions of dollars because of their high return, Mr. Lipper said. **********In addition, he said, I.D.S.'s mutual funds had not been ''super performers'' in recent years. But recently, the company's newer funds that invest aggressively in small growth companies have done well, Mr. Lipper said. I.D.S. which lost money on its mutual fund operation as recently as 1981, is now showing a profit in that area. **********The company has also suffered because it has been slow to lower the fees that it charged investors to join its funds. In an age when many funds charge no such fees, I.D.S. charged up to 8 percent as late as last week, when it finally lowered the rate to a maximum of 5 percent. **********Analysts, though, said the company has been quicker to pick up on its middle-class clientele's developing taste for a variety of insurance policies. **********''I think they've made an improvement in their product line,'' said Gary E. Fegley of the annuity-insurance department of Dain Bosworth Inc., a Minneapolis brokerage firm. He noted the addition of annuities and term life insurance. **********The company also offers American Express a sales force trained to sell a wide variety of products. I.D.S. says its prime customers today are those earning between $30,000 and $75,000 a year. Serving them are 4,484 salesmen working out of 160 offices in every state but Alaska."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/14/business/company-news-ford-splits-shares-and-raises-payout.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-10-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 351, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ford Splits Shares And Raises Payout", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Ford Splits Shares And Raises Payout", "body_text": " **********The Ford Motor Company, citing a favorable outlook in the auto industry, said today that it is raising the quarterly dividend on its common stock by 15 cents, to 45 cents a share. **********The company also announced a 3-for-2 stock split, which will be in the form of a 50 percent stock dividend. Both the stock split and the dividend increase will be payable Dec. 1 to shareholders of record Nov. 1. **********Ford said the 45-cent dividend will be based on current shares, so the fourth-quarter cash payout will be the equivalent of 30 cents a share after the stock split. Ford will have about 181.5 million shares of common stock outstanding after the split, compared with about 121.1 million now, the auto maker said. **********''The stock dividend is expected to broaden interest in Ford shares,'' Philip Caldwell, Ford's chairman, said in a statement.

One outsider who has viewed a reel of new television commercials, and some recent print advertising, would say Yes. **********Generally, even to a non-professional, they do seem relevant, they do contain elements of the unexpected and they are expertly made. And those were exactly the qualities he told his troops that he was looking for when he took over as executive vice president and executive creative director almost two years ago. **********New Yorkers are not aware of a lot of the advertising, because it is running out of town. For example, there are a couple of spots for Serengeti and Chameleon, the two new lines of Sunglasses by Corning, its first entry in the field. These spots do have a European look, and Len Sugarman is importing European directors. **********Then there are the spots for Miss Clairol; Frito-Lay's O'Grady potato chips and Grandma's cookies; Sunkist Orange Juice and Sunkist Fruit Rolls for Lipton, and one you might have seen, the public service commercial for the Boy Scouts, which shows a woeful-looking youngster being stripped of all of his merit badges. **********The reel also included the first TV commercial for Bermuda, which will probably run only on cable in the Northeast.  The print exposition included a magazine effort for Western Electric with particlarly strong graphics, and the TDI, or commuterline, posters for U.S. News & World Report. **********Also included was the ''Locker Room'' campaign for Kent that unites a couple of Kent brands whose previously independent dramatic advertising, Mr. Sugarman said, failed to create an image of the smoker that in turn becomes the image of the brand. Case in point: the Marlboro cowboy. One of the past Kent efforts was that strange combination of food and butts, which could have been called the Kents-on-a-roll campaign. **********The tall, heavy-set executive said that, until recently, he was ashamed to show the New York office's advertising product. Now things have obviously changed. It wasn't easy. **********One of his first moves - in November 1981 - was an announced ban on 10 of the more popular forms of television advertising. ''I want you all to understand that derivative advertising, formula advertising, may be good enough to score in research, but it will not score with me. I will not approve it,'' he wrote. **********That pronouncement led to the departure of some of the work force, contributing to a drop to 45 on the staff, from more than 65.  Mr. Sugarman, who was telling his tale in his little conference room jam-packed with audio-visual equipment, said that before he could really get his new broom in operation he had to do a lot of missionary work among the clients, who in the long run would have to give the final approval. **********''Some just didn't go for it,'' he said, noting that he thinks that this was at least partially responsible for Plough and Life Savers removing themselves from the client list. But Clairol, for the first time in 30 years, went into the marketplace with a TV commercial that wasn't put through any copy-testing procedure. No small victory. **********It's been a tough couple of years and the 43-year-old Mr. Sugarman is quick to acknowledge it. Not quite like just switching jobs back in London town. Here he had the extra chore of absorbing the competitive atmosphere. That meant a lot of overtime laboring. **********But, using his London experience as a guide, he is quite explicit about setting September 1984 as the time when his turnaround job will be finished. By that time his people, he promised, will have won their share of creative awards, proving to clients that that which was said to be creative is indeed creative. **********Len Sugarman is in New York because he helped make the London office F.C.& B.'s best office in terms of growth, profitability, new business acquisition and creativity. And, he said, his management in the world's eighth-largest agency is among those who believe that the future of the business will see a few huge multinational agencies dominate. They intend to be one of them. **********Most multinational companies are American, and most of them are New York-based.

Andropov, the Soviet leader, had survived the incident, along with what one television commentator called ''the structure of detente.''  Soviet Silent on Boycott **********Meanwhile, the Soviet press continuted to withhold any mention of an international air boycott that has been announced by numerous Western pilots associations and air controllers. **********Western diplomats here said the Soviet assessment seemed to be that Western reaction would be confined to an air boycott of limited time, and that Mr. Andropov would soon be able to resume efforts to put the Reagan Administration on the defensive on other issues, primarily nuclear weapons.  The Soviet leader's continued silence on the downing of the airliner tended to support this interpretation. The defense of Soviet actions has been left mainly to a Government statement and to a news conference by Marshal Nikolai V. Ogarkov, chief of the armed forces' general staff. Although Mr. Andropov was reported to have broken off a vacation and returned to Moscow to manage the crisis, he has said nothing about it publicly. **********Diplomats here believed that this was likely to have been an effort to isolate Mr. Andropov personally from the damage sustained by the Soviet Union internationally.   Moscow May Have Been Informed **********It was noted by diplomats here that Marshal Ogarkov's explanations of how the decision was reached to shoot down the airliner did not rule out the possibility that the leadership in Moscow knew of the airliner's intrusion before it was shot down. **********The Marshal told the news conference that the decision to destroy the airliner was taken by a commander of the air defense district in the Far East under standing orders empowering him to destroy intruding aircraft. When asked whether Moscow was informed before or after the plane was shot down, he gave no direct reply but answered: ''At an apropriate time.'' **********After Marshal Ogarkov's effort to prove that the airliner was spying, three pilots involved in intercepting it were interviewed on television on Saturday and claimed that they, too, were convinced that it was on an intelligence mission.   General Appears on TV **********The only elaboration on this came from a general who appeared on television today to repeat the contention that it was impossible for Soviet pilots or ground tracking stations to distinguish between the Boeing 747 and a RC-135 spy plane, a version of the Boeing 707 that the United States uses for intelligence-gathering. **********Another type of converted airliner used as an airborne command post is the E-4, a version of the Boeing 747. However, theere has never been any mention of this plane by the Soviet Union. **********Col. Gen. Nikolai V. Moskvitelev, deputy commander in chief for aviation of the Air Defense Forces, who oversees fighter operations, said that the 747 and the RC-135 are ''of one type'' and could not have been distinguished by Soviet officers monitoring the 747 on radar. **********''They have an identical form and geometrical dimension,'' General Moskvitelev said. ''They have identical flight speeds. They can be distinguished in the air visually only by day and at a close distance. To do this at night is impossible.''  Western Attaches Astonished **********The statement astonished Western air attaches, who noted that the 747 is much larger than the RC-135 and has a dome in its forward fuselage. **********One British officer said: ''It may be impossible for a Russian pilot to tell the difference but I don't know of any other pilot in the world who would find it difficult.'' **********Like other Soviet statements, General Moskvitelev's remarks implied a degree of bungling by the Soviet air defenses, an unusual tack for the Kremlin, which generally presents the armed forces as highly efficient. **********This has led some diplomats to wonder whether the Kremlin's approach has not been to deflect allegations of aerial murder by imputing a degree of confusion to the air defenses that was greater than actually occurred. **********''Let's imagine the worst case,'' one diplomat said, ''that they knew it was the Korean 747, that they realized it was carrying several hundred passengers, and that somehow the word came down from Moscow to shoot it down anyay. **********''Once they realized the enormity of it, you could hypothesize that they decided it was better to let a local commander and a bunch of pilots take the heat than to admit that the blunder was approved at the top,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/28/business/bruno-s-inc-reports-earnings-for-14-weeks-to-jan-1.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-01-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 67, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRUNO'S INC reports earnings for 14 weeks to Jan 1", "print_headline": "BRUNO'S INC reports earnings for 14 weeks to Jan 1", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/27/world/giscard-received-by-reagan-for-talk-on-the-missile-issue.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-07-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 102, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Giscard Received by Reagan For Talk on the Missile Issue", "print_headline": "Giscard Received by Reagan For Talk on the Missile Issue", "body_text": " **********Former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing of France told President Reagan today that the Atlantic allies must keep pressing for arms control after new medium-range missiles are deployed in Western Europe later this year. **********The meeting was in the Oval Office. **********The former French leader said he had also talked with Mr. Reagan about the world economic situation, praising the President for backing an increase in contributions to the International Monetary Fund. **********Mr. Giscard d'Estaing met with Mr. Reagan, Vice President Bush and Secretary of State George P.

But they are worried about the future. **********''The Nicaraguans, who realize that the smartest thing in the world for them to do is act responsibly, have been making their payments on time,'' said a senior vice president for a major consumer products company, who asked not to be identified. **********And American bankers, who are gathering with their European and Canadian counterparts in Panama today and are expected to approve the rescheduling of $180 million in Nicaraguan short-term debt, characterize the Nicaraguan Government's approach to its financial problems as pragmatic. **********Every year since 1980 various parts of what is estimated to be $900 million in foreign debt has been rescheduled. And until last March, when the Government missed a $4 million payment, the debt payments had been made on time. **********Still, business executives say they are concerned about the possibility that the Reagan Administration's hostility to the Nicaraguan Government could unleash an outpouring of anti-American sentiment. **********And they say they are concerned about a marked shift in the direction of Nicaragua's trade toward a variety of other nations, including many in the Communist bloc. **********The banks say that Washington has applied no direct pressure to private financial institutions to stop lending to Nicaragua. But given the relative small size of Nicaragua's debt, its economic prospects and the country's refusal to go to the International Monetary Fund for assistance, no pressure has been required. **********''The banks are looking at a hostile United States policy vis- a-vis Nicaragua, and that tells them that the economy will deteriorate,'' said Richard Feinberg, a senior fellow at the Overseas Development Council in Washington. ''At this point, any other sort of signal is not really necessary.'' **********With the exception of some guaranteed, pre-export credit deals that were made last year, Nicaragua has received no fresh bank loans since 1979. Sugar Quota Cut **********The Administration's move in May to cut by nearly 90 percent the amount of sugar Nicaragua could sell in the United States illustrates how the Administration's actions narrow the banks' search for solutions.  That decision was taken a day after commercial bank lenders gathered in New York on May 8 to to meet with top Nicaraguan finance officials, including Luis Enrique Figueroa, president of the central bank. **********''They told us that since the beginning of 1983 they had experienced a number of financial difficulties, including floods, with damages as high as $500 million, and drought, which had hurt the cotton and sugar cane crops,'' said a banker who was at the meeting. ''And the invasion by Somosista forces had cost the Government about $58 million in damages and additional purchases through April.'' **********Largely as a result of those factors, last month Mr. Figueroa told bankers that Nicaragua would miss a $45 million payment due in July on its private bank debt, and requested that debt payments be suspended until June 1984. **********''This request hardly falls under the definition of a moratorium,'' the banker said. But he admitted that ''many moons shall pass before they can start servicing their debt again. There is no question that the suspension of the sugar quota, which provided Nicaragua with anywhere from $45 million to $60 million in foreign exchange, has been a blow.'' **********American companies have a similar view of the future. 'Economic Aid is Needed' **********''Companies with operations in the region are intensely anti-Communist, but there is a feeling that what Reagan is doing is not good for business, and that economic aid is needed down there,'' said Gary L. Springer, an analyst who tracks developments in Nicaragua for the Business International Corporation, a research, publishing and consulting firm. ''Businessmen are worried that they will end up bearing the brunt of an invasion.'' **********At the end of 1981, the most recent figures available, the Commerce Department put the level of direct foreign investment by American companies in Nicaragua at $87 million. Interviews with executives from several companies with operations in Nicaragua suggest that, in spite of their problems with local businessmen, the Sandinista Government has maintained good relations with foreign investors. **********But since the leftist government came to power in 1979, it has been seeking diversification of trading partners. Treasury and State Department officials could not provide any statistics on the size of the bilateral trade, but Inforpress CentroAmericana, a newsletter published in Guatemala that tracks economic and political trends in the region, estimated that in 1982, Nicaraguan exports to the Communist bloc amounted to 6 percent of the total, nearly triple what they were two years earlier. By contrast, exports to the United States amounted to 24 percent of the total, a slide of 6 percentage points from 1980 levels. **********''A couple of our people were in Nicaragua recently and were surprised with the extent the shelves in stores will filled with Eastern goods,'' the consumer products executive said.

Finkelstein, chairman and chief executive, said before the company's annual meeting that if the sales trend continued, profits in the second quarter, ending Jan. 28, would improve ''significantly'' from the year before. **********He said at the meeting that Macy's first Florida store, in North Miami Beach, will have first-year sales of about $55 million, ''well above our plan,'' and that the company will proceed with its program of opening 10 stores in Florida and Texas by the end of the decade."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/05/business/the-market-s-little-winners.html": {"writer_name": "Fay Joyce", "pub_date": "1983-05-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1114, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MARKET'S LITTLE WINNERS", "print_headline": "THE MARKET'S LITTLE WINNERS", "body_text": " **********When the stock market began climbing last August like an inspired mountain goat, Carol A. Ruth didn't rush right out and buy something. In fact, she waited until April before making her choices. **********''Three weeks ago I bought 100 shares of Chrysler at 20,'' said Miss Ruth, the senior vice president of a Manhattan public relations firm. ''It's about 26 now, which isn't a lot, but I think it's terrific.'' She laughed in describing her $600 profit, adding, ''I'm excited.'' **********Miss Ruth confided her success as she stopped by the Merrill Lynch Investment Information Center on the concourse of Grand Central Terminal. The glass booth is situated almost directly under Taurus, the bull that is part of the constellation decorating the concourse ceiling. And even at 2:15 on a recent afternoon, it was too crowded with people checking on their stocks for the investor to squeeze in. **********''Look at this, everybody's here all of a sudden,'' she said.  The crowd has indeed grown, according to Steven Mekler, a Merrill Lynch account executive, and many who find their way there tell stories that surpass Miss Ruth's. **********In all, she and the rest of the nation's 30 million shareholders have earned about $500 billion in the stock **********Stocks went up yesterday, with the Dow gaining 4.64 points, to close at 1,212.65. Page D10. market over the last year, according to the Wilshire Associates' 5,000 Equity Index. And much of that new wealth was created since Aug. 13, when the Dow Jones average began its ascent. **********''It's great,'' William Martin said of the rally. The Bronxville salesman bought 125 shares of Sears at $15 and saw the price rise as high as $42.125. He is holding that stock and others and building a nest egg. ''I'm looking for long-term growth, and then I'll reinvest that money,'' he said. **********Thomas Aylward of Westchester said that he had made $40,000 in the rally, buying mutual funds as well as individual stocks. One stock that has performed well is A.T.& T. ''A couple of years ago I bought 400 shares at 42,'' he recalled. ''Now it's at 67. That's $25 profit a share.'' **********For Rodolfo Lopez, a retired mechanic from Puerto Rico, the rally has translated into a $10,000 profit on one stock alone, that of the Masco Corporation, which makes faucets and other products. A conservative man who started with utilities stock 20 years ago, Mr.  Lopez will hold on to what he has. ''I just pick stocks and invest and happen to be lucky,'' he said. **********Like poker players shrugging off a bad hand, several investors saw Monday's dip in the market as temporary and predicted the Dow would reach 1,500 or 1,700 in time. **********''I think there's a long way to go,'' said Keith L. Stransky, the research director for a Connecticut financial consulting firm. He said he had nearly doubled his money, to $10,000, since the rally began and had sold very little. ''I bought 100 shares of General Nutrition before the rally at around 11 7/8 and sold it recently at 25,'' he said. ''It's now at 48, but we won't talk about that,'' he added, laughing. **********This is the most money Mr. Stransky, 31 years old, has ever made in the market, and he's glad to see it. ''I had lost a lot of money before,'' he said. ''I was down $5,000. Now I'm up $5,000.'' **********Chandrasen Shah is also putting his money back in the market. An unemployed accountant and bookkeeper who lives in Queens, Mr. Shah estimates he has made $5,000 to $10,000 during the rally, chiefly on I.B.M., Digital and Honeywell. He said he has used some of it to pay his living expenses, however. ''If I had money I could make money,'' he said, voicing a common lament. **********At least Mr. Shah has been coming out ahead. Leaning on the outside of the Merrill Lynch booth, Thomas J. Corrigan forlornly disclosed that he had lost $7,000 by buying put options -a speculative technique that can produce profits when stock prices are falling. He bet the wrong way on I.B.M. and on Delta. ''I made more in the bear market than the bull market, can you imagine that?'' the liquor salesman marveled. ''I've watched this rally very closely so when the next one comes I'll be ready.'' **********As she licked yogurt from a pink plastic spoon, Maryellen Moll calculated that she and her husband had made $4,000 in the rally, with all of the profit still on paper. ''My family's always bought stock,'' she said. ''It makes for good conversation at Thanksgiving dinner.'' **********James Caruso converted his paper profits to something more material. He opened his own import-export company a month ago with the aid of $10,000 he had made in the market. Some of the money came from 200 shares of American Airlines stock, which he said he bought at $18 and sold at $27.50. He also bought 10 contracts for call options on E.F. Hutton at $2.50 and sold them at $8. **********Hutton's gain, along with that of other brokerage stocks, is one reflection of the new business the rally has brought in. At Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., Richard D. Berlin said that people who had pulled out of the market were coming back. In addition, said Mr. Berlin, the Penn Plaza office manager, accounts are being opened by first-time investors. **********The insiders have their own stories to tell. Robert L. Grossmann, who recommends stocks at the brokerage Cantor, Fitzgerald & Company in Beverly Hills, Calif., has seen his choices go up 80 percent in price since he joined the firm in mid-June. **********Mr. Grossmann said he bought 10,000 shares of the First Executive Corporation himself at $8.50; it is now at $22, for a $135,000 paper profit. ''That's not unusual in today's market,'' he said. **********Then there is Gordon Yale, secretary-treasurer of the Janus Fund, a Denver mutual fund. Mr. Yale said the stock held by the fund had gone up 71 percent since the rally began, outstripping the Dow's 60 percent. But he himself has had no such luck. **********''Here I am in the mutual fund business, and except for two months I haven't had a nickel in the market,'' he lamented. ''Two guys in the office bought Hyde tennis shoe in July at $6 and the last time I looked, it was selling at $42, and I missed that.

American Bell Inc. will open for business today with 28,000 employees working in 700 buildings. **********Such a grand beginning is appropriate for a company that is opening a new era of competition in the telephone business.  American Bell, a subsidiary of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, was established to market telephone equipment and computerized services at unregulated prices. It is expected to bring a vast array of products to market, from office computers to computerized department store systems, able to handle such tasks as bridal registry. **********Starting today, consumers wanting telephones and other phone equipment will buy them from either American Bell or one of its competitors. The local telephone companies, such as New York Telephone and New Jersey Bell, will no longer provide equipment for lease under state regulation, once their current inventories run out. **********Competitors Have Doubts **********For the new company's competitors, the birth of American Bell, once known as Baby Bell, is also momentous. American Bell, because of its large size and the backing of its giant parent, will be a potent market force. **********But there are risks for the company, too. Indeed, as ribbon-cutting time drew near, an industry that at first had feared the coming of Baby Bell was expressing some doubt that the new subsidiary would be successful. **********Precisely because of its huge size, American Bell must do extremely well to become profitable. It is also unclear whether an offshoot of a regulated monopoly will be agile enough to compete in the open market. **********''It's like trying to turn around a 500-pound marshmallow,'' said one A.T.& T. marketing official who recently left the company. Harry Newton, president of the Telecom Library, a publisher of telecommunications information, agreed: ''I think it's the greatest gamble in American history. I think there's a very serious question about whether they will make it.'' Moving Into a New Field **********American Bell's formation is the result of a 1980 order of the Federal Communications Commission. The decision allowed A.T.& T. to enter the data-processing industry and to sell telephone equipment and computers if it set up a separate, arms-length subsidiary to insure that the business would not be subsidized by local phone service, which continues to be a regulated monopoly. **********That decision is not related to the settlement of the Federal antitrust suit, announced last January, that will cause A.T.& T. to divest itself of its local operating companies by Jan.1, 1984. **********The need for a separate subsidiary meant that the new company had to be started from scratch. Some 700 office sites had to be found for the company, since American Bell employees could not share buildings with the rest of A.T.& T. Separate computer systems to handle billing and payroll had to be established, and new phones ordered for everyone. **********Such a huge task met with some unexpected difficulties. For example, the New England Telephone Company demanded a deposit before beginning phone service for American Bell, despite the fact that both companies are part of A.T.& T. Headquarters in New Jersey **********Because of its quick formation, American Bell could not find one building big enough for the head offices of the company and its divisions. So the company's headquarters will be in Morris Township, N.J.; the consumer products division, which will handle sales to residences and small businesses, will be in nearby Parsippany, and the advanced information systems division, handling sales to larger businesses, will be in Morristown, N.J. **********To complicate matters further, about six weeks ago officials of Morris Township changed the name of the street where the headquarters will be located. Fortunately, the company had not yet printed a lot of stationery, said Robert E. McNulty, vice president of corporate planning and operations for American Bell. **********American Bell officials, however, say the organizing is just about finished. ''I certainly think we're ready, absolutely without question,'' said Randall L. Tobias, president of the consumer products division. The company was apparently ready enough that Charles Marshall, chief executive of American Bell, and Archie J.  McGill, president of the advanced information systems division, were taking vacations last week. Deficits at First **********Whether the company is ready to compete is another question. With 28,000 employees and no customers, it is certain to start out losing large sums of money. Ivan L. Wolff, who follows A.T.& T. for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, estimates that losses in the first year might reach $500 million. **********But the company will have great resources to draw on. Baby Bell officials hope it will reach about $2 billion annual revenues in either its first or second year. Its capital expenditures between 1983 and 1985 will be $5.1 billion, with most of that coming from its parent. And A.T.& T., which is expected to report 1982 revenues of about $65 billion and profits of more than $7 billion, is able to absorb the losses and investments without too much pain. **********American Bell would be helped greatly if the F.C.C. agreed to A.T.& T.'s request to transfer the equipment now being leased to customers by the local Bell operating companies to American Bell. That would give American Bell a huge customer base and source of revenues. The F.C.C. is expected to act on the request in the next few months. **********American Bell will be relying on the vast research expertise of Bell Laboratories and the manufacturing capability of the Western Electric Company, which are other subsidiaries of A.T.& T. **********One new service offered by American Bell is a sophisticated datacommunications network called Net 1000. If successful, it will cut sharply into the International Business Machines Corporation's grip on corporate data processing. But the network had been announced several years ago, only to be withdrawn when Bell could not get it to work. Even if it is successful this time, it will not be a significant contributor to profits for years, according to Harry Edelson, an analyst with First Boston Corporation. Fighting for PBX Sales **********More crucial will be the market for business switchboards, or PBX's. American Bell has already started to test its new computerized PBX, the Antelope, in the field. The model will be able to handle data as well as voices. The company's current product, the Dimension, has been steadily losing market share to aggressive companies such as Rolm, Northern Telecom and Mitel. **********American Bell also has developed a super-minicomputer that could put the company into competition with manufacturers such as Digital Equipment. It is not clear in what form the product will be marketed, however. The company also is looking at office work stations - desktop machines that are combinations of computers and telephones and are able to handle such tasks as electronic mail and word processing. American Bell officials have made it clear that they will lean toward marketing complete automation and communications systems for offices. **********On the residential side, the company will inherit 461 of A.T.& T.'s 1,500 Phonecenter stores. It has also arranged to sell phones through Sears, Roebuck. In the next two weeks, American Bell will announce other retailing arrangements and a new line of sophisticated electronic telephones. The Marketing Challenge **********Despite the companies' vast resources, some analysts question the ability of American Bell, Bell Labs and Western Electric to get products to market fast enough. **********''They research things to death,'' said George M. Pfister, a former A.T.& T. marketing official who is now president of Perspective Telecommunications Group, a Paramus, N.J., consulting firm. ''It is an incredible place to get a decision made.'' **********There are already areas where A.T.& T. has had to look outside for products, analysts say.  The Bell operating companies have been ordering central office switches, the machines which route telephone calls, from Northern Telecom because they got tired of waiting for Western Electric's own new switch. And American Bell announced it would sell a voice mail system -which allows voice messages to be stored in a computer and transmitted at a later time - made by I.B.M., which is expected to be its biggest rival."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/12/business/iranian-compensation.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-07-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 53, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Iranian Compensation", "print_headline": "Iranian Compensation", "body_text": " **********Iran has paid the Bridgestone Tire Company Ltd. and the Marubeni Corporation a total of five billion yen as compensation for nationalization of their jointly owned Iranian concern - Bridgestone Iran Company Ltd. - and as repayment of loans made to it by them, Iranian Embassy sources said today."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/15/world/thatcher-victory-on-fleet-street.html": {"writer_name": "R.

No such discussions took place during Mrs. Thatcher's first term, and Mr. Murray considered it folly to persist in that attitude for five more years.

Key Test of the Laws **********The Shah case, which began on a very small scale far from the big papers of Fleet Street, has become the key test of the new laws and of the response to them by the militant but hard-pressed unions. **********After his defeat in the employment committee, Mr. Murray began an all- out effort to persuade his organization's general council to reverse the committee's decision. Left-wing, anti- Murray unions also organized furiously, and some of them suggested that Mr. Murray would be ousted unless he won the crucial council vote. **********He did so this afternoon, by a vote of 29 to 21, after a meeting that began with National Graphical Association demonstrators jeering right-wing officials as they entered the meeting room and continued for more than six tumultuous hours. The printers would be supported, Mr. Murray said later, only if such assistance ''does not involve the general council in unlawful action.'' **********Joe Wade, the printers' leader, reacted furiously to the decision. He said his union and all other British trade unions had been ''sold down the river'' by Mr. Murray. He said that today ''was a black day in the long and glorious history of trade unionism,'' and added, ''We are being offered tea and sympathy, and nothing more than that.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/15/business/briefs-166190.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-09-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 563, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Debt Issues **********Circle K Corp. filed an offering of $40 million of convertible subordinated debentures due in 2003 through Bear, Stearns & Co. *********** Clark Equipment Co.  is offering $75 million of 13 percent notes due in 1993 through Goldman, Sachs & Co.

Shad, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, today urged approval of a bill that would allow assessment of triple damages for insider trading violations. **********But Mr. Shad indicated to the House Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Finance that he could accept important changes that might weaken the proposal that the commission voted to support last year. **********The changes involve inserting a definition of insider trading, which could narrow the scope of prosecutions, and stiffening the legal standard for proving the charge of insider trading. The possible shift in position caught some subcommittee members by surprise. **********Despite these differences, commission officials; members of the subcommittee, whose chairman is Representative Timothy E. Wirth, Democrat of Colorado, and industry representatives all agreed that raising the penalties for insider trading was necessary. **********''Despite vigorous enforcement efforts, insider trading continues because it presents an opportunity to reap huge profits with little risk,'' Mr. Shad said. ''We must provide a sufficient deterrent,'' Mr. Wirth said, ''so that people will think twice before they engage in what all of us would call thievery.'' **********Insider trading involves the improper use of corporate information, such as data on earnings or dividends, or market information, such as knowing of a takeover attempt or tender offer, to buy or sell stocks to make a profit or avoid a loss. **********Under current law and regulations, the S.E.C. can bring a civil enforcement action against an individual but can force him only to disgorge the profits made on the use of the insider information. This proposal would allow the commission to seek penalties up to three times the profit from the insider trading. **********Mr. Shad, in explaining his willingness to consider changes, said that people in the industry had raised serious questions about the proposal since the commission endorsed it last fall. He also contended that his was standing behind the original proposal. But Mr. Wirth said, ''We're seeing some potential backsliding.'' No Exact Definition **********Mr. Shad, under questions from several committee members, agreed to work out a definition for insider trading that could be applied when the commission was seeking damages under the new triple-penalty proposal. Several representatives of industry, including a spokesman for the Securities Industry Association, also urged this approach, contending that, since these would be punitive damages, the definition should be very clear. Under current law, there is no exact definition except that based on decisions in the courts. **********Mr. Wirth, however, said this move to define insider trading was being advocated by ''a number of people out there who are going to make sure that, if there are treble damages, they will write a definition that will handcuff the S.E.C.'' and would ''raise the possibility of enormous loopholes.'' **********On the second key issue, John M. Fedders, director of the division of enforcement, said that he could accept a stiffer standard for proving insider trading. Currently, the commission must show ''a preponderance'' of evidence. The S.I.A. and others suggested that for the triple damamges the commission should have a standard of ''clear and convincing.'' **********But Bevis Longstreth, a commissioner who was asked to comment by Mr. Wirth, said that, ''if the Congress were now to increase the burden of proof for this violation,'' it would ''make it more difficult for the commission to succeed in this case.'' **********Mr. Wirth said that he expected to begin writing a bill in a month and would have one pased by the House this year. But the questions raised today, a key Senate aide said, may make it difficult to move quickly on a bill in the Senate."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/02/business/orion-research-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-june-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-08-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 34, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ORION RESEARCH INC reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "print_headline": "ORION RESEARCH INC reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/03/business/nu-west-cites-deficit-for-82.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-05-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 175, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Nu-West Cites Deficit for '82", "print_headline": "Nu-West Cites Deficit for '82", "body_text": " **********Nu-West Group Ltd., a Calgary, Alberta, real estate developer, today announced a large loss for 1982 and said it and its lenders had agreed that Nu-West would stop making interest and principal payments on $562 million of loans. **********The loss totaled $255.2 million, and followed a profit of $4.6 million, or 9 cents a share, for 1981. **********The 1982 loss included a $72.3 million write-down and a $66.3 million loss from Carma Ltd., a company in which Nu-West owns a 48.4 percent interest. **********Garnet Wells, vice president, said the lenders' formal agreement comes in the wake of Nu-West's inability to repay either principal or interest since Oct. 31, 1982.

Military Seeks Immunity **********But the military is seeking to protect itself from future prosecution over the reported disappearance of more than 6,000 people in the hands of state security forces, plus the thousands of others who were killed or tortured. **********The junta refers to the amnesty in communiques as the Law of Pacification, a name that the opposition widely sees as an implicit threat of a coup if it is not accepted. About the only people the law would pacify, opposition leaders have said, is the military. **********''Peace will be impossible if immunity is granted to those responsible for terrorism by the state,'' the human rights groups said in a joint statement calling the march. Among the groups were the Center for Legal and Social Studies, the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, and the Permanent Assembly for Human Rights. **********''It must be the first time in the history of law that those accused of a crime enact a law absolving themselves,'' Ernesto Sabato, one of Argentina's leading writers, told reporters, voicing what appears to be a common sentiment held by many intellectuals.   Terms of Amnesty Law **********The wording of the proposed amnesty has yet to be made final, according to the junta. But Argentine military sources said it would likely apply to all servicemen, police and intelligence agents acting under orders in the anti- terrorist campaign. It would also include the commanders who issued the orders. **********The sources said there may be some clause allowing for prosecution, possibly by military courts, of unsanctioned excesses, such as stealing from the homes of the disappeared. **********Maj. Gen. Llamil Reston, the Interior Minister, told some opposition leaders three weeks ago that between 150 and 200 members of the armed forces were already in jail for such excesses, but he declined to give any other details. **********The proposed law would also probably free a number of convicted or suspected terrorists, the sources said. According to General Reston, 360 convicted people are in jail for terrorist-related crimes, and 185 suspected terrorist are being held without charges. Abroad, he said, there were 216 people convicted of terrorist-related crimes and another almost 3,000 people who could be charged if they returned. **********Almost all of the country's leading presidential contenders have said that, if elected, they will annul the amnesty. **********While all branches of the armed forces agree some form of legal protection is needed, divisions among them over how it should be carried out have delayed the issuing of the law for months, the military sources said. **********The navy is said to oppose releasing convicted terrorists, while the air force favors waiting to try to negotiate the amnesty with the newly elected Government before it takes office.

For the third time in as many weeks, stock market indicators finished Friday at record highs. **********As the week's main feature, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 29.90 points, to 1,226.20. Volume averaged 101 million shares daily on the New York Stock Exchange. The starting point for this rally - whose unflagging strength has amazed amateurs and professionals alike - was a close at 776.92 last Aug. 12. **********Trading has acquired a rather distinct pattern in recent sessions.  Stocks often moved erratically early in the day, only to finish with a burst of energy and higher prices. **********Basically, the stock market remains engaged in a variant of demandpull inflation, a process economists define as too much money chasing too few goods. On Wall Street, too much money - or excessive liquidity, to use a currently fashionable term - has been chasing too few stocks. The stock market's chase will end, temporarily at least, when investors and traders run out of money to spend - or decide to do something else with their cash. **********In fact, almost the worst thing that could happen to the equity market now is a roaring business recovery that channels liquidity into other areas and, at the same time, causes interest rates to rise. **********''Liquid funds seeking the best return in a declining-interestrate, excess-plant-capacity world seek out higher returns from longer-term financial assets,'' according to Robert J.  Farrell, head of Merrill Lynch's market analysis department. ''This is why demand for stocks - and bonds -has been so persistent.'' Predicting the Market 'Top' **********Like many another market professional, Roy M. Blumberg of A.G.  Becker-Paribas expressed frank amazement at the sheer upward momentum of stock prices in April. With a trace of wonderment in his voice, the technical analyst noted on Thursday that the Dow industrials had climbed about 100 points in 17 trading days, scarcely pausing along the way up. (On Friday, the average added nearly 7 points more to its tally.) **********In late March, for example, some money managers were predicting that stocks were likely to tumble in April, following portfolio switches made by pension fund and other institutional investors just prior to the end of the 1983 first quarter. Instead, prices dipped briefly in early April and then commenced their breathtaking ascent.  At the same time, contributions to I.R.A. and Keogh accounts by individual investors kept new cash flowing into equities. **********''What has kept sending the market higher is the basic investor fear of missing the bandwagon,'' Mr. Blumberg noted. ''Still, I think we'll start an intermediate decline within the next few weeks and could see the industrials drop perhaps 125 to 150 points. A classic 'blow-off' buying panic might trigger such a decline.'' **********But, like most market professionals, he is quite bullish for the long term. In fact, Mr. Blumberg is more optimistic than most other analysts. ''I expect the industrial average to reach a high between 1,600 and 1,700 before it finally tops out,'' he asserted. ''The market top should occur in late 1984 or early 1985.'' The G.E. Guessing Game **********On the final Friday in January 1983, General Electric's stock ''broke par,'' as they say in Wall Street, going over 100 for the first time. It traded as high as 100 3/4 before finishing at 99 5/8, up 4 3/8 points for that stirring session. The Dow industrials, which include G.E. as a component, closed the same day at 1,064.75. **********Propelling the stock was an agreement by G.E. to sell most of its Utah International subsidiary to the Broken Hill Proprietary Company of Australia for $2.4 billion in cash. The present expectation is that the deal will be consummated later this year. G.E. followers predicted that would swell the company's war chest of cash and marketable securities to around $5 billion. **********G.E. had expressed its intention to expand into high technology and other rapid-growth areas of the economy. Thus, as soon as the sale was announced, the guessing game began. What high-tech company might G.E. buy as its entrance fee into a new field? **********Last Wednesday, rumors flew that the target was the Data General Corporation, which makes general purpose computers and also does a bit of business with G.E. That day, Data General's stock jumped 10 1/4 points. On Thursday, after G.E. issued a categorical denial of any such plans, Data General dropped 6 3/8 points. **********G.E.'s shares, which traded last year as low as 55, finished the week at 111 7/8, up 2 3/4, while Data General closed at 66 5/8, up 3 1/4.

Ordinarily, such news would cause hardly a ripple in the vast sea of commerce in commodities. **********But from the moment the ship's manifest and ports of call were made known, the Satu Maru became a symbol of the plight of American agriculture and the cargo added a new dimension to the global banking crisis. **********The ship's cargo includes 10,730 metric tons of cottonseed oil bound for Memphis, where it will be processed by Hunt-Wesson Foods, a division of Norton Simon Inc., into cooking and salad oils and many other products. **********It will mark the first significant import of an agricultural product in which the nation has long been the dominant exporter. In the latest crop year ended last Sept. 30, for example, the United States exported 384,000 tons of cottonseed oil, or 77 percent of the total of 496,000 tons that was exported by producers worldwide. **********''The shipment is not only the ultimate insult to American farmers, but also to our nation's biggest industry -agribusiness,'' said Dwayne O. Andreas, chairman of the Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, the biggest processor of edible oils in the nation. **********Morton S. Sosland, publisher and editor of Milling & Baking News, a leading trade journal, said last week: ''I would compare the Satu Maru's voyage to a long string of freight cars moving flour to a baking company right here in Kansas City, which is in the midst of the biggest grain producing area in the country. **********''It is even more bizarre when one thinks of the billions of dollars being spent by Washington to bolster farm income by providing farmers, including those who grow cotton, with costly incentives to cut back their acreage this season and, at the same time, ignoring the dumping of foreign subsidized farm products on our markets.'' **********On April 1, shortly after the ''payment-in-kind'' and other programs aimed at sharply reducing planted acreage took form, the Federal Office of Mangement and Budget estimated that the programs would cost $21.8 billion during the fiscal year ending Sept. 30. A year ago, crop-loan and other programs were projected to cost $1.8 billion. Banks Said to Demand Exports **********However, Mr. Andreas of Archer-Daniel-Midland attributed the cause of the problem to banks locked into foreign loans they cannot collect, noting: **********''Our banks lend dollars to these nations to use in any way they see fit, and then these same banks demand that these countries export at any cost in order to earn dollars. **********''Given this situation, I see these indebted nations demanding that they be permitted to dump all kinds of goods here, claiming that they must have open access to our markets in order to raise the dollars to pay off their creditors. One doesn't have to be particularly bright to see where this could lead us.'' **********Mr. Andreas said the cottonseed deal was more than a ''coals-to-Newcastle'' affair, which he asserted would be both uneconomic and illogical were it not for the fact that Brazil can easily subsidize its exporters with cruzeiro it creates by fiat. **********The symbolism begins with the fact that the ship carrying the oil to Memphis is Japanese. Ten years ago this month, President Nixon embargoed all exports of soybeans and products including edible oil because his farm experts told him the crop that season would be insufficient for domestic needs. The 1973 crop proved more than adequate. Japanese Invest in Brazil **********The Japanese were shocked because they depend on soybean sauces as a major source of protein. They then invested heavily to vastly expand Brazil's soybean, cotton and other farm products, and that country is now the world's second-largest exporter of edible oils.  Japan is now investing additional large sums to expand Brazilian exportable oilseed and other crops. **********The Satu Maru's destination is also symbolic, Mr. Andreas noted, because Memphis has been a leading cotton market since the days when ''King Cotton'' was the nation's top cash crop. Today, cotton is the fourth major crop after corn, wheat and soybeans in that order. Much of the crop is now produced on irrigated acreage in California and Arizona as well as in the South's traditional Cotton Belt. **********''It is also symbolic,'' Mr. Andreas added, ''that the Satu Maru is due in Memphis on July 3, the day before our national holiday.'' Perhaps it is also symbolic that Mr. Andreas was chosen by President Reagan two weeks ago to be chairman of the International Private Enterprise Task Force. The group was formed last Nov. 20 to advise the President and various Federal agencies on how to implement the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, which is aimed at helping poorer countries improve their economic conditions by stimulating trade."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/07/world/independent-party-leads-in-turkey.html": {"writer_name": "Marvine Howe", "pub_date": "1983-11-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1067, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INDEPENDENT PARTY LEADS IN TURKEY", "print_headline": "INDEPENDENT PARTY LEADS IN TURKEY", "body_text": " **********An independent conservative party took a commanding lead early today over the military-backed party in Turkey's first general election since the armed forces seized power three years ago. **********The party in the lead in Sunday's election, the Motherland Party, is headed by Turgut Ozal, the chief architect of Turkey's economic recovery program. The party was leading in both rural and urban areas around the country. **********The liberal Populist Party, set up by a former civil servant, Necdet Calp, as a loyal opposition, was in second place, ahead of the military's favorite, the Nationalist Democracy Party, which is led by a retired general, Turgut Sunalp. **********With 85 percent of the vote counted, according to broadcasts early today, Mr. Ozal's Motherland Party was well ahead, with 44.8 percent of the vote. Mr. Calp's Populist Party had 30.5 percent and Mr. Sunalp's Nationalist Democracy Party had 23.5 percent.   Possible Blow to President **********If Mr. Ozal's party were to win, many officials have said it would be seen as a blow to the President, Gen. Kenan Evren, who in a pre-election speech clearly came out in support of Mr. Sunalp's party and was sharply critical of Mr. Ozal, although no names were mentioned. **********General Evren called a special session of the ruling National Security Council Sunday night. No details of what went on were made public. **********Despite rain, Turkish voters turned out in large numbers. Nearly 20 million people are eleigible to vote. **********The election was being held to elect a 400-member Parliament. Under the terms of a new Constitution approved last November, General Evren is to remain President. The candidate whose party wins a majority in Sunday's voting will become Prime Minister. **********Mr. Ozal, 56 years old, an engineer and former Deputy Prime Minister, is respected in international business and financial circles for his successful stabilization program. **********He was able to reduce Turkey's inflation rate from 120 percent in March 1980 to about 35 percent the next year. He also doubled the country's exports and ended widespread shortages. He fell out of favor with the military and resigned last year when interest rates shot upward.   A Show of Independence **********If Mr. Ozal wins, many Turkish politicians say, it will have been because of his his show of independence from the military, proven competence at the head of the economy, charismatic personality and good party organization. **********The election process has been carefully controlled from the outset. The country's two main parties, the conservative Justice Party and the moderate leftist Republican People's Party, have been abolished and their leaders, former Prime Ministers Suleyman Demirel and Bulent Ecevit, have been barred from politics for 10 years. **********Only 3 new parties out of 15 were allowed to take part in the election after the military screened their candidates and the founders and programs. **********The three-week election campaign was limited, from the size of buttons to the number of rallies. Even public- opinion polls were banned when it appeared that Mr. Ozal was well in the lead.   'Glad to Get Back' **********A civil servant said, explaining the large voter turnout, said, ''We've missed elections and are glad to get back to democracy.'' **********Another reason, he said, was the $10 fine for not voting. A friend added, ''We hope that with the help of God the new government will do more to solve our economic problems.'' **********The atmosphere at the polls was generally serious, and it was clear that, after three years of military rule, Turks consider voting an important event. **********In a tour of polling places in the capital and several outlying villages, there were no overt signs of attempts to influence the voters. There was no evidence of military presence near the polls. Turkish news agencies reported no incidents of any significance. **********Each voter was given a stamp that said ''Evet'' - ''Yes'' in Turkish and then went into a booth or an empty room, marked the party of his choice, folded the ballot and put it into an envelope and deposited it in a ballot box. **********The only irregularity observed was clearly unintentional, and in fact acted against the authorities. It was noted that if the ink on the stamp was still wet when the ballot was folded, more than one party would be marked, thereby invalidating the ballot. **********In a sampling of voters at the polls in well-to-do, middle-class and poor districts in Ankara and at several nearby villages, few people said they favored Mr. Sunalp's party.   Speech May Have Backfired **********Most said they supported Mr. Ozal's party, and several people in the poorer districts said they had voted for Mr. Calp. At least in the Ankara area, President Evren's pre-election speech in indirect support of Mr. Sunalp seemed to have backfired, as some businessmen, professional people and even civil servants said they had decided to vote for Mr. Ozal after General Evren's speech. **********In the fashionable neighborhood of Cankaya, where most of the members of the ruling military council live, some voters went out of their way to stress that their own parties were absent from the ballot and that they had voted for ''the least bad of the three'' or had voted for all the candidates, invalidating their ballots in protest. **********A senior civil servant, asked how he had voted, answered, ''Demirel.'' He said that since the Justice Party and its offshoot, the True Path Party, had been barred from the election, he had made up his own ballot with his candidate. Several university students and professionals voting in Cankaya said they had deliberately voided their ballots by stamping ''yes'' for all the candidates. **********In Ankara's ancient Castle district, a muhtar, or local headman, said he would vote for Mr. Sunalp and was sure his party would win because ''he has the support of the generals.'' **********It was difficult, however, to find any voters for Mr. Sunalp in the Altindag district, a vast area of squatter houses on the edge of town, where chickens, cats and children rule the alleys and cars rarely venture. **********''People are poor here, and the poor people will vote for the Populist Party,'' a retired schoolteacher said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/21/business/imasco-tire-bid-faces-opposition.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-06-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 201, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Imasco Tire Bid Faces Opposition", "print_headline": "Imasco Tire Bid Faces Opposition", "body_text": " **********Imasco Ltd., the Montreal-based tobacco, retailing and fast-food group, is considering whether to go ahead with a proposed $1.08 billion (Canadian) cash and stock offer for the Toronto-based Canadian Tire Corporation, in the face of opposition of two Canadian Tire family shareholders controlling 30 percent of the voting common. **********Imasco, which is 45.4 percent owned by the diversified British tobacco group B.A.T.

Nowhere in Manhattan does Con Ed have a stronger presence than along the stretch from 41st Street to 35th Street on Franklin D.  Roosevelt Drive. The properties include the inactive Kips Bay generating station east of First Avenue between 35th and 36th Street and the active Waterside generating station on the superblock from 38th to 41st Streets. **********As in so much of Manhattan, however, locations are no longer purely industrial, commercial or residential. In transition areas there has been a shift toward housing, especially on waterfront sites where high-rise construction provides an opportunity for expansive views. **********Ground was broken Monday for Rivergate, a 34-story, 700-unit rental structure that Donald Zucker is building on the square block formerly occupied by a Coca-Cola bottling plant east of First Avenue from 34th to 35th Streets. It is a natural extension toward the East River of residential development along 34th Street, much of it done by Mr. Zucker. **********Two blocks to the north, the Glick Construction Corporation will start demolishing a Texaco station and an old warehouse in May or June, in preparation for construction of a 35-story condominium with 487 apartments and 6,000 square feet of commercial space. Its tentative name is Manhattan Place. The 40,000-square-foot site is on the east side of First Avenue between 36th and 37th Streets. **********The immediate area is not entirely industrial. Across First Avenue is the landscaped ground surrounding the entrance to the Queens Midtown Tunnel. Another neighbor is St. Vartan's Park, formerly known as St. Gabriel's Playground, which occupies a full square block. **********Jeffrey Glick, a partner in Glick Construction, said in an interview that the assemblage of the site and the rezoning it required took three years. As with Rivergate, the Glick project involved months of negotiations with the City Planning Commission and Community Board 6. One outcome was that the building will face southwest instead of northeast, as originally planned, so that the landscaped area in front will face St. Vartan's Park. **********More unusual was the developer's decision, following a suggestion of Planning Commissioner Martin Gallent, to make a $427,000 contribution to help Phipps Houses provide 75 apartments for Bellevue Hospital nurses at below-market cost in a prospective development on First Avenue at 29th and 30th Streets. **********This is a $50 million venture that will produce about 400 apartments, most of them market-rate, in a conversion of the hospital's former pathology laboratory and its current psychiatric hospital. Hospital employees are to get first choice in buying or renting, depending on whether a condominium or rental is built.  Nurses earning about $20,000 will be able to afford the subsidized apartments. **********''They didn't say I had to do it,'' Mr. Glick said, ''but we liked the idea.'' The apartments at Manhattan Place will have floor-to-ceiling bay windows running the full width of the living rooms, and 8-foot, 6-inch ceilings. Ribbons of glass and brick will encircle the jagged facade of the building, which is shaped like a giant rectangle with triangular ends. The architect is C.A. Kondylis of Philip Birnbaum & Associates. **********On the top floor there is to be an 8,000-square-foot glass-enclosed health club for tenants, surrounded by an indoor jogging track around the perimeter. **********Opening prices are expected to be about $240 a square foot. The apartment mix as currently planned is to be 10 percent efficiencies of 655 square feet, 75 percent one-bedrooms or larger one-bedrooms of 715 to 760 square feet, 10 percent two-bedrooms averaging 1,030 square feet and 5 percent larger two-bedrooms of 1,275 square feet.  Thus, $182,400 would be a typical opening price for a 760-square-foot one-bedroom apartment. **********The mix of apartments may change, depending on sales experience, as it already has at another Glick condominium project: Baybridge, on 30 acres off Bell Boulevard at 108th Place near the Throgs Neck Bridge in Bayside, Queens. **********Baybridge is a low-rise condominium development built in a Georgian style. Construction started two years ago. The original plan was to build 700 1,200-square-foot simplex (single-level) units, one to a floor in the three-level buildings. These units are now on the market at prices of $95,000 to $157,000. **********But the developer has made a design change, and newer buildings are to contain two duplex units rather than three simplexes. The apartment size will be about 1,800 square feet, Mr. Glickman said.  Prices will range from $180,000 to $230,000, buyers will typically be older, and the total number of units at Baybridge should turn out to be about 600 instead of the 700 originally planned, he said. **********Similarly, buyer preferences could lead to a change in the mix at the First Avenue building.

Also important, they say, are the advantages that the Japanese companies enjoy from an undervalued yen and tax forgiveness on exported products. **********The cost gap was put at $1,000 to $1,500 a car by a Federal Government study in 1980. Subsequent Government studies have put the gap at $1,500 to $2,000 on a typical subcompact car. This cost disadvantage, more than any other factor, has cast an ominous cloud over the American auto industry, once considered the most productive in the world. **********Philip Caldwell, chairman of the Ford Motor Company, describes the situation this way: ''Using the landed cost advantage number of $2,000, as we see it, the yen is about $700, the tax burden is about $600 and the balance of it is everything else. So if you call it one-third, one-third, one-third, then I would say two-thirds of the problem is wrapped up in areas which only governments can do something about.'' **********Mr. Caldwell's contentions, if not his exact breakdown of the amounts involved, are supported by other auto industry executives and those in related fields. **********Lee L. Morgan, chairman of the Caterpillar Tractor Company, which is facing stiff competition from Komatsu Ltd., the Japanese heavy equipment maker, recently called for a surcharge on Japanese products sold in this country. The surcharge, he said, would offset the difference between the present value of the yen, about 235 to the dollar, and the rate of 200 yen to the dollar that he said was the Japanese currency's true value. **********However, Martin L. Anderson, director of an automobile study program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the effect of the currency difference on the price of Japanese cars was overstated by Detroit executives. Only about $3,000 of a car selling for $7,000 in the United States represents costs incurred in yen, he said. Thus an increase in the value of the yen would affect less then half the value of a car. Although few auto executives make the charge, there is a suggestion in their discussions that some-how the Japanese are cheating and maintaining the yen at an artificially low value to capture still larger shares of export markets. W. Paul Tippett, chairman of the American Motors Corporation, asked the Treasury Department last year to ''launch a thorough investigation'' into the yen-dollar relationship. **********The Reagan Administration has done just that, said Michael Driggs, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Automotive Industry Affairs. ''Our experts continue to tell us they cannot find any evidence of manipulation,'' he said. ''They can't fully explain why it is happening, but they don't find manipulation.'' **********John Williamson, an exchange rate specialist at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, said the major problem was that the dollar was too strong in relation to most other currencies, a situation, he said, that would correct itself in time. The Shift to Small Cars **********Before 1979 the relative values of the dollar and yen did not matter greatly to the United States automotive industry, since most Americans bought big cars manufactured only in this country. The shift in consumer taste to smaller vehicles came at a time when Japanese car makers were rapidly expanding. Automobiles accounted for $13 billion of this nation's $20 billion merchandise trade deficit with Japan last year. **********Similarly, before America became part of the world car market, the difference in the tax systems that evolved here and in other countries was not as important to the companies involved. Japan, like most European countries, relies more heavily on a form of sales tax, known as a value added tax, rather than on income taxes, which raise the bulk of revenue for the United States Government. **********Under international trading rules, countries may forgive the value added tax on products to be exported while imposing it on imported products. In the United States, corporate income taxes are built into the cost of cars and other products and there is no tax incentive for export. **********Since the Japanese value added tax on small autos is 17.5 percent on smaller cars, the forgiveness feature combined with the low United States auto tariff of 2.8 percent gives Japanese cars an advantage of about $735 on a $6,000 car, American auto executives charge. An American product shipped to Europe or Japan would pay taxes both at home and abroad. U.S. Action Asked **********''In the example of trade between the U.S. and Japan, where Japan relies on commodity taxes which exempt exports but are imposed on imports, the U.S. manufacturers are disadvantaged by our unwillingness to use a similar system,'' Frank P. Stafford, chairman of the economics department at the University of Michigan, wrote in an article on United States-Japan trade. **********Some auto executives have called for Government action to offset what they say are the ''unfair'' currency and tax advantages of the Japanese. The Administration, however, seems disinclined to act, evidently out of concern that any easing of the pressure from imports would slow the industry's efforts to hold down costs.  Instead, it is relying on the ''voluntary'' import quotas negotiated with the Japanese Government, and overall economic improvement to restore the auto companies' fortunes. **********''The appropriate role of government is to encourage and help the industry to be as competitive as it can in all segments of the market,'' said Mr. Driggs of the Commerce Department. ''The real test of the ability to compete lies with the industry, with management and labor.'' **********Mr. Anderson of M.I.T., who has studied auto operations in Japan, Europe and America, agrees. ''The fundamental problem is that the U.S. is the high-cost producer,'' he said. ''It still costs more to make a car here than in Japan, regardless of exchange rates or taxes.'' **********Mr. Caldwell of Ford, however, notes that the European affiliates of Ford and General Motors have been more successful against the Japanese than the parent companies in their home market."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/23/world/chad-calling-aid-inadequate-urges-france-to-wage-war.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Cowell", "pub_date": "1983-08-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 703, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CHAD, CALLING AID INADEQUATE, URGES FRANCE TO 'WAGE WAR'", "print_headline": "CHAD, CALLING AID INADEQUATE, URGES FRANCE TO 'WAGE WAR'", "body_text": " **********The Chadian Government urged France today to ''wage war'' against Libyan regulars and rebel forces who have occupied the northern third of the country and who were reported today to be continuing a buildup of heavy arms in the oasis of Faya-Largeau. **********At a routine briefing for reporters, Information Minister Mahamat Soumalia, striking a familiar chord, said French assistance to Chad in combating the Libyan-sponsored drive had been ''inadequate.''

He said they were being trained in Faya-Largeau after being coerced ''in a more brutal manner than before'' to join the force. **********Western military experts here discount the legion as a powerful fighting force because its members are seen as unwilling participants. **********''What is really of concern now,'' a Western official said, ''is what the Libyans intend to do.'' The Libyan resupply of Faya-Largeau could be used for either defensive or offensive purposes, the official said, but there had been ''no Libyan withdrawal, no evidence of declining Libyan interest in northern Chad.'' **********Ostensibly, the Libyans are fighting to install a pliant Government under former President Goukouni Oueddei in Ndjamena, but the Chadian interpretation is that Col.

Page D4. **********MIDLAND, Tex., Oct. 13 - The First National Bank here took pride in being an Oil Patch bank, an institution that loaned money to the industry on a handshake. And now that it is failing, there is an outpouring of emotional support from those it has helped over the years. **********First National is only the most recent of several banks that have foundered because many loans to the slumping oil industry are not being repaid. But its failure is perhaps the most dramatic because of its identity with West Texas oil. **********This city, 350 miles west of Dallas, sits atop the oil-rich Permian Basin, the vast geological reservoir that supplies one-fifth of the nation's oil production. **********But last week, after First National announced a loss of $121 million through August of this year and a staggering $314 million in nonperforming loans, a quarter of its total portfolio, small depositors staged a run on the bank. **********Then, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation announced Wednesday that it would lend $100 million to the essentially insolvent bank to keep it afloat until the Federal agency can find a buyer. This would most likely be a stronger bank that would pick up First National's sound assets while the F.D.I.C. took over the bank's nonperforming assets. **********The bank, whose major stockholders are energy industry executives, had scheduled a shareholders' meeting for Friday to vote on a new stock issue to raise as much as $100 million, perhaps enough to avoid a forced merger. But today the bank canceled the meeting as ''no longer appropriate.'' **********The bank's 3.2 million shares outstanding have a book value of about 30 cents a share, according to a recent proxy statement. **********Despite these woes, more than a thousand Midland residents, joined by Gov. Mark White, filled the Civic Center here to overflowing on Tuesday in a nostalgic testimonial to a financial institution that has been a mainstay of the large and small depositor and borrower for almost a century. **********'Mother Midland' **********Old-timers queued up to tell of the time when ''Mother Midland'' made them loans when no one else would. Governor White declared the bank ''one of the great institutions in the state,'' which had ''helped a lot of people to make a lot of money.'' The Young Odessa Businessmen pledged a $500,000 deposit, and lapel stickers proclaimed ''I Support The First National Bank.'' **********Many blamed the overheated oil economy and the flood of amateurs that poured into the oilfields for the industry's sudden collapse, which most oil executives still refer to as a shakedown. **********''It was greed,'' said a driller here who has been in business 17 years and only once, by his testimony, ever hit a dry hole. ''There were tennis pros, college professors, all kinds of people who never did have any knowledge or any business in drilling, who got into it because of the gold they saw lying in the street. That's what did it.'' **********But beyond the unexpected shattering of the oil economy and Midland's good-ol'-boy penchant for writing a loan on faith, a handshake and an oil lease, there were possibly darker problems as well. **********Two Investigations Under Way **********Midland said in its proxy statement that the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Office of the Comptoller of the Currency were investigating the bank. **********The S.E.C. is investigating the bank's statements for accuracy about its financial condition in recent months, and has also suggested that the bank exceeded its loan limits, lent money to its executives on favorable terms, violated laws relating to security and record-keeping and failed to file reports on loans from correspondent banks. **********The Comptroller, the bank said, had found that the bank's precarious condition resulted from ''inadequate supervision and departure from prudent lending practices'' as well as ''violations of laws, rules and regulations.'' **********The bank also noted that possible legal violations ''could result in significant civil money penalties and other liabilities'' and could subject board members to ''liabilities in connection with such losses.'' First National bank has been attributing its weakened financial condition to the superheated state of the oil and gas industry in the late 1970's, a fervor that has been chilled over the past 18 months by an oversupply that forced oil and gas prices downward and put a number of energy companies in financial trouble. **********The problem has plagued other Texas banks, among them the Metro Bank of Midland, which was declared insolvent last July and was reorganized as Mid-Cities National, and the National Bank of Odessa, in Midland's sister city, which was closed by the Comptroller of the Currency two weeks ago and then merged and reopened as the First State Bank of Odessa. **********And the problems reach beyond Texas. The 1982 failure of Penn Square Bank of Oklahoma as a result of uncollectable energy loans sent shock waves throughout the banking community. **********The Penn Square failure in turn hurt Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company in Chicago, which nevertheless was able to maintain its independence. But the Seafirst Corporation, which owned Seattle First National, was forced by the burden of loans bought from Penn Square to merge with the BankAmerica Corporation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/17/business/unilever-posts-5-rise-in-net.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-08-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 81, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Unilever Posts 5% Rise in Net", "print_headline": "Unilever Posts 5% Rise in Net", "body_text": " **********Unilever P.L.C., the international consumer products group that includes Lever Brothers and National Starch in the United States, today reported that net profit in the second quarter of 1983 rose 5 percent, to the equivalent of $171 million, from $164 million a year earlier. **********Revenues increased by 3 percent, to $5.07 billion, from $4.93 billion, despite a 1 percent decline in sales volume. **********Volume fell largely because of difficult trading conditions in Nigeria."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/04/business/united-telecommunications-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 62, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "UNITED TELECOMMUNICATIONS INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "UNITED TELECOMMUNICATIONS INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/07/business/finance-new-issues-cook-county-issue-cut-by-44-million.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-06-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 285, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Cook County Issue Cut by $44 Million", "print_headline": "FINANCE NEW ISSUES; Cook County Issue Cut by $44 Million", "body_text": " **********A Cook County bond issue that was rejected last week by the Continental Illinois National Bank was restructured and reduced to a $61.5 million issue, tentatively priced yesterday with yields ranging from 6 percent in 1984 to 9.90 percent in 1997. **********The bond issue was trimmed from $105.5 million after only one bid was received for the offering at an average cost of 9.98 percent to Cook County, which contains Chicago.

And with the help of improved marketing techniques, greater attention to customers and sophisticated business methods, a change for the better appears to be taking place. **********''You no longer have to walk down muddy paths, be attacked by snarling dogs and scowled at by a menacing owner in order to get a greasy part with no guarantee,'' said Barry Isenberg, a Cupertino, Calif., consultant to the industry. **********Grossed $6 Million Last Year **********Indeed, junkyards have become a big business for some dealers. Robertson's grossed $6 million last year, and was No. 456 on one listing of the nation's 500 fastest-growing companies. **********During the recession, lagging new-car sales helped the used-parts business as people repaired rather than replaced their cars. The average age of cars on the road in 1982 was 7.2 years, compared with 5.7 years in 1972. **********But the recession proved double-edged, for while people kept their cars longer and bought more used parts, fewer cars were junked and used parts were more expensive and harder for dealers to find. **********The shortage of junked cars, along with fewer wrecks because of the lower speed limit and tougher drunken-driving laws, has raised the purchase price of salvage cars for junkyards. ''Where we used to spend $500 for a junk car, we now spend up to $5,000,'' Scott Robertson said. **********Now, with new-car sales increasing, the industry is counting on its spruced-up image to help keep sales steady. And for the customer, the changes are unmistakable. **********Some Parts Come With Warranty **********The most noticeable change is undoubtedly the now nearly universal practice of dismantling used parts before sale. The days are gone when a junkyard owner would wave vaguely toward the acres of rusty heaps out back and say: ''I think there's a wheel on the Chevy out in the corner there. If you can find it you can have it for $10.'' **********Parts are removed, cleaned, tested and often displayed in bright, greaseless showrooms - frequently with a 90-day warranty attached. At Robertson's, salesmen in blazers and ties can show customers candy jars filled with used dome lights, axles for four-wheel-drive vehicles stored in cardboard tubes, and displays of windshield-wiper motors. **********In the warehouse, 600 plastic-wrapped engines - ''It keeps them dry and the nuts and bolts intact,'' Mr. Robertson said - are stored on a three-tiered frame. Out back, hundreds of doors and ''noses,'' the hood and front fender assembly, are displayed on numbered racks. **********Used parts run anywhere from 25 to 75 percent of the cost of new parts. In Baltimore, for example, the fender of a 1980 Chevrolet Monte Carlo costs $287 new and about $125 used. Besides saving money, buyers of used parts avoid the wait for shipment of a new part from the factory. **********Aggressive Marketing Plans **********The industry's improved image is also reflected in aggressive marketing plans, including advertising that is no longer limited to the Yellow Pages. Schram Auto Parts, in Pontiac, Mich., runs seasonal television advertising campaigns promoting the sales of used antifreeze in the fall. Robertson's has a glossy brochure describing its operations, including a prepaid postcard that puts customers on the company's computerized mailing and telephone sales list. Brandywine Auto Parts, Brandywine, Md., has an advertising budget of $500,000 a year. **********The effort to forge a new image extends to the name of the industry association, which eschews any reference to junkyards: The Automotive Dismantlers and Recyclers of America. **********The industry has also been changed by the use of computers, which are proving invaluable to businesses that may stock more than 350 different kinds of parts from countless numbers of automobile models. Mr. Robertson has an I.B.M. 34 computer that can tell him the location of every dismantled part he has, as well as the make, year and mileage of the car it was taken from. **********Not only does this guide him in filling out his inventory when purchasing parts at salvage auctions, but it also prevents the loss of sales because his staff did not know whether a part was in stock. **********Benefits for Insurance Industry **********''You have to have the ability to make the quick connection between what someone needs and what you have,'' said Russell McKinnon of the industry association. ''Before computers, you needed a counter man with a great memory.'' **********The difficulty is compounded because the same part may be used in a number of models. For example, the power steering gear on a 1970 American Motors Hornet is the same one used in a 1976 Chevrolet Camaro. Computer software developed for the industry cross-checks for these interchangeable parts. **********Some analysts expect computers to revolutionize the auto insurance industry as well by providing a nationwide locater service of used parts. ''Insurance adjusters make 50 to 70 million requests a year for parts, parts that could be replaced by used parts if they could be found,'' said Howard Nusbaum, president of AutoInfo Inc., a New York company that sells and services computer systems to auto wreckers. ''If everything were computerized to match requests with availability, repair costs and insurance rates would go down.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/30/business/key-rates-144061.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-12-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 119, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/05/business/arkansas-panel-to-help-baldwin.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-05-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 84, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Arkansas Panel To Help Baldwin", "print_headline": "Arkansas Panel To Help Baldwin", "body_text": " **********A committee of state insurance commissioners was formed yesterday to work with the Baldwin-United Corporation to develop solutions to its financial problems. **********The committee was formed after a day-long mmeeting at the headquarters of the National Investors Life Insurance Company, one of Baldwin's insurance units.

''Any other position is short-sighted; more so, it is suicidal.'' **********The statement included Mr. Andropov's first public comments on the shooting down of a South Korean airliner by a Soviet fighter on Sept. 1, with the loss of all 269 aboard. **********The Soviet leader said responsibility for the loss of life rested with the United States for having sent the airliner on a spying mission, as the Russians have charged, and he mocked the ''humanism'' of Mr. Reagan, who he said had used the incident to argue the need for a further arms buildup. **********''One must say bluntly that it is an unattractive sight when, with a view to smearing the Soviet people, leaders of such a country as the United States resort to what almost amounts to obscenities alternating with hypocritical preaching about morals and humanism,'' Mr. Andropov said. **********His criticism was balanced by a renewed pledge to seek agreement in the parallel Geneva talks on medium-range and strategic, or long-range, weapons and to work for a relationship of peace with the United States.   Malicious Attacks' Charged **********Mr. Andropov said that while the ''malicious attacks'' by the Reagan Administration had aroused indignation, ''our nerves are strong and we do not base our policy on emotions.'' **********''It rests on common sense, realism and profound responsibility for the destinies of peace,'' Mr. Andropov said. **********It has been rare in recent years for such bitter statements about the United States to be made directly by a Soviet leader. The criticism was all the more notable coming from Mr. Andropov, who has generally struck a calm and unpolemical tone in commenting on Soviet-American affairs. **********The importance attached to the statement by the Kremlin was indicated by the fact that it was made by itself, without the context of a dinner speech for a visiting dignitary or an interview with Pravda, the leading Soviet newspaper. **********An introductory passage suggested that the statement was thought of particular moment for both domestic and foreign consumption. **********''The Soviet leadership deems it necessary to make known to the Soviet people, to other peoples and all those who are responsible for shaping the policy of states its assessment of the course pursued in international affairs by the present United States Administration,'' the statement started out.   Kremlin's Resentment Reflected **********Western diplomats, noting that there was little of substance in the document that had not been said before, suggested that it might have been prompted by a mood of anger and resentment at the worldwide condemnation that followed the downing of the South Korean airliner. **********Mr. Andropov's remarks suggested that the Kremlin had been particularly stung by Mr. Reagan's speech at the United Nations, attacking Soviet policies on arms control and human rights. The Soviet leader called Mr. Reagan's speech ''grandiloquent'' and said his statements about the United States' desire for peace and the self-determination of peoples around the world ''can convince no one.'' **********''Even if someone had any illusions as to the possible evolution for the better in the policy of the present Americanu Administration, the latest developments have finally dispelled them,'' Mr. Andropov said. ''For the sake of its imperial ambitions, it goes so far that one begins to doubt whether Washington has any brakes at all preventing it from crossing the mark before which any sober-minded person must stop.''  Reference to Plane Incident **********Mr. Andropov mentioned the South Korean plane, shot down by a Soviet fighter on Sept. 1 with the loss of 269 lives. He called the incident a ''sophisticated provocation'' by United States intelligence services and ''an example of extreme adventurism in politics'' by the Reagan Administration. He said the responsibility of the United States had been demonstrated, regardless of ''what false versions'' Washington might put forward. **********He said the United States leadership had followed up this ''criminal subversion'' by pushing through Congress a program of ''colossal military spending.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/29/business/operating-for-profit-at-hospital-corp.html": {"writer_name": "N. Kleinfield", "pub_date": "1983-05-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 3634, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "OPERATING FOR PROFIT AT HOSPITAL CORP.", "print_headline": "OPERATING FOR PROFIT AT HOSPITAL CORP.", "body_text": " **********WALTERBORO, S.C., is a poor, sleepy, rural community of 6,100 peoples et about 50 miles from Charleston. It was named for the Walters b rothers, who migrated there in the late 1700's to escape the m osquitoes farther south. Getting sick, though, was what modern day inhabitants dreaded most. That meant checking into the red-brick building over on Lemacks Street - the Colleton Regional Hospital, the only hospital in the county. **********It was a dim affair. Rooms leaked when it rained. Plaster was peeling off the walls. Squadrons of roaches, mice and rats competed for space. Some of the equipment seemed fit for a museum. Well-to-do denizens simply hopped in their cars and drove to Charleston and were healed there. **********Then, near the end of 1980, corporate medicine came to Walterboro.  And last March, a spiffy new 145-bed hospital opened its doors on Robertson Boulevard. Its proprietor is not the community, but the Hospital Corporation of America, a for-profit public company that rules over the nation's largest hospital system. **********The coming to town of H.C.A. or one of its powerful rivals in the burgeoning hospital business - Humana, American Medical International, National Medical Enterprises or Lifemark - has been duplicated recently in a wide scattering of communities. Their arrival reflects a profound change in the delivery of health-care in the nation, and it raises difficult questions about how far to let the profit incentive spread into health care. **********Privatization, as it is called, has begun to creep into a number of social welfare areas, such as police protection and sanitation, once deemed fit only for public authorities. Now corporations say that they can heal the sick better than governments or other dogooders and make profits at it, too. The Reagan Administration has struggled to reassert the marketplace wherever possible, providing a fertile time for such systems to grow. **********The phenomenon of the profit-making hospital chain has arisen on such a broad scale so swiftly that it is difficult to analyze.  Opinions about them are rampant; research on them is not. Still, with the drying up of government funds to build hospitals, it seems clear that this is the future toward which American medicine is headed. **********Hospitals run for profit have, of course, existed for decades, even centuries, though they usually have been tiny, individually-operated facilities owned by doctors. But in the late 1960's, hospital chains owned and operated by sizable corporations appeared for the first time. The major impetus was the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965, which made health care lucrative to providers, interesting to investors. They have thrived ever since. Proprietary multi-hospital systems now own about 11 percent of the country's 5,900 community hospitals and 8.5 percent of their beds. **********During the 1970's, these networks grew while the total number of hospitals dwindled slightly. More recently, the industry has begun to bunch into fewer and bigger chains. Some health-care experts boldly predict that the profit-making chains could double in size during the 1980's and claim 20 percent of the industry. **********The emergence of these sprawling corporate empires has showered undeniable gifts on many hamlets that have traditionally had a brutal time getting able medical care. But it has also stirred up debate about their effect on the ethos of medical treatment. **********THE for-profit systems argue that they can run a hospital efficiently and thus put a lid on rocketing health costs even while extracting a healthy profit. Their enormous reach into the capital markets enables them to construct facilities and buy advanced medical equipment that communities with empty tills cannot afford. At the same time, though, their tilt toward people who can pay to be mended and their avoidance of the utterly poor, non-welfare patient may be undercutting the assumption that everyone has a right to decent medical services. **********''Health care is not a commodity like a pair of shoes or a used car or a refrigerator,'' complains Dr. Arnold Relman, editor of the New England Journal of Medicine. He fears that these hospital-management companies are fomenting a dual system of health care: ''We're going to see a very commercial type of arrangement where those who can afford to pay get the best treatment. We're getting back to a sort of survival of the richest.'' **********In addition, these for-profit systems have - until recently - exhibited little commitment to research or to educating the doctors of tomorrow. They have been attacked for eschewing services that fail to fatten their wallets. There are fears that doctors will be pressured to adopt a corporate profit-making mentality. **********Not surprisingly, H.C.A.'s president and chief executive officer, Thomas Frist Jr., disagrees: ''People say we're going to skim the cream,'' he says curtly. ''That's a stupid public.'' **********Back in the 1950's, his father, Thomas Frist Sr., was a cardiologist practicing in Nashville. Fed up with the sorry state of local hospitals, he founded a 50-bed facility called Park View Hospital. By the early 1960's, unable to raise money to expand, he and fellow doctors went the for-profit route. In time, several Tennessee hospitals asked the senior Dr. Frist for help and he sniffed the advantage of stringing hospitals together. **********In 1968, joined by his son, serving as a United States Air Force surgeon, and by Jack Massey, a long-time patient of Dr. Frist's, who had developed the Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant chain, the senior Dr. Frist founded H.C.A. Within six months, 11 hospitals came under its control. **********People howled their upset. Making money off the sick, was immoral, some reasoned. But Dr. Frist plowed steadfastly ahead. He knew the concept would work, he said, ''because I saw Holiday Inn, Kroger and the A & P. I saw everything joining together to save expenses.'' **********H.C.A. now owns or manages a serpentine trail of 364 hospitals boasting 52,134 beds, almost quadruple the network run by American Medical International, its closest competitor. H.C.A. heals the sick in such far-flung places as Trinidad, Colo., Metairie, La., Iron River, Mich., and Grundy, Va. A decade ago, it managed just 57 hospitals. **********Everything about H.C.A. seems to keep getting bigger. Its revenues last year topped $3.5 billion, and it turned a profit of $171.9 million, a 55 percent improvement over 1981. H.C.A.'s stock could be bought for less than $7 in 1978; now it costs roughly $50. Numbers like these have helped the company attract a following among healthcare analysts who see it as one of the best-managed of the hospital empires. And financially-strapped communities that once scorned it are now summoning H.C.A. Tom Frist Jr. speaks of his company swelling to perhaps 500 hospitals before the decade is out and becoming one of the biggest corporations in America. **********But a major test of corporate medicine, which could have enormous impact on H.C.A., will come in October, when a new ''prospective payment'' system of Medicare reimbursement begins to be phased in over a four-year period. Medicare now pays hospitals all reasonable costs. Under the new arrangement, the Government will pay hospitals a flat fee set in advance for each patient with a particular illness.  Then, if a hospital does a shoulder replacement cheaper than the fixed rate, it will pocket the difference. **********Such a change could greatly affect H.C.A.'s profit picture, since it derives roughly 41 percent of its patient revenues from the aged under Medicare. The for-profits, including H.C.A., favor the new incentive, contending that they will now be able to strut their stuff. *********** * * H.C.A.'s glass-sheathed headquarters in Nashville befits a prospering corporation. Thus far, H.C.A. has flourished on hospitals alone, but it forsees the day when it will blossom into a healthcare conglomerate. Already under its corporate umbrella is a Seattle ambulance service, as well as stakes in a California nursing home company and an artificial organ firm. **********Tom Frist Jr. likes to talk about what he sees as a critical edge that the public corporations have: the ability to drum up money.  Non-profit hospitals (which H.C.A. likes to call ''non-tax-paying hospitals'') must rely on philanthropy and tax-exempt bonds to grow, while the for-profit chains (H.C.A.'s calls them ''investor-owned'') can issue stock and tap sources like the Eurodollar market. Money helps when ground is broken on a new hospital about every four weeks - as in H.C.A.'s case. **********Drawing analogies between for-profit and non-profit hospitals is no simple exercise. Two years ago, the consulting firm of Lewin & Associates published an often-cited study of 53 pairs of similar for-profit and non-profit hospitals in three states. Based on 1978 data and not meant to speak truths for the entire country, the study concluded that the for-profits charged 17 percent more per admission than voluntary hospitals. **********It also found that, for Medicare and Medicaid payers, costs were 8 percent higher at the for-profits. While the matched pairs varied little in charges for routine things like bed and board, the study reported that the for-profits sharply marked up ancillary services like drugs and supplies. Although Lewin felt that the for-profits were more efficient in areas such as housekeeping, it found that they demonstrated no edge at all in many other areas. **********H.C.A. said the study was flawed. While Mr. Frist agrees that it will often cost somebody more per day to get rid of a hangnail or have a baby at an H.C.A. hospital, he says that the total bill you pay when you leave is going to be cheaper. H.C.A. gets the sick back on their feet faster, he said. **********H.C.A. prefers that patients to go home after the first two or three days, since by then the most profitable procedures like X-rays and lab tests are over. The national average for patient stays is 7.6 days; at H.C.A. facilities it was 6.4 in 1980, the last period reported. **********Others, however, suggest that H.C.A. and its brethren treat a different mix of patients. Less costly ones, says David Ott, a member of the hospital consulting firm of J.X. Reynolds & Co. ''If you were to get an acute pain in your midsection right now and were rushed off to a for-profit hospital, you'd be cared for right away and you'd rest in your nice comfortable room with the wallpaper and you'd be home in a couple of days. However, if your appendix burst and your upper colon was damaged and there were other complications, that for-profit hospital might take one look at you and say you need more elaborate care and send you over to the local university hospital.'' *********** * * Who will care for the poor? That is the obligatory question in debates over the hospital chains. H.C.A. makes no bones about the fact that it wants dollars and not promises from patients.  Preadmission checking is done to see if patients have deep enough pockets. Deposits are often demanded. While it will treat any emergency patient until he is stabilized, H.C.A. is loathe to admit nonemergency uninsured patients. **********Say an uninsured person with empty pockets shows up with a gall bladder that needs removing. H.C.A. will check to see if the person qualifies for Medicare or Medicaid and will help him sign up. If he doesn't qualify, it will recommend a bank loan (though not arrange one). If that does not work, it will point the way to the nearest voluntary hospital and wish the patient luck. **********In a monopoly situation like Walterboro, the county typically signs a contract with H.C.A. agreeing to reimburse the company for indigent care. In Walterboro, H.C.A. paid $2.3 million for the old hospital's equipment and to lease the building while constructing a new one. The county set aside a special fund of $2 million and and used the income from investing it in the financial markets to pay for up to $200,000 a year for poor patients. **********Dozens of non-profit hospitals in fact indulge in the same practices that the for-profits are accused of: spurning the indigent and eschewing research and education. Indeed, non-profit hospitals have learned from the for-profits and many have begun to combine into regional networks of their own. ''I think you're going to see everybody look pretty much alike 10 years from now,'' suggests David Ott. *********** * * Most hospitals work on the Robin Hood principle. They make money off privately-insured patients and apply it to the costs of the indigent. Even non-profit hospitals aim to make a profit; they just call it a surplus. What alarms many about for-profit systems, however, is that as their facilities siphon more and more insured patients from voluntary hospitals, while shuttling the needy to them, the voluntary hospitals will no longer have enough rich for Robin Hood to do his work. The taxpayers would have to make up the difference. **********But there is no mistaking the health value of the dollars that an H.C.A. has to put to work. ''Whether someone likes them or dislikes them for being publicly-owned and profitable,'' says Peter Frishauf, the editorial director of Surgical Care Publications and a long-time observer of the medical scene, ''the bottom line has to be, do they provide high-quality health care. And the answer, by and large, has to be yes.'' **********So far, of course, the chains have basked in rosy times and haven't often faced hard choices that might suggest where their hearts are.  Asked what would occur if a clash developed between economic and social concerns, Donald MacNaughton, H.C.A.'s chairman and the former head of Prudential Life Insurance, replied, ''You cut down on people, cut down on space, cut down wherever you can. If you still can't solve the problem, you try to find out if there are abuses. You let some of the doctors go. If you feel you're doing too much indigent care, you just put a cap on the level of indigent care you will accept. It might be that that hospital ought not exist and if so you get rid of the hospital.'' *********** * * You won't find H.C.A. in downtown Detroit or Newark. The settings it favors are advantageous to insuring black bottom lines. It skirts the inner-cities, with their heavy concentrations of poor. It likes the Sunbelt, where population growth is, and it likes communities where younger people, with private insurance, settle. If it can't have that, it can find bliss in a setting like Walterboro where it's the only game in town; it enjoys such monopoly status in 50 communities. Climates unfettered by insurers who review the equity of rates also get its juices going. The chains are almost invisible in the heavily-regulated Northeast. In South Carolina, on the other hand, Blue Cross pays pretty much whatever a hospital asks. **********By relying on just four builders and prototype designs, H.C.A.  boasts that it can build a hospital 30 to 40 percent cheaper than a community can. H.C.A. staffers have also devised the optimimum configuration for every room in a hospital. Whether a private-patient room is in Utah or Kentucky, for example, it will always have the bed four-feet-nine inches from the window, leaving space for a chair that is 31 inches long by 27 inches wide. **********Hospital chains differ widely in the authority they bestow on individual units. Humana's president once declared that he wanted to provide a product as uniform as a McDonald's hamburger. H.C.A.  prides itself on allowing hospital administrators broad ''local perogative.'' **********Its corporate staff has devised an array of cost-effective systems - to buff the floors, serve the food, run the pharmacy - that are available to its hospitals but not mandatory. Budgets are worked up locally, though they must be approved by headquarters. Further, the corporate materials management staff has 473 discount supply contracts - covering everything from desks to drugs - to offer individual hospitals. The savings are often 15 to 20 percent. After all, H.C.A. buys 6.1 million aspirins a year and 4.3 million syringes and needles. **********H.C.A. expects its administrators, despite their freedom, to perform and perform well. Every month, hospitals are sized up according to a battery of yardsticks: man-hours per adjusted patient day, bad debt expense, occupancy. The company expects its administrators to shoot for a 5 percent net profit margin. In the computer industry in recent years margins have been running at about 10 percent. In the more mature auto industry, the figure is under 5 percent. **********H.C.A. gets administrators to shine by pitting them against each other. (H.C.A. takes pains to point out that administrators don't get bonuses tied to performance; but, of course, sweeter salaries are rarely doled out for sloppy work). **********Mike Law is a curly-haired, effervescent man in his mid-30s with a college degree in hospital administration. He runs H.C.A.'s Southern Hills Hospital in Nashville. No one had to drill the competitive drive into him. His father sold bib overalls for a living. ''Every month, he'd get a listing of all salesmen that would show how they were doing,'' his son recalled. ''If my dad was not in the top five, it'd kill him.'' His father's compulsion has rubbed off. ''I want to be No. 1,'' he admits. **********The pressure on administrators may get heavier under the overhauled Medicare system. It might also implant some strain in H.C.A.'s network, which tends to defer to doctors in the choice of equipment and supplies. Clayton McWhorter, H.C.A.'s executive vice president, explains: ''In the past, if we had a contract on a catheter and a doctor at one hospital didn't like the catheter, he threw it away.  Well, with the changes, the hospital administrator who knows there's a 20 percent savings on the catheter is going to talk to that doctor and sell him on how good that catheter is. He's not going to allow ego and little turf-protecting types of things to interfere.'' *********** * * Marching bands didn't welcome H.C.A. to Walterboro. Agitation for a private company was set in motion by disgruntled doctors and county politicians, but the community split into antagonistic factions. A public referendum finally decided the matter in November 1980. The board of the old county hospital retained a public relations firm to oppose H.C.A. **********Meanwhile, physicians and politicians were whisked to other hospitals in the chain by H.C.A. in the company's two corporate planes. They also threw a barbecue bash in Walterboro. Some of the scuttlebutt going around town was that H.C.A. didn't employ any black doctors, so some black doctors affiliated with other H.C.A.  hospitals were brought to the barbecue as proof. **********After H.C.A. prevailed, Don Caldwell was appointed the new administrator. The belt was tightened. Bad debts were shaved by sending delinquent bills to collection agencies and by demanding deposits from questionable patients. Staff shifts were shortened during sluggish occupancy months. Supply costs were lowered. Some of the dead wood of the staff was dismissed and, to keep the mood pleasant all employes were put through courtesy seminars. **********Patients are a hospital's meal ticket, and thus Mr. Caldwell is actively wooing specialists to compete against Charleston hospitals.  One of the services he can tap is an H.C.A. computer bank of some 600 doctors with information on where they would like to practice. An obstetrician is due in town shortly. To get him, Mr. Caldwell offered him a year's free office space and guaranteed him a first-year income of $60,000, enticements likely to endear him to H.C.A. **********Mr. Caldwell spent 13 years in the non-profit world and hopes never to revisit it. He remembers answering to board members who couldn't read or write. **********Patients seem pleased by the new comforts - the carpeted, spacious rooms, a television set for every bed.  Ile Stacey, an elderly woman who arrived at the hospital with ''a little heart problem,'' was sitting alongside her bed. Flowers reposed on her window ledge. ''I think it's a wonderful little hospital,'' she said. ''It's like home.'' **********John Kinard Jr., a general surgeon in Walterboro, his legs stretched out in his spacious new H.C.A.-built office, remarked: ''It's certainly a much better place to practice. I'm not flying by the seat of my pants as I was on some operations in the old hospital.'' He said he finds that the ''country-club types'' who used to commute to Charleston are now coming to him. ''It's the hospital,'' he said. **********Charges at Colleton have risen mildly so far, but they doubtlessly will increase further after the new hospital gets a better fix on its costs. Its monthly electric bill, for instance, is $14,000, compared to $6,000 at the old hospital. **********There are still crucial questions that are likely to lack answers for some time to come. By any measure, H.C.A. holds a great deal of thus-far dormant power. What is to stop it from boosting rates to the moon or from stopping to deliver babies if it costs too much? **********Chris Bickley, the city manager, pondered the question in his City Hall office. ''It concerned me having a proprietary company coming in and being given an unregulated monopoly. Thinking it through, I realized that people in Colleton County are used to going to Charleston for their health care. If H.C.A. prices itself out of the market, we won't hesitate to get back in our cars and drive down the road.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/14/business/careers-outlook-for-civil-engineers.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-09-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 733, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Careers; Outlook For Civil Engineers", "print_headline": "Careers; Outlook For Civil Engineers", "body_text": " **********ALL across the country, there is talk about decay of the infrastructure - defined broadly as bridges, highways, railroads and airports, dams and reservoirs, flood control projects, underground pipes and sewage systems, and hazardous waste facilities. **********Putting off maintenance has long been popular to conserve money, so much so that, in the Depression, few civil engineers could find jobs. And in the latest recession local governments cut back on civil engineering and inspection staffs. **********Now, however, the emphasis is changing, and the demand for civil engineers is on the upswing. **********Walter Blessey, former president of the American Society of Civil Engineers, said yesterday: ''I absolutely agree that we still need more civil engineers. In the early 1940's, I would crawl under bridges and notice erosion and rust. Nobody in government wanted to put money into what they couldn't see. We don't have the technical people to maintain our structures.'' **********At Tulane University, where he is head of the school's civil engineering department, Professor Blessey has been discouraged from talking to freshmen about the advantages - and the fun - of being a civil engineer in the last four years because the university wanted to increase other engineering departments. **********''Many students have been seduced into glamorous areas like bioengineering and computer science,'' he said. ''This year, the dean is permitting me to talk to freshmen. I haven't seen more interest in majoring in civil engineering yet, but it could be a delayed reaction.'' **********If Professor Blessey gives his talks, he thinks enrollment in civil engineering could increase. He will talk of such dramatic opportunities as building structures in the Alaskan ice field and designing offshore platforms but will stress that the real need is for rehabilitation of the infrastructure. **********''Nobody likes to be a Jean Valjean and inspect sewers,'' Robert E. Price, president of Openaka Corporation, said. He added that there was ''no obvious glamour'' to much of the needed rehabilitation. His company specializes in investigations and repairs of concrete specialty pipelines. **********He cited several problems. ''No. 1 is that the supply of civil engineers went down when interest rates went up and capital spending went down, both private and public,'' Mr. Price said. ''I think that now people are taking a second look at the field'' because of such recent problems as the collapse of the Mianus River Bridge at Greenwich, Conn, he said. **********''A second problem,'' Mr. Price said, ''is that the supply of experienced engineers to make judgments on repairs is too small, and it will take young engineers several years to gain experience.'' Meanwhile, Mr. Price has difficulty finding able young engineers at the going rate of about $25,000 a year. **********At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Prof. Joseph M. Sussman adds another perspective: ''The extraordinary opportunities in computer and electrical engineering have driven down the number of civil engineers so that there is an undersupply. I don't have finger tip data, but I think the shortage will increase as we see renewed interest in building up the infrastructure.'' **********Professor Sussman, who heads M.I.T.'s civil engineering department, defined infrastructure as the nation's ''physical underpinnings.'' **********At M.I.T., students usually pick a major at the start of sophomore year, and Professor Sussman found more interest recently in civil engineering. ''I can sense a pickup in interest from the number of students who drop in to talk to me,'' he said. ''The data is just coming in, but I think this year the number of sophomores picking civil engineering at M.I.T. will be more than 50 percent higher than in recent years.'' Sophomores choosing civil engineering might number about 30, up from 18 in recent years, he said. **********What about the many civil engineers who work for internationl construction companies that have been building infrastructure in underdeveloped nations, such as Saudi Arabia? ''I don't think the bloom is off that rose, but there might be a slight slowdown in demand for civil engineers working overseas,'' Professor Sussman said. **********A problem in most engineering fields for students and professors is the fast obsolescence of technical knowledge. It has often been said that an engineer's knowledge becomes largely outdated every five years, requiring refresher courses. ''We try to give students basic tools so that as the field changes they have the needed strengths to build on,'' Professor Sussman said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/07/business/us-petroleum-data.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-01-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 121, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Petroleum Data", "print_headline": "U.S. Petroleum Data", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/29/business/insider-reports.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-09-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 122, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Insider Reports", "print_headline": "Insider Reports", "body_text": " **********The New York Stock Exchange issued yesterday its latest report of changes in the shareholdings of officers, directors and large stockholders in companies whose shares are listed on the exchange. **********The report of changes follows:  NEW YORK EXCHANGE **********ADVEST GROUP INC.-Anthony A.

Most of the companies are small, family business, but the industry also includes major international concerns. **********Such a large shift probably has not taken place in New York since the wholesale produce industry was moved from the West Side of Manhattan to the Hunts Point Market in the Bronx. Getting even half of the interior design companies to agree to move would be a major accomplishment. **********At the moment, many of these companies have their showrooms on the East Side in the 50's and 60's and rising rents have become a critical problem for many of them. Typically, leases are rising to $35 to $40 a square foot from $12 to $15, according to Donald Schnable, a real estate consultant with Julien J. Studley Inc. who has been hired by the industry. **********Among the buildings now used by the industry are the Decorator and Design Building at 979 Third Avenue, the Architects and Designers Builidng at 964 Third Avenue, the Decorative Arts Center at 305 East 63d Street and the New York Design Center at 200 Lexington Avenue.  Showrooms typically require far more space than offices, but there is no distinction in rents. **********Edwin Bitter, president of Scalamandre Silks Inc., is the head of an ad hoc committee made up of industry leaders who are studying a move. ''Rents are so high we're being forced out of buildings and the industry is fractionalizing,'' he said. Companies lose business if they are not geographically concentrated, he argued. **********The city is encouraging the industry to move across the 59th Street Bridge to Long Island City, Queens, where Lazard Realty Inc. is rehabilitating the American Chicle Building and the Bucilla Building. The two buildings have more than a million square feet of space. The site has a development potential of four million square feet. **********A year ago Lazard was planning to convert the buildings to backoffice spaces, but the concept failed. Then about six months ago Lazard, at the urging of city officials, switched strategy and decided to turn the property into an international design center, much like the Chicago Merchandise Mart or the Pacific Design Center in Los Angeles. **********Both of these centers have proved to be successful from a real estate as well as a marketing point of view. Like other design centers around the country, the attraction is a kind of one-stop shopping market for the architects and interior designers who patronize the industry. **********Most people in the industry argue that New York needs a design center. The question is whether it would work in Long Island City, or any location outside Manhattan. **********To promote the idea, Lazard hired impressive companies to make its proposal work. I.M. Pei & Partners, the architectural firm, will prepare the master plan. Massimo Vignelli of Vignelli Associates will do graphics. And Joseph Paul D'Urso Design is planning the interior public spaces. **********Just yesterday, Lazard signed its first lease for the design center. John Stuart/John Widdicomb Inc., a furniture company, has taken 30,000 square feet of space and will move from 979 Third Avenue. Harvey Schulweiz, president of Lazard Realty, said he believed the project was ''over the hump right now.'' But he said it would be a recognized success when about 250,000 square feet of space was leased, which also is the amount needed to get permanent financing for the project. **********Lazard and industry leaders - both proponents and opponents of a move - agree that relocation of the industry will work only if the major companies in the business take space in a new area. **********Lynn Berman, president of Designfriends Ltd., a wall covering and fabrics company, and another member of the ad hoc committee, said that the committee had talked to 13 or 14 developers about new locations for the industry, ranging from the Bronx to the Meadowlands in New Jersey. ''We'll listen to anybody, and we are definitely entertaining any offers,'' she said. ''But I think Lazard is the first developer to approach us with anything that comes near meeting our needs.''She also said that a move to Long Island City would be ''pioneering'' and that many companies were afraid to make such a shift. **********Edward Epstein, President of Stendig International Inc., the furniture company, represents the skeptical crowd. Lazard, he said, was the only company ''truly developing a property for the purpose as a design center.'' But, he added: ''Will the industry move to Long Island City? I can't believe it.'' In his own case, he said, he would not want to move. But Stendig, unlike some other companies, he said, can afford East Side rents. **********At the same time, however, Mr. Epstein said he thought that Lazard could rent about two million square feet of space to companies in the design business. ''Lazard hired all the right people,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/30/business/indicators-climbed-1-last-month.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-07-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 404, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INDICATORS CLIMBED 1% LAST MONTH", "print_headline": "INDICATORS CLIMBED 1% LAST MONTH", "body_text": " **********The index of leading economic indicators, which is intended to forecast the direction of the economy, rose 1 percent in June, the Commerce Department reported today. **********The increase was smaller than in earlier months of the economic recovery, which started in November.

The bankruptcy laws are a good example. The Senate recently passed a bill that would make significant changes in the 1979 revision of Federal bankruptcy law, which was based on the premise that debtors should be enabled to have a ''fresh start'' by being relieved of all their debts. **********Since enactment of the 1979 revision, the rate of personal bankruptcies has soared. Before the change became effective, there had been 180,000 to 200,000 personal bankruptcies a year. Since then, the rate has more than doubled, to 450,000. **********Under the 1979 revision, an individual who files for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 is relieved of all unsecured debts, while under Chapter 13 he would be required to pay back at least a part of what he owes over a period of time. The key change in the bill recently passed by the Senate would give a judge the ability to force a debtor who filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 into Chapter 13. **********Emotions run high on the issue, and the facts are murky. Those who oppose the change, such as Representative Don Edwards, the California Democrat who was a designer of the 1979 bill, contend that the problem is not the bankruptcy law itself but profligate lending by banks and finance companies. ''They loaned like they were drunken sailors,'' Mr. Edwards said in a telephone interview yesterday. **********Mr. Edwards denied that the 1979 revision had anything to do with the subsequent surge in bankruptcies. He attributed it to the recession, soaring consumer credit and a Supreme Court ruling allowing lawyers to advertise. Many lawyers have been aggressively advertising for bankruptcy cases, which has increased public awareness of the possibility of seeking protection from the bankruptcy laws. **********Those who have been pressing hardest for a toughening of the bankruptcy laws - the lenders - acknowledge that most individuals seeking bankruptcy, even under Chapter 7, are justified in doing so.  But the lenders contend that a minority has abused the law and forced a sharp cutback in overall consumer lending, at least to people who cannot put up their homes as collateral. **********In addition, the lenders contend that they have had to increase the interest rates they charge on all consumer loans to offset the losses from consumer bankruptcies. **********''Most consumers, 75 percent, take bankruptcy for legitimate reasons - sickness, loss of job or actual overextension of credit,'' said F.M.W. Caspersen, chairman of the Beneficial Corporation. ''The remaining 25 percent have the ability, at least in part, to repay.  Our objection is to those who can pay and, in fact, don't.'' **********He added: ''We have effectively withdrawn from the ordinary unsecured lending market. In the last four years, we have dropped more than 30 percent of our customers.'' **********Last year, Beneficial lost $50 million as the result of personal bankruptcies, Mr. Caspersen said. He estimated that half that amount represented ''justified'' bankruptcies. To compensate for these losses, Beneficial increased the interest rates it charged on consumer loans by about a percentage point, he said. **********Most other consumer lenders have taken similar steps. Citicorp, one of nation's biggest lenders to consumers, reduced its consumer-loan loss rate to 0.93 percent last year from 1.33 percent in 1980. This was largely the result of a shift to loans secured by real estate, including mobile homes. **********A number of studies have been made of the effects of the 1979 revision of the bankruptcy law, each giving somewhat different results. According to a study by the Credit Research Center of Purdue University of 1,199 Chapter 7 bankruptcies, half were unable to pay anything, 20 percent could have repaid all they owed within a three-year period and the remaining 30 percent could have paid a portion of what they owed. This study was paid for by a group of lending institutions, and questions about its accuracy have been raised by supporters of the present law. **********A more recent study, conducted by Philip Shuchman of Rutgers University, indicated that the great majority of consumers who declared bankruptcy were not well off, despite a number of wellpublicized cases in which wealthy individuals, such as professional football players, have declared bankruptcy. **********The question that remains is which set of consumers should ultimately pay for bad consumer loans. Opponents of the Senate bill contend that it might be unconstitutional to force people to work off their debts. But someone will ultimately have to pay, and that someone will end up being a consumer. ---------------------------------------------------------------------  Leonard Silk is on a special assignment."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/10/world/the-un-today-feb-10-1983-general-assembly.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 73, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The U.N.

Wiggins Junior Growth Stocks Viewed", "body_text": " **********MANY trackers of junior growth stocks expect the bearishness that marked much of that sector in 1983 to give way early next year to a renewal of investor enthusiasm. **********From August 1982, when they hit bottom, until the end of June 1983, emerging growth issues - usually companies doing less than $100 million in annual sales with a compounded earnings growth rate of at least 15 percent - far outperformed the general market. Since then, the group has been in what analysts call a severe corrective vein, perhaps aggravated recently by tax-loss selling. **********But in the opinion of John Westergaard, publephone lisher and editor for Equity Research Associates, an advisory service specializing in junior growth stocks, 1984 ought to be a banner year. **********''We think the economy is going to outstrip all expectations,'' Mr. Westergaard said the other day, ''and we believe that the force of that economy, particularly earnings and cash flow, will drive the averages to new highs, creating a very positive environment for most of the junior companies we deal with.'' **********Mr. Westergaard is naturally optimistic about the small high-technology companies he follows for Equity Research Associates, a division of Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company. Since Oct. 1, 1976, he has recommended 105 stocks in his newsletter; 92 of them went up, and 13 went down. **********At this time, he has several favorites for 1984, including Digital Switch, Vishay Intertechnology, National Micronetics, Monolithic Memories and Eagle Computer. All are traded over the counter. **********Mr. Westergaard believes Digital Switch is positioned to take advantage of the A.T.&T. divestiture. It should benefit, according to Mr. Westergaard, if other common carriers expand their 3 percent market share of the long-distance telephone market to a projected 35 percent by 1990. **********Third-quarter results reached record levels at Digital Switch, with $35 million in revenues and 27 cents a share in earnings. Mr. Westergaard expects the company to earn $1.50 a share in 1984. The final bid for its stock yesterday was 35 1/4. **********Vishay Intertechnology is the world leader in strain gauges for materials stress analysis, with 70 percent of the market. It grew at a 25 percent annual rate before 1980, then overspent for what it thought would be a strong economy. **********''With the economy on the upswing, we would expect Vishay to resume its 25 percent growth rate over the next few years, leading to earnings of $1.70 a share in 1984 and $2.15 in fiscal 1985,'' Mr. Westergaard said. It closed at 18 3/4 yesterday. **********''National Micronetics seems poised to experience strong growth during calendar 1984,'' he said. ''Two-thirds of the company's sales are 5.25-inch Winchester disk-drive products, and it is no longer dependent on the I.B.M.-compatible drive market, which had been hurting National Micronetics' profitabilty during the last year.'' **********Mr. Westergaard believes the company will benefit from the sale of Winchester disk-drive original-equipment manufacturer heads, growing from sales of $26 million in the fiscal year ended June 30 to more than $50 million in the present fiscal year. Yesterday's close was 13 3/4. **********Monolithic Memories, which manufactures high- performance integrated circuits, reported record sales of $105 million and earnings of 60 cents a share for its fiscal year ended Oct. 2. Equity Research Associates is estimating 50 percent growth in revenues and earnings of $1.20 a share in the fiscal year 1984.

Collins, director of research at Laidlaw Adams & Peck Inc. Two he particularly likes are Vega and Comtech, also O-T-C stocks. **********Vega, a biotechnology company, is the leading supplier of instruments for peptide synthesis.

Metromedia stock, which traded around $150 a share in early 1982, had risen to a breathtaking $560. Thus, it had become the most expensive issue on the New York Stock Exchange. **********But at the same time, ''for most small investors, Metromedia was unbuyable,'' said Alan J. Gottesman of L.F. Rothschild. ''A stock split was as inevitable as a volcano melting rocks.'' **********So, on May 10, with its shares at $551, Metromedia followed the example of I.B.M., Superior Oil and other companies that had seen their stock rise to extrordinary heights. It announced a stock split of 10 new shares for every share held as of July 15, to be distributed as of Aug. 15. And in a separate move to share its good fortune, Metromedia raised its quarterly dividend to $1.90 from $1.75, or 19 cents a share after the split. **********Although it may be the outstanding example, Metromedia is one of more than 100 major corporations that have announced or completed stock splits in the last 10 months. Other examples include General Electric, Lockheed, Commodore International, and R.H. Macy. **********And while analysts maintain that stock splits are inevitable in any rising market, there remains much disagreement about when a stock should be split and whether investors can expect to make money by anticipating splits. Technically speaking, a stock split is nothing more than an accounting change in which the assets of a company are redistruted in a greater number of shares. **********''If the fundamental value of a company remains unchanged, it shouldn't matter if the stock is trading at $5 or $500,'' said Arthur E. Rockwell of Crowell, Weeden & Company of Los Angeles. But he added that there was ''almost always a difference between what should technically be true and what investors believe; and it's what the investor believes that counts.'' **********For both the shareholders of stocks that split and the companies that split them, there are often some measurable benefits. But analysts maintain that stock splits are often immersed in as much phychology as sound business judgment. **********In most cases, directors decide to split their stock ''to keep it trading in a range that does not discourage the small investor,'' said Robert Willard, a senior vice president of Prudential-Bache Securities. Mr. Willard regularly consults corporations on when and why they should split their shares. **********For example, he said, many individual investors would be more reluctant to buy shares trading at $80 a share than at $40, even if two of the lower-priced certificates represented an equal holding in the company. This attitude, he added, is often supported by small investors' tendency to buy stock in round lots of 100 shares. **********For companies, a broad base of ownership of their shares among individuals can be an important factor in discouraging takeover attempts. Moreover, such broad ownership tends to moderate the sharp downward swings in stock prices that occur when companies, suddenly faced with bad results, find their institutional shareholders rushing to sell off their holdings. Some analysts said that had Texas Instruments' stock been split prior to the company's announcement last month that it would lose $100 million the second quarter, the resulting drop in its price - by about one-third of its value -would not have been nearly as great. **********But Mr. Willard maintained that it was not always bad policy for companies to allow their shares to trade far higher than most other issues. ''Even though it limits some investors, a high-priced stock can still connote a blue-chip security,'' he said. **********THAT view, however, is not universally held. Exceptionally highpriced stock ''means management is on an ego trip,'' said Fred Anschel of Dean Witter Reynolds. And Samuel Hayes, a professor of finance at the Harvard Business School, said that companies with extraordinarily high-priced stock ''are thumbing their noses at the small investors.'' **********Generally, when companies split their stock, the most tangible benefit to shareholders comes with increased dividends. Often quarterly dividends are increased, as in the case of Metromedia. **********Many believe, however, that the mere announcement of a stock split tends to increase its trading price, regardless of what happens to the dividend. ''Some of it is instinct, some is psychology, but most people think it's easier for a stock to move from $10 to $20 than from $50 to $100,'' said Mr. Anschel. ''And they invest accordingly.'' **********But neither he, nor a half dozen other experts in the field who were asked about the subject, said they would recommend the purchase of shares simply because they expected a stock split. ''It is true that stocks tend to split when companies are doing well,'' said Anne Gregory, publisher of the Merrill Lynch Market Letter. ''If the fundamentals look good, the stock is attractive. But the stock split itself means little more than another piece of paper.'' **********If the splits announced recently have had any impact on the price of the stocks, it has been varied and impossible to measure.  Metromedia shares, for example, appear to have registered little benefit since the announced 10-for-1 split. Last week, the stock was trading at about 545 a share, down $15 from the day of the announcement. **********The Lockheed Corporation, another company that had been expected to announce a stock split, did so last Monday. The aerospace concern, whose shares were trading at $125.50 before the disclosure, said it would seek sharehold approval for a 3-for-1 split to be distributed in August. Its stock has since fallen in the wake of last week's market troubles and closed Friday at $123 a share. **********Meanwhile, examples of companies that may have benefited from splitting their stock can be found on a list prepared by Mrs.  Gregory. In January, her market letter listed 16 companies that it predicted would split their stock before the end of the year, So far, 12 of them have done so. Those on the list that have not include Economics Lab, Federal Express, Standard Motor and Subaru of America. **********The Standard Register Company, one of the companies on the Merrill Lynch list, announced its 3-for-1 stock split on Feb. 17 when its shares were trading at $73. Immediately after the announcement, the shares rose in value, and have continued to hold their advances. By June 2, the day before the new certificates were distributed, Standard Register traded at $101. **********Otto Stock, Standard Register's corporate secretary, said that it was ''impossible to know if the stock split, in itself, was at all responsible'' for the run-up in the stock price. Nonetheless, he added that the stock's performance ''has obviously been very good, and the split could not have hurt.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/02/business/profits-scoreboard-073662.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-08-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 111, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Profits Scoreboard", "print_headline": "Profits Scoreboard", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/12/business/commodities-gold-futures-advance-silver-prices-also-up.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-04-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 584, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Gold Futures Advance; Silver Prices Also Up", "print_headline": "COMMODITIES; Gold Futures Advance; Silver Prices Also Up", "body_text": " **********Gold futures prices advanced yesterday amid increasingly bullish short- and long-term market factors.

Gold climbed to $430.00 in London, from $421.25 on Friday, and in Zurich it hit $427.50, up from $420.75 on Friday. **********In New York trading gold was bid at $430.50 at Republic National Bank, a gain of $9.50 from Friday.  Comex silver followed gold, with the spot futures rising 32.3 cents an ounce, to $11.308, and the active May contract up 32 cents at $11.36. Last week, spot silver futures gained 30.3 cents, and the May contract 29 cents. **********''More important than today's advance in gold is that the market now expects the supply of newly mined bullion to be tight for the rest of 1983,'' said Jeffrey A. Nichols, director of precious metals research at J. Aron & Company, a division of Goldman, Sachs & Company. As a major international bullion broker, J. Aron takes no market position in precious metals or other commodities. **********Basically, Mr. Nichols expects the global output of gold this year to rise less than a million ounces, to 40.7 million ounces.  Meanwhile, the world's jewelry makers and industrial users are expected to increase their consumption to 31.3 million ounces from 27.9 million in 1982, ''provided the worldwide economic situation remains sluggish for the rest of this year,'' he said. **********With demand from central banks, the International Monetary Fund and other global agencies expected to be unchanged at a million ounces this year, the net supply of newly mined bullion available to investors worldwide would be only 8.4 million ounces. **********Last year, private investors took 10.7 million ounces, much of it in Krugerrands and other bullion coins, as well as bars. Since Jan.  1, 1975, when Americans were again able to own gold, the global stock of newly mined bullion available to private investors ranged from 22.3 million ounces in 1979 to the 8.4 million projected for this year. **********''If the global demand from private investors exceeds 8.4 million ounces this year, then they will have to, in effect, bid the metal away from industrial users and each other,'' he said. **********Commenting further on J. Aron's latest survey of the gold market, Mr. Nichols said that bullion prices should also be bolstered by a continued easing of interest rates, explaining: **********''High interest rates reduce gold's attractiveness as an investment and also inhibits industrial users from holding much in the way of inventories and, indeed, reduces consumer demand for jewelry and other items.'' **********The Chicago Board of Trade is also confident that gold will be attractive to investors. Today, the nation's biggest commodity market will start trading futures in one-kilogram (32.15 troy ounces) gold bars. The standard gold futures contract traded on the Comex and other domestic exchanges consists of 100 ounces."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/07/business/company-news-ford-and-chrysler-show-higher-sales.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-04-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 720, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ford and Chrysler Show Higher Sales", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Ford and Chrysler Show Higher Sales", "body_text": " **********The Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation reported today that new car sales rose in the March 21-31 period, by 3.6 percent and 9 percent, respectively.

Arbatov, the Soviet Union's senior expert on the United States, struck a pessimistic tone and said failure to ''make appreciable progress'' on arms this year would make a new round of the arms race unstoppable. **********He said that the present balance of medium-range nuclear forces in Europe was one favoring the United States and its allies, which he said did not need the 572 new American missiles the Atlantic alliance plans to deploy starting later this year. Mr. Arbatov said that, if the Soviet Union were to insist on equality, it would have to deploy missiles near border of the United States. Response to Orlando Speech **********Mr. Arbatov said ''American leaders tell lies'' when they assure the public that the deployment of the United States missiles will induce the Soviet Union to conclude arms-control agreements. He said the truth was that pressures of that kind would only force the Russians into ''developing new missiles of our own,'' however reluctantly. **********The article was a response to President Reagan's speech in Orlando, Fla., describing Moscow as ''the focus of evil in the modern world.'' Although Mr. Reagan told his audience of Evangelical church leaders that he would do all he could to persuade the Russians of his desire for arms reduction, he adopted an anti-Soviet tone echoing an earlier phase of his Administration. **********Mr. Arbatov said Mr. Reagan was ''ignoring all the rules of propriety'' in international relations by condemning Soviet leaders as men who reserved the right to break promises in the pursuit of their Communist goals.'' 'Outright Medievalism **********Referring to the Orlando speech, Mr. Arbatov said that ''frenzied calls are being made for crusades that smack of not just the 'cold war,' but of outright medievalism. And all this is covered up with hypocritical talk about faith and God, about morality, eternal good and eternal evil.'' **********Some Western diplomats saw the Arbatov article as marking a toughening of Soviet attitudes, pulling back from the positive tone struck by Yuri V. Andropov after becoming the Soviet leader four months ago. He then spoke of a possible meeting with Mr. Reagan and appealed to the United States to restore detente and to avoid making arms a test of the two political systems. **********Mr. Arbatov said that, with Mr. Reagan's popularity dropping in the opinion polls, ''the stench of failure hangs over the White House.'' He said that the Reagan team was characterized by provincialism and outright ignorance, adding that some specialists advising the Administration on military policy held such extreme views that they had ''been found to be in need of medical help.'' 'Sobering Up' Is Now Doubted **********Mr. Arbatov said there had been predictions in the West that the Reagan Administration would be forced to ''sober up'' by pressures from the United States' allies, by Congressional opposition to military spending and by the approach of the 1984 election. **********He expressed doubt that the United States would return to ''common sense'' after having deserted it for so long, but he pledged that, if genuine changes did come, the Soviet Union would ''notice them in time'' and ''be a reliable partner in honest talks.'' **********The sort of compromise proposals on the European missile issue being talked of in Washington do not constitute such a change, Mr.  Arbatov said. He said that, from what was known, the so-called intermediate solution being prepared '''will again be nothing more than a propaganda trick,'' since its effect would still be to justify the new missile deployments in Western Europe. **********''Washington will never succeed in persuading the Soviet Union to 'bless' such attempts, to affix its signature to the policy of the arms race and of sharpening tension,'' Mr. Arbatov said.

Orloff, chief executive officer of the Evans Products Company, learned that Victor Posner had begun to purchase a sizable number of shares in his company, his first thought was to resist a takeover. **********But then he found there was no ready means of blocking Mr. Posner, and decided to give the Miami financier a free rein in pursuing the company, which lost $65 million on sales of $1.2 billion in 1982. **********Now, two years later, Mr. Posner owns 43 percent of the Evans stock, and Mr. Orloff is still in charge of the company, which runs a major building materials retail chain and produces truck trailers and rail cars. Mr. Posner, named chairman of the board last April, appears content for now to leave the task of restructuring Evans to its current management. **********''We are confident that the existing management can turn this company around,'' said Steven Posner, Mr. Posner's 40-year-old son and the vice chairman of the Evans board. **********Merger With Sharon Dropped **********Originally, Mr. Posner wanted to merge Evans, which lost $15 million in the first quarter this year, with his Sharon Steel Company. But when the 22 major lenders to Evans rejected the deal last spring, he instead sought a majority representation on the Evans board. **********Since Mr. Posner joined the board, the company, after changing its mind several times, has reaffirmed its original intention to raise cash through the sale of its 340-store retail division, which accounted for $790 million of the company's total sales and $56 million in operating profits last year. The division, which operates stores under the names of ''Grossman's,'' ''Lindsley'' and ''Moore's,'' posted revenue of $155 million in the first three months of 1983, up 12 percent from the first quarter last year. **********Last September, Evans had put its most profitable division on the block, hoping to use the proceeds from the sale to pare its long-term debt of nearly $500 million. Unable to find a buyer willing to meet its stiff price, however, the company has now decided to spin off the retail group as a publicly held company. Analysts Favor Retail Plans **********Evans intends to retain 20 percent ownership of the newly formed retail concern, which will be called Grossman's Inc. The company plans to file its offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission later this month. **********The move must still be approved by Evans's lenders, but analysts say their approval is likely.  ''This could create a company with a market value of over $500 million,'' said Steven Albert, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody in New York, who last week recommended buying Evans stock. ''In one shot, Evans would double the book value of the retail division and get enough cash to almost wipe out its debt.'' **********Nonetheless, Mr. Albert and other analysts agree that Evans is certainly headed for another year in the red. They also agree, however, that the company's prospects, which were dismal last fall, have lately brightened. **********''Admittedly, the jury is still out,'' said Jeffrey Grayson, president of Capital Consultants, a Portland investment firm. ''But Evans is structured to do well in a recovery.'' **********Even with a lift from the recovery in housing, however, Evans may need to sell some of its money-losing operations. The company, which spent $85.3 million last year servicing its debt, must cut $100 million from the principal it owes lenders by March of next year. **********''Evans needs to go through a major reorientation,'' said Dr.  Abraham Zaleznik, a professor at the Harvard Business School, who just left the Evans board to make way for a Posner associate. ''The company has to decide what businesses it wants to remain in.'' Custom Home Unit Terminated **********Evans has already discontinued what was once a major operation.  Last December, the company terminated its custom homes division, which as recently as 1981 was the eighth-largest seller of new single-family homes in the nation. Last year alone, the division lost $31.9 million. **********The main problem with the division is that it lost badly on the construction and long-term loans it made to buyers of the precut homes. ''We lost money on the financing,'' Mr. Christopherson said, ''because we misjudged interest rates.'' **********Even after realizing that mortgage rates were soaring, however, Evans was unable to put a cap on its home-loan portfolio, which increased from $108 million in 1978 to $290 million by the end of 1981. **********''I don't understand how they let it go that far,'' said David Wilson, an analyst with Shearson/American Express in New York.  ''After the 1974-75 recession, they said they would never warehouse mortgages again. But they did.'' **********''It was a Catch-22 situation,'' recalled George Porter, a former Evans comptroller now with Nike Inc. ''To sell the homes, you had to offer attractive financing.'' Greater Emphasis on Leasing **********With the homes operation gone, Mr. Orloff has said Evans plans to concentrate its resources on such profitable areas as the retailing of building materials and the manufacturing and leasing of rail cars and truck trailers. **********Although the rail car business is worse off now than in more than four decades - Evans's rail car shipments declined 60 percent in 1982 - this approach has been approved by Mr. Posner. He has told Mr. Orloff that he favors a continuation of the unusual combination of retail and rail cars because it allows Evans to reduce its tax liability through the sale of investment tax credits. **********With the outlook for rail cars gloomy, however, some analysts doubt that Mr. Posner will have the patience to rebuild Evans. They expect him to seek to recoup his more than $100 million investment in the company by breaking it up. **********''It's not inconceivable,'' said Mr. Albert of Kidder, Peabody, ''that the spinning off of the retail division could be the beginning of a wholesale liquidation of the company.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/10/business/business-people-mobil-official-to-head-alternative-energy-unit.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1983-05-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 284, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mobil Official to Head Alternative Energy Unit", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Mobil Official to Head Alternative Energy Unit", "body_text": " **********The Mobil Corporation yesterday announced the formation of an alternative energy division and the appointment of Jerome F.

Revenue was off 7.1 percent, to $4.20 billion, from $4.52 billion. **********Burlington said that its oil and gas and its coal and minerals operations showed an operating loss in the latest three months, but that its operating income from forest-products management exceeded 1981's for both the latest quarter and the full year. Crown Zellerbach **********The Crown Zellerbach Corporation announced that it had a loss of $146.4 million in the fourth quarter of 1982 contrasted to earnings of $29.2 million, or $1.01 a share, in the fourth quarter of 1981.  Sales dropped 7.2 percent, to $713.8 million, from $769 million. **********For the full fiscal year, the company reported a loss of $112 million, primarily as a result of unusual charges related to selling Crown Zellerbach Canada Ltd. and restructuring its domestic operations. In 1981, Crown Zellerbach had earnings of $75.3 million, or $2.47 a share. Sales in 1982 fell 6.3 percent, to $2.95 billion, from $3.15 billion. Singer **********The Singer Company, citing the impact of the worldwide recession and the impact of the major devaluations of the Mexican peso, reported a loss of $3.2 million, contrasted to earnings in the fourth quarter of 1981 of $3 million, or 11 cents a share. Sales dropped 4.5 percent, to $621.7 million, from $651.2 million. **********For the full year, the Stamford, Conn., company said that it had a loss of $2.9 million, contrasted to earnings of $33.4 million, or $1.93 a share, in 1981.

Andropov's drive to root out official malfeasance gained a new hero today when the Minister of the Interior offered what amounted to a public apology to a 29-year-old merchant marine mechanic who had been the victim of a five-year vendetta by the police. **********The minister, Col. Gen. Vitaly V. Fedorchuk, who is a former head of the state security agency, published a letter on the front page of Literaturnaya Gazeta conceding that the prosecution of the seaman, Nikolai Rozovaikin, had been ''absolutely unfounded.'' Literaturnaya Gazeta is a weekly newspaper often used to reveal wrongdoing that the authorities want corrected. **********In the latest case, Mr. Rozovaikin, a graduate of a merchant marine school in Odessa, set out 10 years ago to find out how several thousand rubles belonging to students had disappeared. His efforts brought him 20 months in jail, dismissal from the party, and three years of work as a sweeper on the docks. **********Friends' pleas finally caught the attention of someone at Central Committee headquarters, and an inquiry began. Today, General Fedorchuk listed half a dozen policemen and lawyers who had been reprimanded or otherwise disciplined, and he described the outcome as a harbinger of what the public could expect from Mr. Andropov's drive ''to strengthen socialist legality.'' **********Mr. Rozovaikin was said to have regained his party membership, work as a shipboard mechanic and admission to the seamen's academy. The inquiry into the missing money was said to have been reopened. **********Some Russians may regard the case as something of an exception that proves the rule. Literaturnaya Gazeta acknowledged how heavily the odds counted against a person seeking redress, even at a time when Mr. Andropov has asked people to come forward with complaints about wrongdoing. **********Speaking of Mr. Rozovaikin, the paper said: ''He generated a wave, and the storm nearly destroyed him.'' His troubles began in 1973, when he graduated with honors from the merchant marine school. He led a group of students to the prosecutor's office to demand an investigation into the disappearance of money earned in summer jobs after an inquiry at school had dragged on for months. **********When he returned to Odessa after a period at sea, he found that several instructors sympathetic to the original inquiry had been transferred or retired. **********Fresh attempts to revive the inquiry led to what the newspaper described as a smear campaign based on the fact that Mr. Rozovaikin had recently been divorced and on his subsequent dismissal from the academy. He was also dismissed from a paid job as an organizer at the Young Communist League. **********When he traveled to Moscow to seek redress, he was arrested by the police after the Odessa police had asked for his return as a ''dangerous criminal.'' **********For 20 months, he was in custody awaiting trial on charges of ''parasitism'' and ''malicious hooliganism.'' The case was based on an incident in which housing inspectors investigating a complaint against newighbors of the Rozovaikins were said to have been abused by Mr. Rozovaikin and physically attacked by his brother, Viktor. **********''Whoever concocted this indictment knew perfectly well that Viktor Rozovaikin had been paralyzed since early childhood, was helplessly incapacitated and physically incapable of attacking anyone,'' the newspaper commented. **********After a six-day trial, the brothers were finally acquitted.  Nikolai Rozovaikin was working as a night sweeper on the docks when the Party Control Commission in Moscow, a watchdog body, took up the case. It finally acted against the policemen, ordering the reprimands, transfers and demotions that were announced today. **********Referring to the Odessa police, General Fedorchuk, the Interior Minister, said, ''Their inquiry was conducted in a superficial manner and on a low professional level that produced gross violations of socialist legality.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/18/world/israel-and-lebanon-sign-agreement-at-2-ceremonies.html": {"writer_name": "David Shipler", "pub_date": "1983-05-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1689, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ISRAEL AND LEBANON SIGN AGREEMENT AT 2 CEREMONIES", "print_headline": "ISRAEL AND LEBANON SIGN AGREEMENT AT 2 CEREMONIES", "body_text": " **********Israel and Lebanon signed a security agreement today that is intended to lead to the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Lebanon and continuing Israeli involvement in policing the country's southern region. **********The agreement came nearly a year after Israel invaded Lebanon on June 6, 1982, with the stated goals of helping to install a Government more acceptable to the Israelis, diminishing Syrian influence in Lebanon and ousting guerrillas of the Palestine Liberation Organization from their military bases and political headquarters. **********In the hope of consolidating these gains, Israel has made its troop withdrawal and the carrying out of the rest of the agreement contingent upon the withdrawal of P.L.O. and Syrian forces from the north and east of Lebanon. The return of all Israelis held as prisoners of war and an accounting of Israelis missing in action are also prerequisites for an Israeli pullout. **********The agreement will be technically completed upon the exchange of instruments of ratification, a formality said to involve another approval by Israel's Cabinet and Lebanon's Parliament. Officials expect this to take place within a week. **********But no aspect of the accord is to go into effect until the Israeli withdrawal. Successful but Fragile **********The agreement, which the United States endorsed as a witness, was a step less than a full peace treaty. But it was the second Israeli success in recent years in concluding a formal agreement on peaceful relations with an Arab neighbor, lending it a symbolic weight much like the Israeli-Egyptian Camp David accords of 1978. **********The signing, at consecutive ceremonies in Lebanon and Israel, took place in a spirit of fragile accord, however, with no certainty that the volatile situation of Lebanon would let the pact be fulfilled.  The choice of the sites for the ceremonies and the cautious remarks of the heads of the delegations testified to the potential for ultimate failure. **********Syria has vehemently denounced the accord and has pledged to block it, although Western and Middle Eastern diplomats see some chance of a Syrian pullout if Damascus obtains a defense treaty with Lebanon, security arrangements at least as extensive as Israel's and generous financial grants from Saudi Arabia. **********In the agreement and its supplements, Israel and Lebanon pledge ''to live in peace with each other,'' ''declare the termination of the state of war between them,'' define the border as inviolable, require each country to prevent the use of its territory by armed bands for attacks on the other and bar hostile propaganda against each other. The 2 Ceremonies **********The first signing ceremony today was at Khalde, a seaside town just south of Beirut where Syrian and Israeli forces fought a tank battle during the Israeli drive to Beirut last summer. Then the delegations flew by helicopter to Qiryat Shemona, the Israeli border town that had lived for years under sporadic rocket and artillery attacks from P.L.O. bases in southern Lebanon. **********The agreement was signed in four languages - English, French, Hebrew and Arabic - by the men who had represented their countries in the five months of negotiations: Antoine Fattal, a retired Lebanese diplomat who was once Acting Director of the Foreign Ministry, and David Kimche, Director General of Israel's Foreign Ministry. Morris Draper, an American special envoy who participated in all the negotiations, signed as a witness. **********The United States is reportedly committed to giving Israel a memorandum, which will be kept secret at Lebanese insistence, pledging American efforts to have the agreement carried out and expressing American understanding of Israel's intention to remain in Lebanon pending a Syrian pullout. **********In brief remarks, all three representatives took note of the uncertain future and portrayed the agreement as but a first step.  Mr. Draper praised the meshing of Lebanese and Israeli objectives, saying, ''They are crossing the threshold of a more satisfactory and sensible relationship.'' He acknowledged ''the obstacles ahead'' and pledged American help in overcoming them. Sacrifices on Both Sides **********''Both countries have been victimized,'' Mr. Draper declared.  ''Their peoples over the years have made enormous sacrifices, and not only in blood and property. There is no one here among either the Lebanese or the Israeli delegations who has not somehow been touched by past tragedies.'' **********Mr. Fattal also said Israel and Lebanon had an obligation to tackle the obstacles still on the horizon. Lebanon was not abandoning the Arab world, he asserted, but was taking ''a step toward a just and lasting peace,'' a phrase, he noted, that appeared in the May 1974 disengagement agreement between Syria and Israel. **********Mr. Kimche made an explicit call on Syria to withdraw. ''I know that the signatures that we have affixed on the agreement are just the beginning of a new chapter in our histories,'' he said, ''that many obstacles still stand in our paths and that there are many who would wish to render the agreement we are signing meaningless. **********''I would like to say to all of those who castigate the agreements and who see peace as a betrayal of their cause, I would like to say to them that you cannot go against the will of the people. And the people of Lebanon, who have proven their strength of determination by maintaining their independent character from the time of the Phoenicians, these people of Lebanon are in favor of this agreement just as our own people are.'' Terms of Accord **********The accord establishes a security region in southern Lebanon running 20 to 37 miles north of Israel's northern border. It is to be patrolled by a maximum of eight Lebanese-Israeli teams and two Lebanese Army brigades maintaining direct communications with Israeli Army officers. Two headquarters are to be staffed by Lebanese commanders and Israeli liaison officers. Lebanese military deployment in the south is to be restricted in numbers of troops and types of weapons. **********A Joint Liaison Committee, including the United States as a participant, is to oversee carrying the agreement out. In that body, a Security Arrangements Committee is to deal with military matters. **********Although the agreement does not establish diplomatic relations, it says each country may, if it wishes, set up a liaison office in the other, a device Israel sees as creating the embryo of an embassy. **********If the agreement leads to an Israeli troop withdrawal, negotiations are to begin within six months after the pullout on normalizing the movement of goods and people across the Israeli-Lebanese frontier.  The agreement says nothing about the interim, but Israeli officials are confident the border can remain relatively open, as it is now, at least to commerce. Sharon's Role in Accord **********Much of the groundwork on the agreement was done last fall by Defense Minister Ariel Sharon, the chief architect of the war, who met secretly with a still unidentified confidant of President Amin Gemayel of Lebanon and drew up a document outlining an accord. Mr.  Sharon then publicized the document, damaging Israeli-Lebanese trust and, in the opinion of Israeli and American officials, setting back the negotiations. **********The final agreement represents some compromise of Mr. Sharon's demands, and he has denounced it as inadequate. Still, it contains many elements of the original Israeli proposal. **********The former Defense Minister demanded limits on Lebanese weapons in the south; the restrictions, scaled down slightly, are in the accord.  Mr. Sharon wanted five outposts in southern Lebanon manned by a total of 750 Israeli soldiers and intelligence agents who would have the right to enter houses and detain civilians in search of P.L.O.  guerrillas. The idea was rejected by Lebanon and finally abandoned by Israel, but joint patrols under Lebanese command were approved. Issue of Major Haddad **********In addition, Israel wanted its longtime client and ally, Maj. Saad Haddad, as the commander of a southern Lebanese Army brigade that would patrol a security zone north of the Israeli border. Major Haddad, who left the Lebanese Army during the 1975-76 civil war to set up his own militia with Israeli arms and training, is not mentioned in the agreement; Lebanon has reportedly offered to make him a deputy commander. **********Major Haddad, it was believed, would open the door to extensive, clandestine Israeli involvement in the region, as he did along a narrow border zone he controlled for years. Through the major, Israel itself could effectively command the southern brigade, creating favorable conditions for the operations of its intelligence agents and elite antiterrorist units. **********In practice, the agreement need not preclude such extensive, clandestine Israeli involvement. Indeed, the accord appears to be less a ceiling on the Israeli role than a foundation for its day-today evolution into a close Israeli-Lebanese military and intelligence partnership. Presumably, Lebanon will send to the south a brigade commander who shares Israel's desire to keep the P.L.O. out and who will therefore welcome quiet Israeli help in doing so. **********The Lebanese have made it clear throughout the negotiations that they would be more comfortable with unwritten understandings along such lines. Lebanese negotiators told their Israeli counterparts repeatedly that there was no need to put everything down on paper, that an oral agreement was enough - and more desirable in terms of Lebanon's ties to the Arab world. **********To help this development of a close, discreet relationship, Israel has selected an old hand at the game to coordinate its relations with Lebanon. He is Uri Lubrani, who has served as the senior Israeli representative in some difficult places, including Uganda, Ethiopia and Iran. **********Mr. Lubrani is reputed to be an official of Mossad, Israel's civilian intelligence agency, who developed a close friendship with the Shah of Iran that enabled extensive Israeli construction contracts, arms trade and other commerce with Iran when Teheran maintained the fiction that there were no relations at all. Israel is counting on him to use his skills in Lebanon."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/22/business/spot-oil-prices-dip-in-london.html": {"writer_name": "Barnaby Feder", "pub_date": "1983-02-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 657, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SPOT OIL PRICES DIP IN LONDON", "print_headline": "SPOT OIL PRICES DIP IN LONDON", "body_text": " **********Prices quoted for most crude oil fell nearly $1 a barrel today on London's spot market. Activity was light, as traders waited for Saudi Arabia and other oil producers on the Persian Gulf to respond to price cuts by Nigeria, Britain and Norway. **********On short-term contracts, North Sea Brent and Forties crudes fell to an indicated price of $28.10, down from $29 Friday. The unsettled mood extended well beyond that market, analysts and industry sources said. **********A spokesman for the British National Oil Corporation, when asked if buyers had responded positively to its proposed price cut, said, ''I don't think anyone wants to wait.'' But he added, ''No one is in a position to move until they see what happens in the Gulf.'' The Government-owned company proposed price cuts Friday of $3 a barrel for North Sea oil sold under long-term contract, and Nigeria followed on Saturday with a price cut of $5.50. Advantage to Nigeria **********Nigeria's cut put its Bonny Light at $30 a barrel. That would give it a price advantage over North Sea crudes of similar quality, which would trade at $30.50 under B.N.O.C.'s proposed change. **********The widely expected response by Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf states is a cut of $4 or more a barrel, with matching moves by other important producers, such as Mexico and Venezuela. The Saudi benchmark price currently is $34 a barrel. **********However, rumors here suggested that the Saudis might attempt a $7 cut, to $27. That would put the Saudi benchmark crude $3 below Nigeria's higher-quality oil, restoring a differential the Saudis think should exist. Nigeria's Stance **********In announcing Nigeria's price move Saturday, Mallam Yahaya Dikko, the nation's presidential adviser on petroleum and energy, said the nation was committed to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. But he also said Nigeria would respond to price cuts by other producers. **********Analysts such as Walter Newton, head of Petroleum Economics Ltd., said they interpreted that remark to mean that Nigeria would act if the Saudis cut their price below $28.50. Nigeria has argued that the maximum price differential with the Saudis should be $1.50 a barrel, the analysts note. **********North Sea oil would continue to have the advantage in most of Europe because of transportation costs, the analysts agreed.  According to Mr. Newton, ''The competition would come in the United States.'' **********The analysts also said it may be several days before it is possible to get a reliable idea of what effect the cuts are having.  It is not clear how quickly oil buyers can shift their purchasing patterns once they determine where the best deals are offered.  Longterm contracts vary widely. Typically, in the North Sea, they resemble B.N.O.C.'s arrangement in which buyers have an annual or multiyear agreement to buy certain quantities of oil, with a provision allowing them to request a renegotiation of the price on a quarterly basis. That renegotiation is involved in B.N.O.C.'s proposed cut. When Cut Would Take Effect **********Buyers dissatisfied with the proposal, after comparing it with other opportunities, can ask for further negotiations. The price cut becomes effective when about 90 percent of B.N.O.C.'s buyers are satisfied. Those that are still unhappy have a month to find other supplies and bow out of the contract. **********Companies can also plead unforeseen circumstances and seek interim price changes. If an agreement cannot be reached in 14 days, the companies can escape from the contract. The Gulf Oil Corporation is said to have cited this provision as a basis for refusing two shipments of B.N.O.C. oil in the weeks before the proposed price change. **********''Prices are crumbling steadily,'' said a trader at one of the larger trading houses here. ''But there is hardly any market activity. It was even slower today because New York was closed'' for Washington's Birthday."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/04/business/profits-scoreboard-209182.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 111, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Profits Scoreboard", "print_headline": "Profits Scoreboard", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/02/business/monitor-labs-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-june-30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-08-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 69, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MONITOR LABS INC reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "print_headline": "MONITOR LABS INC reports earnings for Qtr to June 30", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/24/world/anglicans-losing-ground-in-britain.html": {"writer_name": "Jon Nordheimer", "pub_date": "1983-10-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 940, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ANGLICANS LOSING GROUND IN BRITAIN", "print_headline": "ANGLICANS LOSING GROUND IN BRITAIN", "body_text": " **********Jutting out on a hillside overlooking the fields of Cheshire, St. John's is a simple Anglican parish church. **********In its graveyard there is a marker remembering the 155 men and boys from Alsagers Bank who died in a mine explosion in 1918. A brass plaque on the church wall lists 47 men from the village killed in World War I under the inscription ''Faithful Unto Death.'' **********Elsewhere there is another list with the names of the vicars who have served the parish since St. John's was built by a wealthy landowner in 1875. The last name on the list is that of Leslie Hamlett, and in Alsagers Bank and through the entire realm of the Church of England, that name now inspires intense and divided feelings. **********Last month Father Hamlett gained sudden notoriety when he announced he was leaving the Church of England to become a Roman Catholic. Other Anglican priests before him have made the same decision, but what made the announcement so unnerving was his statement that he was taking 40 of the parish's 42 active members with him. **********This defection to the Catholic Church is believed to have been unprecedented in the 449 years since Henry VIII defied the Pope and set himself up as head of a state church.   A Precipitous Decline **********Those who have watched the surge of interest by ''Anglo Catholics'' inside the Anglican clergy for a reconciliation with Rome were not completely surprised by the priest's change of faith. But the decision by the congregation to follow him was unsettling to those already worried by the Church of England's precipitous decline in a country in which it claims to be the official state religion. **********Their defection comes at a particularly bad time for the Church of England, which is facing a decline in active membership and financial resources, while the clergy continues to clash over articles of faith, liberalizing trends and the church's mission. **********While nearly 30 million people in Britain have been baptized as Anglicans, only 1.8 million remain active in the church, a figure that has fallen from 3 million in 25 years. **********In the last century church attendance and Anglican influence in English society seemed as natural a combination as the tea and cakes that followed a Sunday service. Only the English monarch was required by law to be a member of the Church of England, but in terms of social, economic and educational networks it was an indispensable asset. Yet on a typical Sunday today fewer than three-quarters of a million worshipers go to church.   Methodism, Too, Is Slipping **********A decline in church attendance is not an exclusive problem of Anglicanism. Methodism, the other great Protestant voice competing for the souls of the British, has also weakened. **********It is the Roman Catholic Church, which is much closer to Anglicanism in structure and ritual than the Anglicans are to the Protestant evangelical faiths, that has been prospering in England. The number of Catholics in England has doubled since 1930 to nearly 5 million. **********Moreover, the Anglo-Catholic renewal movement inside the Church of England is now thought to embrace one-third of the active church membership and clergy. **********Several Anglican parishes in the Stoke-on-Trent area, which includes the village of Alsagers Bank, already use the Roman Catholic service and hear confessions, and some vicars like Father Hamlett are Roman Catholics in all but name. Their practices are tolerated if not shared by the leadership. **********Many of the villagers in Alsagers Bank are not as charitable. They suspect that Father Hamlett ''brainwashed'' his congregation from the day he took over the parish 17 years ago. Others who did not like his services elected to attend the Anglican church in the next village.   Attempt at Rebuilding **********Now some like Frank and Mary Webb are trying to rebuild St. John's along the traditional lines that they feel were neglected by Father Hamlett. **********''By the time he left there were not a lot of village people left in his church,'' said Mrs. Webb. **********Father Hamlett, an intense man of 55 years with bushy eyebrows and a trim gray beard, now meets with his breakaway flock for daily masses in a center for the handicapped, or in the house that he and his wife and three children live in on the far side of Stoke-on-Trent. **********He denies he disguised his beliefs. ''I've done nothing subversive,'' he said in an interview in his home, a large house along rows of industrial row dwellings behind the old factories that for more than a century have turned out some of the world's best china under names like Wedgwood and Spode. **********His intentions, he said, were fully outlined three years ago in a letter to the Archbishop of Canterbury. **********He said he left the Church of England instead of working with fellow Anglo- Catholics ''from the inside'' because of the liberalizing trends that he said introduced obstacles to communion with Rome. **********In Alsagers Bank the villagers who stayed away from St. John's during Father Hamlett's tenure are now trying to save the church. **********But the verdict on whether they can stay together may have to await the end of feelings of enmity some feel for Father Hamlett. All across the English countryside, in villages that are virtual copies of Alsagers Bank, small parish churches like St. John's stand empty and unattended, admired from a distance by passing tourists and ignored by most of the townspeople."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/20/business/citicorp-net-up-17.5-bank-america-off-19.6.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Bennett", "pub_date": "1983-04-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 620, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BANK AMERICA OFF 19.6%", "print_headline": "CITICORP NET UP 17.5%; BANK AMERICA OFF 19.6%", "body_text": " **********Despite sharp increases in its problem loans, Citicorp, the nation's largest bank holding company, reported yesterday that its first-quarter net income rose 17.5 percent, to $228 million, from the $194 million earned in last year's first quarter. **********In California, the BankAmerica Corporation, the nation's secondlargest banking concern, reported a 19.6 percent decline in net income, to $120.3 million, from $149.6 million. But BankAmerica asserted that its net income in the first quarter last year was distorted upward by $31 million because of a retroactive accounting change. **********It contended that a truer picture of its year-to-year results would be obtained if the $31 million were deducted from its net income in the first quarter of 1982. On that basis, BankAmerica's earnings rose 1.4 percent. **********The main element in the strength of Citicorp's profits was a $214 million rise in net interest income, the difference between the amount of interest Citicorp paid for its funds and the amount of interest it received on its loans and investments.

Actual loan losses amounted to $71 million, up from $62.1 million.  Problem loans rose 24 percent, to almost $3 billion, from $2.4 billion. Such loans represented 4 percent of BankAmerica's total loans. **********Its annual rate of return on each $100 of total assets dropped to 39 cents, from 50 cents in the 1982 quarter. Bankers Trust **********At Bankers Trust, net income rose 15.3 percent, to $61.1 million, in the first quarter of 1983, from $53 million in the comparable period of 1982.

Federal housing funds were to help those low-income tenants who chose to buy or remain as renters under the noneviction plan. A leading Harlem-based real estate firm was hired as the managing agent. And hundreds of nonresident families had expressed interest in buying apartments there. **********The 150 vacant one- and two-bedroom apartments that were to be available to outsiders ranged from 498 square feet to 935 square feet and were to cost from $7,000 to $12,000. **********And conversion of the Dunbar - which occupies the square block bounded by 149th Street, 150th Street, Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard and Frederick Douglass Boulevard - conforms to its history. The development, with apartments around a spacious courtyard, was built in 1927 by John D. Rockefeller Jr. as the city's first large cooperative for blacks. **********Although that cooperative failed during the Depression and the apartments have been rented since, the current conversion plan seemed to be a no-fail proposition. It has not failed, but now it seems much less promising. The buoyant optimism among the Dunbar's owners and city officials has disappeared amid a welter of accusations and countercharges. **********The imbroglio has prompted the state Attorney General's office to delay acceptance of the conversion plan. It has brought about a rent strike by some tenants and a tenant- versus-owner suit in Manhattan Civil Court. It has led the managing agent to seek to withdraw from the project. It has forced one bank to miss mortgage payments on the project to another bank. And it has raised the question of whether the completion of the renovation will meet the deadline for the use of Federal money. **********Basically, the many-sided dispute centers on whether the owner, the Goldome Bank for Savings, has properly maintained and renovated the complex. **********Tenants such as Mary Ann Holmes, a 15-year resident, charge that maintenance has deteriorated since the conversion plan was announced. Dissident tenants, most of whom apparently do not want the building converted, also complain that Goldome officials have deliberately not rented vacant apartments to make it easier to gain tenant approval of the proposed conversion. **********But Frances Levenson, vice president of Goldome, insists that the repair and renovation work done thus far has met city standards. She said the vacant apartments were not rented because they were to be sold as co-ops. **********Both sides agree that many tenants oppose the conversion plan, even on a noneviction basis, because the necessary renovation entails a restructuring of the rents. **********The top rent for a two-bedroom apartment is now under $400; in the conversion plan, it could rise to $530. **********Although the city has pledged the use of Federal and other housing funds to help eligible tenants meet the increased rents, the restructuring would mean a rise in the amount all tenants pay for rent. **********Miss Levenson said a combination of the Dunbar's relatively low rents, the nonpayment of rent by striking tenants and the lack of income from the vacant apartments had brought about a severe shortfall of operating funds. **********The shortfall, estimated to be at least $50,000 a month, has forced Goldome to go into arrears on its payments to the National Consumer Cooperative Bank and on its own mortgage. The Washington-based institution had contributed $5 million to the project with the understanding that it would become a cooperative. **********Other money for the $11.8 million renovation to prepare the complex for conversion came from Goldome itself and from the city's low-interest Participation Loan Program. **********The tenants' lawsuit asks the court to take direct responsibility for the building's management from Goldome and to give it to a court-appointed administrator. The suit is to reopen Monday before Judge Ralph W. Sparks after a month's hiatus. **********An informal meeting Wednesday between Judge Sparks and representatives of the dissident tenants and the savings bank has left open the possibility of a settlement. **********It was at that meeting that George Brooker, president of Webb & Brooker, the managing agent, said in exasperation that his firm would cease its involvement in the Dunbar. **********''I hope something good happens to it because it's a valuable piece of property,'' he said later during an interview. ''But we're not going to waste any more energy on it.'' **********Miss Levenson of Goldome, however, was more optimistic. Whether the property is converted to a cooperative, she said, is ''a minor issue.'' She declared, ''The important point is that the property is made viable and provides good housing for the people who live there.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/26/business/brunswick-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 155, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRUNSWICK CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "BRUNSWICK CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/26/business/briefs-124282.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-08-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 293, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Acacia Mutual Life Insurance Co., Washington, said it had agreed to purchase the Calvert Group Ltd. ***********  Boeing Co., Seattle, said a new West German airline had bought two of its 757 jets for about $85 million. **********The airline, Lufttransport-Sued A.G. of Munich, is the 10th customer and the first in Europe for the 757. ***********  Houston Natural Gas Corp.  said it reported a year-end, nonrecurring write-off of $39 million against operating earnings for the fiscal year ended July 31.

This holds true for data processing, a technical area that is increasingly indispensable to the widespread sales and inventory requirements of retailers. **********While the processes may be similar, corporate policies may vary widely. For example, Sears Roebuck & Company, the world's largest retailer, will be hiring between 40 and 100 new people a year in the next few years for its data-processing operations. But few will need computer-science degrees, since Sears has found that math, English and home-economics majors - and its own people - fit its training and salary requirements better. **********The J.C. Penney Company, on the other hand, the nation's third largest general merchandise retailer after Sears and K Mart, will seek out computer-science graduates for the 60 recruits it expects to hire annually after having largely dropped its training program. The New York-based company had an elaborate training activity, involving liberal arts and math and other majors, but found that it had ''a lot of people on board who were not productive,'' according to its systems chief. **********The Associated Dry Goods Corporation, however, wants more experienced people with better management skills but not necessarily a better formal education, but will continue to hire some entry-level people. The big New York based-retailer, which operates Lord & Taylor, Caldor discount stores and the J.W. Robinson department stores in California among others, is expanding its in-house training of data-processing personnel but wants them to come in with a strong background. **********If these varying needs and criteria seem confusing to entry-level applicants or young careerists looking for a job change, they need not be dismayed. In fact, although the nation's retailing has hardly been one of the growth sectors during the two-year recession, its employment potential for data-processing personnel may be brighter than any other major segment in the economy. Two major reasons are the continuing expansion into new stores and increasing sophistication of store computers and their applications. **********CHARLES A. Carlson, vice president for data processing and communications at Sears, said that ''Generally, I see a bright potential for employment in this field. In retailing in the 1980's,'' he added, ''we are changing the way we do business. We are getting the information that data processing gives us to the points where it needs most to be used. That will make better merchants of us. On sales input and inventory replenishment, for example, we will be ableto fill our pipelines from up-to-date information rather than on data that is days and weeks old.'' **********At Sears, which last year had revenues of $25 billion, almost every possible major application has already been made of data processing, including accounting, payroll, order processing, inventory management and credit. **********''But there are better ways of doing all those things,'' Mr.  Carlson said, ''We have to take advantage of having all that information at our fingertips and we think that's a great opportunity for us at Sears.'' **********As a result, at his company and at most other retailers, he feels that the data-processing job potential is quite promising.  Penney's has been encouraged in its quest for better-trained people by the fact that ''some schools are doing a fine job in their computer-science programs,'' according to Robert Capone, vice president and director of systems and data processing. He said that Penney recruiters typically visited those schools, held parties and gave students a rundown on what Penney's processing facilities are like. **********Schools Mr. Capone cited that have computer-science programs near Penney's data-processing facilities include Hofstra University on Long Island, only 20 miles from Penney's Manhattan headquarters; Marquette University in Milwaukee, where Penney operates its catalogue, distribution and stores-data facility; and the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, where the company has its pointof-sale data center. About 150 people are employed in each data center, Mr. Capone said, each of which hires between 15 and 20 people a year. **********THE big push in retailing systems activity, especially the refinement of internal communications, is of great interest to Associated Dry Goods Corporation, which will stress this factor in its enhanced in-house training. Peter F. Gundell, director of systems planning for Associated, noted that a growing number of universities were offering degrees, not only in computer science, but also in management-information systems. He gave as examples the State University of New York at Albany and the University of California at San Diego. **********An integral part of that extension into communications, Mr. Gundell feels, is the move of retail systems into two-way information exchange, known as an interactive system. ''This, of course,'' he said, ''eliminates the former keypunch operator, who was a link in a system that was reiterative and wasteful.'' Now, he said, the user is both entering and retrieving information quickly. Keypunch people are being retrained, and many are finding new careers in a changed technology.'' **********Yet while the opportunities for entry at the major retailers are obviously growing, there are some developments that create opportunities for those who already work there. At Sears, for example, a centralization policy in the merchandising operations has created a ''pool of people available for reassignment,'' according to Mr. Carlson. Assignments are being changed as the company seeks to ferret out the most promising people within its ranks - those who already know both data processing and the way the company works. **********Training sessions at Sears, in which about 35 ''students'' meet at the company's Sears Tower in Chicago, last 16 weeks. They involve both classroom and store-application training. ''We tried to cut the course to 12 weeks,'' Mr. Carlson said, ''but found that it hurt the quality level.'' **********How high can a successful Sears applicant climb? ''They all start from a common base of programmer,'' Mr. Carlson replied, ''and go as high as national manager - and even higher.'' But because Sears will be trying to transfer more of its existing staff into systems operations, the entrant will be competing with Sears regulars."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/28/business/sloan-technology-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-01-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 57, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SLOAN TECHNOLOGY CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "SLOAN TECHNOLOGY CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/07/world/around-the-world-un-chief-in-africa-urges-namibia-solution.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 136, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.N.

''But you have to put things in perspective. The numbers are going up from a very low base.  You must remember that 1982 was a bloodbath.'' **********One reason for the industry's nosedive was the recession. ''We just went through the worst recession since World War II,'' said James A. D. Geier, chairman of Cincinnati Milacron, a major machine tool manufacturer. ''It went on so long that people just stopped buying machinery.'' **********A second reason was imports. Their share of the domestic market has jumped to 33 percent, up from 21 percent in 1979. **********Looking Ahead **********Noting that industry orders - an important part of capital goods spending - lag behind the rest of the economy by six to eight months, Mr. Geier predicted that they will continue to pick up in future months. **********Mrs. Conigliaro forecasts that in 1984, orders may reach $3 billion, comparable to 1981 levels. **********But David G. Sutliff, an analyst with Salomon Brothers, doubts that orders will soon approach their historical highs. ''In the cycle of capital goods spending in the late 1970's,'' he said, ''three of the largest machine tool customers - automobile, aerospace and oil and gas - were very heavy spenders. This was especially true with the auto industry's retooling for smaller cars. Their orders just won't be as large this time around.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/25/business/kimberly-clark-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-01-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 55, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "KIMBERLY-CLARK CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "KIMBERLY-CLARK CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/29/business/article-075582-no-title.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-11-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 110, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Article 075582 -- No Title", "print_headline": "Article 075582 -- No Title", "body_text": " **********The Treasury announced plans yesterday to sell $10 billion of additional bills in three auctions this week. **********The bills will be sold in minimums of $1 million.

Within five years, she helped turn around the retail banking operation. Working with community bankers, she encouraged them to take on small business and personal loans that were profitable, and to bring in low-cost deposits. She set up a processing center in Rochester for government-guaranteed student loans and she won the respect of her colleagues. **********Now Citicorp, with a more complicated problem, has turned once again to Mrs. Peabody. In acquiring the failed Fidelity Savings and Loan Association of San Francisco last September and transforming it into a new entity called Citicorp Savings, the Eastern corporation inherited an operation with deposit losses of $350 million and a constituency bitter about Fidelity's past lending policies and the lending in South Africa by Citibank. Citicorp, the parent of Citibank, also faced a torrent of protest when it crossed the state line into California. The problem was turned over to Mrs. Peabody, who was named president and chief executive. **********''Citicorp recognized this as a troubled company,'' says Mrs.  Peabody, who at 41 years of age is one of the highest ranking women at Citicorp. ''Our primary focus is to get on the road to recovery and back into the loan market.'' That revival has begun. **********The takeover was much contested by the California thrift industry and others concerned about the impact of the Eastern giant on the California market. Citicorp won Federal Reserve Board approval last September to become the first United States bank holding company to acquire an out-of-state savings and loan association and the first New York bank to be able to collect consumer deposits in the lucrative California market. **********Fidelity, with 80 branches in central and northern California, many in inner-city neighborhoods, had assets of $2.9 billion. In renaming it Citicorp Savings, Citicorp barely avoided a restriction imposed by the Federal Reserve Board on it not to use the word ''bank'' in the name. **********Now, said Mrs. Peabody, deposits are up by $153 million, the company has re-entered the mortgage market and is now offering the new consumer products allowed by Federal rules that went into effect Dec. 14. Expansion to the lucrative southern California market is a major item on the agenda for the future. **********''She was sent to California to do the same job that she did upstate,'' said Will Sparks, director of Citicorp's advertising and public affairs and Citibank's external affairs. ''She was the obvious person to do it. She was not sent because she's a woman, but because she's a good banker. She's a tough administrator but she works hard herself.'' **********In fact, Mrs. Peabody decries reference to her being a woman. ''We are people in business,'' she said, emphasizing the word ''people.'' She added: ''Sex doesn't matter.'' **********Mrs. Peabody is terse and businesslike, with a tomboyish quality and a penchant for purple and smart suits. She is a good listener, cordial and economical with words. A male colleague, who asked not to be identified, said that Mrs. Peabody had come up through male ranks at a time when it was unusual for women to do so, which may account for her no-nonsense demeanor. **********She is characterized by former co-workers at W.R. Grace and colleagues at Citicorp - the only two places where she has worked since receiving an M.B.A. in finance from the University of Virginia in 1963 and a B.A. in economics from Rice University - as demanding, and a team player who is not afraid to speak out and to whom her colleagues listen.BORN in Longview, Tex., the daughter of a building supply company o wner and a high school algebra teacher, she and her brother, Joe, w ho is now an executive for Exxon in London, got their first taste ofb usiness when they worked in the family lumber yard. **********Mrs. Peabody maintains a long-distance marriage with Arthur W.  Peabody, 39, a strategic planner for the Allied Corporation, whom she met at W.R. Grace and married in 1970. They have maintained separate homes since 1978, when she moved to Rochester. He owns a house in Morris Plains, N.J. She has purchased a three-bedroom condominium in Orinda, Calif., which is 15 minutes from her Oakland office. **********In changing jobs, Mrs. Peabody's responsibilities widened. In upstate New York, she was in charge of 35 branches with assets of $2 billion and a work force of 650 people. At Citicorp Savings, she runs an operation with $2.9 billion in assets, 80 branches and 900 employees. **********She believes in listening to community leaders - potential customers - and her subordinates. But some community activists in minority-dominated Oakland remain cautious about what they expect from the new owners of Fidelity, which had been accused in the past of having the worst ''red-lining'' record in California. **********''We hope they don't come out here and run roughshod over us and shoot 'em up,'' said Paul Cobb, executive director of the Oakland Citizens Committee for Urban Renewal. His organization, the Alameda County Legal Aid Society, a public interest law firm known as Public Advocates, and other groups presented testimony before the Federal Reserve Board at the takeover hearings in October, asking the new owners to ''remedy'' what Mr. Cobb called Fidelity's ''neglect'' of the minority community. The groups also are angry over Citicorp loans to South Africa. **********''Our concern was that Fidelity had a terrible lending record, and whoever took it over had an obligation to correct it,'' said Clifford Sweet, the Alameda County Legal Aid Society's director. **********At a meeting Dec. 6 with Citicorp, the group advocated a program that included development of affirmative action loans, a minority member on the Citicorp board and a minority committee to advise Citicorp Savings. Mrs. Peabody was not at that meeting, however, nor were other top Citicorp officials whom she was shepherding on a visit to the new acquisition. Their absence prompted Angela Blackwell, an attorney with Public Advocates, to wonder aloud whether Citicorp was taking their concerns seriously. **********Mrs. Peabody says it is. ''They may not like everything we tell them, but we are looking at their concerns seriously,'' she said.BANKERS and savings and loan executives in California are publicly c alling the arrival of Citicorp Savings healthy competition.  P rivately, some are fearful that smaller savings and loans may be h ard-pressed to match what former California Savings and Loan C ommissioner Linda Tsao Yang, called the potential for ''ruthless c ompetition.'' **********Mrs. Yang was suspended from her job for eight days last fall after voicing opposition to the takeover. She fears that Citicorp is in a position to program losses over a long time to gain market share at the expense of California competitors. ''My concern is the people of California,'' she said. ''Is it to their advantage to set up this kind of ruthless competition? A number of small S.&L.;'s may be forced to combine with others or go out of the business.'' **********On the surface, at least, the competition is not acting scared.  Hallam Dawson, president of Crocker Bank of San Francisco, said, ''We thought this was not the way to go about it,'' he said, referring to Citicorp being allowed to cross state lines by regulatory action rather than by legislation. After the Citicorp takeover, Congress passed legislation allowing ailing thrift units to be merged with institutions from other states. **********William Mortensen, president of First Federal Savings and Loan of Santa Monica, and past president of the California Savings and Loan League, believes that consumers will benefit. But, he added, ''almost all of us have a twinge when competition increases. It probably will sharpen up competition.'' He does not believe smaller savings and loans will be driven out of business by Citicorp Savings, but he admits that a lot of league members do not agree. **********''We're waiting for the other shoe to drop,'' said Marian Sandler, president and chief executive officer of World Savings and Loan of Oakland, with operations in Kansas and Colorado. ''You can't just plunk down a New York operation in California unless you're willing to spend a lot of money. They may at the worst take a little bit of business from everybody.'' **********Although she has never lived in California, Mrs. Peabody plans to bring her Eastern expertise to bear in Citicorp's new market. And she has taken to California with enthusiasm. Although her life revolves around her work, she plans to take up golf again - she shoots in the 90-handicap range when playing well. She relaxes with spy novels and traveling, preferably to quiet beaches. And she plans to stay in California for a while. ''I like California very much. I like the people. I think it might be a good place to retire. It fits in with my lifestyle.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/21/business/market-place-how-fertilizer-group-is-doing.html": {"writer_name": "Vartanig Vartan", "pub_date": "1983-09-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 718, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place; How Fertilizer Group Is Doing", "print_headline": "Market Place; How Fertilizer Group Is Doing", "body_text": " **********AFTER a two-year slump, fertilizer issues are one of the best-performing groups in the stock market. Standard & Poor's index of four fertilizer stocks, in fact, has increased 55 percent so far in 1983. Meanwhile, brokerage house comments on shares of fertilizer producers, along with recommendations on other farm-related stocks, have generally been favorable. **********For example, two leading producers of fertilizer - the Williams Companies and the International Minerals and Chemical Corporation - have been recommended by Shearson/American Express. Oppenheimer & Company has also recommended Williams. And International Minerals has been cited by Moseley, Hallgarten, Estabrook & Weeden Inc. as ''worthy of consideration as a beneficiary of rising farm incomes.'' **********Even some stock market letters have issued favorable comments on the fertilizer sector. The Professional Tape Reader, a publication based in Hollywood, Fla., mentions Beker Industries and the First Mississipi Corporation in its list of stocks that ''can be selectively bought on weakness.'' **********The stock issued by the aforementioned companies are the four components of the fertilizer group index, although there are other chemical companies that depend to a lesser extent on fertilizer for earnings. The worst drought in nearly 50 years has sharply reduced this year's corn and soybean crops, and that is viewed by industry analysts as enhancing the prospects for phosphate, nitrogen and other fertilizers.  But a new appraisal by the Value Line Investment Survey takes a less optimistic view of this group in terms of potential price gains in the stock market from now on. In particular, the investment advisory service warns that price/earnings multiples for these companies are ''high,'' even when based on next year's estimated profits. **********''These stocks, buoyed by continuing hopes, may well perform as well as the market averages for the next six months or longer, but we think the current price/earnings ratios are unsustainable over any considerable length of time,'' Value Line said. ''The optimists, or those who have bid the stock prices up, think that resurgent fertilizer demand will push fertilizer prices up to the point where producers will be making a lot of money. **********''The less sanguine - and we count ourselves among them - agree that demand will recover. However, considering the more-than-ample capacity for all fertilizer materials, the competition for market share, the loss of export markets because of the dollar's strength and the encouragement of imports by that same strength of the dollar, we are less inclined to expect a significant rise in fertilizer prices.'' **********Value Line also said that margins within the industry currently are so thin that many producers are losing money on fertilizer. ''More volume at tissue-thin margins,'' it added, ''won't produce any bonanza.'' **********Meanwhile, Standard & Poor's Outlook suggested this week that, after recent price advances in fertilizer stocks, ''the group may require a period of consolidation before extending its gains.'' The Outlook expects aggregate earnings of the four producers in the index to drop about 30 percent this year, with this forecast skewed adversely by the results for Beker Industries. A ''gradual recovery'' in industry profits is envisaged for 1984. **********In yesterday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Beker was unchanged at 12, while First Mississippi fell 3/8, to 13 5/8. Meanwhile, International Minerals closed at 45, down 5/8. Williams Companies last traded on Friday when the stock rose 3/8, to 26 1/4. **********In a current technical commentary on these stocks, Justin E. Mamis, a consultant to Wertheim & Company, said he continues to regard the fertilizers as ''still an O.K. group.'' He went on to observe, however, that the group ''needs a rest.'' **********Standard & Poor's Outlook also took a look at other stocks related to the farm economy. ''At current prices, we believe Deere is fully valued on an interim basis,'' it said. ''International Harvester and Massey-Ferguson are viewed as high-risk speculations and should be avoided by the average investor. However, Allis-Chalmers, a diversified machinery maker that is less dependent on sales to agricultural markets than its major competitors, is worth holding speculatively.'' **********On the Big Board yesterday, Deere slipped 3/8, to 39 3/8. Harvester closed at 9 1/4, unchanged, while Massey-Ferguson finished at 5 3/4, also unchanged, and Allis-Chalmers inched up 1/8, to 18 5/8."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/13/world/canada-s-new-tory-leader-bilingual-and-stylish.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Kaufman", "pub_date": "1983-06-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 867, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CANADA'S NEW TORY LEADER: BILINGUAL AND STYLISH", "print_headline": "CANADA'S NEW TORY LEADER: BILINGUAL AND STYLISH", "body_text": " **********Brian Mulroney, a 44-year-old lawyer and businessman who defeated former Prime Minister Joe Clark late Saturday in a contest for the leadership of the Conservative Party, has sought to project himself as a model Tory and a new kind of Canadian politician. **********For one thing, in a party that has had its share of high-born patricians, Mr. Mulroney has stressed his working-class roots as the son of an electrician in the pulp and paper town of Baie Comeau, north of Quebec City. **********For another, in a party that has scorned French-speakers and been scorned by them in return, he has made his bilingual fluency his major selling point. And finally, in a party and country where politicians have worked their way up through the ranks, he has never sought or won elected political office. **********Mr. Mulroney's victory came after four months of often divisive campaigning that intensified as public opinion polls showed that Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau and his Liberals were lagging behind the Conservatives in popularity. A Good Image on Television **********Pierre Berton, a journalist and Canada's foremost popular historian, noted that Mr. Mulroney was a different kind of leader from any who had preceded him, and suggested that his image may be well suited to the television age. Many agree that Mr. Mulroney, well-coiffed, well-tailored, with a resonant voice, has the television presence of an Academy Awards show host. **********He is married to the former Mila Pivnicki, the Yugoslav-born daughter of a Montreal psychiatrist. They have three children.  All during the three-day convention Mr. Mulroney seemed instinctively aware of the cameras, smiling and pointing at some friend in the crowd just as the cameras zoomed in on him. **********All of this is in stark contrast to Mr. Clark, the man he defeated, whose closest aides regarded his lack of television presence as his largest liability. Mr. Clark, who comes from Alberta, endured often brutal criticism during his seven years at the party's helm, most of it based on his often awkward appearances on television. When he took over the reins of the party as a largely unknown 37-year-old he was dubbed ''Joe Who.'' **********No nicknames have yet emerged for Mr. Mulroney. It is the popular conception of his followers that his forceful style will lead the party to victory against the Liberals who have ruled Canada for the last 20 years except for the nine months that Mr. Clark was in power. A general election has to be called within a year and a half. **********Despite this appearance of aggressive toughness, Mr. Mulroney has kept most of his options open on most issues. Like all of the other Tory candidates, he has come out for freeing and expanding the private sector of the economy, for encouraging foreign investment, for improving relations with the United States and for testing the United States cruise missile in Canada. He has also favored the reimposition of capital punishment. **********But on issues of constitutional change, in which he once differed with the Conservative provincial premiers, his position was diplomatically amorphous. Similarly, on the economy, he has stressed both job-creation and deficit-cutting. **********He explained part of the ambiguity of his responses by harking back to his experience as a labor lawyer and negotiator, saying ''You never give anything away before you sit down at the bargaining table.'' **********The key, however, to Mr. Mulroney's successful campaign was his stress on his Quebec origins and ability to speak French. A graduate of Quebec City's Laval University, Mr. Mulroney kept repeating at virtually every meeting that in Canada there are 102 federal constituencies in which at least 10 percent of the population speaks French, and that in the 1980 election Mr. Trudeau's Liberals took all but two. ''You give Pierre Trudeau a head start of 100 seats and he'll beat you 10 times out of 10,'' he said. Election Challenge Ahead **********Such statements and his claim to dent Liberal dominance in Frenchspeaking Canada may soon be tested. Mr. Mulroney, having won the party leadership, will now try to win a seat in Parliament. The Liberals, who control 74 of the 75 seats in Quebec, may force byelections in some of those seats, in effect taunting Mr. Mulroney. **********Mr. Mulroney's aides have said they would resist that temptation, preferring to run in districts of their choosing rather than in those selected by Mr. Trudeau. Mr. Mulroney, the aides suggested, will probably run in a safe Conservative district outside Quebec where a current Conservative Member of Parliament will step aside for him. **********Though he has not run for elective office, Mr. Mulroney has been active in Tory politics since his college days.  He has worked as a specialist in labor law and came to prominence as a member of a bipartisan commission in Quebec that investigated graft and corruption in the construction industry. Since 1978, he had been the president of the Iron Ore Company of Canada, where he was credited with restoring positive labor relations that led to heightened productivity and record profits."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/17/business/your-money-various-taxes-on-municipals.html": {"writer_name": "Leonard Sloane", "pub_date": "1983-09-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 844, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Your Money; Various Taxes On Municipals", "print_headline": "Your Money; Various Taxes On Municipals", "body_text": " **********MANY investors in municipal bonds who buy them primarily for their exemption from Federal taxes are unaware that such bonds are nevertheless taxable in other ways. **********A major development recently in the taxation of municipal bonds - debt obligations of states, cities, authorities and other jurisdictions that are exempt from Federal income taxes by virtue of a doctrine specifically stated in the Constitution - appeared in the 1983 Social Security Act Amendments. **********These amendments will make some Social Security benefits subject to Federal income tax for the first time beginning next year. In determining whether these benefits will be taxed, tax-free interest income from bonds and other sources is included in modified adjusted gross income, with the new tax levied on those whose income exceeds certain thresholds. **********While the inclusion of municipal bond income in computing the Social Security benefits tax is new, state and local taxation of this income has long been in effect. And the degree and categories of state and local taxation can be confusing to both holders and potential holders of municipal bonds. **********Forty-four states and the District of Columbia levy some kind of tax on individual owners of municipal issues. Most states, moreover, provide at least limited advantages to in-state municipals over out-of-state bonds by wholly or partially exempting in-state bonds from state taxes. Yet the extent of state taxes is not so great as it may seem, because of the difference between the nominal tax rate and the effective tax rate. **********Take the case of state income taxes on municipal bonds. The nominal, or posted, rate is the level legislated by the state - and such maximum rates range from a low of 2.2 percent in Pennsylvania to a high of 17.6 percent in Minnesota. The effective, or actual, rate, though, is normally much lower since the real cost of these taxes is derived by allowing for the tax savings by deducting them from gross income on your Federal return. **********For example, the nominal maximum tax rate in New York State is 14 percent for annual incomes of more than $23,000, with an additional maximum of 4.3 percent in New York City for annual incomes of more than $25,000. But a taxpayer in the top 50 percent Federal income tax bracket would have an effective rate of 7 percent for state tax and 2.15 percent for city tax - a total effective tax rate of 9.15 percent. **********''The lower the Federal marginal tax bracket, the more expensive the state tax,'' said Steven J. Hueglin, executive vice president of Gabriele, Hueglin & Cashman Inc., a securities firm. ''That's because the value of your deduction is less with a lower Federal bracket.'' **********Therefore, municipal bond investors should compare the effective after-tax return on in-state bonds with the effective after-tax return on out-of- state municipals. For the advantage of purchasing in-state bonds depends principally on the weight of the state tax burden. **********''If the nominal tax rate is 10 percent or higher, it's enough of an advantage to stay with in-state bonds,'' Mr. Hueglin asserted. His reasoning is that a nominal rate of 10 percent is equivalent to an effective rate of 5 percent for someone in the 50 percent Federal tax bracket. **********Although the income tax on municipals, the annual tax on coupon return, is familiar to most persons, there are two other lesser-known kinds of taxes on these securities - those levied on personal property and those on capital gains. Personal property taxes are populist in origin and are imposed by about a dozen states, primarily in the Middle West, and excluding New York. **********Depending on the state, such a tax typically ranges from $1 to $5 for each $1,000 of par or market value. Portfolios are generally evaluated at the end of each year to calculate the amount of the tax. **********Capital gains taxes on municipals, applicable in most states, should be evaluated independently of income taxes. The tax on capital gains is paid just once when the bonds are sold or mature and is often due even in many of the states that exempt income from in-state or out-of-state bonds from state income taxes. **********Furthermore, with the maximum long-term Federal capital gains rate at 20 percent, the state capital gains tax on municipal bonds is usually at a different effective rate than the state income tax. For instance, the maximum New York State capital gains rate is 2.8 percent - 20 percent of the top 14 percent rate - and the maximum New York City capital gains rate is 0.86 percent - 20 percent of 4.3 percent. The effective tax rate on capital gains then for a New York City resident is 3.66 percent. **********''The state taxability of a municipal bond plays an important part in many investment decisions,'' Mr. Hueglin said. ''Awareness of the cost of state taxes, and of the cost of avoiding them with double- exempt bonds, is essential in today's market.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/17/business/patents-improving-on-electric-motor-unit.html": {"writer_name": "Stacy Jones", "pub_date": "1983-09-17", "snippet": "WASHINGTON AN electrical device patented for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has money-saving potential for private users.

''Do not compel me to move into the extreme measures that you know of. If necessary, I will do so.'' **********Opposition leaders reacted angrily to the President's statements, charging that the Government had created the conditions that had led to civil disturbances. **********(In Washington, a White House official said the clashes might make it ''very difficult'' for President Reagan to proceed with his visit to the Philippines in November. But Elliott Abrams, Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights, said the State Department was recommending that Mr. Reagan go ahead with the trip.  He said that the Philippine civil rights situation had improved since the killing of Benigno S. Aquino Jr., the opposition leader, and that there was now ''a very real amount of free speech, free press and free assembly.'' Page A8.) New Protests Planned **********Former Senator Salvador H. Laurel, leader of an opposition coalition, said demonstrations against the President would continue. Another opposition leader, former Senator Jose Diokno, said at a news conference that plans were being made for boycotts, sitdowns and civil disobedience campaigns to bring pressure on Mr. Marcos to resign. **********Jaime Cardinal Sin, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila, said in an interview that President Marcos should schedule new presidential and parliamentary elections soon as ''the only solution'' to the country's political unrest. **********In his television speech, Mr. Marcos announced a new ban on the possession of firearms outside the home, and warned that violators would be prosecuted ''to the full extent of the law.'' He said he was conferring with his military and police commanders on arming the security forces, which he said he had instructed earlier to ''exercise extreme tolerance'' in handling demonstrations, avoiding the use of guns. **********''I have ordered them to defend themselves,'' he continued, referring to forces assigned to monitoring political demonstrations in the future.   'Day of National Sorrow' **********The clashes began Wednesday night as several thousand students, armed with rocks, bottles and homemade explosive devices, attempted to march on the presidential palace after a large but peaceful rally in central Manila called to mark a ''day of national sorrow'' over the death of former Senator Aquino. He was slain Aug. 21 as he left a plane under military escort at the Manila International Airport on his return from three years of self-exile in the United States. **********''It was the first time I had seen businessmen at such a demonstration,'' Cardinal Sin said today of the rally, held in front of the central post office in Plaza Bonifacio and attended by crowds estimated to total 500,000 people. It was also an anti-Marcos event, marked by incessant shouting of slogans demanding that the President resign. **********The date, Sept. 21, was chosen for the rally because it was the 11th anniversary of the imposition of martial law by Mr. Marcos, and also a month to the day since Mr. Aquino's death. **********Opposition leaders today accused the Government security forces of unnecessarily attacking the students with clubs and then opening fire. The marchers were finally stopped a quarter of a mile from the presidential palace, but bonfires blazed in various sections of the city through the night, and there were a few separate incidents of looting and burning.   'Proper Reception' for Reagan **********''Responsibility for the violence that rocked Manila last night rests solely with the Government,'' said Mr. Diokno, leader of an opposition umbrella group called Justice for Aquino, Justice for All. **********He also said that the opposition groups planned ''a proper reception'' for President Reagan when he arrives in Manila on an Asian tour in November, but did not elaborate. Opponents of the Reagan visit have urged him not to come, arguing that his appearance would be viewed as support for Mr. Marcos and his authoritarian rule. They have also expressed fears that security measures would not be sufficient to protect the President. **********The prelate said in today's interview that new elections would be a successful antidote for the political unrest provided that they were seen to be conducted in a ''clean and honest'' manner. The first step, he said, must be to replace all the present election officials, who he said had ''lost their credibility.'' **********He also urged scrapping the present Constitution, which puts no limit on the number of six-year terms the President may serve and makes no provisions for a successor if the chief executive dies or becomes incapacitated. President Marcos has been in office since 1965; his present term ends in 1967. **********The prelate said there should be a return to the 1935 Constitution, which was drawn on the American model and provided for a vice president who would be next in line for the top office."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/12/business/american-well-service-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-03-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 62, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AMERICAN WELL SERVICE CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "AMERICAN WELL SERVICE CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/18/business/godfather-s-pizz-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 55, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GODFATHER'S PIZZ reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "GODFATHER'S PIZZ reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/29/business/flick-tax-exemption-revoked-by-germany.html": {"writer_name": "John Tagliabue", "pub_date": "1983-12-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 651, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FLICK TAX EXEMPTION REVOKED BY GERMANY", "print_headline": "FLICK TAX EXEMPTION REVOKED BY GERMANY", "body_text": " **********The West German Economics Ministry said today that it had revoked tax exemptions awarded to the Flick industrial group in 1976 and 1978 when it acquired its stake in W. R. Grace & Company of New York. The announcement widened the impact of a major investigation into influence peddling within the Government and the financing of political parties. **********The Government spokesman, Peter Boenisch, said the tax exemptions, which were granted to Flick because it reinvested in Grace the bulk of $690 million in capital gains from the sale of shares in the Daimler-Benz automobile company, were based on ''incorrect circumstances.'' **********Manfred Kiesewetter, a Flick spokesman in D\"usseldorf, denied this, and said Flick would challenge the decision before an administrative court. If upheld, the decision would require Flick to pay an estimated $163 million in back taxes, in addition to possible interest payments. Tax experts estimate the entire bill could reach $254 million. **********In a statement, the ministry said Flick had received tax exemptions under German laws that permit such rulings for companies that reinvest capital gains abroad in ways ''beneficial to the national economy.'' It said Flick contended that potential close links between its subsidiaries, including the Dynamit-Nobel chemical company, and units of Grace, would favor development of Germany's energy industry. **********But the ministry said its investigation, which was begun after a study of documents supplied by the Bonn prosecutor, brought to light ''no significant cooperation in noteworthy areas or of noteworthy dimension.'' **********Sale of Grace Stake **********The prospect of heavy back taxes has raised the question of whether Flick will be forced to sell its stake in Grace to raise needed cash. Mr. Kiesewetter denied Flick had any intention of selling those stocks. **********''We would not have gone to court if we did not intend to treat Grace in the future as we treated her until now,'' Mr. Kiesewetter said. **********The Government decision is closely related to charges brought earlier this month by the Bonn prosecutor against Economics Minister Otto Lambsdorff and his predecessor, Hans Friderichs, who is now chairman of the Dresdner Bank. **********The prosecutor said he had determined that to obtain tax waivers on the capital gains arising from the 1975 sale of a 29 percent interest in Daimler-Benz, Eberhard von Brauchitsch, Flick's former deputy chairman, paid Mr. Friderichs $140,740 in cash between 1975-77 and paid Mr. Lambsdorff $50,000 in 1977 and 1980. **********Mr. von Brauchitsch, who kept records of the payments, was indicted, as were Horst Ludwig Riemer, a former Free Democratic Economics Minister in North Rhine-Westphalia state, and Manfred Nemitz, another former Flick employee. **********Mr. Friderichs, as Economics Minister, allowed a tax waiver in 1976, when Flick paid about $140 million for its first stake in Grace. Mr. Lambsdorff, who became Economics Minister in 1977, granted a further concession in 1978, after Flick paid about $250 million to raise its share in Grace to 25.1 percent. Both men have denied any wrongdoing. **********Economics Ministry officials could not say how, if at all, the tax decision would affect the pending criminal case. Officials of the prosecutor's office were away from their offices for the Christmas holiday and not available for comment. **********Through subsequent acquisitions, Flick has increased its Grace holding to 13.6 million shares, or 28 percent. **********In a statement released today in D\"usseldorf, Flick attributed the failure of planned projects between Grace and its other affiliates to the ''changed world economic situation, a fact that lay outside the sphere of influence of both companies, and was unforeseeable for all parties, including the ministry.'' Flick also argued that the ministry failed to meet a Nov. 30 deadline for revoking the tax exemption. **********Mr. Kiesewetter said Flick had pursued cooperative projects with Grace in coal-processing technology that the companies were forced to drop after falling oil prices made coal-derived energy products uncompetitive."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/03/business/berry-industries-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-26.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-03-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 89, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BERRY INDUSTRIES CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 26", "print_headline": "BERRY INDUSTRIES CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 26", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/10/business/national-gypsum-co-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 74, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NATIONAL GYPSUM CO reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "NATIONAL GYPSUM CO reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/07/world/briton-admits-he-left-secrets-on-the-subway.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-01-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 139, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Briton Admits He Left Secrets on the Subway", "print_headline": "Briton Admits He Left Secrets on the Subway", "body_text": " **********A British information officer admitted today that that he lost secret Government documents in a London subway train. **********Extracts from the documents, which the officer was taking to a European Economic Community meeting, were later published in a radical weekly London magazine. **********Robin Gordon Walker, 36 years old, a senior officer with the Central Office of Information, was fined the equivalent of $883 at Bow Street Magistrates' Court after admitting a violation of the Official Secrets Act. **********''It seems to me that you have been a fool rather than a knave,'' the magistrate, Ralph Lownie, told him as he passed sentence.

Morgan's friends by surprise.  When the 41-year-old executive vice president for marketing at P hilip Morris Inc. announced July 8 that he was quitting to become t he new chairman and chief executive of Atari Inc., many were s tunned. ''I uttered an expletive,'' said James C. Bowling, Philip M orris's director of corporate affairs. Added William Ruder, p resident of the public relations firm that bears his name: ''I a lmost dropped dead.'' **********And, to hear him tell it, no one was more surprised than Mr.  Morgan himself. ''It was fate,'' said Mr. Morgan, who had worked at Philip Morris for 20 years, almost since the day he left Princeton.  ''I honestly believe with all the bones in my body that this is probably the only situation that could have gotten me out of Philip Morris.'' **********Indeed, his decision to make the drastic shift from cigarettes to computers is a striking one and raises the question: Can a consumer goods marketer who is successful with one product - Mr. Morgan made his mark with Marlboro, Merit and Virginia Slims cigarettes - duplicate that success with a totally different product in a completely different industry? **********Mr. Morgan, clearly, thinks he can, come Sept. 6 when he moves to Atari. ''The universal principles of marketing to the consumer far transcend individual nuances between different industries,'' said Mr. Morgan, while puffing on a Merit cigarette. ''Once the consumer has elected to use a product, it's my job to convince him to use my brand.'' **********But it is more than simply switching products. For starters, Philip Morris and Atari are vastly different companies. Philip Morris, with sales of $11.7 billion, is pure Eastern establishment. It traces its lineage to turn-of-the-century England, where a predecessor company was the tobacconist for King Edward VII. In modern times, it is credited with some of the shrewdest marketing of consumer goods, including Miller beer, Seven-Up soft drinks and a cigarette lineup that includes Marlboro, Merit, Benson & Hedges, Lark and Parliament.  It is characterized by stability and deep ranks of well-trained managers. **********Atari, on the other hand, is a California upstart. Less than a decade old, it traces its origins to a coin-operated video game called Pong. Initially run by entrepreneurs and engineers in Tshirts, Atari was once one of the fastest-growing companies in the nation, climbing to about $2 billion in sales on the crest of the video game craze. It is a company without much of a corporate heritage. **********The differences in the cultures of the two companies are striking, and Mr. Morgan is not the first person to make the transition from a consumer packaged goods company to computers. Earlier this year John Sculley moved from the presidency of Pepsico's Pepsi-Cola Company subsidiary to become Apple Computer's president and chief executive. **********But what compounds the challenge for Mr. Morgan is that he is taking over the reins of a deeply troubled company. Its breakneck growth came crashing to a halt last December as oversupply and new competition shattered the company's core home video game and home computer business. **********The company recorded stunning losses - after a record of 31 consecutive profitable quarters - and turmoil spread through management ranks. In the first quarter of 1983, Atari had an operating loss of $45.6 million, which mushroomed to $310.5 in the second quarter, a striking contrast to the $111.8 million profit it posted in the second quarter of 1982. Atari's most recent quarterly loss was cited by its parent company, Warner Communications, as the cause of its own much-larger-than-anticipated loss of $283.4 million. **********At least 1,700 manufacturing and 1,000 white-collar workers out of some 7,000 domestic employees have lost their jobs in Atari's effort to cut costs. **********In the midst of the troubles, Mr. Morgan's predecessor Raymond E.  Kassar resigned under a cloud. Mr. Kassar, who was known as a mercurial executive, is now being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission for insider trading violations after he had sold 5,000 shares in Atari's parent, Warner Communications, immediately before the announcement of a sudden earnings drop at Atari. **********Largely because of these many differences, Mr. Morgan believes that his job is cut out for him. ''My goal is to get Atari to be like Philip Morris,'' said Mr. Morgan, who works out of a modest office overlooking Grand Central Station that has few decorations except for a poster-sized photograph of Cheryl Tiegs in a Virginia Slims advertisement. ''The biggest challenge is to transfer the culture of Philip Morris into a company that got too big, too fast and hasn't yet understood how to be a big company and a successful big company.  I know how to do it. I've been part of building and executing the management philosophy here.'' **********But why would a successful executive in his prime - and one, according to all accounts, with a chance of one day heading Philip Morris - give up this stability for the turmoil and uncertainty of Atari? ''I think I reached the point in life when the idea of doing something different was compelling,'' said Mr. Morgan, a trim man with a quick smile, who nearly bursts out of his chair with his animated style of talking. IN fact, it was a decision that almost crept up on Mr. Morgan w ithout his really knowing it. ''This came right at a time that I wasm ost primed,'' he said. ''A combination of factors had happened that s et me up to take the big step.'' Among those factors, he recalled, w as that he had passed age 40, and ''I realized I was no longer in t he first half of my life,'' he said. **********And, just prior to the Atari offer, he had attended his 20th class reunion at Princeton, which gave him a chance to look at the unexpected twists and turns that the lives of others had taken. Then, one day, he heard the news that a close journalist friend had been reported killed in Central America along with two other journalists.  The news that his friend was among those killed later turned out to be unfounded, but ''I lived through the death and resurrection of a friend,'' he said. **********So, when Gerard R. Roach, chairman of the executive recruiting firm of Heidrick & Struggles, called, Mr. Morgan, who had steadfastly turned away all such recruiters, agreed to have lunch with Steven J.  Ross, Warner's chairman. ''On one hand I felt I was being very adventuresome to have lunch,'' said Mr. Morgan, ''but I was equally upset because I was cheating on the company I loved. I felt guilty.'' **********The rest happened quickly. That Wednesday lunch was followed by another the next day with Warner top executives and by Friday, Warner made an offer - for a reported $10 million over a seven-year contract. Mr. Morgan would not comment on the financial details, except to say his compensation was tied to the profits of Atari, while Mr. Roach would only say that the $10 million figure was ''conservative.'' **********Mr. Morgan, who said he owned a video game but was not familiar with computers when he was named to his new job, said he was attracted to Atari primarily for nonmonetary reasons -the strong personal chemistry he felt with Warner's top management, the chance to head a company and the numerous challenges that are inherent in trying to turn around a company with as many problems as Atari. **********''The whole thing moved like the speed of light,'' said Mr. Roach, who added that Mr. Morgan's departure ''shook Philip Morris because he had a dead shot at the top.'' Those at Philip Morris certainly agree. Said Philip Morris's Mr. Bowling, who has known Mr. Morgan since Mr. Morgan came to the company: ''This is not something we are accustomed to. We've never lost anyone.'' **********Added Kenneth S. Olshan, chairman of Wells, Rich, Greene Worldwide, the advertising agency for both Philip Morris and Atari: ''Jimmy was a lifer at Philip Morris. It took a one-in-a-million opportunity just to get him to talk.'' **********To the financial community, Mr. Morgan is an unknown and he is the subject of much speculation. ''I can't say his moving to Atari is that far-fetched,'' said Emanuel Goldman, an analyst with Montgomery Securities. ''Both are technologically driven marketing companies.  The process of cigarette making has become very high tech and Morgan's move to Atari is not that far afield from the environment he came from.'' Added Christopher Kirby, an analyst with Sanford C.  Bernstein & Company: ''The biggest thing needed at Atari is discipline. They don't know where the company is or is going. He's got to be the riveting factor for all the arms of Atari.'' **********Mr. Morgan's friends are confident he will do just that. ''Knowing Jimmy, he'll create order,'' said Mr. Olshan.  In his years at Philip Morris, Mr. Morgan rose through the ranks and ultimately was associated with some of the company's most memorable cigarette campaigns. He started as a salesman in 1963, fresh out of college with a wife and baby daughter in tow (he now has two daughters), and made his mark by becoming so well versed in sales figures that even the chairman would call him when he needed a quick statistic. He moved up to become a brand manager for various cigarettes, including Marlboro, which was by then an established product, and later assumed the top cigarette marketing position. **********He helped introduce Merit, a low-tar, full-flavored cigarette. In doing so, Philip Morris entered a market in which such cigarettes had never before delivered on their taste promises. In fact, 90 percent of the smoking public had tried - and ultimately rejected - low-tar cigarettes that promised, but failed to deliver on, their taste claims. **********''Our problem was: How do you go back to the well one more time?'' said Mr. Morgan. In the face of such deep consumer skepticism, he helped develop the ''Merit Taste Test'' campaign, in which the results of taste tests showing a preference for Merit were widely advertised. The cigarette went on to become a huge success. HE also helped mastermind the introduction of Marlboro Lights, in w hich he had to make sure that the new cigarette would not take s mokers away from regular Marlboros. The campaign - which was pitchedt o non-Marlboro smokers and stressed the differences in the c igarettes - accomplished just that. ''Our fear was that we could h ave undermined Marlboro,'' he said. **********While he said his plans for Atari are still being formulated, he already has some thoughts. After his first visit to Atari, he was surprised to find the company housed in a series of separate buildings, some 20 miles apart. His first task will be to bring management together, through daily meetings in one spot and, eventually, perhaps to build a single headquarters building. He wants to move the company more into home computers, which now represent about 21 percent of sales, as well as educational tools, and make Atari less dependent on games. which represent about 77 percent of sales. At the same time, however, he wants to retain the ''fun'' aspect that games provide and adapt this quality to a more educational setting, making these computers more ''user friendly.'' **********As his first order, he wants Atari to define exactly which businesses it is in and which it wants to be in, and he wants to provide an organizational stability so that employees can stop worrying about personnel turmoil and focus instead on the tasks at hand. And he said he will stress quality -''My goal isn't to be the biggest, it's to be the best. And if you are the best, size will take care of itself,'' he said. **********While concerned about the larger issues of Atari, he also plans to take some time out to get a personal sense of consumers' wants. He's already planning to spend about three days roaming consumer electronic stores to watch people buy home computers and listen to their thoughts. And he plans to spend a brief stint as a clerk in a computer store. He will be doing this after relocating to California from his home in Old Greenwich, Conn., where his wife and one of his daughters will remain for about a year until the daughter graduates from high school. (The older daughter is in college.) In all, Atari is providing the personal change he sought - but not without some mixed emotions. ''I'm depressed about leaving Philip Morris,'' he said. ''But I'm exhilarated with what I'm going to and that exhilaration outweighs my depression.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/11/business/briefs-debt-issues.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-07-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 304, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Debt Issues", "print_headline": "BRIEFS; Debt Issues", "body_text": " *********** Hardwicke Cos. said it has not paid the semiannual interest payments due June 30 on $22 million of subordinated debentures. *********** Pennsyvania Real Estate Investment Trust said its $35 million offering of 20-year convertible subordinated debentures due Aug.1, 2003, was priced at par. **********Common Stock *********** Action Industries said shareholders have approved an increase in the number of authorized shares to 10 million, from 2,268,000, and a 3-for-1 stock split declared earlier by the company's board. *********** Computer Devices Inc. is offering one million shares at $11.25 per share, through A.G.

In an earlier vote, Gibraltar and its 30,000 people gained the top status. **********The other two, lesser categories have no automatic right of residence.  Citizens of British Dependent Territories include 3 million people in Hong Kong, Bermuda, Belize, the British Virgin Islands and a handful of other far-flung island and Antarctic territories. **********For Hong Kong's residents, the right of moving to Britain is a crucial issue, with the lease of the New Territories from China running out in 1997 and Peking apparently determined to reclaim sovereignty. **********But those in the British Overseas Citizen category are even worse off. About 1.5 million people contained in it, mainly members of Chinese and Asian minority groups who opted for British citizenship when independence was granted to Britain's east African colonies and Malaysia, cannot pass citizenship on to their children without approval from London.

Thus, the companies seem to face a choice of either restricting sales of their most profitable models or paying millions of dollars in fines. **********One idea under study at the Transportation Department is to permit the companies - G.M.'s situation is considered much worse than Ford's - to include high-mileage light trucks when calculating their status under the corporate average fuel economy, or CAFE, rules. Another idea is to allow the auto makers to borrow against future credits. There is more flexibility than generally acknowledged in administering the standards, one official insists. **********The auto makers must meet a requirement this year of 26 miles per gallon, which rises to 27 m.p.g. in 1984 and 27.5 in 1985 and succeeding years. The companies are already drawing down credits earned when they substantially exceeded the standards for earlier years, but a G.M. official said last week that revised estimates for sales of big cars make it unlikely the company would be able to build up any future credits. **********The Transportation Department is eager to find a way to resolve things - short of scrapping the standards. **********The department may have another option in current law. The law gives the department the right to roll back the 27.5 m.p.g. standard to as low as 26 m.p.g., and, subject to Congressional veto, to below 26. Since the Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that the legislative veto is unconstitutional, the Administration may now have complete freedom of action. **********Payment-in-Kind Decision **********In the next few weeks the Administration must make a crucial decision on whether or not to renew the payment-in-kind crop program, under which farmers this year could obtain corn and other products from Government-controlled surpluses in return for not growing them. **********The program has proved to be a bonanza for most farmers who participated, but it is regarded by many in the Administration as a disaster. These critics complain that the idea is totally contrary to the supply-side philosophy of encouraging production rather than discouraging it. **********A month ago it was decided to renew the program for the winter wheat crop. But a general extension seems face long odds. **********The Sept. 12 crop report, an Agriculture Department official indicated, will probably put an end to the payment-in-kind program.

Not much, perhaps, but turning. In its midyear review of the 1984 budget figures in July, the Reagan Administration projected a deficit for the current fiscal year of $210 billion, slightly above its January estimate of $208 billion. **********But with only September remaining in the current fiscal year, the Office of Management and Budget now thinks the figure may be more like $207 billion, largely because defense spending is a bit less than expected. The deficit should keep heading down as the recovery continues to generate new tax revenues. Next year, the Administration has predicted, the figure should drop to $180 billion. That level, however, would still be three times greater than the last deficit of the Carter Administration. **********Briefcases **********- The Occupational Safety and Health Administration says the number of its inspections climbed 14 percent, to 32,093, in the first half of the 1983 fiscal year.

Roberto d'Aubuisson, the president of the Constituent Assembly, is the leader of Arena. **********Colonel Ochoa said that although Mr. d'Aubuisson was a friend, he was also a ''politician'' and ''I am a soldier.'' ''I support all the parties and all the people,'' Colonel Ochoa said. ''We are not breaking with the democratic process; we are breaking with the Defense Minister.'' **********Only a few soldiers were stationed along the narrow road to Sensuntepeque Friday. One roadblock was set up before the turnoff to Cabanas and the soldiers there turned back some travelers. Beyond this roadblock, Colonel Ochoa's men had set up two others and were searching buses before they passed through. **********Colonel Ochoa said today that he was in contact with Colonel Adolfo Blandon, a representative of the military high command who spent two hours with him Friday in Sensuntepeque, but that the colonel had not offered any solution. He added that he had called Col. Jose Domingo Monterrosa of the Atlacatl Battalion in San Salvador and that the colonel had said he would remain neutral. **********Colonel Ochoa also said that the Air Force commander, Col. Juan Rafael Bustillo, had expressed his support.  Colonel Bustillo could not be reached for comment. **********As Colonel Ochoa talked, more than 700 peasants from the province were being bused in a group to a rally in the town square. People Express Support **********Some carried signs saying their city or party supported Ochoa. ''He has the support from the biggest man here to the littlest,'' said Luis Hernandez Segovia, a 44-year-old farmer. **********As Colonel Ochoa walked out to the square, the crowd began to chant: ''Ochoa! Ochoa! Ochoa!'' The colonel spoke to the crowd for about 10 minutes, reaffirming his intention to remain in Cabanas. ''I want to stay here to help the people of Cabanas,'' he said. ''I have received calls from members of the armed forces and I have their support.'' **********The farmers of the province, who help Colonel Ochoa's troops by forming civil defense units, have not been bothered by the guerrillas since June, and most interviewed said they supported the colonel.  Colonel Ochoa said about 800 peasants participated in the local defense units. 'All Happy With Him' **********''We are all happy with him,'' said Rosa Amana. As the people heard her talking to a reporter they began to gather around and nod as the 78-year-old woman said that she only wanted Colonel Ochoa to protect Cabanas. **********Some people in Sensuntepeque were unhappy with the standoff between Colonel Ochoa and the military command. ''These colonels are just substituting one power for another,'' said a young supermarket worker who said she attends college in San Salvador. ''We are the ones that are left here, we are the ones that end up getting killed.'' **********Colonel Ochoa, who has been critical of the American military advisers in El Salvador, said he wanted the people of the United States to ''understand that our struggle is against the Minister of Defense.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/21/business/loss-in-quarter-for-air-florida.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-03-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 85, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Loss in Quarter For Air Florida", "print_headline": "Loss in Quarter For Air Florida", "body_text": " **********Air Florida System Inc. has announced that it had a deficit of $29.4 million in the fourth quarter of 1982, compared with a loss of $19.3 million in the fourth quarter of the preceding year. **********Operating revenues dropped 26.5 percent, to $50.1 million, from $68.2 million. **********The Miami-based company said that it had a loss of $93.4 million for the full year, compared with a deficit of $5.9 million in 1981.

Her modest Century City office in central Los A ngeles is bombarded by scripts and movie ideas from producers and w ould-be producers. She ''takes'' endless meetings, interrupting themf or telephone calls from the other coast, Europe and Australia. **********The reason for Mrs. Deknatel's popularity is that she has some $85 million to spend next year on a new category of entertainment: the made-for-pay-TV movie. **********Mrs. Deknatel is the 40-year-old vice president of made-for-pay motion pictures at Home Box Office, which, with 12 million subscribers, is the largest single cable channel and the most aggressive new force in entertainment. Established in 1981, HBO Premiere Films, as the new venture is called, has already underwritten a handful of movies. **********The first, ''The Terry Fox Story,'' about the young Canadian who lost a leg to cancer and then tried to run cross-country to raise money for cancer research, was shown on HBO last month to a sizable audience. The Time Inc. subsidiary plans to bankroll some 24 films next year that will be shown in the United States exclusively on HBO. **********''We'll wait to see how successful they are,'' said Mrs. Deknatel in a recent interview. ''Within the next four or five years, it might be possible to do about 50 a year.'' **********Last week, HBO Premiere Films' ambitions got an important boost when Metromedia, one of the nation's fastest-growing broadcast companies, agreed to acquire at least eight of the films HBO makes over the next two years, and to assist in future productions. The arrangement, which will give Metromedia films to run on a movie network of independent television stations that it hopes to link up by January, should increase Mrs. Deknatel's already substantial budget while reducing the venture's risk. **********At first glance, the British-born Mrs. Deknatel would seem to be something of an anomaly in Los Angeles's gaudy show business world.  Attractive and well-spoken, she presents a marked contrast to the fast-talking New Yorkers who often seem to populate Hollywood. **********But in fact, Mrs. Deknatel's quiet determination also made her something of an anomaly in Britain when she was growing up. The daughter of a trade union organizer, she left Britain 19 years ago because ''there were very few opportunities for a woman in the U.K.  in 1964,'' she said. Some friends sacrificed their careers and ''I wasn't about to have that happen to me.'' Divorced, she has two daughters, aged 11 and 13. **********In the United States, she worked in international management consulting and acquired a master's degree in business administration from Simmons College in Boston. Her first job in the entertainment industry was as a speechwriter for CBS in New York. But the jobs became increasingly high-powered: director of docu-drama for the CBS Broadcast group in Los Angeles, then vice president of NBC's movies and mini-series operation. Before joining HBO in 1981, she was in charge of developing and producing television and feature films for David Susskind. **********''She's a very talented lady,'' said Michael Fuchs, who is president of the HBO Entertainment Group and who hired Mrs. Deknatel. ''In a town that sometimes has a different set of values, she's direct, straightforward and all business. Once we choose a project, no one works harder than Jane.'' **********By underwriting its own movies, HBO is following the lead taken by the television networks in 1969 when, after relying heavily on studio features, they introduced the made-for-television movie. Since then, the television movie has become a network standard, often costing less and getting better ratings than Hollywood's fare. **********HBO dismisses the possibility that, like the television networks, it will eventually replace most of Hollywood's movies with its own.  ''We've always felt that you can't replace the big, pre-sold movies,'' said Mr. Fuchs. Still, he added, ''there's not too many movies out there. To fill our time, we have had to buy a certain amount of product that we've not always been proud of.'' As a result, he said, if HBO Premiere Films proves successful, ''we will buy less'' from Hollywood. **********Showtime, the runner-up to HBO, is making made-for-pay-television movies, too, but with a difference. ''Basically, they serve as pilots,'' said Jim Miller, vice president of Showtime's program planning and feature films. Showtime hopes to underwrite films from which a character or two can be spun off as the basis of several more 90-minute films. ''Continuing characters will be very important for pay television,'' said Mr. Miller. Nonetheless, he added, ''we're not ruling out a one-shot, HBO-type project, if it were right.'' **********To a large degree, what distinguishes the made-for-pay-TV movie from the television movie and the theatrical film is its price tag.  The production of the average theatrical film currently exceeds $12 million, and takes two months or more. By contrast, the television networks allocate about $2 million, and three weeks, to cobble together a movie. The made-for-HBO movie costs about $4 million, and is produced in about a month. **********''Our movies can't look like movies-of-the-week,'' said Mrs.  Deknatel. Nor should they sound like television movies, which are designed mainly to lead into and out of commercials. With longer scenes and more complex dialogue, HBO movies will more nearly resemble theatrical films, she said. BUT the resemblance can go only so far. Financially, Mrs. Deknatel c onceded, ''we can't compete with the major features. We can't afforda Robert Redford or a Goldie Hawn,'' or the special effects of a ' 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind.'' The stars bought by HBO also t end to be slightly less glittery: Elizabeth Taylor and Carol B urnett in ''Between Friends,'' a story of two middle-aged divorced w omen; Bette Davis and James Stewart in ''Right of Way,'' about an e lderly couple threatened by illness, and Jodi Foster in ''The Blood o f Others,'' a dramatization of the Simone de Beauvoir novel. **********The subjects tread a line somewhere between the topicality of television movies and the broader themes of feature films. ''We deal with subjects that aren't subjects of the moment,'' said Mrs.  Deknatel. The reason is partly pragmatic: While a network movie is likely to be retired after it is shown twice in one year, HBO expects to run each of its movies repeatedly over a five-year period. Thus, ''they have to stand up,'' she said. Furthermore, HBO must choose subjects and treatments that differentiate it from free television and justify its fee. **********Accordingly, the subject of rape -which sometimes appears to be the theme of the movie-of-almost-any-week - will be shunned. But incest, a subject still too sensitive for most television programmers, may appear in the HBO lineup. ''We'll handle subjects that the networks won't touch because they are pleasing their constitutents - advertisers as well as viewers,'' Mrs. Deknatel said. **********Still, it might be argued that many of the HBO movie storylines sound suspiciously like movies-of-the-week. Initial reactions to the Terry Fox project were ''it's another disease-of-the-week,'' Mrs.  Deknatel recalled. But she defends it, noting that it contains ''some fairly grueling moments in the cancer ward'' that a television movie would have omitted. **********Similarly, ''Between Friends'' presents another popular TV-movie theme, divorce. But the actual subject, Mrs. Deknatel said, is the developing friendship of two mature women - the sort of theme and characters that are rarely examined by either Hollywood or the networks. ''Most people in television don't admit that people over 50 exist,'' she said, ''while theatrical films, generally, are made for teen-agers.'' **********At this point, HBO maintains, it has no plans to acquire the films it bankrolls. ''It's not a little movie company,'' said Mr. Fuchs.  ''We're licensing them, just the way ABC licensed 'Winds of War' from Paramount.'' But HBO is usually the largest investor in each project, contributing between 50 and 80 percent of production costs and, depending on the size of its investment, sometimes has broader distribution rights. And ''we have full creative control,'' said Mrs. Deknatel. She and her staff look at the daily rushes and the various cuts of a film as it is edited. **********The remaining financing comes mainly from abroad, an unusual source for American television networks. Because most of the films are expected to be exhibited in theaters outside the United States, the ventures have attracted foreign broadcasting companies and venture capitalists interested in box-office revenues. Among the investors, for example, is Goldcrest, the British company that helped finance ''Chariots of Fire'' and ''Gandhi.'' Goldcrest will own, and probably release in cinemas overseas, ''The Far Pavilions,'' a miniseries starring Ben Cross and Amy Irving. In this country, it will appear only on HBO. **********Under current arrangements, HBO will have no share of cinema grosses overseas. Its real interest, however, is in expanding and maintaining its market share in the United States. If the made-forpay-television movies are good, Mrs. Deknatel said, ''it will be another reason to buy HBO.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/02/business/travelodge-international-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-oct-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 70, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TRAVELODGE INTERNATIONAL INC reports earnings for Qtr to Oct 31", "print_headline": "TRAVELODGE INTERNATIONAL INC reports earnings for Qtr to Oct 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/17/business/personal-finance-how-to-sell-grandmother-s-samovar.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-07-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1220, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HOW TO SELL GRANDMOTHER'S SAMOVAR", "print_headline": "PERSONAL FINANCE; HOW TO SELL GRANDMOTHER'S SAMOVAR", "body_text": " **********IN 1962, a California woman bought a picture at a garage sale for $ 4, largely because she liked the frame. Last month the picture was a uctioned by Sotheby Parke Bernet for $57,750. At the same auction, a school district in Seneca Falls, N.Y., collected $286,000 for a p icture that a janitor had been told to throw away 25 years ago but c hose to save. **********Such stories only fuel visions of converting household heirlooms and pieces of art into piles of cash. But most people do not even know how to attempt such conversions. They are familiar with the low end of the collecting market - the world of garage sales and notices on supermarket bulletin boards. And most people have read about the upper end, where vast collections of old masters are sold for six and seven figures. **********But what if you think the silver teapot your great aunt left you warrants more than a tag sale, yet is unlikely to interest Sotheby Parke Bernet or Christie's? There are mechanisms for selling a range of items of more than utilitarian value. There are not only broad resale markets for art, antiques and jewelry, but also for rare books, rugs and carpets, fine wines, classic cars and a vast assortment of memorabilia and collectibles. **********If you think you've got something of value and want to sell it, the first step is to get it appraised. Indeed, obscure and subtle distinctions - the upside-down number on a postage stamp, for example -may give items added value, but only in the right marketplace. ''The essential and pivotal issue is to know what you have before you begin attempting to sell it,'' says Victor Wiener, executive director of the Appraisers Association of America.  Appraisers, who can estimate the market value of nearly anything, are listed in most local Yellow Pages. Moreover, Mr. Wiener's organization, and other appraisers' groups, will provide names of appraisers classified by locality and specialties. **********As an alternative to paying an appraiser, many auction houses and art dealers will provide a free appraisal. Sotheby Parke Bernet, for example, has experts in 50 areas who will appraise anything within those areas brought into the company's Manhattan headquarters. They will also appraise something if you send in a picture, a good description of the item and what you know of its history. **********Once an appraisal is completed, an item's owners may find big surprises - or disappointments. ''It's a wonderful fantasy, but one doesn't usually have a Rembrandt in the attic,'' says Arnold Glimcher, president of the Pace Gallery in New York City. **********If your items are indeed worth something, and you decide to sell them, there are three main alternatives: offer them to a dealer, sell them to collectors or go to an auction house. **********In looking for a dealer, pay attention to specialties. If you have pictures to sell, don't just go to an art gallery; find one specializing in what you've got - etchings or lithographs, Impressionists or Surrealists, etc. If you can't find one by asking around, ''call the Art Dealers Association of America to see who handles what you have,'' says Mr. Glimcher, a member of the organization's board. Similarly, you should go to an antique dealer specializing in the period or kind of item that you want to sell. **********Going in armed with an appraisal gives you some sense of what your item is worth, but it's definitely a negotiating situation. The appraisal is an estimate of what the dealer could sell your item for, but the dealer is going to offer considerably less than what he can get for the item. **********If you do not like the offers you get, a dealer may take an item on consignment. In that case, ''when he sells it you'll get the selling price, minus a 10 or 15 or 20 percent commission, depending on the dealer,'' says Mr. Glimcher. Over all, he notes, ''You may get more by selling on consignment than through an outright purchase,'' but because it may take time to find a buyer, he warns that ''you may have to wait several months for the money.'' **********A second way to sell an item is to go directly to collectors. This works best with memorabilia and collectibles, where dealers are less institutionalized. If you have clay crocks, postcards or old baseball cards, you may be able to sell them at gatherings of collectors or through newsletters. But if you are an outsider in the arcane world of collectibles, ''it's not always easy to understand the nuances of the market,'' says David S. Cohen, who buys and sells stamps from his Wisconsin home through advertisements in stamp publications. **********A third alternative is to use an auction house. The pre-eminent names in the fields are Sotheby Parke Bernet and Christie's. ''Our specialty is the upper end of the market,'' says Sotheby's deputy public relations director, Lyn Snodden, but ''we have things here that sell for less than $1,000.'' In deciding what to accept, Beverly Miller, Sotheby's fine arts representative, says, ''It's hard to put a dollar amount on it. We use our own discretion.'' But art dealers say an item must usually be worth well into four figures for major houses to take it seriously. PAINTINGS likely to fetch $1,000 to $1,500 and other small-ticket i tems are sold in ''Arcade Auctions'' at Sotheby's. These are held ont he ground floor at the same time that similar, bigger-ticket, items a re sold upstairs. But Miss Snodden says these clients still benefit f rom ''an extensive worldwide marketing effort,'' a catalogue and thec achet of the houses. Of course, you pay for this. **********How much? ''As a general rule of thumb,'' says Miss Snodden, ''the consigner is charged 10 percent of the hammer price for anything sold for more than $3,000. For less than $3,000, we would charge 15 percent.'' If the item doesn't sell, Sotheby's still charges 5 percent of the ''reserve'' - the minimum price that the seller and Sotheby's agreed to accept. ''The minimum for anything that doesn't sell is $50,'' she adds, and in addition to the commissions, there is a minimum handling charge of $80. **********There are, of course, local auction houses that tend to have narrower specialties or a smaller customer base. Mr. Glimcher says many of these ''are excellent for less noticeable items.'' **********How do you choose between local and national auction houses? ''If you're dealing with middling items, it's probably not worth your while to send them off to New York,'' says Mr. Wiener of the appraisers' group, but ''important collections deserve a national house. You rarely read about astronomical prices reached in local settings.'' **********The channels you choose for cashing in on your valuables depend on how fast you want the cash and how much you want to involve yourself in the selling. But there are markets for a surprising range of things, and if you've been brooding about treasures buried in your basement, Lyn Snodden says, ''Let the marketplace decide what it's really worth.''  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  Harvey D.

King Fahd was quoted last week as saying that the aim of the meeting was to unify Arab ranks, and that it could be held at any time. **********But Western diplomats here said they doubted that a meeting would take place unless progress was made soon in mending some of the myriad rifts within the Arab world.   Saudis Seeking Consensus **********The agenda at such a meeting would be long and would contain potentially divisive topics, one diplomat said. The Saudis are seeking political consensus, he noted, and if it is not there they may well decide that this is not a suitable time for such a gathering. **********The Saudis have placed special emphasis on easing the differences between Syria and Iraq, which are ruled by rival factions of the Baath Party. **********Specifically, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and other Persian Gulf countries have tried in recent weeks to persuade Syria to prevent an intensification of the war between Iran and Iraq by reopening a pipeline that once carried Iraqi oil across Syrian territory to the Mediterranean. Such a move would enable Iraq to more than double its oil exports, which have fallen sharply because of the war to about 700,000 barrels a day. **********Iranian oil exports, by contrast, are estimated at 1.8 million barrels a day, and Iraq has warned that it considers this situation unacceptable.   Oil Installations Threatened **********The Gulf countries have argued that a reopening of the pipeline could persuade Iraq not to use French-built Super Etendard jets armed with Exocet missiles to strike at oil installations in Iran. **********Syria is said to be studying the proposal, but diplomats here said they doubted it would make such a concession. Damascus has consistently backed Iran during the war, which is now entering its fourth year. **********In addition, diplomats said, there are deep ideological divisions between President Hafez al-Assad of Syria and the Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein, as well as longstanding personal enmity. **********The divisions in the Arab world over the Iranian-Iraqi war were further underscored by a report today that the Egyptian President, Hosni Mubarak, had said his Government would ''not stand idly by'' if Iran blocked shipping in the Gulf.   Interview Published in Kuwait **********In an interview published today in the Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Siyasa and quoted by United Press International, Mr. Mubarak reportedly said that ''if Iran carries out its threats to attack the Gulf ports or close the Hormuz Strait, the situation will require us to revise our stand in consultation with political leaderships in the region.'' **********Along with the pipeline issue and the Iranian-Iraqi war, an Arab meeting would have to address the situation in Lebanon, officials said. **********The Lebanese President, Amin Gemayel, has demanded the withdrawal from his country of all foreign forces - Israeli, Syrian and Palestinian. Although Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states have supported his position, Syria, according to Western diplomats, feels that the balance of power is in its favor and has refused. **********Syria has been highly critical of the agreement the Lebanese Government signed with Israel on May 17, calling for withdrawal of all Israeli forces if Syria and the Palestine Liberation Organization will also pull out. Hence, consensus on Lebanon is unlikely, diplomats said.   P.L.O. Split Would Be Issue **********Another potentially divisive issue at any meeting would be the split within the Palestine Liberation Organization. **********Farouk Kaddoumi, the head of the P.L.O.'s political department, who remains loyal to Yasir Arafat, the chairman, said Tuesday that Mr. Arafat was seeking by all possible means to normalize relations with Syria. But Libya and Iran are said to be supporting a rebel faction in Damascus that has gained considerable strength of late.  Finally, officials said, the Arab countries would have to take up the overall Middle East peace process, yet another potential source of disunity. **********Syria and several other Arab states have been critical of a peace plan put forward by President Reagan a year ago, while Saudi officials have continued to express some support for the American approach.   Arab Plan Adopted **********At their meeting last September in Fez, Morocco, Arab leaders adopted an eight-point peace plan similar to one proposed the year before by King Fahd, who was Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince at the time. **********One Western diplomat said that Saudi Arabia's failure to win support for its plan at the 1981 meeting had made it more reluctant to proceed with pan-Arab meetings in the absence of political consensus."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/13/business/holiday-closings.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-05-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 26, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Holiday Closings", "print_headline": "Holiday Closings", "body_text": " **********Stock markets were closed for Ascension Day yesterday in Zurich, Brussels, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Johannesburg and Paris.

The officials say Iraq remains superior in weapons despite Iran's effort to narrow the gap. **********The analysts say Iran's major problem is having opened the offensive at one of the strongest points on the Iraqi front: the battleground on the frontier of Iraq's Missan province west of the Iranian town of Dizful. **********One intelligence source suggested that this familiar and unprofitable battle plan was the result of a compromise between the two rival elements in the Iranian high command. One represents the remains of the old imperial army, the other the newly made officers of the Revolutionary Guards. **********In any event, these officials said, Iran is running out of choices. The area south of the present front is marshy and unsuitable to tracked or wheeled vehicles. Since last summer, the Basra position near the Persian Gulf, already strong, has been reinforced. Any offensive further north and closer to Baghdad would suffer from the absence of suitable roads on the Iranian side. **********The Iraqis, fighting on their own soil, have the advantage of a network of subsidiary roads, some newly built, over which reinforcements can be moved to meet Iranian offensives. What Faces the Iranians **********Intelligence officials in this country and abroad agree that Iran's only choice, given its resources, is a campaign of attrition to inflict serious casualities and encourage a revolutionary movement in Iraq. **********The officials say that to attack Iraq's extremely strong positions in the area, the Iranians, moving from a hilly area, have to cross a treeless plain and attack two lines of entrenched infantry supported by dug-in tanks, artillery and short-range surface missiles. **********A third line, built by bulldozers and hundreds of soldiers, lies just to the rear.  The officials say the Iranians will have to break through all three lines before they are within reach of their main objective.  This is believed to be the main eastern highway running from Basra to Baghdad. At the northern end of the offensive, which opened on an 18-mile front, the Iranians would be about 20 miles from the highway. **********The significance of the operation has been obscured by the extravagant claims made by both sides. Western military attaches in Baghdad know the general scope of the offensive but have not been permitted to visit the battle zone. High Casualty Reports **********Iran's claims to have retaken 60 square miles of territory in Missan and to have killed or wounded more than 5,000 Iraqi troops are viewed with considerable reserve by intelligence sources. These sources are equally dubious about Iraq's claims to have killed 3,200 Iranians, although some pointed out that, fighting from strong defensive positions, the Iraqis probably inflicted heavy casualties on the Iranians, who attacked without significant air support. **********Ever since last summer, when five major Iranian attacks on Basra were repulsed with heavy losses in men and materiel, Teheran has been buying weapons wherever it can. A NATO report said weapons were bought from Eastern Europe and North Korea, and in both cases the weapons were old. In addition they have to be fed into an army and air force trained largely on American-made weapons. The problem of maintaining a half dozen types of weapons systems from East and West must be ''horrendous,'' one American intelligence source commented. The Balance in the Air **********The Iranians have had some success, this source noted, in restoring tanks and artillery damaged early in the war. They have not been as successful in repairing aircraft or finding spare parts for the American F-4's and F-14's that were the air force's cutting edge at the start of the war. **********Estimates of the number of Iranian aircraft now operational vary from 40 to 50. The Iraqis are superior in numbers and, today, in pilot training, but intelligence sources noted that their planes had stayed well away from targets guarded by the American Improved Hawk missile. These targets include Teheran, Isfahan and Qum. **********Cutting the north-south highway would be a tactical setback to Iraq, intelligence officials said, but it would not knock the country out of the war. The western Basra-Baghdad highway would then have to absorb much of the heavy traffic moving from the southern cities north and this would increase Iraq's logistical problems. **********The outlook, however, is for more Iranian offensives in the area west and southwest of Dizful. ''It's not much of an option,'' one source said, ''but it's the only game in town.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/01/business/finance-new-issues-010786.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-11-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 241, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES", "body_text": " **********-Point, to 12 1/2% **********WASHINGTON, Oct. 31 (AP) - The Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced a drop of one-half percentage point in the interest rate on mortgages backed by the Federal Housing Administration, to 12 1/2 percent.

Glaxo must still submit proposed labeling for the drug, called Zantac, an application that normally takes six weeks to two months.  Zantac has already been approved in 31 countries, and in 18 months has taken a large share of the expanding anti-ulcer market in several of them. Zantac's popularity has slowed the growth of Tagamet, a sixyear-old drug that has made SmithKline one of the world's most profitable pharmaceutical companies. **********Safety of Drugs Cited **********Zantac is several times more powerful than Tagamet and is said to have fewer side effects, although both drugs are considered so safe that physicians have prescribed them for a far wider range of gastric complaints than the companies have suggested. **********The F.D.A.'s action covered the use of Zantac in tablet form for the short-term treatment of duodenal ulcers - by far the most common kind - and a condition involving the excess secretion of gastric acid. Glaxo said it would now seek approval for Zantac's use in longterm treatments against gastric ulcers and in injectable forms. **********The anti-ulcer market passed the $1 billion sales mark last year and is growing at a strong pace, according to analysts here. About 45 percent of sales of anti-ulcer drugs are in the United States. American Sales Agreement **********To promote sales in the United States, Glaxo has entered a joint promotion agreement, on undisclosed terms, with Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., increasing Zantac's American sales force to 1,200, from about 400. **********''I expect Zantac to expand the U.S. market and for Glaxo to end up with a large part of that expansion and perhaps a bit of Tagamet's existing market,'' said Christopher Clark, an analyst here with Scrimgeour Kemp-Gee. Mr. Clark predicted sales for Zantac of about $70 million during its first full year in the United States. **********''One key question is what price Zantac will be launched at,'' he said. ''It has typically been sold at a premium of up to 20 percent over Tagemet.'' SmithKline Growth in Japan **********Mr. Clark said SmithKline, meanwhile, could expect strong growth in the large Japanese market, where it recently received approval.  Glaxo's application there is thought to be at least a year away from acceptance. **********Robert A. Holland, manager of corporate information at SmithKline, said that marketing of Tagamet would not change as a result of Zantac's introduction in the United States, but declined further comment on Glaxo's announcement. **********Tagamet, which was introduced in Britain in 1976, and in the United States in 1977, makes up the bulk of SmithKline's sales of gastrointestinal products, which in turn make up nearly a third of the company's total sales. Last year the division recorded $857 million in sales, up from $776 million in 1981. SmithKline's total sales in 1982 were $2.97 billion. **********Ronald J. Stern, an analyst with the First Boston Corporation, estimated that Zantac would capture 20 percent of the available market within a year, ''depending on the thrust they get from Hoffmann-La Roche.'' Since Zantac is not sold in an injectable form, which accounts for about 15 percent of anti-ulcer drug sales, its ''available'' market is about 85 percent of the anti-ulcer drug market as a whole, Mr. Stern pointed out.

The pound has been trading at $1.58. Glaxo's American depositary receipts, traded over the counter, closed down 1/4, at 12 1/2. **********''American interest has been strong in Glaxo for the last six months, and after today's buying I would guess that about 15 percent of the company's shares are held by American investors,'' said Roben Gilbert, an analyst at James Capel & Company. **********Last month, Glaxo reported that sales for the six months to Dec. 31 rose 24 percent, to about $792 million at current exchange rates, while net income jumped 55 percent, to about $83.5 million. **********On the New York Stock Exchange today SmithKline stock slid 2 3/8, to 69 1/2."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/22/world/helms-delays-confirmation-of-ambassador-to-salvador.html": {"writer_name": "Bernard Weinraub", "pub_date": "1983-07-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 448, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HELMS DELAYS CONFIRMATION OF AMBASSADOR TO SALVADOR", "print_headline": "HELMS DELAYS CONFIRMATION OF AMBASSADOR TO SALVADOR", "body_text": " **********In a move that has angered the White House and left the State Department ''extremely upset,'' Senator Jesse Helms has abruptly delayed confirmation hearings on the newly appointed Ambassador to El Salvador. **********Administration officials predicted that President Reagan's nominee, Thomas R.

Thus the portion of a utility dividend that is treated as a tax-deferred return of capital does not qualify for the exclusion. The reason is that Washington does not want stockholders to obtain two separate tax benefits for the same investment. **********For instance, John J. Jones, a utility analyst for Oppenheimer & Company, noted that 100 percent of the dividends from the Long Island Lighting Company last year represented a return of capital and therefore was ineligible for the exclusion, while 100 percent of the dividends from the Consolidated Edison Company of New York was ordinary income and therefore qualified. As an example of a dividend with both considerations, he cited the American Electric Power Company, with 24 percent a return of capital and the remainder ordinary income. **********There are two other tests that a company must meet to have its shares qualify for the dividend exclusion. First, the shares issued to participating shareowners must be newly issued stock, rather than existing stock purchased in the open market. **********Second, at least 60 percent of the depreciable property acquired by the utility during the last 10 years must have been public utility property. Because of this last requirement, the stock of most telephone and natural gas utilities does not qualify. **********Interest in utility dividend reinvestment picked up in the second half of 1982, analysts report, in keeping with the overall decline in short-term money market rates. With the average utility yield now at 10.3 percent - and all or part of this dividend tax sheltered through reinvestment -many investors bought utility stocks with funds obtained by selling their shares in money market funds. By contrast, the most recent 7-day average yield for money market funds, as tablulated by Donoghue's Money Fund Report, was 7.8 percent. **********An added fillip is that some utilities offer stock to participants in dividend reinvestment plans at discounts from prevailing market prices. These discounts usually range from 3 to 5 percent of the current price level. **********The full benefit of this provision in the law is felt by investors who hold their reinvested stock for at least a year. In such situations, the full proceeds are taxed, when the stock is sold, at the long-term capital gains rate - with a maximum rate of 20 percent. Otherwise, the proceeds are taxed as ordinary income, with a top rate of 50 percent. **********A negative of such dividend reinvestments -even with the tax break - is that investors do not have the use of the cash from their dividends until they sell the stock. And for those who need the income on a regular basis, this type of delay might create a severe or unmanageable financial burden. As Mr. Jones of Oppenheimer said, ''It's basically for the under-65 shareholders.'' **********In addition, there is generally considered to be greater risk in purchasing utility stocks than buying money market funds. The funds have a fixed share value of $1 a share with a yield that changes daily, while utility company share prices fluctuate based on market conditions with dividends determined each quarter. **********The utility dividend exclusion is scheduled to end on Jan. 1, 1986. However, Mr. Gradin of the electric institute said that ''it's such an excellent capital formation device, I'm sure the industry would love to see it extended.'' So would many utility stockholders."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/06/business/east-west-trade-turnabout.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-04-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 209, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "East-West Trade Turnabout", "print_headline": "East-West Trade Turnabout", "body_text": " **********In a historic turnabout in East-West trade, the West last year recorded its first trade deficit with the Soviet bloc in two decades, according to a United Nations agency report released today. **********The report by the United Nation's Economic Commission for Europe said the Western deficit was just under $2 billion in 1982, compared with a surplus of about $2 billion in 1981. **********It said the Soviet Union alone had a merchandise trade surplus with Western nations of about $1 billion last year.

Her program for the next five years, she added, is equally ''robust and responsible.'' **********''The choice before the nation is stark,'' she asserted, ''either to continue our present steadfast progress towards recovery or to follow policies more extreme and more damaging than those ever put forward by any previous opposition.'' On Dealing With Unemployment **********As she has since taking power, Mrs. Thatcher refused any suggestion of direct action to deal with unemployment, which she called ''the universal and most intractible'' problem. ''The answer is not bogus social contracts and Government overspending,'' she said, ''the Government's role is to keep inflation down and offer real incentive for private enterprise.'' **********The paradox of the campaign so far is that the Conservatives remain well ahead despite opinion poll showings that a large majority of the public considers unemployment the dominant problem and prefers Labor's policy of economic stimulation to the Prime Minister's hands-off approach. In a survey by Market and Opinion Research International, published in Tuesday's issue of The Daily Star, the Tories' lead was put at 7 points. The poll gave them 44 percent to 37 percent for Labor, 17 percent for the Liberal-Social Democratic alliance and 2 percent for others. **********That is a smaller lead than in previous surveys, and Labor strategists hope it means they are breaking down the public's belief that there is nothing to be done about the jobless. With unemployment at 3.2 million, or 13.3 percent of the work force, the highest rate in the country's history, Labor has pledged to spend enough to create 2.5 million jobs during the next Parliament. **********Michael Foot, the opposition leader, has begun to draw large, emotional crowds at rallies. He attacked the issue again today, declaring on a radio program that ''if there is anything worse than mass unemployment, it is the Tories' complete misapprehension - to use a very polite word for it - that there is no alternative.'' Dr.  David Owen, of the Liberal-Social Democratic alliance, said the country would not accept the prospect of a further rise in unemployment under Mrs. Thatcher. Decidedly Right-Wing Tone **********The Conservatives' 47-page manifesto had a decidedly right-wing tone, as expected, especially with regard to the trade unions. Among other things, a new Thatcher Government would be committed to guaranteeing by law a secret ballot for union elections and the right for union members to decide whether they wanted part of their dues to go to the Labor Party. Unions would also be required to hold secret ballots before calling strikes if they wished to retain legal immunity. **********Among the state-owned businesses that Mrs. Thatcher promises to sell off are Rolls-Royce, the automobile makers, and British Airways, as well as large parts of British Steel, British Leyland and British Shipbuilders. This will be possible, the Tories privately concede, only if the businesses involved can demonstrate consistent profitability. **********On local government, the document attacks the metropolitan councils and the Greater London Council, which in the 1970's took over much of local government's responsibility from district and borough councils. A number of them, including London's, have been dominated by Labor left-wingers. **********''The metropolitan councils and the Greater London Council have been shown to be a wasteful and unnecessary tier of government,'' the Conservative manifesto said. ''We shall abolish them and return most of their functions to the boroughs and the districts.'' **********Stressing that British jobs and investments were directly linked to Britain's membership in the European Economic Community, Mrs.  Thatcher declared that ''we need to fight on'' within the organization.

This week's economic statistics, however, are not expected to point so clearly toward a weakening economy as the retail sales for July would suggest. **********Figures will be released today on industrial production for July. Most analysts expect a rise greater than June's 1.1 percent. **********Estimates for July's housing starts, also scheduled for release today, vary widely. John MacAuley, an economist at the Chemical Bank, said starts probably fell to an annual rate of 1.65 million units, from 1.75 million in June, because ''we may already be seeing some impact from the higher mortgage rates.'' Other analysts said that higher mortage rates were hurting the housing industry but that the increases were too recent to have affected starts during July. Traders Scrutinize Figures **********Economic data are closely watched by participants in the credit markets. They expect that a continuation of the second quarter's rapid growth would bring higher interest rates. A less robust expansion would delay the onset of higher rates and also would help keep inflation subdued, analysts said. **********By late yesterday, long-term bonds were the only sector of the Treasury market with generally lower prices. The 12 percent issue due in 2013 closed at about 102 1/8, down 3/8 point, to yield 11.74 percent. Dealers said institutional demand was modest, though there was still a good flow of orders from smaller investors buying less than $1 million. **********The 12 percent bonds, like the 3- and 10-year Treasury notes sold earlier this month, are all trading at prices well above the average levels set at the auction. Although much of the rapid rise in prices last Friday was caused by speculative buying by Wall Street firms and other traders, analysts said that securities dealers' holdings of the Treausry issues were not burdensome. Overnight financing costs of 9 5/8 percent, they noted, mean that there are profits to be made from holding Treasury issues - so long as prices are stable or rising. Yields Dip for Treasury Bills **********For Treasury issues due in 20 years or less, prices rose modestly by about one-eighth point. Traders were not discouraged by Friday's rise in the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market, to 9 7/8 percent, from 9 5/8 percent. **********In the short-term market, new three- and six-month Treasury bills were auctioned yesterday at average rates that were more than one-eighth percentage point less than at last week's auctions. The three-month bill sold at about 9.4 percent, down from 9.57 percent, while the six-month bill sold at about 9.55 percent, down from 9.7 percent. **********Based on the auction results, the maximum rate for new six-month savings certificates offered by banks and thrift institutions will decline today to 9.80 percent, from 9.95 percent. The top rate for three-month certificates is the same as the average for three-month Treasury bills. **********While rates declined for three- and six-month savings certificates, rates rose for longer-term ''small saver'' certificates, which have a maturity of 18 months or longer. The Treasury Department announced that the maximum rate for these certificates offered by thrift institutions rose to 11.05 percent, from 10.7 percent, while banks may offer a top rate of 10.8 percent, up from 10.45 percent. The rate for small saver certificates changes every two weeks, according to changes in the yield for Treasury notes due in about 30 months. Tax-Exempt Area Affected **********Although the higher interest rates for home mortgages may not have affected the housing starts to be reported today, they have already had a noticeable impact on the market for tax-exempt securities, where the supply of housing revenue bonds has grown rapidly in recent weeks. **********By selling tax-exempt bonds, states and local governments can borrow at rates low enough so they can then arrange for low-cost mortgages to be made available to home buyers. For example, a $140 million issue by the Louisiana Housing Finance Agency was tentatively offered by an E. F.  Hutton & Company group with a maximum yield of 10.58 percent for interest-bearing bonds due in 2011. At yield levels set yesterday, underwriters estimated that the financing would result in home mortgage rates of about 10 5/8 percent. **********Another recent example was the Massashusetts Housing Finance Agency, which is using proceeds of a $100 million bond financing to provide 11 percent mortages to qualified first- time home buyers in the state. Bernard Singer, chairman of the agency, compared the 11 percent rate for a fixed-rate, 30-year loan with home mortgage rates of 14 to 14 1/2 percent now being charged by many local lenders. **********Following are results of yesterday's auctions of new three- and six- month Treasury bills: (000 omitted in dollar figures) Average Price [ TEXT OMITTED FROM SOURCE ] **********Both these issues are dated Aug. 18.

Overall Industry Profit **********Nevertheless, because of vigorous cost cutting, the industry over all is expected to be profitable for the year, largely on the strength of G.M.'s expected earnings of more than $1 billion. The Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation are expected to report losses, as they did in 1981, but much less than in 1980, when the industry over all lost almost $4 billion. **********Imports took a record share of the American car market, with 27.8 percent of all sales, up from 27.1 percent in 1981, despite restrictions on imports of Japanese cars, which accounted for about 80 percent of the imports. **********The numbers and kinds of cars sold in 1982 reflected the nature of the recession, which has resulted in widespread blue-collar layoffs while leaving professionals and other higher-income groups relatively unscathed: Sales of bigger cars and luxury imports increased, while those of smaller economy cars, usually the choice of less affluent buyers, slipped. **********Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Volvo and Jaguar, none of which has a model priced under $10,000, all reported gains, as did Cadillac and Buick; sales of Chevrolet's bottom-of-the-line Chevette, which has a base price of $4,997, declined by a third. 'Rich Folks' Still Buying **********''There's no question that the rich folks haven't been hurt,'' said Harvey Heinbach, a vice president at Merrill Lynch. ''Those people who did not have to worry about losing their job situation went ahead and spent. But the unemployment put a scare in a lot of others. The ability to spend was there in many cases, but the unemployment situation affected confidence.'' **********Similarly, the strength in full-size and intermediate-size cars was attributed to their attraction to older buyers with more secure incomes. These models increased their market share to 53 percent of the sales by domestic manufacturers, from 46.2 percent in 1981. **********Sales by the Big Three domestic producers rose to 152,130 in the final 10 days of the year, from 118,343 in the 1981 period. The total for all five domestic producers rose 27.8 percent, to 161,823. **********For December the Big Three sold 428,260 cars, up 26.4 percent.

Unit Drop for Imports **********The shrinkage in the auto market during the year was further illustrated by import sales, which dropped to 2,221,829 units, from 2,309,100. **********Ford improved its share of the market for domestically built cars to 23.4 percent for the year, from 22.2 percent, while Chrysler's share rose to 12 percent, from 11.8 percent.

Since early this month, trading had been very quiet as many investors stayed on the sidelines. **********Several Government securities dealers noted that anticipation of the adjustment in money supply growth targets announced yesterday by Paul A. Volcker, the Fed chairman, was strong enough for foreign and domestic customers to start trading well before the traditional 9 A.M. opening. **********'The Place Was Hopping' **********''When I got in at 7:30 the place was already hopping,'' commented Elliott Platt, a money market economist at the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation. Earlier trading hours may become a regular feature in the Treasury market since two major brokers plan to begin trading at 8 A.M. today. **********The three-month Treasury bill rate, which mirrors changes in Fed policy, quickly fell by one-tenth of a percentage point, to a low of 9 percent, but then rose to about 9.08 percent late in the day.

Early in the day, dealers traded the two-year issue with a yield of 10.47 percent, but said that investor demand was nil at that yield. Fed's New Target Range **********The changes in the Fed's growth target for the basic money supply measure, M-1 - to a new range of 5 percent to 9 percent for the second half of the year, versus the 4 percent to 8 percent range that had been set for the full year - were disclosed by Mr. Volcker in testimony to the House Banking Committee. **********Mr. Volcker's comments had the full attention of the credit markets, where short- and long-term rates have increased about a percentage point since early May. **********Many traders and economists have been worried that further rate increases were likely if the Fed tried to reduce M-1 growth to within the 4 percent to 8 percent target announced last February. M-1 consists of currency in circulation plus all kinds of checking accounts. **********Before the latest revisions, M-1 was more than $14 billion above the Fed's old growth target. However, the M-1 level reported on July 6 of $514.1 billion was only $2.7 billion above a level consistent with a 9 percent growth rate, measured from the second quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1983. Outlook Seen as Uncertain **********The wide swing in rates and the fact that there were as many sellers of notes and bonds as there were buyers was a sign of the still uncertain outlook for interest rates, analysts noted. **********Irwin Kellner, chief economist of the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, noted that M-1 is likely to decline to within its new target soon. Once that happens, he said, traders might become less fearful that the Fed would soon tighten policy. ''If the markets can just relax, it would allow interest rates to fall,'' he said. **********Other economists, however, said they can already identify the forces that will eventually cause interest rates to rise, no matter what adjustments the Federal Reserve makes to its money supply objectives. **********''The clash between Federal deficits and private sector credit needs is still down the road,'' Mr. Kellner said.

Initially, both maturities were for $200 million. **********Other financings included a $100 million issue of Aa2-rated First Interstate Bancorp 12 percent notes due in 1995. The notes are being offered by a First Boston Corporation group at a price of 99.21, to yield 12.125 percent.

That's what economists have been asking themselves. Most of them have been counting on a surge in consumer spending to lead the economy out of recession. But there has been no surge. Instead, retail sales have posted three straight monthly declines - December, January and February. **********''On average, consumers were spending little more in the first two months of 1983 than they were last fall,'' said Karen L. Johnson, an associate economist at Citibank. She adds that even the Census Bureau's recent upward revisions in its monthly retail figures for 1977 to 1982 ''did not take away from the fact that in January and February of this year, spending really didn't go anywhere.'' **********All this has left economists scurrying for explanations. One factor cited by some is lower prices -for gasoline, food and other items - which can pull down sales figures even when unit sales increase.  Another factor, say Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette economists Gert von der Linde and Richard Hokenson, may be ''the inability of the Commerce Department to account for all the growth in the number of retail outlets as well as the introduction of new products, such as personal computers.'' The Rich Got Richer... **********How rich are the rich? Richer than they used to be, says Lawrence Chimerine, chairman and chief economist at Chase Econometrics, who sees this as another clue to the lower-than-expected consumer spending. **********He says there has been ''a dramatic shift in the distribution of income away from lower- and middle-income groups toward the upperincome group.'' The factors behind this shift include tax breaks weighted towards upper-income groups, Government budget cuts aimed primarily at the poor and near-poor, and unemployment and wage freezes concentrated mostly among middle-income and lower-income people. **********Since affluent people save a higher fraction of their incomes than less wealthy people, this means that more of the country's income is now being saved, and less being spent. Increasing the savings rate was one of the Reagan Administration's original goals. But Mr.  Chimerine notes that it has had ''a somewhat depressing impact on economic activity in the last year because consumption has not responded to income growth.'' ...And Kept On Spending **********The rich may be holding back a spending boom in a different way, too. Jay Schmiedeskamp, director of economic surveys for the Gallup Organization, notes that during a recession, virtually everyone becomes more cautious and cuts spending - both those who are unemployed or working fewer hours and those not directly affected.  When recession ends, typically the first spending to turn up is that of the more well-off people who have not been directly affected. **********This time, however, the script did not go according to plan. The group unaffected by recession did not curtail spending as it usually does, but continued to have a rather favorable attitude. ''In spite of the worst recession since World War II, this sector of consumer spending held up fairly well,'' Mr. Schmiedeskamp said. **********Since these people did not significantly reduce their spending during the downturn, there is little room for them to increase their spending now - and to provide the first surge in consumer purchases.  Spending by the more affected group will eventually come back, Mr.  Schmiedeskamp predicts, ''but will take more time.'' A Feeble Punch **********When consumers decide they are ready to spend, will they have the money? The picture is mixed. Net worth is up, but personal income growth has been anemic. Wages and salaries fell by one-tenth of a percentage point in February, after rising 1 percentage point in January. And Morgan Guaranty economists note that interest income, after rising by an average of 20 percent a year for the past five years, is now falling, as interest rates decline. Interest income accounts for nearly 15 percent of total personal income. **********As for net worth, the Morgan Guaranty Survey notes that the value of stocks, bonds and liquid assets held by consumers rose by more than $500 billion in the last six months of 1982, while net worth grew by $729 billion. The bank's economists caution, however, that consumer outlays are more influenced by after-tax personal income than by net worth. There may be a small psychological ''wealth effect,'' the Survey says, but the impact of higher net worth on spending will be small and spread out over time. Karen W.

Gen. Efrain Rios Montt, appears to be facing his most serious political challenge since coming to power in a coup 15 months ago. **********According to politicians, diplomats and church and business leaders interviewed here, the key issue is the general's promise to restore ''authentic democracy'' that he made after annulling the results of national elections in March 1982. He did so on the ground that the voting had been fraudulent. **********In the last few weeks, pressure has mounted on the President to keep his promise, with an army general and church leaders publicly petitioning him to get the military out of government. The petitioners are also demanding the election of an assembly to draft a new constitution for this nation, which has known dictatorship for most of its history. **********Challenged by Guerrillas **********At the same time, the Rios Montt Government continues to be challenged by a loosely unified guerrilla movement. Although a drive on the rebels in the mountainous countryside, in which many Indians were killed, had been thought to confine guerrilla activity to a remote northwestern sector bordering the Mexican state of Chiapas, there have been reports of renewed fighting closer to the Guatemalan capital in the last few weeks. **********The calls for a return to civilian rule, while providing a unifying theme for opponents of General Rios Montt, mask the motives of a variety of special interests from extreme left to extreme right, according to Guatemalans and foreign diplomats here. Economic, social and religious tensions are all playing a part. So is the personality of the President, an evangelical Christian who has been described as part nationalist, part missionary; part soldier, part reformer; flamboyant and pious at the same time. Strong Rumors of a Coup **********''All the political parties are against him; the merchants, professionals and farmers oppose him; he has alienated the church, and his army is badly divided,'' Mario Sandoval Alarcon, head of the militantly far-right National Liberation Movement, said in an interview here Friday. **********''If he doesn't call elections in the next two or three weeks, he will be finished,'' said Mr. Sandoval, whose party is widely believed to be among those with the most to gain if General Rios Montt were to fall from power. **********Last week, the capital was so abuzz with rumors of a coup that on Friday the chief of the Guatemalan general staff, Gen. Hector Mario Lopez Fuentes, issued a public statement saying that no one in the army was thinking of overthrowing the Government. **********According to Mr. Sandoval, any military challenge to the President would not be likely to come from the generals, ''who are all his friends,'' but from younger officers. **********General Rios Montt has not been on good terms with the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy in this predominantly Catholic country.  Among the President's critics is Msgr. Ramiro Pelleter Samyoa, who last week was appointed, at least temporarily, the Archbishop of Guatemala after the death of Mario Cardinal Casariego y Acevedo on Wednesday. **********''I hope there will be no more attacks on the Catholic church by the Government,'' Monsignor Pelleter was quoted as having told an interviewer. Monsignor Pelleter is one of the church leaders who have petitioned General Rios Montt. **********The urban middle class of professionals and merchants, as well as some country landowners, are apprehensive about a new tax package that the Rios Montt Government promises to introduce. In a time of economic crisis attributable at least in part to falling prices worldwide for commodities on which Guatemala depends for export earnings - in particular, coffee - business leaders fear that their interests are not being looked after by a Government and bureaucracy packed as in no other time in recent history by military men. New Parties Formed **********Politically there is wide agreement that President Rios Montt has opened the way for a range of new parties and many, some no larger than committees, have begun to form in anticipation of elections. He is also credited with allowing the press greater latitude than it has usually enjoyed in the past. **********But at the same time, General Rios Montt has begun to set limits on political dissent. Last week he jailed for four days one political opponent, Mario Castijon of the National Renewal Party, a centerright group viewed by some Guatemalans as liberal in the absence of left-of-center parties. Dr. Castijon had criticized General Rios Montt for using his political power to aid his evangelical church. **********Politicians and diplomats here point out that it is to General Rios Montt's advantage to put off elections as long as possible in the hope that new parties will grow and weaken the power of the entrenched political groups. **********General Rios Montt, it is generally agreed, was robbed of the presidency in the election of 1974 when his Christian Democratic Party was pushed aside by a party further to the right. There are those here who suggest that the general, who has said he will not be a candidate in the future, may now want to claim the four years of power that he was denied almost a decade ago. **********The challenge from within the army came earlier this month from General Jose Guillermo Echeverria Vielman, who in an open letter to the President on June 5 that was read on national television and printed in the press, made an eloquent case for a return to the barracks. The general was then forcibly retired from military duty. 'Could Become a Hero' **********Political leaders will not discuss whether he is their chosen alternative to President Rios Montt. Alejandro Maldonada Aguirre, who heads the National Renewal Party, is quoted in the current issue of This Week, a privately published news letter on business and politics, as having said that General Echevarria ''could become a hero.'' **********Meanwhile, President Rios Montt has continued to insist that more time is required to prepare the country for an election free of fraud. He has promised that he will schedule voting for the second half of 1984 to choose a constituent assembly similar to the one elected in El Salvador last year. **********The widening opposition here says that is too long to wait for what is only the first step of a long process.

In fact, the performances of portfolio managers are usually measured against the S.& P. 500 index, he said. **********''Despite their intense interest in these markets, most managers are still inhibited by tangible and intangible restraints,'' he said. ''For one, many of the institutions lack hedging strategy systems. A surprising number lack the computers and other tools to set up and operate hedging systems.'' **********While large and experienced investment banking houses such as Salomon Brothers have the knowledge and mechanical tools, many of the big institutional investors are also inhibited by their lack of experience and mechanical tools to enter these markets. **********Also, the fact that the stock options and index markets include a great number of speculators still inhibits traditional portfolio managers, despite the fact that no market could exist without the vital speculative element that willingly assumes the risks the hedgers seek to avoid. **********''Far more important,'' Mr. Margolis said, is the fact that many institutions don't have hedging systems in place. They need performance measurements, evaluations and other means to find out how well they performed, not just whether they made money or not.'' **********Meanwhile, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board Options Exchange and Standard & Poor's last Friday reached an agreement to rename the C.B.O.E. 100 index options the S.& P. 100 options.

More than 500 people were reportedly arrested and the roundup was said to be continuing. **********The army under the elected Government of President Belaunde Terry reports that 823 people have been killed since the beginning of the year in the fighting between Government forces and guerrillas, compared with about 200 in the previous two and a half years.  Officials say about two-thirds of the dead were guerrillas; the rest - soldiers, policemen and peasants - were said to have been killed by guerrillas. **********Guerrillas Strike in Lima **********Western diplomats and Peruvian political experts estimate that the Shining Path numbers no more than 2,000 guerrillas, with perhaps an equal number of sympathizers. **********Army leaders have predicted they will wipe out the guerrilla movement by the end of the year, but a heavy blow to their efforts was dealt on Friday by a guerrilla strike on this capital of five million people. Western diplomats here said the attack, estimated to involve more than 100 guerrillas, was spectacularly coordinated. **********The attackers blew up power pylons, blacked out much of the city, set off bombs near embassies and Government buildings and largely destroyed the sprawling Bayer Chemical industrial works with firebombs. Peruvians Express Concern **********The psychological effect appeared great. Recent polls have shown that despite an economic crisis, ravaging floods in the north and a debilitating drought in the south, Peruvians are most worried about the guerrillas. **********Many demand that the Government take harsher measures, and the nation's two weekly news magazines, Caretas and Oiga, both ran cover articles two weeks ago on the possibilities of a coup. They even speculated who the future cabinet members might be. **********President Belaunde Terry was elected in 1980 after 12 years of military rule, and according to sources close to him the specter of a coup has been a constant concern as he has tried to cope with the Shining Path insurrection. **********He did not accede to political pressure to send the army into the campaign against the guerrillas until December, reportedly hoping to limit the military's role. With the campaign against the guerrillas showing little success, the President has announced that he is studying the creation of a special police commando force to replace the army. Civil Liberties Suspended **********In what was widely interpreted here as a show of forcefulness, President Belaunde Terry declared the state of emergency Monday for the 60-day maximum allowed under the Constitution. The decree suspends most civil liberties, such as the rights of assembly and free speech. It is designed to allow the police to arrest guerrilla suspects and interrogate them for up to 15 days without charges. **********At a news conference on Sunday, the day before he issued his decree, the President said, ''All Peruvians should unite in this undeclared war against delinquents, mercenaries and dark forces of ideology that Peru fortunately rejects.'' He meant the Shining Path guerrillas, whom he does not refer to by name. **********The state of emergency was a particularly delicate step because it suspends the democratic principles Mr. Belaunde Terry has long upheld. He was overthrown and exiled by the military in a previous term as President in 1968. Hospital Strike Called Off **********The President's decree has had little visible effect on daily life in this capital. There are no tanks in the streets, and the police presence appears normal. **********However, a strike by hospital employees that had been paralyzing public hospitals was called off because of the measure, and a nationwide strike considered by Communist-controlled unions must now get Government approval, which seems unlikely. Even a mass rally planned for today by the President's own party, Popular Action, was called off. **********Reaction from the opposition has been muted. Many leaders of Peru's largest party, the Popular Revolutionary American Alliance, guardedly supported the state of emergency. They objected mostly to its being national in scope, arguing it should be limited to the problem areas, as a number of earlier states of emergency were.  Ayacucho has been under a state of emergency since December. **********The strongest complaints have come from the country's badly fractured Marxist parties.

This, plus the spreading economic recovery, seems to have had the desired effect, in the light of the data supplied by Sheik Otaiba. **********Today, however, OPEC officials were reluctant to speculate about how long the March arrangements could be maintained.  ''There is no time limit,'' Sheik Otaiba said. ''It will be as long as the market has not improved in a way that would allow us to adjust the previous arrangements.'' **********But, he added in a personal aside, ''I myself believe that the price of oil should be kept at $29 until the end of 1985.''

Fourth-Quarter Estimates **********Mr. Otaiba, who is also head of OPEC's market monitoring committee, said demand for oil from the group could rise to between 17.5 million and 19 million barrels a day in the fourth quarter. **********But he and other OPEC ministers expressed concern about the quality of the demand: whether it would reflect an end to the drawing down of inventories by oil companies in anticipation of lower prices, or a real growth in consumption. **********The ministers also questioned whether non-OPEC producers would attempt to meet any added demand. Liaison with oil exporters outside the group has widened: Mexico had observer status here, and Sheik Otaiba said Belkacem Nabi, minister from Algeria, would visit the Soviet Union for discussions. **********The conference communique said discussion of long-term strategy would be continued at the next general meeting to give a committee led by Sheik Yamani time to update its report in light of ''changing conditions.'' The meeting is scheduled for Dec.7 in Geneva. **********The report, which Sheik Yamani has been working on for several years, deals with OPEC's relations with consuming and developing nations and with non-OPEC oil producers. One key proposal is said to be a commitment to keep oil prices from rising through the end of 1985. **********The appointment of a new Secretary General to succeed Marc Saturnin Nan Nguema of Gabon became impossible when neither Iran nor Iraq would accept each other's nominees and no third candidate emerged. As a result, Sheik Otaiba will supervise the group's administrative affairs with the help of Fadhil J. al-Chalabi, the current Deputy Secretary General. **********The position is more prestigious than powerful because all major OPEC decisions are reserved to the member states.

Paul Sarnoff, vice president of Paine Webber Futures, and a longtime precious metals bull, said: ''I continue to hold that silver will outperform gold and that we will see $15, perhaps even $20 silver this year.

The surge in oil and gas drilling, followed by a boom in real estate development, produced steadily higher profits for banks. Especially in the state's two money centers, Houston and Dallas, banks were benefiting from their high-yielding energy loans. And in an unprecedented wave of acquisitions, several of the state's bank holding companies grew geometrically by buying out smaller rivals. **********But since mid-1982, after the oil boom went bust and Dallas and Houston became overbuilt with ultra- modern, mirrored glass office buildings, Texas banks have come into disfavor on Wall Street. Especially in the wake of the collapse of the Penn Square Bank in neighboring Oklahoma, which had a huge portfolio of irrecoverable energy loans, banking industry analysts have expressed growing fears that some Texas banks might have similar problems. **********News Turns Grim And earlier this month, bank news that had seemed merely depressing abruptly turned grim. **********On Oct. 7, the Interfirst Corporation of Dallas, the state's No. 1 bank holding company, reported the largest quarterly loss in the history of American banking, $194 million. Only a week later, another large energy lender, the First National Bank of Midland, was closed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and finally sold to Republicbank of Dallas in the second-largest bank failure in the nation's history. **********The coalescence of two events so devastating raised an inevitable question: Are Interfirst and Midland merely symptoms of broader problems to come for Texas banking? **********''Reports of the death of the Texas economy have been greatly exaggerated,'' replies Ben F. Love, chairman of Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc. of Houston, the state's third-largest holding company. ''This is still a tremendous place to be in banking.'' **********Interfirst, which owns 66 banks in Texas, maintains that it will be profitable in the fourth quarter. Robert H. Stewart, chairman of Interfirst's flagship bank in Dallas, characterized the bank's third- quarter loss, as ''a bump in the road.'' **********''We've had some excesses in the oil and gas business, and it's going to take time for demand to catch up with supply,'' Mr. Stewart added. ''But the situation at Interfirst has stabilized, this state has a vibrant economy, and I'm quietly optimistic.'' **********Re-evaluation of Management **********At the same time, Interfirst, which has been one of the nation's fastest- growing bank holding companies, is serious re-evaluating its management. **********For most of the year, Interfirst had bridled at any suggestion that its loan portfolio might be flawed. But when it disclosed its third-quarter loss, it also announced that William Breedlove, who had been chairman of the holding company's Dallas bank, had been forced out and replaced by Mr. Stewart. **********''We have been unsatisfied with some of the management judgments,'' said Elvis Mason, Interfirst's chairman. In addition, Mr. Stewart said, Interfirst now has essentially completed its flurry of acquisitions in which it has acquired three dozen bank and doubled its assets since 1980. **********In June, Interfirst completed the largest acquisition in Texas banking history when it took over the First United Bancorp of Fort Worth, with $2.4 billion in assets. Mr. Stewart said that the only thing that would persuade Interfirst to consider other mergers would be a change in interstate banking laws that would allow it to purchase and operate out-of-state banks. **********Analysts say Interfirst, as well as a handful of other Texas banks that have been hurt by irretrievable energy loans, will have to slow their plans for growth and may lose market share to those with healthier loan portfolios. **********Sharply Lower Earnings **********Although no other large Texas bank has reported losses this year, the First City Bancorporation of Dallas, the state's fourth-largest bank holding company, reported that its third- quarter net income plummeted 84 percent, to $5.2 million, or 10 cents a share, from $32.6 million, or 95 cents a share, in the 1982 quarter. And No. 6, Southwest Bancshares Inc., reported that its third-quarter net income fell 44 percent, to $9.9 million, or 62 cents a share, from $17.6 million, or $1.16 a share. **********Like Interfirst, which took a $430 million write-off from its third-quarter earnings as a provision against loan losses, both First City and Southwest have cited serious problems with energy loans. First City, for example, increased its loan loss provision to $60 million at the end of the third quarter, compared to $17 million a year ago. **********And while analysts say they do not expect other Texas banks to follow the First National of Midland into collapse, the fallout of nonperforming energy loans may not be over. **********''I think the worst of it has been documented already, but we don't expect the full extent of the problems to be known until the fourth quarter,'' said Frank W. Anderson, a banking analyst at Rauscher Pierce Refsnes Inc. in Dallas. **********Indeed, the headaches of Texas bankers could also spread to the state's sprawling real estate industry, which, fueled largely by oil growth, has left both Houston and Dallas with acute surpluses of commercial office space. **********''No doubt somebody is going to get hurt,'' said William Gibson, chief economist at Republicbank Dallas. **********Because of these problems, the major Texas banks are unlikely to return to the unusually high levels of profitability they sustained between 1978 and last year. In that five-year period, the seven largest banks in the state recorded an average return on assets - the most widely used measure of a bank's performance - of 1.1 percent, or 75 percent higher than the national average for large banks.

Snijders, a Dutch editor, told the meeting, which has brought together nearly 90 editors and publishers from 25 countries. **********''In Latin America, Asia, Africa and Europe, governments have increased pressure on journalists, and are continuing to harass and to persecute them and often to close down papers they dislike,'' Mr. Snijders said.   Common Position Sought **********At their meeting here, called ''Voices of Freedom '82,'' press representatives from all over the world are trying to agree on a common position in advance of next month's general meeting of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in Paris. At this meeting, third world and Communist nations are expected to renew pressure for internationally approved curbs on press freedom. **********Two years ago the same group of editors and publishers held a similar meeting at this French alpine resort on the eve of the last Unesco general conference and issued ''the declaration of Talloires,'' a strong call for governments to defend press freedom against United Nations encroachment. **********Conference participants hope to issue a similar statement Sunday, and to review efforts to help developing countries build their own free and independent presses. **********At today's meeting, many speakers said Unesco was encouraging third world governments to reduce press freedom by saying they have a right to control the flow of information reaching their citizens and by pressing for international regulations governing journalists and the media.   Government Control Increases **********''Unesco debates are lending a respectability to government attempts to control the media,'' said Leonard R. Sussman, executive director of Freedom House, a United States organization that fights media censorship. **********The institute's new study says that in Nicaragua, the Sandinista Government has reimposed the press censorship practiced by the deposed Somoza Government. It added that in Argentina, the military authorities had regularly shut down newspapers and magazines or confiscated their issues, and many journalists have been imprisoned for their reporting while others have disappeared. **********In Turkey, the study says, the military authorities have also banned papers and fined and imprisoned journalists.   Harassment and Censorship **********In South Africa, the institute said, ''in a period of promised reform, there has been an apparent increase in detention and prosecutions and in harassment and censorship.'' **********The institute said that in Zimbabwe, ''press freedom appears to be under threat as the country moves ever nearer to a one-party state.'' In the Philippines the past year saw ''the country's first crackdown on the press since the lifting of martial law in January 1981,'' the institute said. **********The institute said that in India individual states introduce restrictive press legislation, and that in Ghana the press is run by what the Government calls ''civil servant journalists.'' The institute said that in Malaysia the Government will soon prevent foreign wire services from giving news directly to the local press."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/17/business/effects-of-phone-strike-hit-equipment-makers.html": {"writer_name": "David Sanger", "pub_date": "1983-08-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 832, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EFFECTS OF PHONE STRIKE HIT EQUIPMENT MAKERS", "print_headline": "EFFECTS OF PHONE STRIKE HIT EQUIPMENT MAKERS", "body_text": " **********With the strike against the American Telephone and Telegraph Company in its second week, telephone equipment manufacturers who depend heavily on the continued health of the Bell System say the walkout is already hurting their operations. **********For most consumers, who use the highly automated parts of Bell's switching systems to complete their calls, the effects of the strike have so far been almost unnoticable. But for companies dependent on A.T.& T. personnel to connect them into the Bell network, and for those who supply Bell with cable, electronics and computer systems valued at millions of dollars, the walkout of 675,000 workers is already having a strong ripple effect. **********Yesterday, the Rolm Corporation, one of the nation's largest manufacturers of private branch exchanges, the switching systems used in most offices, indicated it could number among the strike's first casualties. **********Revenues and earnings for the fiscal first quarter, ending Sept. 30, will be ''adversely affected,'' the company said, because it was unable to link its PBX systems to the Bell network without phone company personnel. Rolm stock dropped $1.625 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, to $63.375. **********''We have systems that are all installed and ready to go,'' said Anthony V. Carollo, vice president and general manager of operating companies for Rolm, which is based in Santa Clara, Calif. ''But until Bell hooks them up to the outside world, they are just some very expensive intercom systems.'' **********In fact, industry experts say the experiences of telecommuncations companies in the past week illustrate how dependent the nation's communication infrastructure remains on the phone company, despite the rapid deregulation of the industry. In the case of Rolm and its competitors, the greatest hardship is the absence of Bell personnel to perform cut- overs, an industry term for splicing a company's internal data and voice communications system with Bell's trunk lines.  Bottom of Priority List **********The phone company has repeatedly said the managers filling in for striking workers would place new installations of equipment at the bottom of their priority list, in favor of keeping existing systems running. And while the situation will be alleviated somewhat once the strike ends, most telecommunications companies expect that long installation delays will continue after Bell's workers are back on the job. **********''We have been told that the rule of thumb is this: Every day the strike goes on, A.T.& T. gets two days behind in installations,'' Mr. Carollo said. **********Nonetheless, most analysts say that the strike should not cause lasting problems in the industry. ''As long as the strike does not drag on for months, this will only delay the revenue stream,'' said Anthony G. Langham, a vice president of Prudential- Bache Securities. ''Income that we thought would show up for this quarter will show up instead in the next quarter. It is not like losing business to a competitor.'' **********Indeed, Rolm officials said that the strike had not slowed the pace of new orders. And at Northern Telecom, a Canadian-based manufacturer of both PBX systems and central office switching equipment for the phone company, a spokesman said that there was no indication so far that business would be hurt.  Profits Noticeably Hurt **********But on Monday, Timeplex Inc., a company based in Rochelle Park, N.J., that designs electronic data communications equipment for the phone company and other customers, said its profits would be hurt noticeably by the strike. Its stock plunged $2, to $20, that day, on the New York Stock Exchange. Yesterday, its shares edged up 12.5 cents. **********Other small companies, especially distributors of telephone parts and systems, said it was too early to determine the impact of the strike. But they expected to see a decline in orders should the strike last longer than a month. **********Increasingly, the walkout is affecting businesses that find themselves in need of new telephone service. In Fremont, Calif., the Ferix Corporation, a research and development company specializing in magnetic printers, is scheduled to move into new headquarters next week. But a PBX system installed by Rolm has yet to be hooked up. **********''We are told that we are third on the list,'' said Richard DeMello, a purchaser for the company. ''But we don't know for sure. And we can't operate without phones.'' **********Should the strike put a crimp in telecommunications revenues, it would stall a relatively healthy recovery under way throughout the industry. Low capital spending last year meant that new telephone systems were delayed by many corporate customers, but analysts say orders have been up by nearly a third in the first half of 1983. **********Nonetheless, the business is growing increasingly competitive, especially as the industry repositions itself for the breakup of the Bell System on Jan. 1. At that time, companies such as Rolm and Northern Telecom will be competing directly with A.T.& T. Information Systems, the phone company subsidiary now entering the office communications market."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/22/business/ohio-sealy-mattress-manufacturing-co-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-feb-28.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-03-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 59, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "OHIO-SEALY MATTRESS MANUFACTURING CO reports earnings for Qtr to Feb 28", "print_headline": "OHIO-SEALY MATTRESS MANUFACTURING CO reports earnings for Qtr to Feb 28", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/08/business/key-rates-018024.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-03-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 122, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/22/world/around-the-world-malta-negotiating-with-hijackers.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 153, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Malta Negotiating With Hijackers", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Malta Negotiating With Hijackers", "body_text": " **********A hijacked Libyan airliner with about 160 passengers and crew aboard remained encircled at the airport here tonight while Prime Minister Dom Mintoff negotiated with the hijackers from the control tower. **********The hijackers, believed to number three or four, warned they would blow up the plane unless their demands for fuel, food and medicine were met by a certain time, reports on the Maltese television said. **********According to unconfirmed reports, the hijackers have set such deadlines several times. **********The Maltese authorities say they will not meet any of the hijackers' demands until all passengers are released.

He reiterated that the number of marines would not be increased nor their mission expanded. **********Concern over the American troops' exposed position at Beirut airport has redoubled since a truck bomb killed at least 219 marines on Sunday.    176 Marines Still Unidentified **********A Marine spokesmen said 176 servicemen remained unidentified, partly because many of them had been been asleep and had removed their dog tags. The Pentagon, while continuing to release the names of identified casualties, prepared today to make public the names of known survivors. (Page A9.) **********The senior official, speaking in a background briefing, said that President Reagan was urging Mr. Gemayel to form a government more representative of the diverse factions in Lebanon and more conscious of Syrian and Israeli interests. **********He said the success of the Gemayel Government hinged on its ability to be more credible in Syrian eyes and to satisfy Syrian interests. **********According to a number of officials, this will be the American strategy at Lebanese unity talks due to get under way in Geneva next Monday.  Secretary of State George P. Shultz said earlier this week that the United States was seeking a broader role in the present Christian-dominated Lebanese Government for the Shiite Moslems and the Druse, as a way of dealing with Syrian concerns.  The senior official said the main mission for the marines - as well as for French, Italian and British troops - was ''being there'' to establish stability and to provide time for the Lebanese Government to build its institutions. He insisted that progress was being made to these ends.  He said the international force in Beirut would continue to play this role. He described it as practical and sensible to undertake a more mobile and flexible disposition of the marines. **********This could be done in a variety of ways, he said. He mentioned additional fortifications and redeployment to more secure areas along the coast. He specifically spoke of the possibility of putting marines in villages where they could help with construction and sanitation.  In response to questions, the official did not say whether the multinational force was sufficient in size and mission to meet the goal of bringing about a stable Lebanon. Instead, he argued that withdrawal would make attainment of the goal impossible and that no Lebanese Government could be expected to have the necessary perseverance without it. **********His emphasis appeared to be on these forces' role as an adjunct to a diplomatic effort to accommodate Syrian interests. **********When asked what incentives could be offered to Syria to support a stable Lebanese Government, he said that Syria was interested in an Israeli withdrawal so that it would not have to face the Israelis on two fronts, in Lebanon and in the Golan Heights. He also said Syria had an important stake in a restored and strong Lebanese economy. **********He said that President Reagan believed that Syria had legitimate worries about its borders, and that the President would urge Mr. Gemayel to take these security interests into account. **********With regard to the existing Lebanese-Israeli agreement, opposed by Syria because it provides for Israeli withdrawal in return for Syrian withdrawal, the official said Syria could deal with its concerns ''in dialogue'' with the Lebanese Government."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/25/world/blacks-seen-to-applaud-bomb-attack-in-pretoria.html": {"writer_name": "Joseph Lelyveld", "pub_date": "1983-05-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1785, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BLACKS SEEN TO APPLAUD BOMB ATTACK IN PRETORIA", "print_headline": "BLACKS SEEN TO APPLAUD BOMB ATTACK IN PRETORIA", "body_text": " **********In virtually all their pronouncements on Friday's car bomb explosion in Pretoria, South African officials have emphasized the black casualties, apparently in the belief that sympathy among blacks for the outlawed African National Congress would give way to revulsion over the brutality of an urban bombing. **********However, soundings taken today among a rough cross-section of politically involved and also ordinary urban blacks indicate that the reaction among the section of the population that matters most to the African National Congress has been the opposite of what whites tend to assume. **********The state broadcasting monopoly and the press, as well as the Government officials, have tended to emphasize black casualties and to assume a convergence of white and black reactions to the attack.  Thus on Monday, when Defense Minister Magnus Malan pledged to avenge the dead be they ''white, black or colored,'' The Johannesburg Star commented in an editorial deploring the cycle of violence that ''South Africans mourn the Pretoria dead'' and ''perhaps even exult in the swift revenge at Maputo'' - the capital of Mozambique, which had just been the target of a reprisal attack. Leaders in 'Homelands' Quoted **********It was striking that the editorial drew no distinction between the reactions of whites and blacks. On a facing page, a headline declared, ''Black Leaders Damn Attack.'' That article quoted the reactions to the Pretoria blast only of officials in the black ''homelands'' that South Africa has created within its borders. **********This morning a commentary on the state radio declared that the Pretoria bombing had been ''universally condemned'' in South Africa by ''all communities and every sector of political opinion.'' **********But none of this has taken into account the reaction in the broad range of black opinion that can loosely be described as nationalist, in that it rejects any political settlement not based on full political rights for the majority. **********Questioned about reactions to the bombing, a black with wide contacts in political circles declared: ''People are jubilant. They long ago gave up any hope for peaceful change. What they are saying is that the African National Congress is finally hitting real targets. That is why you are having crowds of blacks drawn to the street where the bomb went off. They want to see the place where a white man died.'' Distrust of Press Cited **********Asked how they felt about the 8 blacks who were among the 18 people killed by the blast, the man replied that some blacks were so mistrustful of the official information outlets that they have taken comfort from a hypothesis that some of these dead might be the creation of Government propagandists. The reaction of others, he said, was that, ''We should just keep quiet about them and bury our dead.'' **********Another source replied to the same question by saying, ''I heard one man say, 'You can't separate the tea and the milk after they've been mixed.' They understand that there have to be black casualties in South African conditions.'' **********Older blacks who are often intensely religious and might be expected to recoil from bloodshed are also intensely loyal to the African National Congress, which was a legal movement in their youth, this man said. **********''They know how long it waited before it tried these kind of tactics,'' he said. Because of the sensitivity of the questions being asked - and the risk of official reprisals for any expression of support for ''terrorists'' - the interviews were conducted on the understanding that no one whose views were mentioned would be identified except in the most general terms. Criticism of Congress's Tactics **********The car bomb explosion has probably erased one of the most frequently voiced criticisms of the tactics of the African National Congress in black nationalist circles. This was that white strategists in its leadership were sending young blacks on ''suicide missions'' in which they were instructed to hit symbolic targets such as empty Government buildings. This time there is a widespread assumption, fostered in part by the pro-Government Afrikaans press, that the car bomb might actually have been set off by white members of the movement. **********Except among the most doctrinaire supporters of the ''black consciousness'' viewpoint, which rejects political alliances with whites, the immediate effect of the Pretoria bombing has apparently been to bolster support for the African National Congress, the sources all agreed. However, they said the early reaction and their assessment of it must both be regarded as tentative. **********Those questioned all appeared to subscribe to the general view that whites have relied on violence to maintain their power and that blacks had no choice but to respond in kind. The car bomb explosion was justified on two counts: as a reprisal for the attack last December by South African forces on African National Congress residences in Maseru, the capital of Lesotho, in which 42 people were killed, and as a strike against a military target. No Tally of Military Casualties **********The office buildings outside which the bomb went off housed South Africa's air force command. The Star's editorial estimated that about half the dead and injured worked for the armed forces in one capacity or another, but there has been no official tally of military casualties. **********The black reactions proved to be a mirror image of what whites have been saying to justify the strikes of the armed forces across the border. In each case, the deaths of bystanders is deplored but blamed on the extremism of the other side. ''It is unfortunate that innocent civilians were involved,'' a black social worker said, ''but the motive of the attack was very clear. The black fatalities are just part of the larger sacrifices that we as a nation have to face and accept.'' **********The mother of two young men who have left the country to join what is called ''the struggle'' commented: ''The boys have finally struck where it hurts most. This will make the Government realize that our sons are away from home and dearly want to return. There will never be an end to this as long as the gates to their country remain closed to them.'' Hope for Negotiation Voiced **********''You don't want to call the deaths of innocent people a good thing,'' a teacher observed, ''but maybe some people will begin to realize now how valuable all human life is and take steps to negotiation.'' **********Such justifications were sometimes streaked with foreboding. A man who offers tutoring in English in the black township of Soweto called the news of the bombing ''good but alarming.'' He said it signaled ''a bleak future for the country as a whole.'' **********A middle-aged security guard said he thought the fighting should be kept out of the cities, but added: ''It will make the Boers realize that these boys mean business too and have the guts to fight.'' Boer, the Afrikaans word for farmer, is sometimes used as a pejorative ethnic label by blacks. **********''They hit them! It was out of this world!'' said a 19-year-old school dropout who sounded exultant. ''The cops, the whites didn't expect a black man to strike so hard.'' A.N.C. GLANCE African National Congress History **********The African National Congress was founded in the Orange Free State in January 1912 ''to defend Africans against repression.'' In the early years, its orientation was reformist rather than revolutionary, and it tried to achieve its goals through legal political action only. In 1949 it adopted a ''Program of Action'' that included nonviolent civil disobedience. **********On March 21, 1960, a protest against laws requiring South African blacks to carry passes resulted in the shooting of nearly 300 blacks in Sharpeville. Subsequently banned, the group went underground. On Dec. 16, 1961, Nelson Mandela, a leader of the group, formed Umkhonto We Sizwe, which is Zulu for Spear of the Nation, a military command that began a campaign of sabotage against ''the symbols of apartheid,'' using, in particular, rocket attacks against police stations. **********Two years later, South African police found the underground headquarters of the African National Congress in Rivonia, a suburb of Johannesburg. Mr. Mandela and other leaders of the organization were arrested. In 1964, Mr. Mandela was sentenced to life in prison. He is in a maximum security prison near Cape Town. **********Several other leaders of the group, including its current president, Oliver Tambo, left the country to rebuild the organization abroad. **********For the rest of the 1960's, the exiled group concentrated on diplomacy and propaganda. Since the late 1970's, guerrilla and sabotage activities have steadily increased but the group has avoided indiscrimiate violence. The recent bombing in Pretoria, according to Thomas Karis, an expert on South African politics at the Graduate School of the City University in New York, ''marks a historic shift if it is the beginning of guerrilla action that harms civilian bystanders.'' Goals **********Mfanafuthi Makatini, head of the group's mission to the United Nations, where it has observer status, describes the organization as a national liberation movement whose goal is ''to defend Africans against repressive white laws.'' **********He said the group favors the creation of a democratic society ''for all South African people regardless of race, color or creed.'' It is an independent organization, he added, ''non-Communist but not anti-Communist.'' Mr. Makatini denied South African charges that the group is controlled by Moscow through its Communist members. Structure **********The ruling body of the group is the National Executive Committee based in Lusaka, Zambia. Its 18 members are South African blacks.  Below the National Executive Committee is the Revolutionary Council, whose members are leaders of the organizations in the A.N.C. alliance, including people of Indian or Asian origin and whites. The task of the Revolutionary Council is to carry out the program of the National Executive Committee. **********Below the Revolutionary Council are such organs as the military command and the information department.  The group receives money from many governmental and nongovernmental groups in the Communist bloc, Western Eu- rope and the third world. Leadership **********Nelson Mandela, 65 years old, is considered the leading figure in the organization despite his being in prison. Oliver Tambo, also 65 and formerly Mr. Mandela's law partner, is president. Alfred Nzo, a longtime activist, is secretary general. Thomas Nkobi is treasurer general. **********Several surveys indicate broad support for the group among South African blacks, but there are no official membership figures or claims."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/23/world/mitterrand-to-visit-us.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-12-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 33, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mitterrand to Visit U.S.", "print_headline": "Mitterrand to Visit U.S.", "body_text": " **********President Francois Mitterrand will visit the United States March 21-27 at the invitation of President Reagan, a French Government spokesman said today.

Egyptian officials say the emphasis of the visits, particularly the one to Japan, will be to obtain economic and trade commitments. **********Aid from Japan has been running at about $180 million a year. This year Egypt is expected to receive about $210 million from Japan, mainly for agricultural and fishery projects, and an official announcement is expected during his visit to Tokyo. Mr. Mubarak is also said to be eager to persuade the Japanese to take a bigger financial role in Egyptian banking. **********In China, talks are due on intensifying agricultural and trade ties. Military aid is also on the agenda. In the past China has provided some warplanes and spare parts. In North Korea, Mr. Mubarak is due to discuss obtaining Soviet-made spare parts for aging Egyptian military equipment, and in Indonesia he is expected to stress Egypt's ties with third world countries. Cuts in Government Spending **********At a recent meeting with his economic aides, Mr. Mubarak said efforts must be made to cut Government outlays without raising the prices of subsidized basic commodities. In 1977, when prices on such subsidized items as bread, cooking oil and sugar were reduced, street riots erupted, resulting in many deaths and threatening to topple President Anwar el-Sadat. **********The economic outlook appears bleaker today than some months ago.  Projections for next year's Government budget, which has not yet been announced, indicate a deficit of nearly $2 billion, with about $500 million of that resulting from a drop in profits on Egyptian oil exports. Egypt recently cut its price for top-grade oil from $29 to $27 a barrel after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries announced agreement on a drop from $34 to $29 a barrel. **********Since coming to power after Mr. Sadat was assassinated at a military parade on Oct. 6, 1981, Mr. Mubarak has moved at a measured pace to bring about changes. **********His command over the unicameral Parliament, overwhelmingly dominated by his ruling National Democratic Party, seems firm. But he has received some criticism from opposition groups like the small Socialist Democratic Party because of his measured pace. A More Critical Press **********The Government-supervised Egyptian press is more critical and unfettered than it was in the last days of Mr. Sadat's rule. Lately the President has earned public approval because of his muchpublicized anti-corruption drive. **********The chief target has been Mr. Sadat's half-brother, Esmat, who rose during the Sadat Presidency from a $60-a-month bus driver to a man with a fortune estimated at $150 million. Esmet and three of his sons were sentenced in February to a year in jail by an ethics court, which also confiscated their property and that of seven other members of the family. **********The state prosecutor general is reviewing the case, which includes charges of illegal acquisition of land, influence peddling, black market dealings and the importation and sale of rotten food. Two members of the Egyptian Cabinet - Supply Minister Ahmed Nouh and Industry Minister Fuad Abu Zaghla - were forced to resign after their names were mentioned in the investigation of Mr. Sadat. **********The trial has sent shudders through a newly rich Egyptian class that gained enormous profits from President Sadat's open-door economic policy, an international move that brought a glut of foreign consumer items on the market from cosmetics to tape recorders. Steel Plants, Not Perfume **********Mr. Mubarak has said he will continue the policy but it has to be reordered to wipe out the heavy emphasis on consumer luxuries. He wants foreign investments that will help add steel plants and other components of a sturdy industrial base. **********According to Egyptian and diplomatic officials, Mr. Mubarak has ''a huge stake,'' as one put it, in what happens in Lebanon, although he is not a direct participant. **********Mr. Mubarak has been steadfast in his support of the Egyptian treaty with Israel despite calls in the Arab world for its abrogation. He has said the treaty is proof that peaceful tactics can work in the search for Middle East stability. **********But the current impasse in the talks on withdrawal of Israeli, Syrian and Palestinian forces from Lebanon has caused concern here that this argument is being weakened at a time of what seems to be improvement in Egypt's relations with Arab nations that broke ties because of the treaty. **********Mr. Mubarak has been calling for speedy action by Arabs to take up President Reagan's proposal last September for autonomy for Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in association with Jordan. He has been addressing his call especially to King Hussein of Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organization, asserting that the crucial American voice in peace talks may be diminished as Presidential elections approach next year in the United States. **********In domestic affairs, President Mubarak's public style has been different from that of President Sadat. Mr. Sadat made a point of placing himself alone in the foreground, with his aides kept in the shadows. Mr. Mubarak has brought the officials into the picture, and diplomats here note that he thus can share any criticism and blame as well as praise."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/26/business/business-people-bbc-brown-boveri-appoints-us-head.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1983-04-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 336, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BBC BROWN BOVERI APPOINTS U.S. HEAD", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; BBC BROWN BOVERI APPOINTS U.S. HEAD", "body_text": " **********Klaus E.

''It's very difficult to manage from Europe, as we and other European companies here found out,'' Mr. Agthe said. ''Now we have a central focus, a uniform business approach, and we will go forward from there.'' **********Brown Boveri employs 3,000 people and generates sales of $400 million a year in the United States. Brown Boveri's strategy, in the homeland of the likes of General Electric and Westinghouse, is to look for special segments of the market.

The Dow Jones industrial average, meanwhile, finished at 1,225.71, down 14.03 points. **********Indicative of the market's fast-changing mood, the industrial average on Monday moved from an early 20-point gain to a 10-point loss at the close, in the wake of rumors that the Federal Reserve had miscalculated its money supply numbers. That brought a denial from the Fed, but it failed to impart any sense of direction to what seemed essentially a market without a rudder. **********The changing face of market favorites has persisted for most of this year. At various times, favorites have included interest-sensitive stocks, technology high-fliers, basic industry issues and ''hot new issues.'' While sustained gains have been virtually impossible for any individual sector, this group rotation has a way of correcting market excesses. **********But it has proven to be a puzzling environment for small investors and professional portfolio managers alike. At a private meeting of a dozen money managers on Friday, the prevailing sentiment was that stock prices would move higher over the next 6 to 12 months. However, some of these managers now are carrying larger-than-usual cash positions. **********In the first glorious year of the bull market, which began in August 1982, brokerage stocks were the top-performing group. This sector soared 255 percent, as measured by Standard & Poor's survey of 89 industries.  However, as proof of the market's changing leadership, most brokerage issues tumbled last week. The biggest casualty was Merrill Lynch, dropping 5 1/8 points, to 36 7/8, as the most-active issue on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of the world's largest brokerage house sold two months ago at a record price of 56 1/2. **********Last week's sharp drop followed Merrill's disclosure that it would report ''substantially lower'' profits for the 1983 third quarter, compared with last year, because of a combination of lower trading volume, which translates into reduced commission income, and increased operating costs. **********Meanwhile, railroad stocks enjoyed their turn in the investment sun. Among other factors, railroads are perceived as beneficiaries of an improving economy. Two vast rail systems traded at new highs: CSX Corporation gained 5/8, to 72 5/8, after selling at a record price of 73 3/4. Burlington Northern, edging ahead 1/8, to 97 3/8, saw its shares trade at a high of 99 3/4 during the week. Individuals Still Buying **********While some large institutions have been taking profits and piling up a war chest of cash lately, individual investors continue to buy stocks. This pattern was borne out by the market's roller-coaster performance on Monday and, somewhat earlier, by the persistent appetite of individuals to buy stock on margin. **********The Big Board reported that margin debt of customers at its member firms rose to a record in August for the 11th straight month, to $19.1 billion, from the previous month's $18.9 billion. The number of margin account customers also set a new record - 805,000, up from 790,000 in July. **********A customer with a margin account is borrowing money from his broker, and the stock is used as collateral for the loan to help pay for the shares. The percentage of cash a person must put up to open a margin account is set by the Fed. Since 1974 this margin requirement has remained at 50 percent. **********Most technical analysts consider a rising tide of margin debt as a bullish sign. But the slim 1.2 percent increase between July and August could indicate that individuals are tempering their enthusiasm for stocks. A look at margin-debt figures indicates that individuals were somewhat slow to climb on the bull market's bandwagon, fueled initially in August 1982 by huge purchases on the part of pension funds and other institutional investors. Between the end of July 1982 and the end of September 1982, margin debt actually contracted, slipping by $520 million to reach $10.95 billion. Effect of Interest Rates **********The direction of interest rates, virtually everyone agrees, will set the tone for both stock prices and bond prices in the period ahead. Ronald A. Glantz, chief investment officer of Paine Webber Mitchell Hutchins Inc., said last week that his firm continues to believe that interest rates will decline over the balance of 1983 and then increase next summer. **********''In any event, we advocate group rotation,'' he said in a strategy report. ''Basic industry seems to be in the middle of its relative move, capital goods have entered their move, and consumer nondurables appear to be next.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/11/world/britain-s-nuclear-battle-the-political-lines-form-news-analysis.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-01-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1814, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "News Analysis", "print_headline": "BRITAIN'S NUCLEAR BATTLE: THE POLITICAL LINES FORM; News Analysis", "body_text": " **********When Vice President Bush arrives in Britain next month at the end of his seven-nation European tour, he will find America's closest European ally torn with uncertainty about nuclear weapons and strategy. **********And when Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, by far the Reagan Administration's staunchest European supporter, faces the British electorate later this year or early next, she will find herself challenged at every turn on the same issues. Apart from the domestic economy, they have become the central questions in British politics. **********In the past year, the old consensus over military policy has broken down. The Tories under Mrs. Thatcher are committed to the emplacement of American cruise missiles, the purchase of Trident missiles to replace the aging Polaris system and a generally tough line toward Moscow. The Labor Party under Michael Foot is equally committed to removing all nuclear weapons from Britain, whether British or American, and to vigorous pursuit of an arms-reduction pact with Moscow. **********Protest Has Grown **********The nuclear question has been thrust into the forefront of political debate here not only by the Labor Party but also by antinuclear pressure groups. The ''peace camp'' at Greenham Common, 50 miles west of London, started by a few women to protest the planned installation there later this year of Europe's first cruise missiles, has grown into a worldwide symbol of the drive to ''ban the bomb.'' **********In a sense, the appointment last week of Michael Heseltine as Minister of Defense was a measure of the seriousness with which the Prime Minister takes the growing antinuclear sentiment. He is not one of her intimates, and she probably would have preferred to give the position to someone else; Mr. Heseltine got it, according to Conservative leaders, because he was thought to be the man best equipped to lead the counterattack against Labor on disarmament. **********The change in assessment at 10 Downing Street is an important one.  As antinuclear sentiment built up in Britain during 1982, prominent Tories tended at first to dismiss it, as one Cabinet member last spring did as ''a lot of froth generated by the old pinko fringe.'' **********It is no longer possible to be so dismissive. In the latest Gallup poll, completed in mid-November, 72 percent of the electorate pronounced itself worried about nuclear weapons. Although two-thirds of the public said they opposed unilateral disarmament for Britain, almost a third favored it. And only 41 percent said they thought Britain's independent deterrent decreased the probability of a nuclear attack on this country, as against 52 percent who said the deterrent increased that possibility or had no effect at all. Archbishop Is Involved **********Prominent people in no way associated with the far left have also been voicing their concern. In his Christmas sermon, the Most Rev.  Robert Runcie, Archbishop of Canterbury, said a full-scale nuclear war was unwinnable, said it was madness even to contemplate such a war and applauded those who demonstrate against nuclear weapons. In February, the Church of England, which Dr. Runcie heads, will debate a new report of a working party on ''The Church and the Bomb'' that looks with favor upon disarmament with Britain acting alone. **********Many middle-of-the-road newspapers are devoting an increasing amount of space to the nuclear question. The Sunday Times, for example, described it as ''the most crucial issue for 1983'' in a New Year's editorial. The paper called for cancellation of the purchase of Trident, changes in the means of control of cruise missiles and much more serious bargaining with the Soviet Union on arms reduction. **********One of the important strands in antinuclear feeling in Britain is the fear that Moscow and Washington contemplate fighting a nuclear war on the soil of Western Europe. Alex Kitson, a Scottish labor union and political leader, puts it this way, ''When they talk about limited nuclear war in the States, they mean it would be limited to us.'' The Current Focus **********That feeling has coalesced around the 96 cruise missiles that are to begin arriving at Greenham Common - technically a Royal Air Force Base but actually under the control of the United States - sometime next winter. The women who set up the ''peace camp'' 15 months ago outside the base's main gate and have kept it going in fair weather and foul freely admit to making a basically emotional appeal to others who, as one of them said last week, ''don't want the world blown up.'' **********''The impetus for the campaign,'' commented Helen Swarbrick, one of the 30,000 women who linked hands in protest around the base last month, ''is the idea that we don't like violence rather than any sort of argument for or against the Americans being here or how many weapons we should have. It means you don't get mixed up in silly arguments about numbers. It's simplified and idealistic, but the goal and direction are clear.'' **********Gillian Booth, who has already spent two weeks in prison for her activites at the camp, adds: ''I would like to see all countries get rid of nuclear weapons, including Britain. But you can only bring pressure in the country that you happen to be living in.'' **********It appears inevitable that the protests will intensify as the election campaign and the arrival of the missiles comes closer. In addition, Mr. Foot, who had been following a fairly circumspect course, has recently put his prestige and that of his party behind the Greenham Common protestors with a visit to the camp, a Christmas present of a Cheddar cheese and an attack on Mrs. Thatcher's weapons policy in his New Year's message. Issue of Dual Control **********''At every twist in her attitude to the nuclear arms race,'' he said, ''our Prime Minister displays her refusal or her incapacity to understand what it means, and the terms on which she has agreed to station American cruise missiles here in Britain provided a truly strange commentary on the Thatcherite idea of national sovereignty.'' **********Playing on nationalistic feeling, Labor spokesmen, including Denis Healey, who opposes his own party's demand for Britain to act alone on disarmament, have been pressing the Government to insist on dual control of cruise missiles, such as that which applies to some weapons based on the Continent. Dual control would mean that no cruise missile could be fired without the approval of both British and American officials. **********Francis Pym, the Foreign Secretary, told Mr. Healey in the House of Commons that such control would be highly desirable but added that he could ''not give that assurance.'' A few days later, Secretary of State George P. Shultz, on a visit here, brushed the idea aside. But it has almost unanimous support among Labor M.P.'s and some backing among the Tory backbenchers. **********In addition, it is strongly advocated by Dr. David Owen, the former Labor Foreign Secretary who is now one of the leaders of the new Social Democratic Party. Dr. Owen, who abandoned his old colleagues in part because he could not stomach their so-called unilateralism, said the British people must be given the assurance that cruise missiles cannot be fired here without the approval of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. A Middle Position **********The Social Democrats are trying to carve out a position between the two major parties, favoring the abandonment of Trident like Labor, favoring the retention of American nuclear bases and an independent British deterrent like the Conservatives, and arguing, in a policy paper published over the weekend, that a decision on cruise deployment should await the outcome of the arms limitation talks in Geneva. **********Their allies, the Liberals, are officially committed to the abandonment of the independent deterrent, the renewal of which, through the purchase of the Trident, is thought likely to cost more than $15 billion. The party is split on the cruise missiles, with the Liberal Council opposing their deployment and the party leader, David Steel, making it clear that he does not feel bound by the council's stand. **********''For every party,'' a leading Liberal said at the end of last year, ''evolving a clear policy on cruise missiles and defending it vigorously is the primary business of the new political year.'' **********The missiles were originally intended to guarantee Western Europe's security in the face of Soviet SS-20's, and the plan to deploy them was conceived in part at the request of the Europeans. But now they are seen by growing numbers of people, here and elsewhere, as increasing the chances of war. Their defenders argue that they are necessary to maintain the nuclear balance and that if Europe refused them, some or all American troops might be pulled out of West Germany; their critics say that they would simply make it easier for the United States and the Soviet Union to fight a nuclear war without intercontinental missiles. Outlook for Mrs. Thatcher **********For Mrs. Thatcher, a hard road seems to lie ahead, even with the help of the rhetorical skills of Mr. Heseltine. At a time of mounting anxiety about nuclear weapons and at a time of increased spending on the garrison in the Falkland Islands, she must defend not only vast outlays for Trident but also the deployment of the cruise missiles. **********Some Cabinet members appear to be having second thoughts about Trident on economic grounds, although none so far has even semipublicly advocated a reversal of the decision to buy the system, and the Government is beginning to lose ground with usually friendly commentators. Malcolm Rutherford of The Financial Times said not long ago that Mrs. Thatcher was overextended in the whole area of military policy. **********If the Prime Minister and her associates can successfully paint Mr. Foot as an extremist who might pull Britain out of NATO or dangerously reduce the country's military capacities, she might win the argument. The country, as opinion polls show, is not yet unilateralist. But if, on the other hand, she retains a hard line on arms negotiation and shows no sign of responding to the nation's concern while Mr. Foot makes his appeal in relatively moderate terms, the issue could hurt the Conservatives at the polls and even, conceivably, help Labor to win. **********On the eve of taking up his duties at the Defense Ministry, Mr.  Heseltine said he intended to engage in a ''constructive dialogue'' with the antinuclear movement while keeping in mind the need to counter Soviet strength. To many, his comments sounded like the opening shot in a campaign to put a more politically acceptable face on Mrs. Thatcher's policies in preparation for the electoral battle."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/08/business/briefs-026224.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-11-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 310, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Avnet Inc.  said it had agreed in principle to acquire all the shares of Master Specialties Co., a privately held switch manufacturer, for an undisclosed cash price. ***********  Citicorp's Capital Markets Group said it had agreed to buy a 29.9 percent stake in the London Stock Exchange business of Vickers Da Costa (Holdings) P.L.C. and control of its other activities. ***********  Du Pont Co.  introduced a new clinical test using monoclonal antibodies to monitor the level of the drug theophylline in the blood serum of patients being treated for acute chronic asthma. ***********  IMC Magnetics Corp.  said its board had accepted a merger offer of $24 a share from Minebea Co.

Not Clear Who Manned Guns **********The Western military sources said it was not clear whether the anti-Government artillery positions attacked by the French were being manned by Syrian, Druse, Palestinian or Lebanese leftist troops. Nor was it clear, the sources said, whether the positions were destroyed in the raids. **********Shortly after the French air strike, the makeshift Lebanese Air Force base at Jubail, 24 miles miles north of Beirut, was attacked by a barrage of rockets, as was the Lebanese Army position in Khalde, on the coastal road just south of the capital. **********In other military action today, Lebanese troops holding the town of Suk al Gharb, on a ridge overlooking Beirut, came under repeated attacks by the Druse and their allies through the day.

American jets have been confined to such flights so far, although American warships shelled Druse and Palestinian troops on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of this week. **********On Monday, the French Foreign Minister, Claude Cheysson, criticized the United States for opening fire from naval vessels in support of Lebanese Army units defending Suk al Gharb. The shelling was undertaken under a policy authorized by President Reagan allowing the United States contingent to call in air or naval strikes in support of the Lebanese Army if the army is attacked in a way that endangers the Americans. **********Today, the French Defense Minister, Charles Hernu, announced in Paris that his Government had given French troops in Beirut permission to make use of their ''right to legitimate self-defense and to reply against the batteries that have taken as targets French objectives in Beirut.''  A French Decision **********The French decision to retaliate was made by them alone, just as the Americans alone decided when they wanted to use their naval guns. The French, Italian, British and American contingents of the international each have liaison officers stationed with the other three units to coordinate any military decisions they have made and to insure that they do not run into each other. **********But there is no overall commander making military decisions on behalf of the international force as a whole.

The first reason, he said, was ''the reluctance of the Jordanians and the Palestinians to come forward and negotiate, as was called for in the Camp David accords themselves.'' **********Second, he said, was ''the sharp disparity between the concept of full autonomy as offered by Prime Minister Begin and his Government on the one hand, as contrasted with the concept that both President Sadat and I had at the conclusion of Camp David.'' **********Asked if this did not point to a flaw in the Camp David framework, which allowed such varied interpretations of ''autonomy,'' Mr. Carter replied that hours had been spent during the talks ''looking in thesauruses, dictionaries, studying the history of other examples of autonomy around the world. I never considered that the definition of autonomy would be so narrow as has been preferred by the Israeli Government.'' **********Mr. Carter said the Israelis had put forward ''a long list of duties for which the Palestinians have been offered a very limited authority. In each instance, I believe, the Israelis have wanted to retain an absolute veto power.'' In some key areas, he said, such as water and land, ''the offer of autonomy did not remain.'' **********''My hope,'' Mr. Carter continued, ''is that with the possible joining of the autonomy talks by King Hussein and the Palestinians, this limited offer by the Israeli Government, which I considered when I was President to be inadequate, will be expanded.'' **********But in the meantime, he said, even that limited version could be put into effect by Israel. ''There's never been anything to prevent this, what I consider to be a very limited degree of autonomy, from being given unilaterally to those who live on the West Bank and Gaza,'' he said. ''It would be a very easy thing for the Israeli Government to do, it would be a true demonstration of a commitment to the concept of autonomy.'' The Israeli package, Mr. Carter said, ''could very easily be granted overnight.'' **********He said that seeing the Jewish settlements in the West Bank, many of which have now become high-rise satellite cities, had been discouraging."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/21/business/less-oil-used-by-us-in-82.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-01-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 175, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Less Oil Used By U.S. in '82", "print_headline": "Less Oil Used By U.S. in '82", "body_text": " **********The United States consumed almost 6 percent less oil in 1982 and cut oil imports by 20 percent compared with the previous year, the American Petroleum Institute reported today. **********The institute said total oil products supplied for the domestic market were 15.1 million barrels a day in 1981, down 5.5 percent from 1981. **********This reflected the recession and conservation efforts, the institute said. **********Crude oil imports fell 20 percent in 1982 from the previous year, to 3.3 million barrels a day.

Greene today approved another major step in the divestiture of 22 local phone companies by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, but criticized recent rulings by the Federal Communications Commission that will raise local phone rates. **********Judge Greene has approved the overall antitrust agreement between the Justice Department and A.T.& T. under which the divestiture is to take place early next year, and is now in the process of approving each step of the process. He has been scrutinizing the details of the divestiture as they are submitted to him for approval. **********In today's action, Judge Greene gave conditional consent to A.T.& T.'s plan to divide the nation into 161 geographical areas within which the divested local phone companies will offer service. Each of the local companies will have a number of districts, but will seldom handle service among their districts. That as well as interstate calling will be considered long-distance service, to be handled by A.T.& T. and other long-distance carriers. The judge also ordered some changes in the districts, including the splitting of the New York City zone. **********A.T& T.'Delighted' **********Pickard Wagner, a spokesman for the company here, said A.T.& T. was ''delighted'' at Judge Greene's 162-page opinion issued today and added that the complicated process for carrying out the divestiture appears to be ''on track.'' **********Phone calling between the zones, which are called LATA's, or local access and transport areas, after divestiture will generally be defined as long-distance calls, and such service will be handled not by the local phone companies but by A.T.& T. itself and the smaller, competing long-distance phone companies, such as the MCI Communications Corporation. **********Previously it had been proposed to include in the New York LATA a vast region including Long Island, New Jersey and New York State up to Poughkeepsie. Today Judge Greene approved a change that splits off Poughkeepsie into a separate LATA and ''will draw the Poughkeepsie LATA so as to absorb as much of the 914 number plan area as network considerations will allow.'' **********That would presumably extend the new LATA southward to include large segments of Westchester County and perhaps Rockland County, but details were not made available today.

He said the F.C.C. was responsible for authorizing local phone companies to raise revenue by imposing on customers monthly access charges for long-distance calls. **********Despite his strong misgivings about the F.C.C policies, Judge Greene said, he is unable to order any changes because the actions of the commission are not legally before him. **********The access charges, covering the interconnection of local and long-distance networks, would offset revenue that A.T.& T. says it has been giving its local subsidiaries over the years from longdistance revenue. Long-distance service is considered more profitable than local phone service. **********Judge Greene, however, said that while it may be a commonly accepted notion, it has not been proved that long distance service subsidizes local service. Even if it does, he said, the regulatory agency is not compelled to spread higher costs across local phone customers as the F.C.C. has ordered state regulators to do. **********The long-distance carriers should make up for revenue lost by local companies by means of higher charges they will pay the local phone companies for interconnections, Judge Greene said. **********The F.C.C. did not comment on Judge Greene's statements.  In ruling on the the geographic areas, Judge Greene approved five of the geographic regions as proposed for New England and ordered a division of the proposed Eastern Massachusetts area. **********In the South, the judge approved 57 areas, ordered the division of the Birmingham, Ala., region and the consolidation of two regions in Kentucky. **********In the Midwest, he approved 40 proposed regions, ordered the division of the Cleveland and Davenport, Iowa, regions; consolidated the two regions proposed for South Dakota, and consolidated one Illinois region. **********In the West, he approved 21 areas; consolidated two regions proposed for Utah and ordered a modification of the Los Angeles region. **********In addition, Judge Green withheld approval of several regions pending more information.

And he added, ''We're going to have to show a willingness to sacrifice in almost every sector of the Federal budget, and military simply can't be immune from it.'' **********Although Mr. Baker opposes the idea of a contingency tax, he said he would favor repeal of the indexing of income tax brackets to inflation. Such indexing is scheduled to begin in 1985, and repealing it could raise the additional revenues in future years that most budget officials, in both Congress and the Administration, argue will be needed to reduce deficits. But the revenue gain from repeal of indexing would fall short of the $135 billion that Administration officials say is in the contingency tax proposal. **********Treasury Secretary Regan described restructuring of the income tax as ''probably the dream and the goal of every Secretary of the Treasury once he's been in office more than two months.'' **********But it seems unlikely that much will be done in the near future, he indicated, and aides said he was trying to de-emphasize recent speculation about proposals to overhaul the tax code. **********''I would like to think that perhaps we could advance that somewhat,'' Mr. Regan said, adding, ''It's something that I'd like to study to see if we can accomplish it.'' **********The Secretary said interest rates would continue to decline this year, and he predicted that the banks' prime rate, now 11 percent, would drop. ''I do think that we'll probably see another couple of points, at least, on the prime,'' he said. But he remarked that rates might go up in 1984 if the economy expands. **********Although senior Administration officials said last week that the President had approved the contingency tax plan, Secretary Regan would not say so publicly. But he explained the reasoning behind the idea. **********''I'd have to say the perception has become the reality,'' he said. Speaking of the financial markets, he said: ''They are afraid that huge deficits will mean higher rates of interest in the United States. As a result, the interest rates are not coming down to the extent that we want. **********''So, therefore, we have to deal with these deficits,'' he concluded. ''One is to have less spending, and two is to increase revenues.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/26/world/dead-are-revered-and-living-well-in-madagascar.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Cowell", "pub_date": "1983-07-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 667, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DEAD ARE REVERED AND LIVING WELL IN MADAGASCAR", "print_headline": "DEAD ARE REVERED AND LIVING WELL IN MADAGASCAR", "body_text": " **********The late Uncle Rakoto, a guidebook says, may begin feeling restless, neglected or just lonely, and will communicate this to his relatives, possibly by way of a dream. **********In response, the relatives will arrange a party, dressing him in silk, parading him through the town, drinking to his health and bringing him up to date on the gossip. Then they will put him back in his tomb until he calls for them again. **********To be an ancestor, the guidebook, ''A Glance at Madagascar,'' says, is to join the ranks of ''those beings now passed on but who remain an integral part of the Malagasy family and continue to exercise enormous power and influence.'' **********It may have started, a sociologist said, with a custom of burying the dead first in one sepulcher, and then moving the body a few years later, wrapping the bones anew in a shroud. Later, the celebration, a joyous event, became more frequent - and expensive. Don't Trifle With Rakoto **********These days a good-sized silk shroud costs the equivalent of $150, or three months' wages for a laborer.  But Uncle Rakoto, the guidebook suggests, is not to be trifled with, for ancestors can ''bring a calamity upon any family or community guilty of some violation of the ancestral customs or taboos.'' **********The taboos of this capital, which is encircled by swamps and paddy fields that press against its hills, are many.  Each house, according to a belief that no one seems to disown with any absoluteness, contains a corner for spirits where the north and east walls come together. **********Within the walls, too, there are said to be vectors of fate that change with the shifting of the moon, angles of destiny chronicled by astrologers who decided eons ago that some days are accursed and good for nothing and best left alone. Watch Out for Tuesdays **********Tuesday, in particular, is a day with nothing to recommend it, a day on which no funerals, weddings or work of a serious nature should be scheduled. Save them for Friday, a propitious day in all respects. **********The taboos, called fady, also dictate that a person coming from the north should avoid the west side of a house, that he should walk instead along the east side and come to the door from the south. **********The taboos and the reverence for the dead continue, undiluted by the passing of time or the incursions of missionaries who began the Christianization of the Malagasy. Of the current population of 10 million, roughly half are listed as Christians. **********In 1818 the London Missionary Society sent teachers who translated the Bible into Malagasy, a language that had not been transcribed into Roman characters. **********King Radama I, part of a monarchy destroyed by the French 77 years later, allowed the missionaries to go about their work. But his widow, Queen Ranavalona I, had Christians hurled 200 yards down the hilltop where she had her palace. The palace, built by a French architect, still glowers over the capital. Blessing Uncle's Bones **********Today once-foreign faiths coexist with the beliefs that grew before outside intrusion. A priest or pastor will, for instance, be invited to join Uncle Rakoto's party, blessing the bones before they are replaced in the family sepulcher. **********Superstitions introduced, according to some accounts, by missionaries have also lingered.  In the 19th century, when Jesuits were pitted against Freemasons, word was spread that the Masons were headed by a beast that fed on human blood and hearts. Thus, according to the story, the mpakafo, or heart-taker, usually a foreigner, would stalk the villages for involuntary donors. **********Recently an American here recounted how some village children had fled at his approach, believing him to be the mpakafo. He had been denounced as a heart-taker by a man with whom he had been at odds over onion-growing rights."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/27/business/business-people-leader-of-textron-unit-named-waterbury-chief.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1983-06-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 325, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LEADER OF TEXTRON UNIT NAMED WATERBURY CHIEF", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; LEADER OF TEXTRON UNIT NAMED WATERBURY CHIEF", "body_text": " **********An expert in the field of industrial fasteners has been named president and chief executive of the Waterbury Companies, a leading manufacturer of buttons based in Waterbury, Conn. **********The executive, Michael J.

De Klerk, said that the proposed measure was a response to continuing resentment from young white South Africans at the fact that they have to enter the military for two years after leaving school while young immigrants do not. **********The Government said that immigrant groups welcomed the move. The proposal, which is to go before Parliament for approval some time next year before it can take effect, was endorsed by the spokesman for Johannesburg's Greek community, Peter Manikas. **********The white parliamentary opposition, the Progressive Federal Party, and the Federated Chamber of Industries also welcomed the move, but warned that it could increase the shortage in skilled manpower by making the country less attractive to skilled immigrants. The spokesman on defense issues for the Progressive Federal Party, Phillip Myburgh, also suggested that the measure might be followed by one requiring young Asians and men of mixed race, known as coloreds, to undergo military training.   Exemption From Conscription **********Like blacks, these groups have been exempt from military service, but their inclusion in power-sharing arrangements under a new Constitution here has led to speculation that they may also be conscripted. A military group is currently examining the issue. **********Under South African defense law, young white men have to undergo two years' continuous military training after they leave school, after which they must serve 720 days in occasional military duty over the next 12 years. They then may be required to serve occasionally in local military units until they reach the age of 55. **********Until now white immigrants have, after two years in the country, been able to take up permanent resident status - which allows them to work here - while not adopting South African citizenship, which would compel them to serve in the military. **********The proposed bill would affect all immigrants who have arrived in the country since 1978 and are between 15 and 25 years of age. Under the proposal, they would acquire permanent residence after five years, but this would automatically entail South African citizenship and hence military duty.   The Right to Work **********The only way they could avoid military service would be to refuse to become South African citizens - but they would then lose their permanent residence rights and, thus, their right to work. **********The proposed measure toughens a 1978 law that said immigrants ''might be forced'' to serve in the military after two years residence, but was never enforced. **********It is not clear how many immigrants would be affected by the new measure.  According to Government statistics, 140,000 white immigrants arrived here between 1978 and August 1982, the last month for which figures are available. **********The biggest groups were about 56,000 whites from Zimbabwe, mostly seeking to avoid living under a black Government there. and about 52,000 Britons fleeing that country's economic difficulties.   Immigrants From Britain **********Recently, British immigrants have been by far the biggest group, accounting for 45 percent of immigrants in the first months of 1982. **********The Government's proposal follows complaints by South Africans that immigrants were gaining an advantage over them in looking for employment while the South Africans went off to the military after school. **********The Government ministers referred to this in their statement, saying that military service ''evasion'' by immigrants had ''long been a source of dissatisfaction.'' In some cases, the ministers said, young immigrants had even ''advertised'' their ''favored position'' over South Africans,"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/16/world/us-accepts-terms-for-human-rights-at-madrid-meeting.html": {"writer_name": "Bernard Gwertzman", "pub_date": "1983-07-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 896, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. ACCEPTS TERMS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AT MADRID MEETING", "print_headline": "U.S. ACCEPTS TERMS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AT MADRID MEETING", "body_text": " **********The United States agreed formally today to a compromise document on security and human rights to end the East-West conference in Madrid and possibly open the way for high-level Soviet-American meetings. **********The conference, which has been under way nearly three years, is expected to be finished in the next week.

Communists Accused on Rights **********The Soviet Union and its allies have regularly been accused by Western nations of violating the terms of the accord by arresting human rights activists and increasing restrictions on rights of people to emigrate. **********In his statement, Mr. Reagan said: ''We have agreed to this concluding document, as we did in 1975, to the Helsinki Final Act itself, with no illusions about the nature of the Soviet Union or about the system which it seeks to impose over much of Europe.'' **********''Together with the Helsinki accord,'' he said, ''this agreement sets forth a clear code of conduct for all 35 states -a set of standards to which we and the other Atlantic democracies will continue to hold all those who will have pledged their word at Madrid.'' **********Mr. Kampelman spent the early part of the week in Washington gaining the approval of Mr. Shultz and Mr. Reagan for the Madrid document. **********In addition to what is contained in the document, American officials said the Soviet Union had given assurances that some detained dissidents would be released by the end of the year. **********Mr. Reagan said of the document: ''We will sign it with the hope that it will serve as a step toward achieving our objective of a more stable and constructive relationship with the Soviet Union.'' **********The document calls on nations to insure ''the right of workers freely to establish and join trade unions.''

But last week, it agreed to a compromise suggested by Switzerland.  This provided that mention of the ''human contacts'' follow-up meeting be omitted in the text of the concluding document. **********But it would be included in a statement to be read by the chairman of the conference that day and published in the Soviet Union and other countries, along with the document text. **********Mr. Kampelman told Mr. Reagan he had assurances that all governments would regard this follow-up meeting with the same importance as seven others provided for in the text. Human Rights Are 'Hard Won' **********Mr. Reagan said results in the human rights field ''are often gradual and hard won, but they are necessary building blocks for a more secure and stable world.'' **********''The challenge remains,'' he went on. ''We must all consolidate and build on these gains. We must insure that good words are transformed into good deeds and the ideas that they embody are given concrete expression.

That is especially true in their handling of Spain's deeply troubled economy. The Spanish view contrasts sharply with the doctrinaire left-wing policies that Mr. Mitterrand adopted when he took office in France 18 months ago. **********Banned by Franco **********The Socialist victories in France and Spain were both historic events, ending more than a generation in the political wilderness for both parties. In France, the Socialists had been in opposition since Gen. Charles de Gaulle came to power in 1957, while the Spanish Socialists, after losing the civil war in 1939, were banned during the years when Francisco Franco was in control. But the similarity between the parties ends there. **********France's Socialists came to power determined to carry out the radical changes they had promised. President Mitterrand, vowing to resist what he called ''the wall of money,'' nationalized banks and big companies, raised taxes on the rich and tried to spend his way out of the recession by increasing wages and Government spending. **********But within a year, the French economy had been brought to its knees by a double devaluation of the franc, a hemorrhage of reserves, galloping inflation and the collapse of business confidence. French unemployment today is higher than when Mr. Mitterrand took office and his Government has been forced into a humiliating policy reversal, switching to a classic austerity program that is even more rigorous than the one its conservative predecessor had followed. **********The Spanish Socialists also promised change during the campaign but Mr. Gonzalez defined this to mean simply ''making things work the way they should.'' Since then, the Spanish Socialists have taken economic actions that are the opposite of what Mr. Mitterrand did in his first months in power. Austere Measures **********The Spanish electricity supply system is to be nationalized, but nothing else. Taxes will be held steady, although collection is to be improved. Above all, by promptly devaluing the peseta, tightening monetary policy, sharply increasing fuel prices and calling for wage restraint, the Socialists have clearly indicated that austerity lies ahead. **********''Gonzalez was always a moderate, but what happened in France makes it easier for him to be pragmatic now,'' says Jose Diego Teirgeiro Ruiz, the chief economist at the Spanish Private Banks Association.  And Antonio Garrigues Walker, a prominent lawyer and secretary general of the new Spanish Liberal Party, agrees, saying, ''Mitterrand's experiment showed everyone in Spain there isn't any room for maneuver.'' **********The economic problems that Spain's Socialists inherited seem an inevitable legacy of the country's break with decades of Fascist rule. During the Franco years, the Spanish Government balanced its books, but in the six years since his death, deficit spending has ballooned as new democratic governments sought to meet the pent-up aspirations of the country's 34 million inhabitants. **********This year, the budget deficit will reach the equivalent of $8.5 billion - 5 percent of the economy's output and one of the highest levels in Europe. Inflation, although halved, to 15 percent a year, is still well above the European average. Jobless Rate at 16% **********Spain's international payments deficit, close to $5 billion last year, will narrow to about $4 billion in 1982. And although a preelection spending spree helped raise economic growth from four-tenths of 1 percent in 1981 to 1.5 percent in 1982, unemployment continued to rise and currently stands at two million, or 16 percent of the labor force, well above the European average. **********The man in charge of Spain's economy is Miguel Boyer, a Frenchtrained economist who has worked in the Spanish central bank and has run the planning department of the country's largest private company, the chemical conglomerate Union Explosivos Rio Tinto. **********As head of both the Finance Ministry and the former Ministry of Economy and Trade, now combined, Mr. Boyer is Spain's economic overlord. He is also the most vibrant symbol of the Socialists' moderate approach. **********At 44 years of age, Mr. Boyer is a little older than the Cabinet average of 41. In Spain, such youth is equated with a foreign education, openness to new ideas and a technocratic approach to governmental problems. Spain's new 17-man Cabinet, for example, includes three ministers educated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. **********''Boyer is a social democrat not a Socialist,'' said Mr. Ruiz, the economist for the bank association. Quick Devaluation **********After he was appointed to the economic post, Mr. Boyer told friends he wanted to avoid what he perceived to be the mistake that Mr.  Mitterrand and Harold Wilson, Britain's former Labor Party Prime Minister, made by refusing to devalue their currencies early in their administrations, only to be forced to do so when the decision appeared a defeat for their policies. **********So Mr. Boyer devalued the peseta by 8 percent before the Socialists held their first Cabinet meeting and backed the measure with austerity measures, including higher compulsory reserve requirements to mop up bank liquidity and a big rise in the gasoline price. **********Within three weeks, about half the $2 billion that the Bank of Spain had spent supporting the peseta during the campaign flowed back into its coffers. **********But economists and bankers in Spain agree that the real challenges lie ahead. The Socialists want to cut inflation to between 12 and 13 percent in 1983 from 15 percent, and want to keep the budget deficit unchanged in peseta terms, implying a large decline in Government spending, after adjustment for inflation. **********At present, the Government is trying to persuade the unions to scale back 1983 wage demands. But it has decided to delay presenting the 1983 budget until after the municipal elections in March, suggesting that it may be planning more austerity measures if the wage talks go badly. 'The Real Challenge' **********Meanwhile, top Government officials and bankers privately concede that the Socialists cannot hope to meet their inflation and international payments targets without sacrificing their campaign promise of 2.5 percent growth in 1983 and the creation of 800,000 jobs over the next four years. ''Unemployment is bound to go on rising and this will be the real challenge for Boyer,'' one American banker said. **********The second economic challenge facing the Socialists is to get Spain into the Common Market in the hope of attracting more foreign investment and modernizing its industry. From a peak of $1.3 billion in 1980, new foreign investment has slumped to $800 million in 1982 and will probably fall further on the continued uncertainty over Common Market membership. **********Mr. Gonzalez wants a firm decision on membership by 1986, when the present parliamentary terms ends. But France, fearful of the competition its farmers would face from Spanish fruit and wine, is dragging its feet. Spain's Socialists may be a far cry from President Mitterrand in economic policy, but they still need his political support to accomplish their own more moderate goals."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/02/business/mesa-posts-profit-on-stock-sale.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Daly", "pub_date": "1983-09-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 429, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MESA POSTS PROFIT ON STOCK SALE", "print_headline": "MESA POSTS PROFIT ON STOCK SALE", "body_text": " **********The Mesa Petroleum Company said yesterday that it had agreed to sell its stake in the Superior Oil Company back to Superior.

(Page A10.) **********Technical experts said it was theoretically possible that Flight 7's communication problems could have been a result of mechanical malfunctions or atmospheric conditions. But the general immediate reaction was that the trouble was caused by the airliner's deviation from course to an area beyond the range of the VHF, or very high frequency, radio network. **********An industry specialist with access to key Government officials said that ''based on the Soviet information and looking at possible computer malfunctions, all indications are that they would have been expected to run into communications problems by getting out of radio range.'' **********On the other hand, there was earlier evidence that all had not been in good working order with the radio equipment aboard the plane. A Korean Air Lines supervisor in Anchorage was quoted as saying the pilot who flew the plane from New York to Anchorage had reported minor radio problems. **********In addition, the pilot of a South Korean plane that made the Pacific cross ing in the opposite direction from Flight 7 was reported to have been unable to radio Flight 7 when they passed in order to make a customary exchange of weather data. **********The State Department, in making public the tapes, took pains to note that the relaying of position reports was nothing to cause alarm to controllers responsible for monitoring the flight. **********The first indication from the transcripts of communications problems with Flight 7 came about an hour and a half after takeoff from Anchorage, when the airliner was due to report over a checkpoint called Nabie. The checkpoint is 282 nautical miles from the mandatory previous checkpoint and is the first such point along airway Red 20, a route that skirts within about 50 miles of Soviet territory en route to Japan. Normally, the airliner would eventually have made a dogleg turn to the right to cross Japan en route to Seoul. Attempts to Make Contact **********When Flight 7 failed to check in with the Anchorage traffic center on schedule at 30 minutes after the hour, a controller tried three times to make radio contact. **********If the plane replied, the words were unintelligible. The controller radioed, ''Korean Air 7, Anchorage center, how do you read?'' **********The tapes could not be clearly understood, but the best interpretation of the answer was, ''Well, wait a minute, call again please.'' **********Two minutes later, the Korean airliner following Flight 7 called the center, relaying word that Flight 7 had passed over Nabie and estimating it would be over the next checkpoint, Neeva, an hour and 14 minutes later. **********Neeva is 593 nautical miles from Nabie. These checkpoints are over water and are delineated by geographical coordinates inserted in the computerized, triply redundant prime navigation system on board. It is known as an inertial navigation system. **********Flight Station Relayed Message **********The tapes indicated the crew of Flight 7 must have realized they had not made direct contact with the center at Anchorage. Hence, at 44 minutes after the hour, Flight 7 checked in with the Flight Service Station at Anchorage on their high-frequency radio. This has much greater range than a VHF system, which a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman in Anchorage said was not designed to give coverage beyond about 150 nautical miles. VHF, however, can normally be used for direct VHF contact with Anchorage as far out as Neeva because remotely controlled relay stations have been installed within range on islands down the Aleutian chain. **********The Flight Service Station was asked to relay the position report to the air- traffic control center, which does not use high-frequency radio. **********Flight 7, after arriving over what the crew thought was Neeva nine minutes after their initial estimate, never made intelligible contact either with the Anchorage control center or with the nearby Flight Service Station. Flight 7's position report was again relayed by the sister Korean jumbo jet that had taken off behind it.   U.S. Demands Compensation **********Alan D. Romberg, the State Department spokesman, said today that John H. Kelly, the Acting Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs, had presented Oleg M. Sokolov, the No. 2 official at the Soviet Embassy, with a note ''demanding compensation from the Soviet Union'' for the ''flagrant and unjustifiable breach of applicable principles of international law.'' **********The note, which was made public by the department, said the shooting down of an unarmed civilian airliner was ''a direct violation of internationally agreed procedures to be followed when an aircraft inadvertently intrudes on a state's territorial airspace.'' **********The note did not specify an amount of compensation but said the United States would supply details later. At the same time, Mr. Kelly sought to give a similar note to Mr. Sokolov on behalf of South Korea, which has no diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.  Mr. Romberg said that Mr. Sokolov ''refused to accept'' both notes and that Mr. Kelly ''refused to accept Mr. Sokolov's rejection.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/06/business/stake-in-trico.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-12-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 63, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Stake in Trico", "print_headline": "Stake in Trico", "body_text": " **********TRW Inc. has acquired 1,339,530 common shares, or 16.6 percent, of the common stock outstanding of Trico Industries of Gardena, Calif., according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Heine Jr. patiently goes about managing $375 million for clients with an investment approach geared to value. **********It's a strategy that has paid off for the Management Asset Corporation of Westport, Conn., headed by Mr. Heine as founder and president. For the 5 1/2-year period ended Sept. 30, the firm showed a total return - market appreciation plus dividends - of 25 percent annually. This compared with a yearly gain of 18 percent for Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. **********''We look for bargains,'' Mr. Heine said in an interview. ''We may not hit many homers, but we tend not to strike out very often.'' **********The cornerstone of the firm's investment philosophy is ''valuation analysis,'' a system developed by the late Benjamin Graham, who with David L. Dodd co-authored ''Security Analysis,'' a classic book on investments. ''Buy value - it will out.'' That was Mr. Graham's credo and Mr. Heine follows it scrupulously, in contrast to some professional portfolio managers who describe themselves as value-oriented but do not adhere to the specifics of Mr. Graham's system. **********Management Asset screens 3,600 companies in its search for certain attributes. It seeks out companies with strong balance sheets whose stock prices are low in relation to historical levels. Each client portfolio, containing about 30 stocks, is diversified across a wide variety of industries. **********Once a stock is selected, the firm sets an ''investment value,'' or target selling price, and from that establishes a maximum buying level. The system calls for subtracting one-third of the investment value to arrive at a price above which the stock should not be bought. For example, a stock with an investment value of $75 a share would carry a maximum buying price of $50. **********''We want to achieve a gain of at least 50 percent, although it might take as long as several years for a given issue to reach that goal,'' Mr. Heine explained. At times, Management Asset is able to purchase stocks selling below their assigned buy levels, thereby achieving potential gains larger than 50 percent. **********Management Asset maintains a strict discipline on the sell side. Stocks are sold for only two reasons: when they reach pre-determined selling prices or when they no longer qualify for the required investment standards. **********The balance sheet analysis calls for a maximum allowable debt of 35 percent of a company's total capitalization. Also, there should be sufficient cash on hand to cover 12 months of total debt payments. Net quick assets - cash and equivalents plus receivables - must at least equal current liabilities. Finally, net working capital should be a minimum of $25 million. **********If a company qualifies on these balance sheet factors, Management Asset then determines the investment value of a company based upon its earnings growth for the past 10 years and its average earnings during the same period. For example, under the system devised by Mr. Graham, a company showing no growth over the past 10 years would be assigned a price-earnings ratio of 8 and one with growth averaging 15 percent, or more, annually would receive a maxiumum P/E ratio of 20. **********Then the P/E ratio is multiplied by the average earnings per share over the 10 years to arrive at the investment value of the company's stock.  Mr. Heine concedes that occasionally he has gone wrong in the past. ''We once took a big loss in Bird Inc., a producer of building materials, after the system said the company's balance sheet no longer met our requirements,'' he recounted. ''Unfortunately, I was depending upon my emotions rather than the system.'' **********There are times, too, when a stock is sold upon reaching its target price, only to climb substantially higher. Mercantile Stores provided one such example earlier this year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/02/world/italian-communists-press-arms-issue.html": {"writer_name": "Henry Kamm", "pub_date": "1983-06-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 987, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ITALIAN COMMUNISTS PRESS ARMS ISSUE", "print_headline": "ITALIAN COMMUNISTS PRESS ARMS ISSUE", "body_text": " **********The Communist Party, judging the Williamsburg declaration on nuclear missiles to be too inflexible, has decided to step up its opposition to the installation of missiles in Italy and make it one of its main issues in the campaign for the June 26-27 elections. **********A source close to Enrico Berlinguer, the party's secretary general, disclosed he had conveyed this hardening of the party's attitude to the United States in a meeting today with two officials from the American Embassy. The meeting was arranged before the conference of the seven major industrial democracies took place last weekend. **********The party official said the Americans maintained it would be more dangerous not to install the missiles. American sources emphasized the view that talks with the Soviet Union in Geneva on the reduction of medium-range missiles in Europe would be successful only if the North Atlantic alliance held firm to its schedule on the Pershing 2 and low-flying cruise missiles. Under the schedule, the missiles will be installed by the end of the year if there is no agreement at the Geneva talks on mutual reduction. **********The Communist official said Mr. Berlinguer and the rest of the party leadership had hoped the United States and its allies would offer to continue the Geneva talks beyond the Dec. 31 deadline and suspend installation of the missiles as long as the talks continued. Sicily Base Raises Fears **********A base for the missiles in Comiso, Sicily, is being prepared and manned by United States troops. This makes Italy one of the main targets for Soviet attack, the party official said, and heightens the need for a more active campaign. ''Even if things seem quiet now,'' Giuseppe Boffa, a writer and member of the party's central committee, said, ''I don't think the actual installation of the missiles will go so quietly.'' **********He said there were reports from Communist leaders throughout the country that opposition to nuclear arms was a major preoccupation, particularly among young voters. It is apparent that this, perhaps more than the Williamsburg statement, caused the party decision to put the issue closer to the center of the election campaign. **********Party officials said in interviews that their main campaign concern would be to reach those who might be tempted to abstain or cast invalid ballots as a form of protest. Local party officials, as well as independent polling groups, note a rising tendency by voters disaffected with political institutions to comply with the compulsory voting law but to cast blank ballots. **********The source close to Mr. Berlinguer said Communists feared that their party might be the main loser if such a trend took hold.  ''The loss of belief in the possibility of change is a danger to the left, to the opposition,'' he said. ''Those who still place hope in the present situation, those who believe that the present system can still produce jobs and economic improvement, will still vote for the parties in power, the Christian Democrats and the Socialists. We must convince the young, the unemployed, the elderly, women, those who are unhappy today, that we represent hope and must gain their confidence.'' Declining Political Activity **********Party officials are clearly uneasy about declining organized political activity among young people. They have identified unemployment, particularly among the young, and nuclear arms as issues responsible for a widespread loss of hope in political institutions and are pitching their appeal to the disaffected. **********Italian antimissile activists, who are far less numerous than their British and West German equivalents, have accused the Communists of paying no more than lip service in opposition to the installation of missiles in Sicily. **********The Italian Communist Party, with 1.7 million members the largest in the West and with 30 percent of seats the second party in Parliament, is contending with its image as a permanent opposition party. **********''We need to project an image of a party of the left that can provide a government, not only a protesting left,'' said Mr. Boffa.  ''Not alone,'' he added, ''but with the Socialists and the other parties on the left.'' Socialists Reject Appeal **********The party's congress last March was held under the slogan of ''Democratic Alternative'' and appealed to the Socialist Party for an electoral alliance. Bettino Craxi, the Socialist leader, has rejected this appeal, although, the Communists say, the two parties' assessments of the economic and social problems and their proposed solutions are close enough to permit such a coalition. **********Mr. Craxi, whose party holds 9.8 percent of seats in Parliament, provoked elections a year earlier than necessary by withdrawing from the governing coalition headed by Prime Minister Amintore Fanfani, a Christian Democrat. Mr. Craxi has made no secret of his wish for elections, which he hopes will increase his party's total of seats and enhance his chances of being Prime Minister in the next governing coalition. **********Communist officials are bitter in assessing Mr. Craxi's attitude, which they describe as opportunistic when they are being polite. But hoping for results that might make a left-wing coalition government possible for the first time, they decline to speak their minds publicly. **********In any event, party leaders make clear their disdain for the position of the French Communist Party, which they feel was outsmarted by President Francois Mitterrand when it joined his Government at the expense of the Communists' own policies. ''The relationship of forces is reversed here,'' said Alfredo Reichlin, a party leader believed by many to be second to Mr. Berlinguer, in an allusion to the Communists' superior electoral strength. **********Despite this, Communist officials hinted they would be ready to join a cabinet headed by Mr. Craxi if the outcome of the voting raised a possibility of putting the Christian Democrats in opposition for the first time."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/02/business/tilling-fights-btr-takeover.html": {"writer_name": "Merida Welles", "pub_date": "1983-05-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 775, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TILLING FIGHTS BTR TAKEOVER", "print_headline": "TILLING FIGHTS BTR TAKEOVER", "body_text": " **********It was never a secret that BTR, a giant British industrial conglomerate, wanted to expand further into energy-related activities, particularly in the United States. Nonetheless, the City of London, Britain's Wall Street, found BTR's bid on April 11 for Thomas Tilling, valued at about $900 million, something of an eyeopener: both the offer and its backing by City underwriters were among the largest in Britain's corporate history. **********Most analysts here think BTR has much in its favor. An unwavering 16-year climb in BTR's earnings led to pretax profits of $161 million in 1982. By contrast, at Tilling, a widely diversified energy and engineering company, profits have declined for the past four years.  After-tax earnings fell almost 50 percent in 1982, to $40 million, from $76 million in 1981. And an extraordinatry charge of $31.3 million for restructuring costs cut last year's net income to $8.7 million, from $65.9 million in 1981. **********Tilling's nastiest setback last year resulted from investments in Texas, where its oil and gas equipment division lost $25 million, after pretax profits of $37.7 million in 1981. **********''Initially, we would be interested in all of Tilling's U.S.  activities,'' Owen Green, the 57-year-old managing director of BTR, said recently. But it is clear that BTR particularly wants to snap up those Tilling businesses involved in the manufacturing and distribution of industrial products and components. **********BTR has offered to exchange 10 shares of its own stock for every 21 shares of Tilling's stock, with a cash alternative of $2.81 for each Tilling share. On April 11, the cash offer was valued at $818 million and the share exchange at $906 million. **********Tilling, which has appointed the merchant bankers S.G. Warburg & Company to help plot its defensive strategy, has rejected the bid as ''totally unacceptable'' and, indeed, the first fierce skirmishes have already erupted. Legal Skirmish in U.S. **********Lawyers for an Illinois-based insurance subsidiary of Tilling, the American Ambassador Casualty Company, tried to block BTR from buying any more Tilling shares by using a state law that requires court sanction for any change in ownership of an insurance company in the state. But so far the efforts have not been successful. **********As a result, BTR has continued to acquire Tilling shares on the open market and by Friday had increased its share of the outstanding stock from 6.9 percent to nearly 10 percent. **********Tilling's finance director, Francis R. Black, refuses to comment on whether Tilling is encouraging any counterbids to thwart BTR's attempted takeover. But Tilling has tried to encourage BTR's shareholders to reject the bid at a special meeting on May 9. **********Since Tilling embarked on its American buying spree six years ago - a time when it was considered a fast-moving, glamour stock - it has picked up an array of businesses. Among its major American subsidiaries are Clarkson Industries in New York, the U.S. Supply Company in Missouri and Clecon Holdings in Ohio. **********BTR has made about 20 acquisitions in the past 10 years, with three particularly successful ones in the United States, analysts say: SW Industries of Providence, R.I.; Huyck Corporation of Wake Forest, N.C., and Worcester Controls in Massachusetts. BTR Emphasizes Management **********''We bought Stowe Woodward for the management,'' said John Cahill, the Providence-based chairman of all these operations. And it is management that BTR and some analysts say is at the root of Tilling's troubles. **********''We see them as industrial bankers, not managers,'' said Mr. Green of BTR. ''Their philosophy is to generate enough cash to acquire companies and then leave them alone to run their own businesses.'' The result, he said, is that ''they don't make enough return on sales to support a progressive company.'' **********BTR, formerly British Tyre and Rubber, is known for its tight budgeting, central financial control and attention to detail, anaylsts say. **********Indeed, in the United States, BTR made a pretax profit of $65 million on sales of $240 million last year. Tilling reported pretax profits of only $23 million on sales of $1.29 billion. **********Tilling promises a significant increase in profits this year and describes the BTR bid as ''opportunistic,'' distorting the underlying value of the company. But BTR's merchant bankers at Morgan Grenfell & Company think the market will prove him wrong. **********BTR's share price closed Friday at $6.48, placing a value on Tilling, under the share swap offer, at $917.8 million. Tilling's share price closed Friday at $2.89, or 8 cents higher than BTR's cash offer."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/13/business/bloedel-newsprint-price-incentive.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-07-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 178, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bloedel Newsprint Price Incentive", "print_headline": "Bloedel Newsprint Price Incentive", "body_text": " **********MacMillan Bloedel Ltd., a major newsprint supplier, introduced a 5 percent newsprint ''incentive allowance'' retroactive to July 1 for United States West Coast customers who purchase 100 percent of their annual contract tonnage. **********MacMillan said the 5 percent price reduction, applies to the list price of $468.50 a metric ton and will be credited quarterly. **********It said for purchases made during the second half of this year a contract level of ''half'' the annual volume will qualify for the incentive program.

'I Never Intended to Stay Here' **********He said he considered his job of changing the orientation of Bell virtually finished and had discussed his desire to leave with Bell senior management a year and a half ago. **********''When I joined the Bell System, I never intended to stay here,'' Mr. McGill stated.  The 52-year-old executive came to A.T.& T. in 1973 after a rapid rise at the International Business Machines Corporation, and was charged with turning Bell from a sleepy monopoly into a marketingoriented company. Mr. McGill's aggressiveness angered old Bell hands,according to company insiders and former employees. Some said it was surprising he lasted this long. **********Some analysts said that his departure meant that the older, more stodgy Bell officials would regain power, setting back Bell's marketing efforts. **********''The same old A.T.& T. is entering deregulated business,'' said Harry Edelson of the First Boston Corporation. Others, though, said Mr. McGill had outlived his usefulness and that what was needed now was an operations man, rather than a strategist and catalyst for change. **********''There is a time for a dynamic leader to shake people up, but there is a time for that dynamic leader to step aside,'' said one former American Bell official, who asked not to be named. ''If the revolution doesn't end after a while, the rhetoric becomes meaningless.'' **********Another agreed: ''He turned the company around in terms of perspective. What was impossible was to get the products to match it.'' Big Loss Predicted **********American Bell officials said the company is close to meeting its financial targets for the year, but analysts predicted the company could lose $750 million, about $250 million more than they had expected. **********Indeed, the perception on Wall Street has changed dramatically since tthe settlement of the Justice Department's antitrust suit in January 1982. At that time, analysts expected the local operating companies, which are to be divested, to have financial problems, while A.T.& T., with its new American Bell, would be the glamour company. Now, owing to changes in the settlement agreement and troubles at American Bell, many analysts say the local operating companies will be better off. **********Mr. McGill's departure is expected to be followed by other resignations within American Bell. Also expected is a consolidation of staff positions in an attempt to trim overhead, which could lead to hundreds of layoffs in the company, which employs 28,000. **********Charles Marshall, the chairman and chief executive of American Bell, to whom Mr. McGill reported, said that Mr. McGill was not demoted or asked to leave. **********''There was no design to squeeze Arch out,'' Mr. Marshall said.  ''We wanted Arch to be with us in this business.'' However, he did say that American Bell was being reorganized and Mr. McGill's job had become superfluous. Mr. McGill, he said, then asked to leave. **********Mr. Marshall said he was hopeful, but not sure, that when the staff consolidation comes, layoffs could be avoided by transferring people to other divisions of A.T.& T. **********American Bell has been having problems getting products to market.  While American Bell conceived products and marketed them, it had to rely on two other Bell divisions, Western Electric and Bell Laboratories, for manufacturing and research, respectively. There was constant friction among the groups. Vertical Integration **********A.T.& T. is thus moving to vertically integrate operations to improve its performance. On Monday, it announced that most of the consumer products division would be moved into Western Electric. A similar reorganization is expected to take place with Advanced Information Systems being combined with the part of Western Electric that makes its products. **********According to Mr. McGill, American Bell will soon consist of only the Advanced Information Systems unit.  American Bell announced that Mr. McGill would be replaced by two people, who would divide management of the A.I.S. division.  Frank S. Vigilante, 53, formerly head of large and intermediate systems marketing, will be the division president for product planning and development. Mr. Vigilante, an outspoken man whose manner a reminds his colleagues of Mayor Koch, joined A.T.& T. in 1957 and spent most of his career in technical positions. **********Robert J. Casale, 44, who has been described by his associates as a quiet, reserved executive, will be division president for marketing and sales. Mr. Casale joined A.T.& T. in 1975 after 10 years with Xerox, Honeywell, Lockheed and Telex. **********Mr. McGill said he had not decided what he would do next. He said that politics ''is a possibility.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/12/world/lebanon-chief-s-father-says-phalangists-weren-t-in-camps.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 100, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Lebanon Chief's Father Says Phalangists Weren't in Camps", "print_headline": "Lebanon Chief's Father Says Phalangists Weren't in Camps", "body_text": " **********Pierre Gemayel, leader of the Christian Phalange Party, denied in an interview published today that Phalangist militiamen were responsible for last September's massacre in two Palestinian refugee camps. **********The interview was conducted Wednesday, a day after the publication in Jerusalem of an Israeli judicial commission's report blaming Phalangist gunmen for the killings.

Her name is Amal Abu al-Jamiyya. Amal means hope. **********She has never seen a Jew without a gun. **********In the labyrinth of pathways that meander among the cold concrete houses of her slum, a refugee camp that has been under Israeli military occupation since six years before she was born, Amal sees only two kinds of Jews: uniformed soldiers and civilian settlers, usually when they are running through the camp after children who have thrown stones at Israeli cars and buses. **********She has never spoken to a Jew. She says she never wants to. **********''Do you like Jews?'' she is asked. **********''No.'' **********''Why not?'' **********''They attack our houses, breaking everything, building settlements.'' **********Why would she not want to talk with any Jews? ''Because they are our enemies.'' **********And what is her dream in life? ''To get back our land.'' **********How? ''Demonstrate.'' And then, after a moment's thought, this cute girl with freckles adds, ''We must use guns.'' **********Here, in a camp like this, Arabs' images of Jews are the harshest and most categorical of any held by those who live under Israeli control. Urban residents of the West Bank often display less hostility, or at least mask it with sophisticated argument. Arabs inside Israel proper, who are Israeli citizens themselves, are caught in complex ambivalence about the stereotypes they hold. **********But those in the Dheisheh camp, just south of Bethlehem, exist behind walls that have become metaphors for their isolation: the concrete barricades that the Israeli Army has recently erected across all the camp's exits to the main road to discourage stone-throwers. **********Although the 5,000 camp residents may leave and enter through a back way, they smile angrily when they call their slum their ''ghetto,'' relishing the opportunity to turn the language of Jewish suffering against the Jews.   Hatred Seethes Quietly **********And within the cloistered alleyways, inside the houses decorated with portraits of Lenin and Che Guevara and the outlawed Palestinian flag, a hatred of the Jews of Israel seethes quietly, intensely, beyond the power of the Israeli Army. Here, future ''fedayeen,'' or ''freedom fighters'' for the Palestinian cause are being indoctrinated, both by their elders and by their environment. **********Nadir al-Farat, 13, a boy with a film of hurt across his eyes, likes to throw stones. Jews have tried to talk to him. ''Sometimes soldiers call to speak with me,'' he says, ''but I refuse and run away.'' What does he want to be when he grows up? ''Fedayeen,'' he says firmly. The young men sitting around him in the room laugh in surprise and approval.  Across the pre-1967 border, inside Israel proper, the Arabs who have lived as Israeli citizens since 1948 are generally less militant politically, although they have their prejudices. Some say to each other, ''Don't behave like a Jew,'' by which they mean don't be arrogant or stingy. **********Common Stereotypes: Violence and Greed **********The common stereotypes of Jews held by Israeli Arabs also include violence, sexual permissiveness, greed, sneakiness, technological superiority and a lack of personal warmth, according to Arabs and Jews who have worked in the Arab communities. **********''There is awe of Jews, and envy,'' said Peter Schaktman, 23, an American Jew from Buffalo, N.Y., who is living in an Arab village as part of Interns for Peace, a program to increase Arab-Jewish contacts and understanding. To many Arabs, who judge by their own standards of effusive hospitality, ''Jews are cold, Jews are inhospitable,'' Mr. Schaktman said. **********Another intern, Susan Bandler, 24, of New York City, was told by an Arab man her age who became her friend that he could not believe she was Jewish. **********Violence is a heavy theme, both in Arab children's play and in their images of Jews. Street games of war involve fantasies of Arab-Jewish battles. Walid Sadik, a teacher and member of the town council of the Arab village of Taibe, northeast of Tel Aviv, and other Arabs say that their small sons and daughters, watching cowboy movies on television, think the Arabs are fighting the Jews.   Jews Blamed for Massacre **********After Lebanese Christian Phalangists massacred Palestinians in a Beirut refugee camp in September 1982, many Arab parents told their children that ''the Jews'' had done it. Mr. Schaktman, visiting an Arab home in a Galilee village, said he was asked by a 3-year-old girl, ''Did you kill them too?'' **********''When you say, 'Jew,' they immediately think of a violent policeman,'' said Khalil Samar, the principal of an elementary and junior high school in Tamra, an Arab village in the Galilee. ''If you ask a Jew, 'What do you think of an Arab?' they think terrorist or worse.'' **********Just as sexual fantasies run through Jews' stereotypes of Arabs, some Arabs find that their most emotional and complex contacts with Jewish society come in relations between the sexes. Here, each side is most vulnerable, and the wounds can be deep. **********''When I was a young guy I used to drive around in a Jeep and go into discos in Tiberius,'' said Samir Sabag, an Arab builder from a small village in the northern Galilee. His Hebrew was so fluent and his appearance such that many Jews thought he was Jewish. He used to like to dance with ''soldier girls,'' he recalled, Jewish women in the Israeli Army. **********''Once I was dancing with a girl soldier,'' he said, ''and she heard me speaking Arabic to a friend. She said, 'What? You're an Arab? I won't dance with you! I can't dance with you!' She backed away. **********''I said: 'You're not dancing with an Arab. You're dancing with a person.' '' He added, with a broad smile, ''It took me two to three weeks, and she was begging me to take her out.'' **********Dating a Jewish Woman Called Lesson in Racism **********For more than a year, Zohar Endrawos, 25, from the Arab town of Tarshiha, dated a young woman from the neighboring Jewish village of Maalot. ''Then I found out what racism was,'' he said. ''How many times I heard 'dirty Arab' from her parents, friends.'' **********During a lovers' quarrel, ''even my own girlfriend said to me once, 'This will teach me to get close to you barbarians,' '' he recalled. ''I could never have said that to her about her Jewishness.'' Still, Mr. Endrawos laces his political views with a fiery pride and bitterness. **********''In general,'' he said, ''Arabs are afraid of Jewish things - anything that's Jewish, they're afraid of. The education I received from my mother was to walk next to the wall and not cause any problems.'' He was determined to reject the advice. **********For Arabs, whose society is fraught with strict sexual taboos, relationships with Jews can be nothing more than the excitement of contact with a relatively permissive culture. Or they can grow out of an effort to leave something of their Arab identity behind, ''passing'' into what, in Israel, is the majority. **********One Jewish woman from Jerusalem, in the Galilee for a weekend, met a young man who tried to pass as a Jew as he began dating her. Despite his fluent Hebrew, she guessed he was an Arab, did not mind and confronted him with the fact. He had been afraid to admit it.   Arab Women More Restricted **********Virtually all such relations, including mixed marriages, occur between Arab men and Jewish women, since Arab women are mostly prevented from dating by the conservative traditions of their society. One exception - the daughter of an Arab Christian family in Haifa - told recently of her rejection by both Arabs and Jews as she was educated in Jewish schools, learned to read and write Arabic at a Jewish university, spent time with Jews and fell in love with a Jewish man. **********''My fellow Palestinian students ostracized me,'' she said in an Israeli radio interview. ''They called me a whore because I socialized with Jews and probably thought I was sleeping with most of them.'' **********She began living with her man, a right-winger; they decided not to buy a television set so they could avoid news broadcasts and thus avoid political fights. One day, she said, his Jewish friends got together with some Arab students and beat him up. **********Both his parents and hers resolutely opposed marriage, leaving her caught between two cultures. ''I don't know if it would have been good,'' she said. ''I don't know. But with an Arab boy it definitely won't work. Now I'm 28. I know that for an Arab boy, my stock has gone down. He can be crazy for me. His family won't go along with it.'' **********Some Arabs See Parallel With Jewish Experience **********Some Arabs see parallels between Jewish and Palestinian culture and between the Jewish and Palestinian experiences of rejection and suffering. But when Arabs speak of this, it is often with an underlying tone of contempt. **********''Both of us are arrogant,'' said Ibrahim Karain, a Palestinian journalist in East Jerusalem. ''We think ourselves distinguished in the Arab world, and they think themselves distinguished in the world as a whole.'' He laughed. Both peoples are intensely political, hard-working, devoted to education, he said. **********Jamil Hamad, a journalist from Bethlehem, disagreed. ''The Jewish arrogance is completely different from the Palestinian arrogance,'' he contended. Palestinians are willing to do any work to get ahead, he said. ''The Jewish arrogance was the product of a very mysterious thing: 'We are the chosen people.' It's an old business. **********''Part of the Jewish arrogance is the inferiority complex,'' Mr. Hamad continued. ''They are exporting a Jewishness to the Palestinians. You see how the Palestinian Jewishness is functioning. You see how the Palestinians of the West Bank are building universities, schools, developing folklore, exhibiting art. This is a Jewish business. You are making me a minority, but I am preserving my culture and identity.'' **********Of all the images of Jews that Arabs possess, the one that ignites the deepest fury among Israeli Jews is the parallel some Arabs draw between Jews and Nazis, the argument that what the Nazis did to the Jews, the Jews now do to the Palestinians. **********Arabs Widely Ignorant Of the Nazi Horror **********In some measure, this comes out of genuine ignorance among Arabs about the Nazi horror inflicted on European Jews; children on the West Bank learn nothing about it in school, and even Israeli Arabs do not seem to absorb the lessons they get. Miss Bandler, of Interns for Peace, said she knew a militant young Arab who used to equate Israeli Jews with Nazis until he went to a small museum on a kibbutz founded by survivors of the Warsaw ghetto. **********''He was very moved to see what Jews had suffered,'' she said. ''He didn't have that image at all: Jews were fighters, powerful.'' **********Last September, when two foreign correspondents visited Ansar, the Israeli prison camp in southern Lebanon, they heard the head of the prisoners' committee, a Palestine Liberation Organization officer named Salah Taamri, invoke the Nazi death camps in denouncing Israel. **********''Ansar is Auschwitz!'' the prisoners chanted as the reporters approached the fence. Cordelia Edvardson of the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet had been imprisoned in Auschwitz, but she did not tell Mr. Taamri that when she asked if he agreed with the prisoners' chant.   Comment by Begin Recalled **********''I can't agree and I can't disagree,'' he answered. Referring to former Prime Minister Menachem Begin, he added: ''When Begin said about us - animals on two feet - doesn't it bring an echo of what Hitler said about the Jews? To someone whose family got killed, the whole world is a Holocaust. Should anything be special because you are Jewish? Are they the chosen people of God, or are they the chaotic people of the devil?'' **********She never told him about having been in Auschwitz. Later, when her colleague asked why, she said, ''It would have been unfair. He was behind bars, and I was free.'' **********In the Dheisheh refugee camp, little Amal with the red ribbon in her hair was asked what she would talk about if she met a Jewish girl her age. ''Nothing,'' Amal replied. Wouldn't she be interested in knowing about the other girl's life? ''No.'' And why not? **********''Because I don't know her,'' Amal declared, ''and she doesn't know me.'' **********NEXT: The status of Israeli Arabs."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/05/business/about-real-estate-some-oriental-rug-dealers-moving-to-meadowlands.html": {"writer_name": "Anthony Depalma", "pub_date": "1983-10-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 799, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SOME ORIENTAL RUG DEALERS MOVING TO MEADOWLANDS", "print_headline": "ABOUT REAL ESTATE; SOME ORIENTAL RUG DEALERS MOVING TO MEADOWLANDS", "body_text": " **********For more than half a century, New York's Oriental rug district has been in old buildings and storefronts spread out over a section of midtown Manhattan that runs from 28th to 34th Streets and from Lexington to Fifth Avenue. **********But over the last few years, rapidly rising rents and a lack of room for expansion have made it increasingly difficult for many of the small-scale dealers who import handmade rugs and carpets to survive there. **********For a dozen of them, or about one- quarter of the city's Oriental rug trade, the solution will be to pack up their rugs and leave the district and the city entirely, moving across the Hudson River to a $6 million central merchandising and showroom facility designed just for the Oriental rug trade. **********The two-story, 157,000-square-foot structure is under construction at the Harmon Meadow mixed-use development rising in the Secaucus Meadowlands. **********The developer of the Oriental rug center, as well as a 500-acre office, industrial, retail and residential complex on the site, is Hartz Mountain Industries, the real estate development arm of the large pet food company.  Eugene Heller, president of Hartz Mountain, said he had not considered including an Oriental rug center at the Harmon Meadow until he was approached by a Manhattan real estate broker looking for space for a group of rug importers whose leases had either fallen due or were to expire soon. **********One of the importers is Jon S. Ansari, president of the Amiran Corporation at 460 Park Avenue South, one of the city's largest rug dealers. Mr. Ansari said the group had considered moving to several centralized properties within the rug district in Manhattan and farther downtown but that the deals had fallen through. **********At first Mr. Ansari was wary about transferring to Secaucus. ''My initial reaction was that as nice as the property was, it probably wouldn't work because we wouldn't be able to get the buyers to New Jersey,'' he said. **********But as he and some other dealers deliberated, rising rents effectively eliminated most of their other options. Mr. Ansari's lease expired last February. He was given a one-year extension, but faced a fivefold rent increase from the $3 a square foot he now pays. **********The new building in Secaucus will be rented for an average $8 a square foot, compared with an average of $15 to $20 a square foot in Manhattan. In addition, there is no occupancy tax in New Jersey and utility rates are lower. **********The building is expected to be completed by March. It will feature a 7,500-square-foot showroom and reception area as well as a conveyor belt system and a large loading dock. **********Many of the rug dealers expect it will take a year before they know if the move to New Jersey was the right one. But Albert Moomjy, president of the Mid-East Rug Corporation at 276 Fifth Avenue, and also a partner in the Einstein-Moomjy carpet stores, is already confident that most of the Oriental rug business will eventually relocate in Secaucus. **********''Some of the dealers don't feel the move will be too good because we're leaving the city, but I don't think so,'' he said. ''We will still be near New York. We won't be far from Newark Airport. We will have better loading facilities, there will be a modern hotel nearby, a Hilton at Harmon Meadow, and the whole atmosphere will be good.'' **********If all goes well, the new rug facility in Secaucus will be expanded by 56,000 square feet within three to five years to accommodate other dealers. **********But Daniel R. Hodges, president of the Oriental Rug Importers Association of America, and one of four partners who own Pande Cameron of New York Inc., at 200 Lexington Avenue, does not expect many other dealers to leave. He said that customers would not follow these dealers across the river. **********''Most of the buyers will still have to come into Manhattan proper, no matter what,'' he said. ''It's going to be difficult for them to turn around and go to New Jersey, too.'' **********In any event, Ahmad Momeni, president of a concern of that name, and one of the dealers moving to New Jersey to join Mr. Ansari as 51 percent equity participants in the project, feels he has little choice. **********''Basically, our industry is being forced out of this area by the high rents,'' he said, adding that when his five-year lease expires in February, the rent on his 15,000 square feet of space at 79 Madison Avenue will rise to $18 a square foot. When he signed his lease in 1978, the rent was $5 a square foot."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/22/business/company-news-hudson-s-bay-freezes-wages.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-01-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 94, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hudson's Bay Freezes Wages", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Hudson's Bay Freezes Wages", "body_text": " **********The Hudson's Bay Company, Canada's biggest trading concern, froze the wages of its 44,000 employees for an undetermined period. **********''We think the economy related to consumer industries will be very difficult for the next six months,'' a company spokesman said, adding that the only alternative would be to cut the company's work force. **********Company losses topped $118 million (United States) over the first nine months of last year, and the final figure for 1982 is also expected to be in the red."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/23/world/around-the-world-pope-in-milan-champions-workers.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-05-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 151, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Around the World; Pope, in Milan, Champions Workers", "print_headline": "Around the World; Pope, in Milan, Champions Workers", "body_text": " **********Pope John Paul II told Italy's leading industrialists today that inflation and recession must not obstruct the fight against unemployment and called for greater worker participation in the management of companies. **********In a speech at the Milan Industrial Fair, a center of international trade, he also said trade unions were an indispensable force in society. **********''I extend to you a heartfelt appeal to multiply and unify your efforts in the search to create new jobs,'' he told an audience that included Industry Minister Filippo Pandolfi; the Fiat chairman, Giovanni Agnelli, and the chairman of Italy's Confindustria employers association, Vittorio Merloni. **********On the third and final day of his pilgrimage to Italy's economic capital, the Pope said inflation and recession ''should never prevent a tenacious search for means to overcome both the causes of unemployment and the painful human situation which derives from it.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/08/world/around-the-world-marcos-approves-raises-and-tightens-security.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-11-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 129, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Marcos Approves Raises And Tightens Security", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Marcos Approves Raises And Tightens Security", "body_text": " **********The Government of President Ferdinand E.

Sales dropped to $2.56 billion, from $2.99 billion. **********''This proved to be an extremely difficult operating quarter,'' said Paul F. Oreffice, Dow's president and chief executive officer.  ''Weak consumer demand and tight inventory control restricted Dow's operating rate to 63 percent of capacity, resulting in heavy fixed cost penalties.'' **********For the full year, Dow said, net income dropped 29.3 percent, to $399 million, or $2.07 a share, from $564 million, or $3 a share, in 1981. Sales slipped 10.5 percent, to $10.62 billion, from $11.87 billion. **********Mr. Oreffice said that Dow, the nation's largest chemical producer after E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, had withdrawn from major joint-venture petrochemical projects in Yugoslavia and Saudi Arabia. **********''Considering the current oversupply of basic chemicals in the international market, additional capacity is unwarranted,'' Mr.  Oreffice said. **********Dow said that earnings for the latest quarter reflected pretax write-offs associated with the dropping of the Yugoslav projects, Dow's withdrawal from Saudi Arabia, and various plant closings and projected cancellations. All of these totaled about $102 million. **********The company said that it had realized fourth-quarter pretax gains from the sale of Bio-Science Enterprises, a clinical laboratory business; Dow's Korean properties, and Apache Petroleum Company depositary units -which yielded $44 million, $7 million and $8 million, respectively. **********''A strong U.S. dollar abroad hindered our European market penetration and export trade in 1982,'' Mr. Orrefice said. Greyhound **********The Greyhound Corporation announced that net income in the fourth quarter dropped 21.9 percent, to $23.6 million, or 54 cents a share, from $30.2 million, or 67 cents a share, in the corresponding quarter a year earlier. Revenues dipped 2.5 percent, to $1.17 billion, from $1.20 billion. **********For the full year, earnings fell 25 percent, to $103.1 million, or $2.34 a share, from $137.5 million, or $3.05 a share, in 1981.  Revenues in 1982 were off 4.3 percent, to $4.5 billion, from $4.7 billion. **********John W. Teets, chairman and chief executive of the Phoenix-based Greyhound, said that the decline in net income was easily identifiable. ''There was a drop of nearly $30 million in Transportation Group results, which were down 59 percent for the year, including a 78 percent drop in the Greyhound Lines' U.S.  results.'' **********He added that ''competitive conditions within the industry, airline cut-rate fares and the economy'' were at the root of the decline. In addition to operating the nation's largest private bus system, Greyhound has interests in various financial, industrial and food services, and owns Armour & Company, a major meat and poultry processor, and the Armour-Dial Company, which markets consumer products.

But there are no such truisms about the amount of money that an individual should spend, or invest, in pursuit of more. The risk that any individual takes should be determined by a number of factors. **********Financial planners and investment advisers say the most important factor is age, which they view in three stages. **********The first is the accumulation of capital, a goal to be achieved - inevitably, through risk - in the early and middle years. The second is the preservation of capital, an object for which risk should be minimized. The third is the orderly distribution of capital. **********The consensus among financial planners is that the best time to take a sizable risk in the hope of a large reward is early in one's career. That way, ''there's lots of time to recover from one's mistakes,'' said Dennis J. Kelly, a financial planner with Janney Montgomery Scott, a New York brokerage firm. As the person enters middle age, there is less time to recoup losses but more financial responsibilities to be met. **********The investor's psychological tolerance for risk may be as critical as his or her age or financial status. ''There is an economic risk to all investments, and people should understand that,'' said James Avedisian, chairman of the personal financial planning group of Coopers & Lybrand, the accounting firm. **********''Asked what they want, everyone will say 'more,' '' said Robert McKeveny, vice president, investments, for Scudder, Stevens & Clark, investment advisers in New York, ''but what is their ability to accept less for a period of time?'' Although their assets may be far larger, older people have less tolerance for risk. TAKING THE HIGH RISK **********The best candidate for a high-risk, high-reward investment, the experts say, is a young professional or business executive who has recently completed graduate school, is free of family responsibility, and has an income of $40,000 or more and assets of $10,000. If he or she also has ''the right psychological makeup, it's time to take a flyer,'' said Mr. Avedisian. **********He added that risk-taking is a form of recreation for many people. That may mean investing in high-technology stocks, or investing with friends on an apartment building. With only $10,000 in assets, it is unlikely that he or she has enough to make a down payment on a home, he said. **********The experts agreed that a young professional's top priority should be building equity. ''The emphasis should be on the rate on investing rather than the rate of return,'' Mr. Kelly said. Ideally, he said, the young person should keep the equivalent of a few months' salary in a money-market account with checking privileges, and invest the rest in a growth-oriented mutual fund. That strategy also gives the investor quick access to his money in the event a more inviting opportunity arises. **********There is disagreement among planners and investment advisers over whether young professionals should put the maximum $2,000 a year into an Individual Retirement Account, from which the money generally cannot be withdrawn until age 59 1/2 without a penalty. Some experts said it would be unwise for young people to place such a large percentage of their net worth in such an illiquid investment. **********Mr. McKeveny, however, said everyone should take advantage of the tax savings offered by I.R.A.'s. ''Uncle Sam's helping you save,'' he said. ''It's good discipline. And if you need to draw on those funds, the penalty is not that horrendous.'' TAKING HALF A RISK **********The issue of risk versus reward becomes more complex in the hypothetical example of a couple in their early 30's, with a joint income of about $85,000 and roughly the same amount in assets. If the couple have not already acquired a house, or if they want to improve their housing, planners say, this is the time. **********Mr. Kelly said such a couple should put down half of their assets on housing, ''a good, comfort level'' that will allow for a reasonable mortgage and enough liquidity for more equity- building investments. **********With the housing question resolved, the next issue becomes how best to invest the remaining assets, as well as any income the couple does not spend and the tax savings from their home, to pay for their children's college tuition in 10 or 15 years. Even at this point, the experts agree, the couple have a relatively long time and can afford to take on risk in order to seek above-average returns. **********Mr. McKeveny recommends that the couple put 10 percent of their assets into something highly liquid, such as a money-market account; 20 percent in long-term tax-exempt bonds, and 70 percent in riskier, growth securities. Mr. Kelly also recommends a three-way split, although he balances the equation differently: one-third in equities, such as stocks; one-third in fixed-income securities, such as bonds, and one-third in so-called tax- advantaged programs, such as a real estate or oil-and-gas partnership. Of the three investments, ''none is riskier than another,'' he said. The plan offers what the couple need at this point, he said: flexibilityand liquidity. At the same time, he recommends that the couple take the cash flow from their fixed-income securities and invest it in equities. If the couple have deferred buying I.R.A.'s, now is the time, Mr. Kelly said. **********Mr. Avedisian agrees that a tax-sheltering vehicle may be useful, but he stipulates that it becomes desirable only if the couple have more than $60,000 in taxable income. Further, he cautions that even tax shelters have risks. For one thing, the Internal Revenue Service sometimes disallows deductions that were intended to save taxes for investors. For another, the tax shelter itself, such as real estate, may fail to generate the hoped-for income if, for example, there is an oversupply of rental properties. Even so, Mr. Avedisian said, ''to the extent that risk can be alleviated with tax benefits, it can help.'' **********The couple can also minimize taxes by transferring some assets to their children through such devices as the Clifford Trust, in which any income is taxed at the children's bracket while the principal is retained by the parents. **********Experts said that, as a rule, people using a Clifford Trust should shun speculative investments in favor of such high- income vehicles as money-market accounts or corporate bonds. ''You want the principal to be there when you need it,'' Mr. Avedisian said. Besides, he added, ''the pressure to obtain a high rate of return is not so great when the tax rate is low.'' THE TRANSITIONAL STAGE **********With the children in college, the Clifford Trust, which freezes funds for 10 years, is no longer useful. But the hypothetical couple, who may then be in their 50's, with combined income of $150,000 to $200,000 and with $250,000 in assets, still need tax sheltering and equity accumulation as well as a good income. ''This is the transitional stage between preservation and distribution of assets,'' Mr. Kelly said. **********The couple ''might want to be less aggressive with investments than in the past,'' he said. ''Or, if they have been speculators, they might speculate with less money. If you make a mistake, you've got less time to recover.'' **********One investment instrument he recommends for affluent middle-aged investors is a series of bonds with different maturities, expiring, for example, in 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 years. In that way, the investor can achieve an average interest rate over the entire period regardless of what happens to interest rates in the short term, he said. **********Another investment to consider at this point, Mr. Avedisian said, is tax-free municipal bonds, an instrument he would not have recommended for younger people because the bonds are income-oriented rather than growth-oriented. **********Financial planners and investment advisers note that middle-aged investors can continue to be somewhat aggressive. ''They have enough income and assets so that they can diversify and take risks,'' Mr. Avedisian said. **********Mr. McKeveny would shift their portfolio slightly, still keeping 10 percent in the money-market account but raising to 25 percent the amount in long-term tax-exempt bonds and lowering to 65 percent the portion in equities. Those equities would be less growth-oriented than the stocks for young professionals and young couples, but they would not necessarily be low- growth blue-chips, either. The middle- aged couple ''still have time to look for capital appreciation,'' he said. **********FOCUSING ON SAFETY **********But as the couple approach retirement, the third stage of their investment life, the experts say they should turn their attention to insuring a certain level of after-tax income for the future. The emphasis now is on safe, liquid, income-generating investments rather than higher- risk equity-building. **********''Retirees look at liquidity, even at the possible consumption of principal,'' Mr. Avedisian said. At the same time, the couple's investment strategy should be consistent with the distribution of their capital. **********The couple could now begin giving to their children those assets that would incur heavy estate taxes, or property with major growth potential, the experts suggested. For example, if the couple own a stock or a collectible that they believe to have substantial long-term growth potential, ''by giving it now, all appreciation is removed from the estate,'' Mr. Avedisian said. **********Another good candidate is a life insurance policy, which may have a relatively modest face value but would balloon upon the death of the owner. Rather than wait until then, the owner can give the policy to an heir as a gift, ''if they give it completely and irrevocably, and live for three years beyond that,'' Mr. Avedisian said. **********In any event, financial planners said, an elderly person with ample reserves would be well-advised to make each heir an annual gift of $10,000, the largest sum that will not incur Federal gift and estate taxes. A husband and wife could give $20,000 a year to each heir without tax penalty.  ''Gifting is the start of orderly distribution,'' Mr. Kelly said. **********In terms of new investments at this stage, the planners recommend such lower-risk instruments as money-market accounts, blue-chip equities and mutual funds. Mr. McKeveny suggests another portfolio shift, still with 10 percent in money-market funds, but with 40 percent in long-term tax-exempt bonds and 50 percent in blue-chip stocks. **********The stocks ''provide growing income through growing dividends,'' he said, ''and if the couple has to draw out in a depressed market, they've hedged themselves by putting in only half their assets.'' **********The couple are likely to remain in the highest tax bracket, and thus may want to shelter some of their income. Here, too, the experts recommend a relatively conservative strategy. **********If the couple choose a real estate tax shelter, for example, they should consider a rental property with long-term tenants rather than a shopping center. In any event, the investment ''should be no more than they can afford to lose without impairing their lifestyle,'' Mr. Avedisian said. **********Or, despite the taxes, they may sleep better with no shelter at all, he noted. ''Often people in retirement want to simplify their lives,'' he said. **********In the final analysis, financial planners and investment advisers caution, such imponderables as an individual's comfort with risk may be as critical as his or her income and wealth in formulating an investment strategy. And emotions aside, there is still wide variation among people who are nominally in the same financial category. **********''There aren't investments suitable for all people, as their priorities and tax situations can be very different,'' Mr. Avedisian said. Thus, while experts offer guidelines for personal investing, they underline that investing is personal. **********Financial Strategies for Three Stages of Life PrimaryWealth accumulationInvestmentvia regular monthlyObjectivessavings; InvestmentBasic Living$18,000ExpensesFederal &$9,000State TaxesMarginal36%Tax BracketInsuranceAppropriate levels of life and disability insurance should be reviewedEmergency$2,000 money-marketFundfund with checkingInvestment$5,000 growth mutualPortfoliofund for capital    A tax-managed trust is an investment company that buys shares in low-risk, high-yielding domestic companies and elects to be treated as a corporation under the tax laws, rather than as a mutual fund, so that the dividends it receives qualify for an 85 percent tax exclusion.

A Vatican official, however, stressed that all parts of the liturgy had been thoroughly discussed and approved by the Pope's representatives. **********The Pope, received with respect rather than enthusiasm by an invitation-only congregation of 400 people, preached a sermon on the theme of reconciliation of all Christians. But he also emphasized the many issues and practices that still separate Roman Catholics and Protestants. **********''So we see ourselves in the midst of all the evident separations that still exist in teaching and life, deeply linked in the solidarity of all the Christians of Advent,'' John Paul said in German, the language that Luther elevated in his break with a church whose only tongue was Latin. **********''We long for unity,'' the Pope continued, ''and we strive for this unity without letting ourselves be discouraged by the difficulties that may pile up along the way.'' **********In his only reference to Luther today, he said that five centuries after his birth, ''we see as if in a distance the dawning of the advent of a reconstruction of our unity and community.'' **********The service reached its ecumenical high point, in the view of some Catholics and Protestants, when the church's pastor, the Rev. Dr. Christoph Meyer, recited a prayer composed by Luther:    We poor sinners pray Thee, Lord, **********and plead: That You would through Your Holy **********Ghost Bring together all that is dispersed, Unite what is separated and make it **********whole. **********However symbolic the action of the Pope's praying in a Lutheran church, those who had hoped for a message that the Vatican was proceeding with greater urgency toward the ecumenical goals set forth by the Second Vatican Council in 1965 had to content themselves with the gesture of the visit. Many Protestants believe that the ecumenical drive sparked by Vatican II has lost impetus. **********But in a city where memories of the great sectarian struggles within Christianity are very long, the gesture was seen by scholars as a major historic act, whether or not any consequences flow from it. **********Some scholars recalled a bull issued by Pope Leo X in 1520, which challenged Luther to recant his heretical doctrines within 60 days or be excommunicated. In the violent language of that time, Leo wrote, addressing himself to Christ: **********''Listen to our prayers, for foxes have arisen seeking to destroy the vineyard whose wine press You alone trod. When You were about to ascend to Your Father, You committed the care, rule and administration of the vineyard, an image of the triumphant church, to Peter as the head and Your vicar and his successors. The wild boar from the forest seeks to destroy it, and every wild beast feeds upon it.'' **********The point was not lost on many of the Protestants in Christ Church tonight that the present successor of a Pope who had compared Luther to savage animals had come to pray in his church, bow to its altar and join with Pastor Meyer in reciting the Apostles' Creed and the Lord's Prayer. **********Dr. Meyer, who also preached a sermon of reconciliation, asked all Christians to strive to overcome a history in which ''so much was unbeautiful.'' The pastor noted pointedly that a different language was spoken today between the churches. **********The Lutheran Church made it clear that the invitation to the Pope was a concession on its part. Dr. Meyer said on several occasions since the visit was announced that it did not imply any measure of recognition of papal authority. The invitations that entitled visitors to penetrate the tight security cordon around the 70-year-old church off the Via Veneto specified that the service would be attended by ''the Bishop of Rome,'' and they avoided the word ''Pope.'' **********In his only direct address to his guest, Dr. Meyer, although speaking German, called him by his common Italian honorific, ''Santit a,'' or ''Holiness,'' preferring this to any title that might suggest submission. **********No applause greeted the Pope as he entered the church. Clapping is usual for him wherever he goes. But parishioners were eager to grasp the Pope's hand and respond to his courteous queries as he walked down the aisle on one side and then walked back up on the other to meet more people. Only then did he climb to the altar, bow and take his seat."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/11/business/chromalloy-american-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-03-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 73, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CHROMALLOY AMERICAN CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "CHROMALLOY AMERICAN CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/31/world/caualties-in-grenada.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-10-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 357, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "List", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CAUALTIES IN GRENADA", "print_headline": "CAUALTIES IN GRENADA", "body_text": " **********The Defense Department has identified these additional United States servicemen killed or wounded in the fighting in Grenada: Killed SLATER, Sgt.

''And if we didn't have to sell it, we should still pay more attention to it.'' **********As it turns out, the company will not have to make the sale.  Yesterday, the F.T.C. overruled the decision of its law judge and voted to let Beatrice keep Tropicana. New Products Offered **********As part of its strategy, Beatrice named new managers and introduced several products, including frozen orange juice concentrates to compete with Minute Maid, the market leader. And last week, at the company's annual meeting, James L. Dutt, chairman, said Tropicana would play an increasingly important part in Beatrice. **********The food company, based in Chicago, is undergoing a broad reorganization, including the sale of 50 of its more than 250 companies.

''They earned about $63 million in fiscal 1981, about $43 million in 1982 and $43 million in 1983,'' said William Leach, an analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. ''Tropicana has been very disappointing recently.'' **********Because Tropicana's earnings performance fell far short of expectations, Beatrice announced in February that it was taking a $190 million write-down of its Tropicana assets.

Others believe that it is an i mportant piece of legislation that will be a boon to American cruisel ines and provide more jobs for American workers. **********However it is perceived, a new law that went into effect at the beginning of 1983 broadens business-expense deduction rules for the tens of thousands of Americans who attend out-of-town conventions, meetings and seminars each year. Such gatherings now may be held on American-flag ships sailing between American ports. The ruling extends an earlier one under which deductions from Federal income taxes were restricted to business functions held in North America, as well as in American possessions, and were not allowed for trips outside the continent or aboard ship. **********''This may be the first crack in the dike,'' said Herbert Paul, a New York tax lawyer. Travel industry lobbyists are already mounting a drive to extend the regulations even further, to allow conventions to be held in foreign locations and on ships registered in countries other than the United States. As it stands now, only about four American ships are likely to take advantage of the ruling. **********Before packing your cruising togs, however, you should be aware of some significant limitations to the new deductibility. Although the Internal Revenue Service has not yet issued regulations implementing the law and may not do so for several months, the maximum deduction per individual per year has been set at $2,000. **********The I.R.S. noted that was the first time a dollar limit had been set on the amount that could be spent to attend a business meeting.  And it said that ''in the absence of regulations, it would appear'' that this limit applies to companies and associations that pick up the tab for such attendance, as well as to individuals who pay their own way. **********The conference report accompanying the legislation noted that if married taxpayers who filed a joint return each attended deductible cruise-ship conventions at a cost of $2,000, each could deduct the full amount, for a joint total of $4,000. But if one spouse spent $3,000 on such a cruise and the other did not attend, only $2,000 would be deductible, even when a joint return is filed. **********Furthermore, a spouse's expenses for travel, meals and lodging at a convention or meeting are not deductible unless the spouse serves what the I.R.S. considers ''a real business purpose'' and there is a ''need'' for his or her presence. Incidental services provided by the spouse - such as taking notes, carrying luggage or entertaining customers - are not sufficient for tax-deductible status. **********Two detailed statements must be attached to a tax return when a deduction is claimed. One signed by the taxpayer must list the number of days of the trip, the number of hours of scheduled daily business activity and the program of the meeting. Similar information must also be provided in a statement signed by an officer of the organization that sponsored the meeting. There are no requirements concerning the amount of time each day that must be spent on business, other than the I.R.S.'s standard requirement that the ''primary purpose'' of a business meeting must be business. **********Business gatherings were allowed to be held almost anywhere in the world until two years ago when the I.R.S. tightened rules following some highly criticized abuses of the deductibility benefit by individuals and groups. The I.R.S. at that time ruled that taxpayers who wished to meet in places other than in North America had to prove that it was ''as reasonable'' to hold a foreign conference as one closer to home if they wanted the tax deduction. **********''When you compare what other countries do, we were pretty tight,'' added Leon Nad, national tax partner of Price Waterhouse, who cited a study of deductibility in other countries done about two years ago by his certified public accounting firm. ''If you've got an opportunity to learn, I don't see any reason why the meeting cannot be on a ship.'' **********After intense lobbying by the American passenger shipping industry, however, the lame-duck session of Congress last year liberalized rules covering business-related meetings. This move to allow business meetings to be held on ships of United States registry traveling between American ports was fashioned by the part of the Highway Revenue Act of 1982 that amended Section 274(h) of the Internal Revenue Code. **********But because the I.R.S. ruling is still untested, some meeting organizers may be reluctant to plan a conference aboard ship for fear of bringing about an I.R.S. audit for their members. A number of planners indicated that even though it could cost less to bring their groups to a seaboard meeting than to one on land, they might hesitate to invite a tangle with a tax examiner by doing so. **********MORE than 125 cruise ships operate from the United States, but only 11 vessels sail under the American flag b etween domestic ports, according to Ford's International Cruise G uide. And because of the size of the ships required to stage i ndustry conventions or company conferences - even relatively small o nes - just four ships are likely to get the bulk of whatever new b usiness is attracted to cruising conventions. **********Two of them, the Independence and the Constitution, are operated between the West Coast and Hawaii by American Hawaii Cruises, based in San Francisco. The other two, the Delta Queen and the Mississippi Queen, run along the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers and are owned by the Delta Queen Steamboat Company. **********''The interest level from meeting planners has been exceedingly high,'' said Dennis M. Myrick, cruise consultant for American Hawaii. ''We've recently hired two sales representatives that will do nothing but call on meeting planners.'' **********Stanley S. Thune, president of Cincinnati-based Delta Queen, is even more enthusiastic. ''This opens up a $20 million market to the United States flag vessels,'' he said. ''Our target is 15 groups for 1983 and 50 groups for 1984.'' He added, however, that the lead time on these business groups is anywhere from seven to 12 months, and that the real impact will start in November. **********Further lobbying attempts have started to convince Congress to liberalize the rules even more by allowing such meetings on other ships and in other countries. ''We believe that a convention should be deductible based on its legitimacy as a business meeting, not upon its location,'' said J.J. Doran Jr., manager of maritime and surface travel of the American Society of Travel Agents, one of the groups pushing for further changes. But he and others in Washington do not expect that the Government will quickly grant their wishes. ''We're working very hard to try to overcome the perception problems,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/06/business/executive-changes-081396.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-04-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 233, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "body_text": " *********** Allegheny Beverage Corp., Baltimore, has named Lynne K.

Miller, an entrepreneur from California's Silicon Valley, bought control of Atlas and became its chairman. **********Analysts are also impressed by the company's prospects, and the principal reason can be summed up in three letters: I.B.M. **********Atlas recently signed a large contract to supply the International Business Machines Corporation with computer heads and assembled floppy- disk drives. The parts will be used in personal computers. Analysts say the contract will be worth more than $170 million over the next three or four years. **********'They're Pushing Us' **********Atlas executives would not disclose the size of the contract. But Mr. Miller, who was in Hong Kong recently, said: ''I.B.M. is talking about tremendous volume. They're pushing us.'' **********Though still tiny by international standards, the Hong Kong-based company is certain to expand dramatically, analysts say. In the year ended last March, Atlas's profits doubled, to $4.1 million, on sales of $32.4 million. **********For the current fiscal year, Atlas will again double its income, to $8.3 million on sales of $47.7 million, according to W. I. Carr Sons & Company. For the following year, Carr expects Atlas to earn about $12 million on sales of $100 million. Some analysts say the Carr figures are unduly conservative, predicting that profits next year will double again, to $16 million. **********Stock Price Up Sharply **********Investors, especially European- based institutions, have driven the price of Atlas shares up sharply, at a time when the Hong Kong market has been in the doldrums. In April 1982, Atlas stock sold for 6 cents a share, applying the current exchange rate of 7.8 Hong Kong dollars to the United States dollar. Recently, the stock has been trading at 70 cents a share. **********Atlas garnered the I.B.M. contract by gaining a top rating for quality and on-time delivery of computer heads in 1982, outperforming other foreign and American contenders. **********A computer head transfers electronic digital signals into magnetic impulses stored on computer tape and memory disks. It also works the other way, transferring the coded information stored as magnetic impulses back into digital signals for processing by the computer. The heart of the computer head is a small piece of ferrite, sliced microscopically thin and finely polished. **********A floppy-disk drive turns the magnetic disk at high speed and moves the head to various points on the disk, to pick up or put down information. **********Another Advantage **********Besides efficient production, Atlas has another advantage: It is not a Japanese company. The largest independent suppliers of computer heads are Japanese, including the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company and the TDK Corporation. **********Although large American computer companies generally make heads themselves, they also buy them. Atlas makes heads not only for I.B.M. but also for Hewlett-Packard, General Electric, Burroughs's Memorex unit and Texas Instruments. **********''One of the reasons we're so busy is that all the big U.S. companies are uncomfortable with being dependent on Japan,'' Mr. Miller said. ''Ultimately, the Japanese manufacturers will do first and foremost what is good for Japan. And Japan's plans to rule the computer industry are no secret.'' **********The company produces ferrite material and conducts research and development through two subsidiaries in the Silicon Valley. But its main manufacturing operations are in Hong Kong, where labor costs are about $15 a day per worker compared with more than $15 an hour, benefits included, in the United States. **********The tax benefits in Hong Kong, with its maximum corporate tax rate of 16.5 percent, are also considerable. **********Labor Force to Increase **********To meet the demand for computer components, Atlas plans to add 1,000 workers to its payroll of about 2,000 in Hong Kong. But the biggest expansion will be in Malaysia, where the company is building a 500,000-square- foot complex in Penang, a free-trade zone offering tax breaks and other benefits for high-technology investments. In addition, Atlas is tripling the size of an existing plant in Malaysia, adding 85,000 square feet. **********The Penang complex will be an integrated plant, housing manufacturing, assembly, plastic injection molding and metal stamping and fabricating operations. **********To date, the Malaysian subsidiary has made consumer electronics components, but this month pilot production of floppy-disk drives began. Six I.B.M. engineers are now at the Malaysia unit, Mr. Miller said, ''to see that we learn to make the computer heads and drives properly.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/18/business/chrysler-cuts-certain-prices.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-01-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 151, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Chrysler Cuts Certain Prices", "print_headline": "Chrysler Cuts Certain Prices", "body_text": " **********The Chrysler Corporation said it had cut prices on its 1982- and 1983-model convertibles by as much as $2,505.

They were given the red carpet treatment designed to display the industrial might - including research and engineering - of American industry. **********After trips to a number of industrial units where the Japanese were seemingly awed by what they saw and heard, the visit ended at one of America's most highly regarded research and engineering laboratories. The piece de resistance was a harbinger of that laboratory's work in the field of microminiaturization - the smallest fully operable electric (AC) motor in the world; the diameter of the motor shaft was about that of a small sewing needle, one about fivetenths of 1 millimeter in diameter. **********The Japanese were obviously impressed, so much so that their leader asked if he might take the motor, which was enclosed in a glass case, back to Japan to show its scientists and engineers the great American accomplishment. After some thought, the director of the laboratory agreed. **********About six weeks later, a Japanese emissary returned the motor along with a message thanking the labortory director and suggesting that he examine the motor shaft. A cursory examination of the shaft revealed nothing; however, under a microscope the director discovered that the Japanese had drilled a hole longitudinally through the shaft, converting it from a solid one to a hollow one. **********Maybe there is something about the Japanese that we persist in overlooking, especially about the management of their research and engineering.

Now the Budget Committee chairman, Pete Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, who had expressed some interest in the directive language, may back off. **********The House has approved its own, albeit different, language that would force the Fed to set more specific economic objectives, including inflation and growth rates. Thus, it seems that Mr. Volcker & Company will need a substantial lobbying effort to keep their territorial prerogatives out of the hands of Congress. New Tune for Bond Sages **********The surge in the nation's key money supply figures had barely begun to slow down this month, but if you listened, there was an audible sigh of relief in the bond market, as short-term interest rates, which had been inching up, turned downward. Yet, some soothsayers didn't waste any time coming up with another cause of worry and disquietude - the Federal budget deficits. **********The worry is the same as it was at this time last year -the budget process could fall apart, leaving deficits of some $200 billion to $300 billion out through 1988 and the anticipation of this continued huge government demand for credit would push long-term interest rates higher, effectively stalling any recovery. **********But Alan Greenspan, who often comments on the markets himself, isn't sure the markets dance to every new tune the commentators play. ''I don't think markets switch back and forth, the commentators switch,'' he said, adding that the deficit threat has been around for a while but was easily forgotten by the commentators during the rapid decline in interest rates last year. This change, he said, ''raises serious questions about what the commentators know about the markets.'' Consumers on the Move **********One of the rules of economic forecasting of the last several years, which has not been followed too often, is expect the unexpected to happen. And, according to the rule, the consumer has not been spending during the initial months of the current recovery. Thus, the recovery is still limping along. **********Citing recent reports from retailers and higher auto sales for the first 20 days of April, Lawrence Chimerine of Chase Econometrics is now betting that the expected is happening - the consumer is beginning to spend. **********He says purchasing power is rising and will continue because of lower inflation, tax refunds and the 10 percent tax cut in July. The surge in the stock market is increasing net worth dramatically and is making consumers at least feel wealthier. Increases in housing starts and sales will spur spending for household goods, and the decline in layoffs recently is giving another shot in the arm to consumer confidence."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/03/business/business-digest-monday-january-3-1983-the-economy.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-01-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 397, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MONDAY, JANUARY 3, 1983; The Economy", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST; MONDAY, JANUARY 3, 1983; The Economy", "body_text": " **********High-interest checking accounts start Wednesday, but they are getting a cool reception.

With demand cut by the recession, Alcoa could not find any takers when it offered raw ingots last year at 76 cents a pound. Buyers were finally enticed to ante up only after Alcoa offered discounts of nearly 40 percent. ''The most frustrating thing,'' sighed one Alcoa vice president, ''is how far prices have come unglued in the last two years.'' **********Whether it is Alcoa or AMAX, Weyerhaeuser or Armco Steel, American business is trying to regain command over prices and start - once again - to raise them. Recoiling from the devastating recession, business now sees the impending recovery as a time when an upturn in demand sets the stage for a similar upturn in prices. This has been the pattern following all other recessions. **********But the upward price move - a key to higher revenues and a restoration of corporate profits - may be nothing more than hope.  Most price increases are still in the planning stages, as business watches and waits for a break in demand. And, of the few that have been attempted - most notably a 6 percent rise in flat rolled steel - success has been elusive. Indeed, prices have fallen so far that it will take a recovery far more vigorous than the one expected in 1983 to give American business the price relief it is seeking. **********''Business cannot do much, desperate though it may be,'' said Otto Eckstein, president of Data Resources Inc., an economic consulting firm. ''Aluminum and steel are just dreaming. They are hoping for significant price increases, but how can they do it? They can't.'' Dreams aside, business claims the recession has dragged on for so long that the need is clearly there. Depressed prices have pushed corporate margins to the lowest levels in years and profits are still falling - by 30 percent alone in the fourth quarter. The situation in some industries has gotten so bad - copper, for instance - that below-cost prices have been the norm. And, in recent weeks, raw material prices have marched up, rising by some 9 percent since the end of December. **********Unlike previous recoveries, which brought rising prices, the turnaround of 1983 comes fraught with obstacles that will keep them down. American business is still operating at less than 70 percent capacity and unemployment remains above 10 percent. And, there are no signs of a quick turnaround. The Reagan Administration, fearing the return of double-digit inflation, has indicated it will move cautiously and steer clear of stimulative policies that would lead to a speedier recovery. In fact, most economists are predicting G.N.P.  growth rates of only 3 to 5 percent in the first year of the recovery, compared with 6 percent or more following past recessions. **********''Everything we've seen so far argues for a price rise that will be only modest,'' said Alan Greenspan, the New York economist who served as chairman of President Ford's Council of Economic Advisers. ''We may see a restoration of the price structure many of these companies had before the roof came in on them. That will reduced the possibility of bankruptcy in many basic industries, but it does not restore them to the type of vitality of two decades ago.'' **********While consumers may hail a moderation in price inflation, it is a mixed blessing for the economy. Slowly rising prices are certainly a harbinger of a long, sustained period of economic expansion, similar to the early 1960's. This is in contrast to the roller coaster cycles of the 1970's, when prices rose quickly only to be beaten back by a severe recession, which, in turn, was halted by an inflationary recovery. But price stability does not come without its costs: Corporate profits remain at low levels, there is less capitalfor reinvestment and unemployment will continue at high levels. **********''The good side is you can have a longer expansionary period than in the past,'' said Barry Bosworth, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and former director of President Carter's Council on Wage and Price Stability. ''With price stability and unemployment you have set the stage for sustained expansion without having to worry about inflation. But, you won't grow rapidly and put a lot of people back to work. Even if you have a period of expansion, 11 million people will still be unemployed. How you feel about this depends on where you sit.'' IT is largely because the last recession was so deep, coupled with the cautious stance of the Adminstration, that the barriers to price increases are so large. A slow recovery means unemployment will remain stubbornly high - some predict it will be as high as 6 percent in 1988 - and idled plants will be slow to return, if at all. **********Excess capacity has a stifling effect on prices because it tempts businesses to keep them low in order to gain market share. And, the recession has so shattered the confidence of many businessmen that they will call back workers and restart factories only when they are certain the recovery is solid. ''Expanding capacity entails additional costs and there will be a great reluctance to do this until margins are sizable and healthy,'' said Joel Popkin, president of Popkin & Company, an economic consulting firm. **********In some ways, business enters this recovery in better shape than after other recessions. But these are ways that act to curb prices.  In their scramble to stay alive, many companies achieved permanent productivity gains over the last two years. Workers, fearful of losing their jobs, have reduced wage expectations from double- to single-digit levels. These trends have reduced the break-even point in many companies, making it easier to maintain margins without increasing prices. **********''During this recession, many businesses, probably most, have trimmed their fixed costs quite effectively,'' said Hugo Uyterhoeven, the Timken professor of business administration at Harvard Business School. ''They can spread their fixed costs over a larger volume during the recovery and increase their profitability without price increases.'' Productivity - output per man-hour has moved up as the recession forced business to cut overhead costs and squeeze production efficiencies.  Productivity rose 3.5 percent in the third quarter of 1982 and 2 percent in the fourth quarter, the Federal Government reports. Rising productivity represents a reduction in operating costs and acts to offset the impact of any wage increases. ''These efficiencies are a real fact of life,'' said Albert Matamoros, chief economist at Armstrong World Industries Inc., ''They will lessen the pressure for price increases and have a salutary effect on the bottom line.'' **********DESPITE these breaks, businesses, especially those in hard hit industries, still hunger for price increases. But, some say the only improvement in their profit margins may well come from cost reductions instead. Take steel, an industry currently operating at about half capacity. ''It's going to be difficult for us to get the price increases in the future that the industry could in the past,'' said Carl R. Fiora, president of the eastern steel division of Armco Inc.. ''Autos use less steel and our markets have shrunk. Couple that with all the capacity and it will make it difficult to obtain price increases. To stay in steel, we're going to have to look at costs, not prices.'' **********So far, the industry has been unsuccessful in getting its customers to accept their annouced 6 percent increase in the price of flat rolled steel, used in autos and appliances. ''We and our competition are having difficulty in the marketplace and it will take a while for that price increase to take effect,'' added Mr. Fiore. Given the prospect of ''wafer-thin to nonexistent margins'' in the steel business, Mr. Fiore said that any recovery means steel will ''come out of a depression and move into a recession.'' **********Clearly, hard pressed companies will push for price increases. ''A key factor is whether you look to increase prices in a recovery or keep them low to gain market share,'' said Mr. Popkin. ''I think that because of the pounding these industries took and the fact they they have now reduced their break-even point tremendously means that they will try to raise their prices and not be too concerned about market share.'' **********While they undoubtedly will get some price increases, whether they will get them in sufficient amounts is another matter. Walter K.  Joelson, chief economist for General Electric, predicts that companies will try to raise prices as much as they can but that their ability to do so is limited. ''It will dawn on all key actors that unless they raise their prices, all will go broke,'' said Mr.  Joelson. ''So many raw-material producers have been consistently losing that they have to do something. ''But people won't be able to raise prices that much,'' he added. **********There is some sign of movement on prices. The Producer Price Index, which measures price levels of food, capital equipment, consumer durables and gas and heating oil, increased 2.1 percent between January 1982 and January 1983. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 13 raw industrial commodities, which reflects spot prices, increased 9 percent between the end of December and the end of February. Copper prices have moved from a low of 68 cents a pound to around 84 cents, aluminum ingots have moved from a low of around 50 cent to about 62 cents, and the prices of linerboard, used in the making of corrugated containers, have moved up about 8 percent. **********The ability, however, to raise prices varies with the industry.  Peter J. McLaughlin, chief executive of the Union Camp Corporation, a paper manufacturer, believes that the $20 a ton increase in linerboard prices that the industry has announced will stick.  ''Business is improving and the increase looks good,'' he said.  Linerboard, which had been selling at $300 a ton in January 1981 has fallen steadily and is now priced at about $250 a ton. **********In the service sector, Sanford Weill, president of the American Express Company, which has the Fireman's Fund insurance subsidiary, predicts that insurance premiums will probably rise as interest rates push down the returns that casualty companies can expect on their investments. In the travel and entertainment card and traveler's check business, Mr. Weill anticipates no price increases, although he expects that increased volume will favorably affect these businesses. **********CONVERSELY, at Alcoa, Ronald R. Hoffman, vice president of flat rolled products, said his company anticipates little price relief through the first half of 1983. He said that aluminum orders have picked up, but it is difficult to determine whether this is a real turnaround or simply hedge buying by customers worried over upcoming industrywide wage negotiations. Also, increasing competition from European and Japanese aluminum makers - who were not in the market following the 1974-75 recession - promise to keep a lid on future prices. **********The effect of rapidly falling oil prices, on its face an antiinflation force, is still uncertain. ''It's hardly something we can count on just yet,'' said Harold E. May, a vice president on the corporate staff at Du Pont, which bases about 70 percent of its chemical business on hydrocarbons. ''Our suppliers have been screaming that their backs are to the wall and even if oil prices fall we shouldn't look for lower prices.'' **********WITHOUT price inflation, corporate profit margins may still not reach pre-recession levels and will probably remain lower than in past recoveries. **********''Proft margins should be a heck of a lot better, but they still won't get back to where they were in the 1978-79 period,'' said Mr.  Matamoros. Added G.E.'s Mr. Joelson: ''I have a suspicion that while 1983 will look good in comparison to a stagnant 1982, you will still have a poor recovery of corporate profits. Even a 20 percent increase leaves profits that are poor compared to corporate requirements and to what corporations enjoyed in the past.'' **********The long-run danger in marginal corporate profits is that business will be reluctant, or unable, to make the long-term investment in capital equipment that is needed if the recovery is to be sustained.  ''There's a limit on how fast you can improve productivity after the first blush of the recession is over,'' added Mr. Joelson. ''And you need capital spending for sustained productivity increases. Many companies would be happy to increase capital outlays. But they just don't hve the funds or the profits.'' **********Mr. Greenspan warns that corporations are faced with a ''peculiar problem'' because of continued high long-term interest rates. The financial markets are expressing uncertainty over whether inflation has truly been contained and this has resulted in capital costs that are still too high for sustained reinvestment. **********''There is a deep-seated ambiguity in the marketplace on inflation,'' said Mr. Greenspan. ''Some of the markets believe the downturn in interest rates is a short-term phenomenon to be reversed in two years. There is still a high inflation premium on long-term rates. The markets are not favorable to capital investment and that's the major problem with respect to recovery in this cycle. **********''In the short run, the recovery will be a lot more formidable than a lot are expecting. But, because of long-term inflation expectations, long-term rates won't come down enough to keep up that kind of pace.'' COPPER PRODUCERS SEE A BETTER DAWN **********The long night for copper producers may be coming to an end. But, while copper prices have already increased 40 percent from their lows of last year, they are still below break-even levels for many American producers. Copper is currently priced in the spot market at just above 70 cents a pound, while the average domestic production costs are around 90 cents to $1.00 a pound. **********Copper, used in construction, autos and consumer goods, was hard hit during the recession, and the recent run-up in price reflects the expectation of a turnaround in these industries. ''Whether this continues depends on the economic follow through,'' said R. Douglas Moffat, a metals analyst with the First Manhattan Company. ''This should take a lot of pressure off a lot of companies that have been not so slowly bleeding to death.'' **********It hasn't only been companies. In Arizona, the nation's largest copper producer, continuing waves of layoffs during the recession furloughed about 12,000 of that state's 26,000 copper workers.  American producers are currently operating at about 65 percent capacity, with many mines still closed and virtually no money going into capital reinvestement. **********Domestic copper producers have suffered at the hands of foreign competitors over the last two years. American producers are penalized by high labor and production costs and, because our reserves have been mined longer than in other countries, by a lower grade ore.  Competition comes mainly from third world countries - Chile, Zaire, Zambia and Peru - whose Government-owned mines were kept running at full capacity while domestic mines were closed. **********The main force setting spot copper prices is the commodity markets in New York and London, which are heavily influenced by speculators.  And, for companies, this is a frustration. ''Copper prices don't always run with the economy, but according to people's future expectations,'' said Harry B. Carson, president of the copper division at Amax Inc. ''Prices in the short run are controlled by speculators and not by utilization or by the industry itself. In the equation of copper, costs really don't affect the price.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/30/world/the-un-today-sept-30-1983.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-09-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 55, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The U.N.

Agee has been perceived as a gambler, a man who enjoyed taking a flier and usually won. But the 45-year-old chairman and chief executive of the Bendix Corporation pushed his luck hard when he tried to acquire Martin Marietta last summer, and yesterday, in resigning from the presidency of the Allied Corporation, Bill Agee cashed in his chips. **********It was the denouement of the ambitious takeover campaign led by Mr. Agee last summer, a complex four-way corporate war that ultimately concluded with Allied's acquisition of Bendix. It was also, at least temporarily, the halt of a career that the business community, Wall Street and the public had come to follow with admiration or derision, but always with keen interest. **********The best-known aspect of that career was his relationship with Mary E. Cunningham, who resigned from Bendix in 1980 amid speculation of a romantic involvement with her boss, and whom Mr. Agee married last year. Beyond that, Mr. Agee had also alienated some of Bendix's senior directors, and had been attacked by businessmen and financial analysts for his short-term, ruthless management style. For a time, however, the blame was outweighed by the praise for Mr. Agee's transformation of Bendix from a humdrum auto components manufacturer to a company with a foothold in the new technologies. **********Some of the criticism undoubtedly stemmed from envy of Mr. Agee's rapid corporate rise. Born in Boise, Idaho, he joined the Boise Cascade Corporation in 1963, a newly minted Harvard M.B.A., and was senior vice president by 1971. At the age of 36, he was recruited by W. Michael Blumenthal, then chairman and chief executive of Bendix, to be executive vice president and chief financial officer. **********When Mr. Blumenthal was named Treasury Secretary by President Carter in 1977, Mr. Agee took over. But when Mr. Blumenthal left the Carter Administration in 1979, Mr. Agee did not invite him to rejoin the Bendix board - an omission that reportedly irritated the older man, now chief executive of the Burroughs Corporation. In 1981, three directors who served on both the Bendix and the Burroughs boards resigned from Bendix, while a fourth left Burroughs - in effect, severing the longtime ties between the Detroit-area companies. Reconstructed Chairman's Role **********As Bendix's chief executive, Mr. Agee reconstructed the office of chairman, delegating the day-to-day decisions to others while he concentrated on acquisitions and strategy issues. **********He shifted Bendix's emphasis from automotive parts to advanced production machinery, strenthening its aerospace and electronics businesses. He acquired a stake in Asarco Inc., a major metals producer, just as metal prices were bottoming out, then sold out at the right time. He also sold Bendix's sizable forest products operations. The divestitures gave Bendix a fund of more than $500 million that Mr. Agee, until a better investment came along, invested in high-yielding money market securities. **********Mr. Agee's actions generally drew praise on Wall Street, which admired the timing of his divestitures and admired the company's bottom line. Not everyone applauded his approach, however. Lee A.  Iacocca, chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, complained that Mr.  Agee, by celebrating short-term returns, cast aspersions on the business of manufacturing. **********It was thought to be only a matter of time, however, until Mr.  Agee unloaded his cash for a major acquisition. Bendix's disclosure last March that it had bought 7 percent of the RCA Corporation's stock touched off speculation that Mr. Agee would make a bid for the rest of the company. Whether that was Mr. Agee's intention is unclear, because RCA immediately mounted a strong defense; it remarked pointedly that Mr. Agee had ''not demonstrated the ability to manage his own affairs, let alone someone else's.'' Romantic Involvement Criticized **********The RCA comment was a none-too-thinly veiled reference to Mr.  Agee's relationship with Mary Cunningham, the 29-year old Harvard M.B.A. who in a brief time at Bendix had risen quickly to be vice president of strategic planning. In an attempt to quash gossip that a romantic involvement had led to Miss Cunningham's promotion, Mr. Agee had denied the rumors at a meeting of 600 employees - a head-on confrontation that only heightened the talk and, two weeks later, led Miss Cunningham to resign. **********Mr. Agee and Miss Cunningham, now a vice president at Joseph E.  Seagram & Sons, were married last year, but the relationship continued to attract attention. Bendix's bid for Marietta was reportedly conceived by the couple, and Miss Cunningham's presence during some of the negotiations - in what came to be described as ''the Bill and Mary show'' - amazed and angered a number of the participants. **********To the end, Mr. Agee continued to defend his bid for Marietta. But to outsiders who knew Edward L. Hennessy Jr., the Allied chairman, it seemed likely that his career at Allied would be short-lived. Mr.  Agee may have been thinking that, too, when he and Miss Cunningham gave an interview to Fortune magazine last October.

The businessmen fear that the vast Treasury borrowing necessary to finance the budget deficit will squeeze them out of the credit markets just as the economy is beginning to revive. **********Both subjects will be on the agenda when the Roundtable's 45-member policy committee meets Tuesday in New York.  On indexation, committee members endorse the principle of denying the Treasury the tax windfall it gets when inflation forces taxpayers into higher brackets. Since seeing the President's $200 billion deficit projection in the budget for the fiscal year 1984, however, the committee will consider proposing that the President postpone the Jan. 1, 1985, date when indexation is scheduled to take effect. The committee will also consider proposing a trigger - maybe inflation of 3 or 4 percent - before indexation would be allowed. **********Many members of the Roundtable, including some military contractors, also feel that the President's scheduled increase in military spending should be scaled down. So far, the policy committee has been unable to reach a consensus on taking a strong antimilitary position, but the growth of the deficit appears to have alarmed the members. **********If the Roundtable does agree to ask for restraints in military spending, it is unlikely to specify which programs need scrutiny on the ground that only the Pentagon has enough information to make such choices. The policy committee's decision is binding on the full membership of the Roundtable, but it might not be announced for a week or two. Money Market Accounts **********Federal banking regulators, having recently authorized banks and savings institutions to offer individuals insured accounts to compete with money market mutual funds, will meet Tuesday to consider opening the accounts to corporate customers, too. **********Analysts say it seems unlikely that the regulators will let the corporations in. For one thing, lobbyists for the banks oppose such a move, as shown by comments submitted to the Depository Institutions Deregulation Committee. This is the panel of Federal banking regulators who will be voting on the matter. **********Just as important, says Preston Martin, vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, ''there has been no pressure from the corporate sector for this kind of action.'' Mr. Martin emphasized that he was speaking only for himself and not for Paul A. Volcker, the Fed chairman, who will be voting on the proposal as a member of the committee. Money for the S.E.C. **********Earlier this month, during House hearings on the Securities and Exchange Commission's budget request, several Congressmen suggested to John S.R. Shad, the S.E.C. chairman, that he was perhaps being a bit too amenable to cutbacks recommended by David A. Stockman, director of the Office of Management and Budget. **********Timothy E. Wirth, a Colorado Democrat and subcommittee chairman, remarked wryly that the ''chairman in the sky,'' John D. Dingell, might have some additional comments about Mr. Shad's budget request. **********Representative Dingell, chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, has now spoken, and he does not seem too pleased about the S.E.C.'s presentation. In a letter to Mr. Shad, the Michigan Democrat wrote: ''I will vigorously oppose any cuts in your budget and, for a number of reasons, I must particularly oppose staff reductions in those divisions responsible for enforcement and review of disclosure documents sent to investors.'' **********Mr Dingell continued, ''The current recession provides ample opportunities for fraud and other serious abuses.'' He said this was not the time for such cutbacks in a ''chronically underfinanced'' agency. Experts on Tender Offers **********An industry panel to recommend changes in Federal rules on tender offers will be announced today by the S.E.C. Among the 15 members expected to be named are two of Wall Street's leading merger lawyers: Joseph Flom of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom and Martin Lipton of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. Brock and His Aides **********Congress recently authorized Bill Brock, the United States trade representative, to have a third deputy, based in Washington. Mr.  Brock has hired, subject to White House clearance and Senate confirmation, Robert E. Lighthizer, the former Covington & Burling lawyer who is chief counsel of the Senate Finance Committee. Mr.  Brock's Geneva deputy, Michael B. Smith, will move into the other Washington slot. The new deputy in Geneva is expected to be Peter Murphy, who has been chief textile negotiator.

Under that agreement, payment of $630 million of Baldwin's $900 million in short-term debt was postponed for 93 days, until July 10, so that Baldwin, a conglomerate made up principally of insurance subsidiaries, could seek ways to raise money. **********In a statement, First Chicago said that Baldwin's failure to make payment on a debenture tendered on May 27 ''triggered a right by the trustee to accelerate the maturity of all remaining debentures under the indenture.'' Validity to Be Contested **********In Cincinnati, Baldwin said it would contest the validity of the notice it received from First Chicago, asserting that the notice is not authorized by the agreement covering the debentures. **********First Chicago did not announce the amount of the debentures on which it sought payment yesterday. But banking sources said the amount in question was less than $2 million of the total of $100 million. First Chicago assumed trusteeship of the debentures two years ago, when Baldwin incurred the debt. **********Bankers involved in the 93-day moratorium agreement, which has given Baldwin breathing time on debt payments, expressed surprise at First Chicago's decision, given that Baldwin's financial problems are complex and that its new management team, installed three weeks ago, is still not wholly familiar with the company's problems. **********''We were surprised that this problem, which is a serious matter, surfaced at this time,'' one banker said. ''This is another $100 million in debt that has to be addressed. We knew it was out there, but we didn't think it would be called now.'' President Was Replaced **********Last month Baldwin's president, Morley P. Thompson, was replaced by Victor Palmieri, whose company, Palmieri & Company, specializes in reviving ailing concerns. A number of Mr. Palmieri's colleagues joined the upper echelons of Baldwin's management, and the company retained Mr. Palmieri's company as a financial adviser. **********First Chicago's action took place a day after a key Baldwin subsidiary, the MGIC Investment Corporation, reported sharply lower operating earnings in the first quarter. Next week, Mr. Palmieri and other Baldwin executives are scheduled to meet with the two bank groups that hold the $900 million of short-term debt. **********At that meeting, which will also be attended by insurance commissioners from a number of states where Baldwin policies are sold, Mr. Palmieri is expected to outline possible solutions to the company's financial crisis."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/24/world/6-opec-nations-agree-to-reduce-their-oil-prices.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Lewis", "pub_date": "1983-02-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 884, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "6 OPEC NATIONS AGREE TO REDUCE THEIR OIL PRICES", "print_headline": "6 OPEC NATIONS AGREE TO REDUCE THEIR OIL PRICES", "body_text": " **********Saudi Arabia said today that it and five other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries had agreed to a reduction in the price of Saudi Light crude, which determines the price that other OPEC members charge for their oil. **********The Saudi Arabian oil minister, Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani, warned the other seven members of OPEC that if they did not accept the planned price cut -believed to be $4 a barrel - the six stood ready to slash prices further. **********If the OPEC nations, which produce about a third of the world's oil, fail to coordinate their prices, recent reductions by Britain, Norway and Nigeria could set off a price war, aggravating economic uncertainty and jeopardizing bank loans to the poorer oil exporters. **********There were indications that those risks could lead non-OPEC members to join any move by the 13 nations to stabilize world oil prices.  Although Sheik Yamani refused to put a figure on the price cut, it was reported in industry circles here that the major Persian Gulf producers would agree on a new basic price of about $30 a barrel for Saudi Light, down from the current $34. **********Sheik Yamani was speaking in Riyadh after two days of talks in the Saudi Arabian capital with the oil ministers of Kuwait, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Iraq. He said Indonesia had been consulted about the plan and supported it. **********Oil ministers from Venezuela and Libya are expected in Riyadh on Thursday.  Sheik Mani Said al-Otaiba, the oil minister from the Emirates, said the six OPEC members involved in the Riyadh consultations would ask for a full meeting of the group in Vienna or Geneva next week to discuss the price proposals. **********He also said ''coordination'' talks would be opened with the North Sea oil producers and Mexico, which are not OPEC members, the Emirates news agency reported. He was quoted as saying that there were ''encouraging indications favoring the creation of some kind of definitive coordination between producers within and without OPEC.'' Talks in London **********Indeed Venezuela, which has long tried to be a mediating presence within OPEC, has already begun such consultations. Venezuela's Minister of Energy and Mines, Humberto Calderon Berti, was traveling to London after meetings with Government officials in Mexico. And officials of the British Government and the British National Oil Corporation also said meetings might take place Thursday. **********(A spokesman in London for a major British oil company called such efforts unique, saying that they reflected the fact that, ''individually, companies and groupings may be unable to prevent what could be a considerable slide in oil prices.'' (''International coordination may be the only answer left,'' this official added. (A Mexican oil delegation was also on the move, with consultations scheduled in Paris Thursday with representatives from oil-producing countries, a spokesman for the state oil company said in Mexico City.) **********Saudi Arabia called the Riyadh meeting after Nigeria broke ranks with the rest of OPEC last Saturday and cut its basic oil price by $5.50 a barrel, to $30, and threatened further reductions if any other producer tried to undersell its oil. Nigeria made its move after two non-OPEC producers, Britain and Norway, cut the cost of their North Sea oil to $30.50 a barrel. **********The Persian Gulf countries, industry sources here say, are trying to head off the danger of a downward price spiral by persuading the rest of OPEC to agree on lower prices and to defend them by accepting output quotas. ''If the others don't accept this, the Gulf will have to cut by more than intended,'' Sheik Otaiba said. **********Sheik Yamani also hinted that the six were ready to take a tough stand with other OPEC countries if they did not agree to exercise greater discipline, saying that the exact size of the proposed cut for Saudi Light ''depends on circumstances.'' **********Oil experts say the Persian Gulf states would ''win'' any price war because their large reserves of oil and money and their tiny populations meant they could always afford to undersell OPEC's poorer and more populous members. Reasserting Role **********As world oil demand has slumped, several OPEC countries have been producing more than the market could absorb and giving buyers discounts in a bid to increase their share of the world market. **********Continuing disagreement over pricing and overall production led to the breakdown of last month's OPEC meeting in Geneva. Iran, Algeria and Libya called on Saudi Arabia and the other Persian Gulf states to reduce their own production instead, and Nigeria refused to reinstitute the $3-a-barrel premium its oil traditionally earned over the Saudi Light marker price because of its superior quality and proximity to Western markets. ---- Latin American Pact **********QUITO, Ecuador, Feb. 23 (Reuters) - Ecuador has joined Venezuela and Mexico in an agreement to avoid competitive price cuts, sources at Ecuador's oil ministry said today. **********They said the oil minister, Gustavo Galindo, had arranged Ecuador's strategy with Venezuela and Mexico, which is not in OPEC, over the telephone when Mr. Calderon Berti, the Venezuelan minister, was in Mexico."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/12/business/tierco-group-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-03-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 77, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TIERCO GROUP INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "TIERCO GROUP INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/01/world/labor-party-finds-an-election-issue-in-british-rail.html": {"writer_name": "Jon Nordheimer", "pub_date": "1983-05-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 671, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LABOR PARTY FINDS AN ELECTION ISSUE IN BRITISH RAIL", "print_headline": "LABOR PARTY FINDS AN ELECTION ISSUE IN BRITISH RAIL", "body_text": " **********It's been a century and a half since the world's first public passenger rail service was introduced on 38 miles of track between Stockton and Darlington. These days, the British rail system has 11,000 miles of track, but it also has mounting deficits, labor disputes, worsening service and shaky revenues. **********Another in a series of reports on the declining state of its finances set off some grumbling recently and has been seized upon by the Labor opposition as an issue to be kept alive as Britain heads for a national election some time this year or early in 1984. **********The report, produced by a committee headed by Sir David Serpell, was commissioned last year by the Government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to find ways to reduce the nationalized rail system's annual subsidy of about $1.2 billion a year. **********One of several recommendations says a drastic reduction in passenger service could turn British Rail into a streamlined system capable of turning a profit of about $50 million a year instead of running in the red year after year. **********To achieve this goal it would require reducing the rail lines from the existing 11,000 miles to 1,600 miles. Such a step would sever rail service in Scotland north of Glasgow and Edinburgh and eliminate most branch lines outside of London and the corridors to Liverpool and Newcastle. **********While this was the most extreme of several possible reductions in service considered by the report, it was the one seized by Labor as evidence to support its charge that Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative Government was ignoring the social consequences of its push to restore to the private sector services that were nationalized under postwar Labor leadership. **********It is not thought likely that the Thatcher Government will undertake a major reduction of the rail system before an election.  Yet it appears inevitable that the provincial branch lines will face some pruning, since their operation accounts for more than half of the entire system's losses. **********In the far reaches of Scotland and Wales, where decisions reached in London are usually received with scorn and suspicion, there is growing concern that the branch lines are safe only until the election. **********''It is not only the 30,000 railway jobs in Scotland which must be defended,'' Andrew Barr, Scottish divisional officer of the National Union of Railwaymen, said in commenting on the Serpell report, ''but any hope of an industrial regeneration in Scotland is dependent on us having an efficient and substantial rail service.'' **********In Inverness concern has been expressed over how a remote and rugged region like the Scottish Highlands could survive without trains. **********On the branch line to Kyle of Lochalsh one day in January, an electronics salesman from Manchester named Barry Jenkins said his territory would shrink considerably without train service in Scotland. **********''It's impossible in a practical sense to depend on driving by car in the winter around here,'' he said, nodding in the direction of snow-powdered crags that the train was passing. ''Without trains, the people themselves will have to step back a century to when the hill folk were isolated.'' **********The dangers of driving in the Highlands, as in Wales, in the winter are well known. The roads are narrow and the hills are steep. Every so often someone gets caught in a sudden storm and freezes to death. **********Construction of better roads, argues David Martin, community development officer with the Scottish Council of Social Service, will be more expensive than continued subsidies for the branch lines, in addition to making additional demands on the environment. **********The real problem, he says, is that, because the country cannot decide if public transportation is a business or a public service, the resulting confusion has ''done much to fudge the issue for investment in this sector.'' **********The real problem, he says, is that, because the country cannot"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/22/business/business-people-247696.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 328, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE", "body_text": " **********In 1950, Eiji Toyoda decided that if Japan was to have an automobile industry, his company had better learn how to make them properly.

A tough wager to win, considering that the bulls already were roaring and that the Dow was up nearly 20 points at the time. **********Mr. Torray is used to betting against the crowd, though. He is continually doing so with the $2 billion in assets - $1.6 billion of which is for equity- oriented accounts - that he manages for 30 corporate, union and municipal pension funds at his firm, Torray & Clark, in Bethesda, Md., just outside Washington. And, more often than not, he is right, as was the case last Monday when the rally evaporated and the Dow fell almost 11 points. **********By sticking to a contrarian investment philosophy that eschews what is in vogue, Torray & Clark has earned the reputation of being one of the savviest investment management firms around and one of the most courageous. Its current investment stance, for instance, clearly sets it apart. **********At a time when most money managers are close to fully invested as they eagerly await the second stage of the bull market, Torray & Clark has about half of its equity portfolio parked in cash investments. It's been that way now for more than six months. And Mr. Torray vows it will stay that way until he sees much of the speculative fever wrung out of the market. ''I just don't think it's worth the risk to confirm the popular view that the market is going to 1,500 or 2,000,'' he said. **********Swimming against the investment tide has paid off for the 46-year-old Mr. Torray, who set up Torray & Clark near his home in Chevy Chase in the early 1970's with David Clark, now 41 years old, a fellow refugee from the money management arm of a brokerage firm. The company's overall performance for its stock and bond portfolios is one of the best among pension fund managers: Its average gain of 15.8 percent a year for the 10 years ending December 1982 far outpaced the Standard & Poor's 500 index average of 6.7 percent and the Salomon Brothers high-grade corporate bond index return of 6.1 percent for the same period. In this year's first half, Torray & Clark outperformed the S.& P. despite its limited commitment to equities. **********Among the big Wall Street trading houses, Torray & Clark is known as one of the few firms that will buy giant blocks of stock when everyone else is selling and will sell when everyone else is buying. Throughout the darkest days of the 1982 bear market, Torray & Clark frequently was one of the only bidders for large blocks of stock. **********One of its biggest positions was in the beleaguered savings and loan group, where it bought between one and three million shares of a number of stocks such as H.F. Ahmanson and Great Western Financial. It has reduced those positions, including a three-million-share block of Fannie Mae and a block of one and a half million shares of Gibraltor Savings of Texas, for a profit of more than $40 million to investors, says Mr. Torray. **********Mr. Torray makes no pretense at being able to pick the bottom or the top of the market. Describing an investment style that would terrify most money managers, Mr. Torray says matter-of- factly that ''on balance, most of the stocks we buy go down after an initial purchase, sometimes as much as 50 percent. So we continue to buy them.'' **********The key, he points out, is that the firm is ''extremely patient.'' Out of about 300 stock positions held since 1971, only 16 have been closed out at a loss. And even the losses were minor, he says. **********Like any other investor, Mr. Torray looks for stocks that he thinks are undervalued. But in his case, the stocks have been pounded down, are selling well below their book value per share and usually have a high yield. A typical candidate is a company with depressed earnings, operating below its potential in an essential industry. After screening out possible bankruptcy situations, Mr. Torray takes his plunge because these kinds of companies, he says, always bounce back. ''Either management takes action, the economy turns around, the company is taken over, or new management is put in place,'' he says. **********The trouble with the investment business in general, says Mr. Torray, is that ''everyone is looking for the big winners and wants short-term results. If the information suggests that the outlook is bright and that the present is favorable, they don't realize that all this is already reflected in the share price.'' **********Mr. Torray also faults Wall Street for becoming too mired in detail. ''I personally think investing is a very simple business. With a little common sense and patience anyone can do well at it. Most people make it too difficult and out think themselves.'' Indeed, Mr. Torray appears to rely more on his own experience and gut feeling when buying and selling stocks. Mr. Torray, whose official title is president and chairman, spends a good deal of time traveling in the firm's corporate jet and limousine to quarterly meetings with clients. Mr. Clark, on the other hand, is an analyst by background and is more the expert on the nitty- gritty details of the stocks the firm owns. He is executive vice president and shares responsibility for investment decisions with Mr. Torray. **********THE firm's current holdings of $800 million in stocks are concentrated in only 28 positions, many of which make Torray & Clark the largest shareholder. It holds over two million shares each of three steel companies - Bethlehem, Republic and Armco - and giant blocks of a number of other heavy industrial companies, such as Clark Equipment, Cleveland Cliffs, Crown Zellerbach and International Paper. ''They're all dull, but they have a lot of earnings leverage,'' says Mr. Torray. Although he does not expect to sell any of his major holdings until there is a big surge in prices, he adds, ''I wouldn't buy any of these now at their current prices.'' **********If he is convinced that present holdings are no longer undervalued than why doesn't he sell them and go 100 percent in cash? Reponds Mr. Torray, ''Fifty percent in cash is pretty extraordinary to begin with. We could be wrong on a timing basis so we owe it to our clients to be hedged.'' **********Mr. Torray is convinced that sooner or later the market will fall out of bed. ''I've seen it happen before, regardless of all the talk now about the emergence of a new era. And how can you really argue that this time we are much better off?'' **********Nor does he buy the case for technology stocks. ''Year in and year out people have said about technology that it will save us and change the face of the earth,'' he said. ''That's nothing new. Sure there are a lot of good things out there. When you get a massive entry of interest, however, competition gets intense for the companies and investors bid up the stocks. It all gets to be ridiculous.'' **********The only thing that will bring Torray & Clark back in as a big buyer of stocks is for the market as a whole to drop below the 1,100 level on the Dow from today's 1,200 or so - with the type of washout that makes a number of industries and stocks begin selling as if the Dow fell from 1,200 to 700, says Mr. Torray. Until then, he said, ''Things have gone too far too fast. We are in one of those phases when people just want to speculate. It's best to just sit here and do what's right.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/23/business/jamesway-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-jan-29.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-03-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 106, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "JAMESWAY CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Jan 29", "print_headline": "JAMESWAY CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Jan 29", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/03/business/business-people-cruise-line-executive-moves-to-costa-as-chief.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1983-11-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 233, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CRUISE LINE EXECUTIVE MOVES TO COSTA AS CHIEF", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; CRUISE LINE EXECUTIVE MOVES TO COSTA AS CHIEF", "body_text": " **********Howard A.

Diesel engines, depth sounders and thermal underwear made it more efficient and warmer but the eternal problem of facing a hostile sea to hunt fish still tested the men in a way that machine operators in the Glasgow mills would never experience. **********The danger and the pride remain. But the rewards for Scottish fishermen seem to be slipping away. Herring has long been protected in the North Sea because of overfishing, and the furor with Iceland over cod fishing a decade ago closed the richest waters for cod. **********Then there appeared the more efficient foreign fleets operated not only by Northern Europeans but also by Russians, Americans, Japanese and Koreans. These fleets from distant places mainly prowl the richer ocean depths and banks. But a Scottish captain working out of Pittenweem can push his work boat to the Dogger Banks off the Northumberland and Yorkshire coasts and run into Bulgarian freezer ships loading up on mackerel and the purse nets of large Polish trawlers swallowing whole shoals of sprat in one gulp. Competition and Concessions **********For the Scottish fisherman, working a relatively small 50-foot trawler, the competition and the fishing concessions granted to Britain's trading partners when the country joined the European Economic Community in 1972 seemed as ruinous as today's cost of diesel fuel. **********A new Common Market fishing policy was to go into effect on Jan. 1. It was hoped that it would overcome many British objections and end nearly a decade of contention over the distribution of fishing rights in the North Sea. **********Denmark, however, refused to sign the agreement, and the other nine nations were left to enforce their own provisions, with Britain determined to keep the fishing boats of uninvited members outside its 12-mile territorial waters. **********Into this setting sailed Kent Kirk, a handsome and wealthy Dane who owns two large commercial fishing vessels and is a Conservative member of the European Parliament. With a retinue of 30 reporters accompanying him, Captain Kirk said he was challenging the British ban - defying his own Government's wishes in the process - by fishing for sprat inside the 12-mile limit. 'A Media Stunt' **********His own Minister of Fisheries called Captain Kirk's plan ''a media stunt,'' and expressed hope that ''sense will return after heads cool down.'' Along the quay at Pittenweem, harsher words were heard. **********Ken Brereton, the captain of the 50-foot stern trawler White Heather, reflected the general view along the Scottish coast by saying that Mr. Kirk was ''doing it for his own political future back in Denmark.'' **********''Denmark had no concessions inside British waters before Jan. 1 and they have none now,'' said Robert Allen of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation. ''Kirk wants to open an entire new ball game. He takes the view that as of Jan. 1 all bets are off. We take the view that after 10 years of participation in the E.E.C. there should be strong legislation to protect British fishing.'' **********''After all,'' Mr. Allen continued, ''Britain brought a huge chunk of water into the community and Denmark has gotten access to a large share of fish available in the community's fish pond.'' Modern Fishing Methods **********There is also a feeling here that the Danes, because of highly advanced methods, do not play fair in other ways.  ''Ninety percent of the Scottish inshore catch goes for human consumption,'' explained Andrew Wyse, a big fisherman with an openfaced smile and dark curly hair who is captain of the trawler Emulate. ''The Danes' whole economy is based on industrial fishing, turning the catch into fish meal to feed to livestock and to fatten their pigs for better bacon.'' **********But in one way, Mr. Wyse, 45 years old, strikes a tone much like that of the 34-year-old Dane who netted so much publicity this week by ignoring the fishing ban. In the old days, Captain Wyse said, when there were no restrictions other than a man's ability and the size of his boat, Scottish trawler fleets ranged far across the North Atlantic from Norway to Iceland to put cod onto British tables and into the hot frying oil of fish and chip shops. Now most of the cod is imported into Britain. **********The restrictions on cod fishing put the large trawler fleets out of business, and most of Scottish fishing is now in the hands of skipper-operators whose number is placed at about 1,700 fiercely independent survivors. 'All the Costs Went Up' **********''Even with the cod taken away from us things were going pretty well until three or four years ago when -Wham!'' He slammed a fist into a meaty palm for emphasis. ''All the costs went up.'' **********Moreover, he said, the dockside price of fish was stuck at 1979 levels despite the rising cost of everything else. ''Other European fleets have more efficient boats and use all kinds of dodges to push their fish in Britain and knock the cream off the top of our market with our own fish,'' he said, shaking his head with the irony of it all. **********''The common fisherman, in my view,'' Captain Brereton said earlier, ''would've been much better off if we'd never seen the Common Market.'' **********European influence has always been felt in Pittenweem, a port with trading activities dating back to the 12th century, and where Celtic history is scrawled in ancient caves along the coast where the round hills shoulder down to the water. The sloping roofs of the village at the waterfront are made of pantiles, slate-like rocks used centuries ago by Norwegian, Dutch and Danish trading ships as ballast, and left on the shore at Pittenweem when the vessels were filled with Scottish grain. **********The modern world intrudes on Pittenweem. It may come in the form of American tourists asking directions to the Royal and Ancient Golf Club at St. Andrews, 11 miles to the north, or in the dark shape of a British nuclear submarine knifing up the Firth to the naval base at Rosyth, or in the distant cooling tower of a nuclear power plant rising on the opposite shore. A few miles outside Pittenweem is the northeastern end of the band of electronics and microchip plants that extends southwest to Glasgow to form what the Scots delight in calling Silicon Glen, one of the few bright developments in an otherwise gloomy economic picture. More Chances Taken **********For the fishermen, however, there is no other path except the one leading out the mouth of the wide Firth and into the open sea.  ''The danger now is that more and more captains are feeling the pinch and taking their boats out in weather when they should stay in port,'' Captain Wyse said. ''They are taking chances now that they never took before.'' **********And the North Sea is a very unforgiving body of water.  Last week two Scottish fishermen were lost in a fierce sea, fishing not only in bad weather but also close to the holidays, when most boats stayed in port. **********For the moment, however, the greater fear is the day when, for reasons having nothing to do with the elements, the fleet from Pittenweem will stay in port and stop going to sea, and then men and their sons will have to look to Glasgow or beyond for their future."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/23/world/us-expert-s-view-too-much-bread-little-wine.html": {"writer_name": "Herbert Mitgang", "pub_date": "1983-04-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 475, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. EXPERT'S VIEW: 'TOO MUCH BREAD, LITTLE WINE'", "print_headline": "U.S. EXPERT'S VIEW: 'TOO MUCH BREAD, LITTLE WINE'", "body_text": " **********Gordon Craig, an American scholar who specializes in German history, said yesterday that he had seen excerpts from the first four installments of a coming series of articles in Stern, the Hamburg weekly, that are based on what the magazine says are newly discovered diaries kept by Hitler. **********Although he said that so far the material contained ''too much bread and little wine,'' Professor Craig, author of ''The Germans,'' said it was too early to determine whether the material would alter to any degree any well-documented facts about Hitler, the Third Reich or the conduct of World War II. **********He said a colleague, Professor Gerhard Weinberg of the University of North Carolina, went to Zurich last week as a consultant to Newsweek magazine with Maynard Parker, a Newsweek editor, to look at the actual diaries, which Stern is trying to sell for translation in the United States to American and other publications.

The Dow Jones industrial average was able to finish the week virtually without change. It closed at 1,182.83, down 0.46. **********Until Monday the industrial average had held firm at 1,180 in the face of repeated selling squalls since the middle of April. But the support gave way Monday when the Dow plunged 20.23 points, to 1,163.06. Rising interest rates caused the crack in stock prices. The prime rate at commercial banks, the most visible of all short-term interest rates, was raised by half a point, to 11 percent, the highest since early January. **********One saving grace to Monday's sell-off was the relatively low volume. Only 71.5 million shares changed hands in that session on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Professionals who watch the activity of institutional investors say that bids to buy stock have dried up substantially in recent weeks. However, selling pressure from the institutions also appears to be largely absent so far. Showing of Mutual Funds **********The first anniversary of the bull market in stocks, duly observed last Friday, marked a banner year for mutual funds. The typical equity, or stock-oriented, fund displayed a total return of 68.21 percent over the last 52 weeks, according to Lipper Analytical Services. This total return, consisting of market appreciation plus dividends, compared with 63.12 percent for Standard & Poor's 500-stock index in the same period. **********Funds that invest in technology issues - a stellar group in the market, although lately it has shown signs of profit-taking - provided the best individual results. Placing first was the Alliance Technology Fund, up 171.20 percent. Close behind came the Fidelity Select Technology Fund with a gain of 170.93 percent. **********The Lipper service, which tracks the performance of 538 mutual funds, reported that growth funds investing in small companies showed the best results of any single group. The average total return for these funds was 97.65 percent. In second place appeared the gold funds, up 93.71 percent. Capital appreciation funds, which are allowed to buy stocks on margin and to use other leveraging techniques, came in third among the groups, up 83.77 percent. **********The strength in mutual funds that mine their gains from precious metal stocks might surprise investors. But the gold funds benefited from the rising price of bullion during the last half of 1982 from what were sharply depressed levels and, to a lesser degree, from the renewal of inflation fears as the economic recovery gained momentum. **********The poorest performing sector consisted of fixed-income funds. On average, the total return for these funds, which emphasize bonds in their portfolios. was 24.16 percent - ordinarily a very creditable record for any 52-week period. Metromedia's Steep Drop **********Not many listed stocks can plunge 110 points in two days. But Metromedia Inc., the highest- priced issue on the New York Stock Exchange, did just that on Monday and Tuesday, when it closed at 390. **********Causing the decline was an article in Barron's, the business and financial weekly, that criticized Metromedia's accounting for the disposal of Foster & Kleiser, its outdoor advertising unit, to a limited partnership last November. The author was Abraham J. Briloff, professor of accountancy at the Baruch College of the City University of New York.  What Mr. Briloff said in substance was that the transaction constituted a financing rather than a sale. When that question was put to a Wall Street executive familiar with the mysteries of accounting, he said the critical element was whether or not the partnership is obligated eventually to sell the assets. **********According to the agreement, the partnership will have the choice in 1987 of either offering the assets back to Metromedia - which holds the right of first refusal - or offering to purchase the remaining assets of Foster & Kleiser. That would seem to indicate that the partnership is not necessarily required to sell, since it has a choice of buying certain assets instead.

It had one passenger bus, which carried a total of 5,000 people that year, and 24 school buses. Revenue came to $360,000. **********Now Mr. Else has a fleet of 13 passenger buses and expects revenue of about $2 million from 53,000 passengers. He also has the authority to operate in 48 states if he wants to. **********He owes much of this growth to his own ambition, but much of it, also, was made possible by the Bus Regulatory Reform Act, which went into effect in November 1982. The law made it easier for carriers to acquire new routes and gave them greater freedom to set fares. **********The act was aimed at bringing some deregulation to the bus industry, as earlier laws had for the airline, railroad and trucking industries. **********While some of the larger carriers have added lines and dropped unprofitable ones, analysts largely agree that most of the action since the law went into effect has been among the smaller bus companies. More than 1,000 of them have gained authority to operate in the 48 contiguous states. **********'Little Guy' Helped **********''It was the little guy who was already started who has been able to expand his operations under the law,'' Mr. Else said during an interview in his cramped office in a small white frame house on Route 61. The office is on the outskirts of Mount Carmel, population 10,000, which had thrived before the anthracite coal industry went into decline. **********In part it has been easier for the smaller, but already established bus lines to expand than it has been for start-up lines with larger ambitions, according to Richard Klem, the associate director of the office of analysis for the Interstate Commerce Commission. **********To expand in the charter and tour business a carrier already in operation generally had only to add buses and drivers, Mr. Klem said. **********Starting an intercity carrier, on the other hand, would take terminals, ticket agents and feeder traffic from local carriers, thus raising the costs and start-up risks considerably, he said. **********''The charter people are the most active,'' he added, ''with many doing well.'' **********Largest Lines in Dispute **********While the small carriers are expanding, however, the nation's No. 1 and No. 2 carriers, Greyhound Lines Inc. and Trailways Inc. and its associated carriers, respectively, are locked in a bitter dispute that the I.C.C. is expected to resolve in January. **********Trailways, through an appeal to the I.C.C., has been able to hold up most of the new route authority being sought by Greyhound since the enactement of the deregulation law.  In a decision that left neither side happy, Paul S. Cross, an I.C.C. administrative law judge, ruled last June 29 that Greyhound should be awarded the routes it seeks. **********He disagreed with Trailways and some of its affiliates that Greyhound, which now accounts for 65 percent of the intercity bus traffic, should first be investigated by the I.C.C. to determine if it was already too powerful a monopoly to get additional route authority. **********Greyhound's Size an Issue **********The administrative law judge also disagreed with Trailways' arguments that Greyhound, because of its size, could easily overwhelm any competition on the routes it sought. But he said the I.C.C. should undertake a study of Greyhound to determine whether it was so dominant that it could overwhelm such carriers as the Trailways system, which now accounts for about 25 percent of the intercity traffic. **********Both sides have appealed to the commission. **********While the large carriers are preoccupied with their legal struggle, many small operators such as Mr. Else have thrived under deregulation. ''All in all,'' he said, ''deregulation has helped us an awful lot.'' **********After the law was passed, he paid a fee of $800 to the I.C.C. and early last year acquired authority to operate in 48 states, and he plans to draw passengers from a wider area. **********The ease with which the application went through, he said, was in sharp contrast to the routine and long delays before deregulation. **********Protests From Competition **********He recalled that when he wanted to expand in 1979 and 1980 he did not even bother to apply to the commission. What typically would happen, he recalled, was that competing companies would file a protest to his application, saying they were already giving sufficient service. **********That would stop the new route application cold, he said, and often lead to months of agency wrangling. The tendency of the I.C.C., he added, was to side with the existing companies and deny the new routes. **********The result was that instead of working through the I.C.C., many companies just bought routes from other carriers. And in July 1980, the 33- year-old Mr. Else did just that, paying more than $50,000 to another local carrier, Capitol Trailways, to extend his authority to six counties. **********His company, which by then had expanded to five passenger buses, got another break in early 1982 when Trailways, in anticipation of deregulation, decided to turn over some of its marginal routes to smaller carriers. **********Twenty-nine of these marginal areas were transferred to about 20 smaller carriers, according to Ted Knappen, a vice president of Trailways. ''In a deregulated environment,'' he said, ''we had to concentrate our assets on routes where we could be profitable.'' **********Nonunion Drivers **********Smaller companies such as King Coal have been able to make money where bigger carriers like Trailways could not, Mr. Else said, because they used nonunion drivers and had lower office overhead and maintenance costs. **********In addition, he said, the smaller lines are frequently more familiar with the territory and thus able to generate more traffic than Trailways could, with its staff concentrated in the larger cities.  So, Mr. Else said, for a nominal $100 payment, Trailways gave him the route from Williamsport, Pa., to Philadelphia. Also for a fee of $1,500 a year his line became part of the Trailways national system, able to use the bigger company's name, terminals, maintenance facilities and marketing expertise.

For about a month after his departure, he stayed in partial eclipse, making few public statements. In the last month he has begun to make himself heard again. Calls for Toughness **********Mr. Sharon's calls for toughness seem to have had some effect on the tone of debate, but they have not yet overwhelmed a new tendency toward calm reason and pragmatism in the Government's inner circle.  Quietly and without fanfare, Mr. Arens has induced Prime Minister Menachem Begin to abandon some of Mr. Sharon's tactics and positions. **********As a figure on the political right, Mr. Arens is able to get away with some conciliatory policies. He is reported to have instructed the army to refrain from the brutality toward Arabs in the West Bank that became customary under Mr. Sharon, and the results have been seen in more restrained handling of recent demonstrations. **********Soldiers have been less quick to shoot at stone-throwing Arab youths. Mr. Arens has also warned armed Jewish settlers in the territory not to take the law into their own hands. **********The tone of Israeli-American relations has improved, and working meetings with the American special envoy, Philip C. Habib, are described by officials as calmer and more courteous. As former Ambassador to the United States, Mr. Arens is credited with having a good feel for American attitudes and sensibilities. Issue of Sharing War Data **********When he wanted to make a gesture to improve American-Israeli relations, for example, he chose to act on his own to undo a tangle that had been created by his predecessor on the issue of sharing information on the performance of Soviet- and American-made weapons in the war in Lebanon. **********As Defense Minister Mr. Sharon had refused to provide the data to Washington unless the United States agreed formally not to transfer the information, even to its European allies, without Israeli approval. **********This was done out of both calculation and pique. He was concerned that the information could find its way into the hands of the Arab countries. He was annoyed that the United States had not been more supportive of Israel's demands for a residual military presence in southern Lebanon after the withdrawal of foreign troops. And he was angry that the Reagan Administration had held up a sale of 75 F-16 fighter planes to Israel. **********When Mr. Arens came from Washington into the Defense Ministry, he took a different tack, however. He asked Israeli intelligence to what extent the Pentagon already had the information, according to an Israeli with extensive military contacts. The answer came back that most of the key data were already known to the United States. So Mr.  Arens proposed that Israel offer the information without a formal agreement, relying instead on similar agreements signed after previous wars. Key Demands Scaled Down **********Mr. Arens has also scaled down Mr. Sharon's key demands in the talks with Lebanon on a troop withdrawal. The idea for five observation posts in southern Lebanon, manned by 750 Israeli soldiers and intelligence agents, has been dropped, although Israel is still demanding joint patrols in the area with the Lebanese Army. **********There is some indication that the new Defense Minister would be willing to make deeper compromises but that the political balance in the Cabinet will not allow it. Mr. Arens had no role in planning the war, and thus no personal stake in the realization of its goals. But he is a determined hawk who believes the war was justified, at least in its most limited aim of routing the Palestine Liberation Organization from within range of Israel's northern border. **********The political reputation of the rest of the Cabinet, especially of Prime Minister Begin, is intertwined with the outcome of the war, however. These men do not want the Israeli public to think that what was gained on the battlefield is being lost at the negotiating table. **********Consequently, when Mr. Sharon warns in Cabinet meetings against abandoning the security demands in southern Lebanon, he is being heard. And even when he does not speak out, everyone knows his views. ''He is like a shadow,'' one official said. ''He sits in the Cabinet meetings, and everyone knows he is watching.'' Sharon Met With Haddad **********Several weeks ago Mr. Sharon visited southern Lebanon and had himself photographed with Maj. Saad Haddad, the Lebanese militia commander whom Israel wants as commander of a southern Lebanese Army brigade. Mr. Sharon warned against letting Major Haddad down. **********Several days ago Mr. Sharon met privately with Mr. Begin, who is said by associates to have a soft spot for the former general and to respect his military analysis. **********Monday night, before Secretary of State George P. Shultz arrived in Israel Wednesday, Mr. Sharon told a political meeting in Tiberias that the United States was trying to block Israel from realizing the full gains of the war. He declared at a recent Cabinet session that Israel should be retaliating against guerrillas who have been attacking Israeli troops in Lebanon. **********These and other activities have shown how thoroughly Mr. Sharon abhors a vacuum. He is described as immensely frustrated as a Minister Without Portfolio, for he has nothing to do but to talk. He is expected to do more and more of that."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/10/world/around-the-world-bonn-parliament-refuses-to-demand-resignation.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-12-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 101, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bonn Parliament Refuses To Demand Resignation", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Bonn Parliament Refuses To Demand Resignation", "body_text": " **********Parliament today rejected an opposition motion demanding the dismissal of Economics Minister Otto Lambsdorff, who is accused of accepting bribes to influence a decision on tax waivers for the Flick holding company. **********He has denied the charge. **********By a vote of 274 to 196, Parliament defeated the motion by the opposition Social Democrats, who said Mr. Lambsdorff, whether innocent or guilty, stained the Government's reputation by remaining in his post. **********The Government appears to be hoping the Lambsdorff affair will subside during the long legal procedure of indictment."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/20/business/time-inc-declines-by-13.9.html": {"writer_name": "Sandra Salmans", "pub_date": "1983-10-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 379, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Time Inc.

D. Quinn Mills, professor at the Harvard Business School and a member of the National Commission on Employment Policy, in a recent Harvard Business Review article, described just such an occurrence at the Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Company, whose workers received voting stock in exchange for concessions on wages and rules. **********''At a recent meeting of one local,'' Professor Mills wrote, ''a worker asked a visiting national union official if the steelworkers union research department planned to analyze an issue raised at the company's annual meeting and advise the members how to vote their stock. The official was a bit taken aback. 'I don't know the answer.  But if you want us to, we probably will.' '' **********So, Professor Mills concluded, unions slowly are moving into the role of investment adviser for members. Will such advice require a different breed of analyst? **********''Yes,'' Professor Mills commented in a telephone interview. ''I think it will.'' And possibly it will require a new dimension in teaching. He said that for about three or four years professors at Harvard have been introducing the concept of wage concessions into pertinent courses from the management aspect, but not from that of the workers. **********''There is a big problem now,'' he said, noting that the worker-employees are not financially sophisticated. ''An enormous communications problem. The union might have some analysts, but my guess is that right now the unions are having to find staff to communicate with Wall Street analysts.'' **********As a result of the recession, several companies have been ''saved'' by takeovers by employees who receive ownership in the form of stock. Suddenly, shareowner capitalists have been created out of worried workers trying to assure their jobs. In an agreement with Eastern Airlines just reported, pilots may get a 21 percent stock ownership in return for work-rule and benefits concessions designed to keep Eastern viable. **********In some cases, employees are getting stock in healthy companies, as a work incentive or bonus, or in lieu of higher wages. At People Express, the young airline that is flying high in an industry plagued with earnings problems, almost everyone in the company owns stock. **********Meanwhile, there also appears to be a growing trend for more employee stock ownership plans and more employee participation.  Usually stock plans involve voluntary payroll deductions of 1 percent to 10 percent of gross weekly pay. Thus workers can quickly accumulate considerable stock positions. **********The popularity of individual retirement accounts also indicates widespread worker interest in investing for the future.  Worker-stockholders might have a lot to ponder.  What is the competition doing? How can the company compete with the Japanese and other foreign nations? Is management doing an effective job? Is management too highly paid? Can wage increases be made now?  If we forgo wage increases, will that help the stock price? **********Another provocative thought might be this: If dividends are raised, the stock price might go up. But the cost of raising the dividend might be at a price that brings workers a smaller increase in wage rates. Yet if the stock price goes up, the company's credit rating might improve and it might be able to borrow money at a lower interest rate for working capital and permanent investments in new plant and machinery. **********Managers often talk about the bottom line, while stockownerworkers, wary about their jobs, might be more interested in the longer term. **********James Balog, senior executive vice president of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the brokerage firm, agrees that investment analysis of a company largely owned by workers requires a different outlook. **********''Yes, I think the investment has to be analyzed differently,'' he said. ''The tone of the analysis might involve a longer-range view.  Analysts might look at more of the ramifications of a particular investment conclusion - the impact on borrowing capacity, for example. **********''There would be a ripple effect of a stock recommendation - the credit rating, the impact on the community. The analysts would have to be almost like sociologists. They would have to consider uniformity of action. Would the worker-shareholders act like a herd and sell at the same time?'' **********Mr. Balog also commented on the broadening trend toward more worker ownership. It affects not only older industries such as steel, where workers have made concessions in exchange for stock, but in some new industries such as high technology, as well as service industries such as airlines, where equity is being given in exchange for accepting lower wages to give a company a head start. **********Mr. Balog speaks of what Peter Drucker, the management expert, calls ''pension fund socialism.'' Mr. Drucker has estimated that by 1985 American workers participating in pension plans will indirectly own 50 percent equity in American business. This raises the question of the influence they might exert. **********Both Mr. Balog and Professor Mills agree that the new kind of analysis requires individuals who can understand the tradeoffs within the particular company or industry. **********As the recession ends, the age of concessions by labor unions to help achieve better productivity perhaps will end, but the age of the worker-stockholder probably is just gaining momentum. With it there will be a demand for a different type of investment analysis - and analysts who can look at individual industries, and the economy in general, through a worker's eyes."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/23/business/new-york-area-costs-up-0.2.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-04-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 418, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NEW YORK AREA COSTS UP 0.2%", "print_headline": "NEW YORK AREA COSTS UP 0.2%", "body_text": " **********Prices in the New York-northeastern New Jersey area rose slightly in March, continuing a pattern of moderate increases in recent months, it was reported yesterday by Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. **********The Consumer Price Index for the area was up two-tenths of 1 percent in March on a seasonally adjusted basis, he said. Since the end of 1982 it has risen at an annual rate of 1.9 percent, he added, while over the last year the area's consumer prices have increased by 6 percent. **********The March index, Mr. Ehrenhalt explained, reflected higher grocery store food prices and higher apparel costs, which were largely offset by a sharp drop in energy prices. Restaurant Meal Prices Off **********The rise in food prices was four-tenths of 1 percent last month, based on an increase of seven-tenths of 1 percent in the food-at-home component. But restaurant meal prices inched down two-tenths of 1 percent over the month. Among the food-at-home index components, Mr.  Ehrenhalt said, the ''volatile'' fruits and vegetables index rose by 1.9 percent in March with increases for tomatoes and fresh fruits partly offset by declines for lettuce and frozen vegetables. The cost of meats, poultry and fish, which usually goes down in March, rose six-tenths of 1 percent last month. **********Apparel prices, typically higher at this time of year as spring lines are introduced, went up 1.7 percent in March. Mr. Ehrenhalt attributed the increase primarily to a 4.4 percent rise in women's and girls' apparel. Prices for men's and boys' clothing were up 1.5 percent, and footwear was up 1.2 percent. **********The medical care index rose by eight-tenths of 1 percent over the month as a result of increases for professional services, including physician and dentist fees, hospital and other medical services, prescription drugs, and related increases in health insurance premiums. Drop of 2 Percent for Energy **********The sharpest price declines last month were in the energy area.  Over all, there was a drop of 2 percent in March following drops of 1.9 percent in February and 1 percent in January. In the last three months, energy prices have declined by 4.8 percent, as compared with a 1.2 percent rise for all other index components. **********Mr. Ehrenhalt said that the price drop for energy reflected a decline of more than 4 percent in motor fuel and residential fuel oil prices.

They shouted back, the bigger boys lifting the little ones so they could see their uncle through the tangle of metal. ''It is very hard and very sad,'' Mr. Hammad said. **********This used to be the bustling center of the Palestinian town of Rafa, once jammed with concrete houses and shops and dusty alleys.  Now it is dead and silent and sorrowful, bulldozed into a swath of emptiness and flanked by armed soldiers and guard towers -monuments to the paradox of peace. **********Rafa, with a population of 60,000, has been a divided city since April 25, when Israel completed its withdrawal from Sinai, pulling back to the international border as delineated in 1906 by Turkey, Britain and Egypt. The withdrawal fulfilled the provisions of the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty signed in 1979, but it also reestablished a frontier that had been essentially ignored for a generation, splitting Rafa and bringing a maddening hardship to its residents. **********Modern Rafa, situated at the southern edge of the Gaza Strip, began as a small town in Palestine under the British mandate, and it grew and spread and spilled over into adjacent Sinai without regard to the 1906 boundary. **********''The shops have been so carefully erected by far-seeing tradesmen on the exact boundary,'' C. S. Jarvis, British Governor of Sinai, wrote in 1936, ''that so far no customs official has been able to decide what constitutes smuggling and what does not. Technically, the mere act of cooking beans in the kitchen and eating them in the living room is an offense against the law of contraband.'' **********After the 1948 war between Israel and the Arabs, Egypt controlled both Sinai and the Gaza Strip, and residents had little trouble crossing back and forth. Sinai and the Gaza Strip changed hands together in the 1967 war, shifting into Israeli control, and Rafa remained whole. **********The border is now a broad scar. It on a stretch of beach, climbs to an Israeli watchtower on a dune, then moves inland across the desert sands, its course vividly marked by the security road on which Israeli jeeps patrol between an electronic fence and unending rolls of concertina wire. The scar cuts from the desert through the town and out the other side, again into the wilderness. **********An old woman in black sits alone by the fence, staring across, waiting for relatives to appear on the other side. A young woman in a white scarf stops picking oranges in the orchards that press against the border zone, and smiles and laughs and flirts through the fence with two Israeli soldiers who have brought their jeep to a halt. Mediators Between Two Sides **********''You flirting?'' the soldiers are asked.  ''Yes, with both sides,'' the driver laughs. ''We are the mediators.'' Up the line a bit, a group of women in black sit sobbing. Sheik Tasaleh Zourob, a leader of the town, has died on the Israeli side, and much of his family, on the Egyptian side, has not been allowed to cross over to his funeral, the women say. **********According to Brig. Gen. Dov Sion, Israel's representative to the joint military commission with Egypt, eight members of the family asked to cross and were allowed to do so. Perhaps others were turned away by the Egyptians, he said. **********Under procedures agreed to by Israel and Egypt, the fence has a small gate for a few Rafa residents with special permission to cross. A couple of dozen, who live on one side and own property on the other, may cross daily. Thirty-two people cross from Egypt into the Gaza Strip every Sunday to work for a week in administrative jobs, then return home on Friday. Some Refugees May Return **********Residents of Camp Canada, a refugee settlement on the Egyptian side, have been granted permits to work in the Gaza Strip for several weeks at a time. They were originally Gaza Strip residents who were moved into a camp that ended up on the Egyptian side and who are eventually to be moved back to a Gaza camp called Tel El Sultan. **********The Sultan camp, a warren of cinderblock structures near the beach, is the new home for the 300 families whose houses were bulldozed when the security strip was made. They were paid compensation by Israel, General Sion said, and took a good deal of their old houses' construction materials to build anew. **********Israel originally proposed that the security zone be drawn around Rafa, either putting the town wholly inside or outside Israeli jurisdiction. Egypt refused. Israel then considered leaving the border as little more than a chain-link fence through the town. But security men were afraid it would be too easy for guerrillas to infiltrate, roof to roof, alley to alley. So the swath was cut. At present there are no plans to change the border. **********Now, General Sion said, about 70 to 80 infiltrators are caught a month, here and elsewhere along the border. Most, he said, are looking for jobs in Israel, are smuggling or are visiting relatives.  But some are armed, would-be terrorists. Israel has asked Egypt to step up its patrols and has asked the multinational force to help. **********On the Israeli side Ahmed Zourob, 14 years old, stared through the fence.

With 10 months of work behind them, the construction crews are topping off the building, and a sales office will open shortly after Labor Day. Occupancy is to begin in late October. **********A sign announcing the sales went up six weeks ago. ''We have received more than 400 inquiries since then, and that is a tremendous response,'' said Vincent L. Riso, the third generation of his family to head the real estate management and construction company. It was founded by his grandfather Luigi Riso in 1914. His brother Raymond and his uncle Dominick also are officers of the company. **********Among the inquiries was one from the Chinatown Planning Council, a nonprofit body seeking possible residences for Chinese families. The growth of Flushing's Asian population - largely Chinese and Korean - has been among the fastest in the nation. **********The impact of the Korean influx, for example, prompted the owner of another multiple-dwelling condominium in Flushing to change its name from Wisteria Gardens to Seoul Plaza. **********Although residential space is at a premium in Flushing, Mr. Riso said the Towers was ''the only new high-rise condo presently available'' in that northeastern Queens neighborhood. **********But around the corner, on Union Street between 37th Avenue and Northern Boulevard, construction has begun on a detached row of 10 to 12 town houses, with two apartments above ground-level stores. And a 15-story condominium building on Main Street south of its juncture with Kissena Boulevard is in the planning stage, the Queens office of the Planning Department said. **********Mr. Riso has lived most of his 49 years in Bayside, which adjoins Flushing to the east. One- and two-family houses mark the quiet tree-lined side streets in both communities, but on the larger avenues there are garden apartments and larger multifamily buildings, many of them with the full services associated with luxury buildings. **********No soaring skyscrapers cut off the light or mar the green foliage and low-profile dwellings, office buildings and stores. From the third floor of the Towers, one can see a church spire, the crenelated tower of an armory and the Gothic tower of a high school rising above the trees. **********The Towers sits on three-quarters of an acre that was formerly occupied by an automobile dealership and car storage lot.  A few blocks away are the Main Street subway stop (terminus of the IRT No. 7 line) and the Flushing station of the Long Island Rail Road. **********The 80 units, with either north or south exposure, consist of 10 one-bedroom and 70 two-bedroom apartments. Each of the 10 floors contains one one-bedroom and seven two-bedroom units. The building is set back from the property line, and cars can approach the entrance on a semicircular driveway. **********The one-bedroom units, which will cost from $115,000 to more than $130,000, will have 750 square feet of space divided among the bedroom, a bathroom, kitchen and living-dining area. **********The two-bedroom units, which will be priced from $130,000 to more than $150,000, will have 950 square feet of space divided among the two bedrooms, one and a half bathrooms, kitchen and living-dining area. All apartments will be equipped with dishwashers, clothes washers and driers, and those above the second floor will have terraces. **********Homeowners at the Towers will benefit from the fact that the project was built under the Section 421A tax abatement program. This program provides for initially low property taxes that will increase gradually over a 10-year period to the maximum set by law. **********As work on the Towers nears its end, the Briarwood Organization is preparing to embark on its first real estate venture in Manhattan - construction of a 108-unit condominium project on the West Side. The multiple dwelling will consist of one- , two- and three-bedroom apartments with selling prices, Mr. Riso said, averaging about $175 a square foot, compared with $140 a square foot at the Towers. **********Mr. Riso said Briarwood's Manhattan venture, in the West Side urban renewal area at Columbus Avenue and 89th Street, would be the first residential development in the area to be built as a condominium at market rates.

The Government-sponsored Voice of Lebanon radio said at least 14 Druse and 9 Christians were killed in shelling and gunfire in villages in the area. **********Israeli military officials said they did not think the violence was related to the signing last week of the Israeli-Lebanese troop withdrawal agreement. Syria, which has an estimated 40,000 to 50,000 troops in Lebanon, has denounced the accord. **********Without the withdrawal of the Syrians as well as the estimated 10,000 to 15,000 Palestinian guerrillas in Lebanon, the agreement is regarded as void because Israel says its troops, estimated at 25,000 to 30,000, will not leave unless the Syrians and the Palestinians pull out at the same time. Druse Reported Killed by a Mine **********The latest incident in the Shuf area began Saturday when a Druse sheik was reportedly killed after stepping on a land mine.  The death of the sheik in the village of Kfarhim resulted in Druse partisans' forming a roadblock and kidnapping Christian motorists.  Armed Christians retaliated, setting up roadblocks and taking Druse drivers hostage. **********Tonight the Lebanese authorities tried to organize an exchange of the kidnapped motorists.  Prime Minister Shafik al-Wazzan issued an appeal for both sides in the region to use restraint ''at these crucial times'' while the Lebanese-Israeli withdrawal pact was scrutinized by Arab countries in light of Syria's opposition. **********The area of violence has been under the control of the Israelis since they invaded Lebanon last June. On several occasions in the past the Israelis arranged an end to the hostilities by moving in reinforcements. Gemayel Meets With Druse **********The renewed violence occurred as President Amin Gemayel met with Druse leaders about the withdrawal pact.  Today's incident was regarded by a senior political analyst here who has closely monitored violence in Lebanon as one of the worst in recent months. **********A spokesman for the Israeli Army based in East Beirut said the Israeli military was ''doing all it can to restore calm to the area.'' The Israeli Army had previously scheduled a tour of the Shuf region Monday for foreign correspondents, most of whom are being brought from Israel. **********According to the Israeli spokesman, the latest outbreak was not related to the withdrawal accord and was an isolated incident in a region that has been the scene of fighting for years. **********''It was sparked off by a freak incident,'' an Israeli official said, referring to the land-mine explosion.

The bonds offer stable cash flow and current yields well in excess of recent inflation. The stocks offer potential capital gains. **********While bonds will never match the performance of a hot stock, few bonds ever suffer the steep declines possible in the stock market. Even if the value of the bond declines, the holder will still receive the same semiannual interest payments as before. For example, when the Consolidated Edison Company of New York and the Chrysler Corporation were going through bad times, both companies continued to make all interest payments on their bonds, but were forced to suspend dividend payments on their common stock. **********''That's the beauty of the bond market,'' said Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber Inc., who was lamenting the recent decline of his firm's stock along with other brokerage issues. ''In the bond market, all you basically worry about is the direction of interest rates. There is none of this business of picking the right group of stocks.'' **********There are two basic categories of bonds, those issued by corporations and the Federal Government with interest payments subject to the Federal income tax, and those issued by states and local governments with interest payments exempt from the Federal tax. **********Most individuals find the tax-exempt market to be the most attractive sector because the Federal income tax does not apply. However, there are situations in which higher-yielding Treasury and corporate issues may be more attractive. For example, Individual Retirement Accounts and Keogh plans are exempt from income tax until the money is withdrawn, so the tax-exempt advantage of municipal bonds would be wasted. **********Although the $2,000-a-year limit on an individual's contribution to an I.R.A. is small by the standards of the Treasury and corporate market, the size of those accounts will increase in several years to a level where a large amount might be shifted to bonds. Even in the early years of an I.R.A. account, Treasury issues can be bought in odd-lots with minimum denominations of $1,000 either through the Federal Reserve or through a bank or securities dealer. Corporate bonds cannot generally be bought in amounts of $2,000, but small investments are possible in many mutual funds that invest in corporate and Treasury issues. **********While the bond market offers more price stability than stocks, there is some risk of price fluctuations. ''I compare bonds to the end of a clock pendulum,'' said Frederick J. Stoever, president of Stoever, Glass & Company, a New York- based municipal securities firm. ''Long- term bond prices swing in the widest arc, while prices of shorter-term issues do not swing so much.'' The second kind of risk - default - is small in comparison to the volume of issues sold - only about two- tenths of 1 percent of all state and local government bonds - but it is major to the buyers of the affected issues, and the default of the Washington Public Power Supply System created anxiety among many other investors. **********The attraction is yields. Bond market investors face an environment in which yields are high not just in contrast to the standards of the past 40 years, but also in contrast to the recent inflation rate of less than 4 percent. **********Allen Sinai, an economist at Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb, said in a recent paper that bond yields were likely to range from 4 1/2 percentage points to 7 percentage points above the inflation rate through 1985. Uncertainty about the economy, inflation, Federal budget deficits, Federal Reserve policy and private credit demands all contribute to the abnormally high level of interest rates, he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/21/world/disquiet-in-denmark-is-just-under-the-veneer.html": {"writer_name": "Jon Nordheimer", "pub_date": "1983-07-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 684, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DISQUIET IN DENMARK IS JUST UNDER THE VENEER", "print_headline": "DISQUIET IN DENMARK IS JUST UNDER THE VENEER", "body_text": " **********Like other European capitals filled with tourists this summer, Copenhagen has a sheen of plenty. Swedes, Germans, Americans and others move in a serpentine mass along pedestrian shopping streets past gleaming shop windows filled with expensive goods and delicacies. **********Underneath the sheen, however, there are economic and social problems, among them unemployment running at a rate above 10 percent. But Denmark's jobless, buoyed by a wide array of social welfare benefits, are said to be confident that life can be cushioned without major sacrifice. **********The austerity program introduced by the center-right coalition that took over leadership of the Danish Government last fall has cut about as deep as is politically possible in a welfare state that now gives a jobless couple with no dependents about $225 a week in addition to subsidized housing and a host of other benefits. **********The minority coalition led by Prime Minister Poul Schluter, a Conservative, continues to grow in popularity on the strength of its moves to check Government spending. Without much outcry from the Social Democrats, who have been in opposition since last fall, the new Government ended the index-linking of wages and welfare benefits. It also won an agreement from trade unions not to seek wage increases above 4 percent. Lectures on Spending **********Real economic growth is expected to continue at the present annual rate of about 2.5 percent, a level that Government economists say will pay the costs of maintaining one of the most advanced and stable societies in Europe but one that apparently would not ease unemployment by creating new jobs. **********Foreign debt still represents about 25 percent of the gross national product.  ''Whenever bankers visit Denmark they lecture us about our spending,'' Erik Hoffmeyer, director general of the National Bank of Denmark, said in an interview. ''From the outside we are considered an unstable economy, but there is now broad political support in Denmark for the Government's austerity program.'' **********The bankers' concern led to the lowering of Denmark's bond rating this year from AAA to AA-plus, a move that reflected the belief that austerity had not gone far enough. **********In the view of many, however, if Denmark is forced by a return of high interest rates into an attempt to cut further in social spending, the Schluter Government would be placed on a collision course with Social Democrats. Because the coalition holds only 66 of Parliament's 179 seats, a vote on the question would be expected to force a general election. Missiles Are an Issue **********In any election campaign, the Social Democrats would be expected to benefit from the continuing dispute in Denmark over the plans by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to begin deploying new American intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe in December unless the Soviet Union and United States reach an agreement on limiting such arms in Geneva. The Schluter Government supports the NATO decision, but in May a Social Democratic resolution adopted by Parliament compelled it to press for an extension of the deadline. **********This enforced ''wavering on the deployment issue,'' a coalition member said in an interview, has not only embarrassed the Schluter Government but has also been causing much trouble in the Netherlands, where public support is in a delicate balance. He said that ''if an election was necessary this year'' the coalition could not afford to let missiles become the central issue. **********Beyond the political impact of chronic high unemployment, there is growing concern over the social consequences among young Danes. With five million people in a small land mass, Denmark has prided itself on order and an affluence that eliminated poverty and clear class divisions. **********However, young Danes, like others of their generation in Europe, are more inclined today to see themselves as victims in a society that can no longer provide jobs for them. Among small signs of unrest among them are groups of young people in Copenhagen called the B-Zed who are taking over unoccupied housing and resisting police attempts to remove them."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/26/world/man-political-star-born-again-portuguese-election-mario-albertonobre-lopes.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-04-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 765, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "POLITICAL STAR IS BORN AGAIN IN PORTUGUESE ELECTION: MARIO ALBERTONOBRE LOPES SIARES", "print_headline": "MAN IN THE NEWS; POLITICAL STAR IS BORN AGAIN IN PORTUGUESE ELECTION: MARIO ALBERTONOBRE LOPES SIARES", "body_text": " **********Many here show a trace of amazement when they speak of the comeback of Mario Soares. Not that the 58-year-old Socialist leader has ever really been away. For the last four years he has been an irrepressible figure on the political scene, but in the opposition. **********His return to power means a slight shift to the left. It reestablishes him, along with the nonparty President, Gen. Antonio Ramalho Eanes, as one of the two people in Government who count. **********''I think, finally, that there was just no one else around,'' a leftist political writer said. ''In the past people have wished for too much and seen too little. So they are turning to him out of pure hope but also out of desperation.'' A Mixed Review as Leader **********Mr. Soares first became Prime Minister in the 1976 elections, beating back a Communist takeover attempt after the 1974 armysponsored revolution. In June 1978 his minority Government was dismissed rather curtly by President Eanes, who thereby gained his longstanding enmity. **********Mr. Soares's tenure got mixed reviews - the promises had been lofty, there was a bit of nepotism, and the corruption that is endemic to politics here seemed more visible because so many committees were appointed to investigate it. But after three years of drifting rule by a center-right coalition it began to look better and better to many Portuguese. **********Mr. Soares had a lot going for him in the present campaign. The deepening economic crisis produced a toss-the-rascals-out psychology; the right-wing parties were feuding and in disarray, and the pro-Soviet Communists were tarnished by antinationalism. **********Then, too, Mr. Soares is not a parochial figure. His years as Foreign Minister in the post-coup Government and his position as vice president of the Socialist International since 1976 mean that he can justifiably speak, as he often does, of ''mon ami Mitterrand'' and ''mi amigo Filipe,'' references to the Prime Ministers of France and Spain. International stature counts for a lot in a small country. **********And Mr. Soares is a natural politician. Cherubic, slightly pudgy, his gray hair neatly coiffed, he performs brilliantly on the stump, donning rubber boots to wade through markets and hug fishmongers, resting his hand gently on the shoulder of a farmer, cutting the air dramatically with his right hand when he exhorts a crowd. In the Path of His Father **********Mario Alberto Nobre Lopes Soares was born in Lisbon on Dec. 7, 1924. His father, Dr. Joao Soares, struggled against the Salazar dictatorship for four decades, undergoing long periods of imprisonment and exile. **********The son followed the same path. He studied history, philosophy and law at the University of Lisbon and the Sorbonne. He was active in the antifascist movement and in 1946 helped found the Democratic Youth Movement in Portugal. In 1947, disillusioned by the show trials in Eastern Europe, he broke with the Communist Party. **********Mr. Soares married Maria Barroso, a leading actress, in prison in 1949. They have a 33-year-old son, Joao, and a 30-year-old daughter, Isabel. **********Mr. Soares went to jail at the age of 19, the first of 12 imprisonments and four and a half years of exile he was to suffer under Salazar. As a lawyer he defended opposition activists of all stripes, from Communists to African nationalists. **********In 1968, Mr. Soares was sent into exile to the African island of Sao Tome. Ten months later, in the ''false spring'' that followed Salazar's death, the regime of Marcello Caetano allowed him back to attend the funeral of his father, but he fell foul of the authorities again and within a year was forced to leave. Based in Paris, he taught at the Sorbonne and the University of Rennes, wrote his most important political works and, in West Germany in 1973, founded the Portuguese Socialist Party.  The coup of April 25, 1974, brought him back to Portugal in triumph. **********Perhaps the most rightist of Western European Socialist leaders, he has noticeably toned down any hint of radicalism in the campaign. He has also had to fend off the charge, from his old enemies, the Communists, that he is the candidate favored by the United States.  ''They attack me because I say that friendship with Washington is an essential condition of our foreign affairs,'' he said. He added, with a subtle dig at the Communists' pro-Soviet stance, ''I reply that everyone has the friends he wants.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/26/world/mitterrand-views-peace-in-chad-as-aim-but-combat-as-possibility.html": {"writer_name": "John Darnton", "pub_date": "1983-08-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1092, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MITTERRAND VIEWS PEACE IN CHAD AS AIM BUT COMBAT AS POSSIBILITY", "print_headline": "MITTERRAND VIEWS PEACE IN CHAD AS AIM BUT COMBAT AS POSSIBILITY", "body_text": " **********President Francois Mitterrand said today that French troops had been sent to Chad to ''bring peace,'' but he warned that, if threatened by Libyan-backed rebels, they could go on the offensive. **********The President's statements, his first full exposition of policy since fighting flared in the Central African nation two months ago, appeared as a question- and-answer interview in Le Monde. The questions were not submitted in advance, but the text was personally reviewed by the President before its publication this afternoon. **********The interview came amid a growing public debate over France's military buildup in Chad. It also came as Paris pressed a diplomatic effort designed to avoid a clash with Libya. The commitment by France is rapidly becoming larger than any in Africa since the Algerian war two decades ago. **********President Mitterrand sought to justify both the timing and the rationale behind the deployment. He also stressed the need for a negotiated solution among the Chadian antagonists themselves and seemed to want to put to rest a diplomatic dispute with the United States over the sending of American Awacs surveillance aircraft to the Sudan, which borders on Chad.   Of Partition and Federation Asserting that France's role was to safeguard Chad's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, Mr. Mitterrand ruled out eventual partition of the country, a situation that now exists on the battlefield. Such a solution, he said, could plunge all of Africa, with its fragile boundaries and ethnic rivalies, into ''a tragic period of general instability.'' **********But in what could have been a significant hint of a possible negotiating objective, he observed that ''federation often conforms more to reality than a formal unity that is always broken.'' **********The idea of a federation in Chad between the desolate, Moslem north and the somewhat more productive, Christian and animist south has been broached in 17 years of civil war. But it is anathema to the Government headed by Hissen Habre, a northerner. The thrust of Mr. Mitterrand's statements appeared directed toward the Libyan regime of Col. Muammar el- Qaddafi, which is sustaining the rebels against Mr. Habre's forces. **********It was a message balanced between prudence and firmness. The President recalled Libya's concern for a secure southern boundary, but he spoke in no uncertain terms of ''Libyan aggression,'' which he said is what brought the French intervention.   'Our Troops Will Riposte' **********He made it clear that France would not tolerate any attempt by the anti- Habre forces, led by former President Goukouni Oueddei, to move beyond their northern stronghold. **********''If threatened, our troops will riposte,'' he said, ''and in order to defend themselves better, they will not limit their response to defensive measures alone.'' **********He also noted that French soldiers, which have been estimated at 3,000 and are backed up by eight war planes stationed in the capital, Ndjamena, are now in a position to react ''militarily and quickly to a new offensive.'' **********Chadian officials, pressing France to deepen its commitment, have reported Libyan tanks moving south from Faya- Largeau, the northern oasis seized by the rebels more than two weeks ago. **********By implication Mr. Mitterrand rejected any prospect that the French would help the Habre forces retake the north. ''Our troops cannot be regarded as an additional force submitted to a strategy in whose determination they have not taken part,'' he said. ''France will not allow itself to be led where it does not want to go.''  Hernu Is on His Way to Chad **********In discussing the need for talks involving Mr. Goukouni and Mr. Habre, an idea that both Chadians have ignored, he noted that it was time for a ''deep conversion'' with Mr. Habre. **********As the interview appeared, it was announced that the French Defense Minister, Charles Hernu, was on his way to Chad ''to inspect the French forces.'' It was thought highly likely that Mr. Hernu would meet with Mr. Habre to impress upon him the deterrent intent behind the French military presence and the urgency of agreeing to negotiate. **********Mr. Mitterrand insisted that it was the presence of the French forces, who arrived after Faya-Largeau fell, that brought about a halt in the fighting. The lull has now lasted 12 days. **********He devoted considerable attention to fending off domestic criticism that he had not acted soon enough. There had to be clear-cut evidence of external aggression, he said, so the world could see that ''the will for war and domination was that of Libya and not of France.'' He also argued that the delay made military sense, allowing the French to deploy their forces in a defensible position and with adequare supply lines. **********Mr. Mitterrand, who had criticized intervention by previous governments and told African leaders in May of last year that France would no longer play the role of ''a gendarme'' in Africa, insisted that the deployment was not ''neo-colonialist.'' Rather, he said, it was a question of coming to the aid of a menaced and long-standing ally, a former colony.   The Dispute With Washington **********He next turned to the dispute with Washington over his claims that the Americans applied undue pressure to intervene and sent the Awacs planes without informing France. **********Mr. Mitterrand repeated his assertion that France had not asked for the planes. He said there had been general talks on Chad - the Americans were ''very concerned with us,'' he said - and he confirmed reports that he had met with Vernon A. Walters, a former Deputy Director of Central Intelligence. The reports said this occurred on Aug. 6 and 7, the days the planes were sent. **********He added that France was grateful for information on Libyan movements supplied by the Americans. The planes have since been withdrawn and, as if to close the chapter, Mr. Mitterrand said: ''Things are back to normal.'' **********Chad Awaits Mitterrand Text **********NDJAMENA, Chad, Aug. 25 - A Government spokesman said today that Chad would wait for the full text of President Mitterrand's statements before reacting. **********In response to questions, however, the spokesman, Information Minister Mahamat Soumalia, appeared to express disappointment, saying France's interpretation of its military role in Chad remains ''too restrictive, it does not satisfy us or comply with our expectations.'' And he declined to comment on the visit by Defense Minister Hernu of France, who arrived here tonight. **********The Chadian Government has repeatedly urged France to take part directly in the fighting."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/16/business/advertising-people.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1983-02-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 106, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "People", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; People", "body_text": " *********** Len Dia promoted to senior vice president at Benton & Bowles. *********** Robert McCaffrey, a senior vice president of Sudler & Hennessey, a unit of Young & Rubicam, named to the new position of creative director-copy. *********** Louis B.

Kvitsinsky, the Soviet negotiator. **********At the time, the Soviet Union had about 250 SS-20's and 250 older SS-4's and SS-5's trained on Europe and almost 100 SS-20's aimed at China and Japan. The United States had no comparable missiles, but was planning to deploy 108 Pershing 2's and 116 launchers carring 464 cruise missiles. **********The understanding that Mr. Nitze and Mr. Kvitsinsky committed to paper called for limiting each side to 75 launchers. Counting three warheads for each Soviet SS-20 and four missiles for each American cruise-missile launcher, that gave the United States 300 warheads as against 225 for the Russians. **********As compensation, the United States was to forgo deployment of all Pershing 2's and be restricted to the torpedo-shaped cruise missiles, which fly close to the ground and take two to three hours to reach Soviet territory from European locations. **********The number of Soviet SS-20's aimed at Asia was to be frozen at 90, meaning Moscow could not complete nine sites under construction. By the same token, 162 missiles and aircraft from the independent French and British forces were not to be included in the agreement. A Mostly Positive Reaction **********The understanding also called for limiting each side to 150 mediumrange nuclear-capable aircraft. This included Badgers, Blinders and Backfires for the Soviet Union and F-111's and FB-111's for the United States. **********The understanding was disclosed to only a few top officials in Washington, where the initial reaction was said to be mostly positive. But William P. Clark, the national security adviser, sent a note to Mr. Shultz criticizing Mr. Nitze's deviation from instructions. **********Mr. Shultz was described as upset about a lack of discipline, but felt that the private discussions should be continued. A number of his subordinates were said to be angry that anything had been done without consultation with European allies, as clearly required by past agreements. Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger, officials said, posed no objections. **********The first to raise strong reservations was Army Chief of Staff Edward C. Meyer, over concern about the elimination of the Pershing 2, an Army project. Completely Unacceptable **********Administration officials said President Reagan then directed the State Department to inform the Russians that the Nitze understanding was inadequate, particularly because of the ban on Pershings. It is not clear whether this directive was carried out at all, or before Mr. Shultz met with Mr. Gromyko at the United Nations on Sept. 28. **********At that meeting, Mr. Shultz was said to have stated that while the two sides had not agreed on how to advance the negotiations through private talks between Mr. Nitze and Mr. Kvitsinsky, this way of doing business outside the formal negotiating sessions was very important and should be pursued. Mr. Gromyko was said to have merely nodded, saying nothing. **********Two days later, on Sept. 30, the negotiations resumed in Geneva, and Mr. Kvitsinsky told Mr. Nitze that the understanding was completely unacceptable, that Moscow's initial and public position stood. He said that French and British forces had to be included in any agreement and that stricter limits had to be placed on the growth of all North Atlantic Treaty Organization nuclear-capable aircraft. **********Mr. Nitze's instructions called on him to respond that the United States stood firmly behind Mr. Reagan's zero-zero proposal, but that private explorations for agreement should continue. As it soon turned out, however, neither Mr. Kvitsinsky nor Mr. Nitze had anything new to say. **********In the harder line that followed, some officials said that Soviet negotiators in the companion strategic arms talks threatened last fall to walk out if the United States deployed any missiles. The threat has not been repeated, and American negotiators have never taken it seriously. **********In November, the Russians again changed their tone and publicly offered to limit their European-aimed missiles to French and British levels. Washington rejected that plan."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/09/business/long-term-bond-prices-off-sharply.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1983-12-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 733, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LONG-TERM BOND PRICES OFF SHARPLY", "print_headline": "LONG-TERM BOND PRICES OFF SHARPLY", "body_text": " **********Prices of long-term bonds fell sharply yesterday and interest rates rose, reflecting a growing conviction that chances have faded for a near- term decline in rates. **********By late in the day, the bellwether 12 percent Treasury bond due in 2013 was offered at 100 5/8, its lowest price since early November. The decline of about 7/8 point in the price of the Treasury bond, which is a benchmark for a wide variety of other interest rates ranging from corporate bonds to home mortgages, raised its yield to 11.92 percent from 11.80 percent. A week ago, the 12 percent issue was offered at 102 22/32 to yield 11.66 percent. **********The rise in interest rates also depressed the stock market, where the Dow Jones industrial average fell 11.89 points, to 1,261.89. (Page D10.) **********''There has been a less-than-subtle shift in psychology lately,'' said a senior offical at one Government securities dealer. Trading volume in the Treasury market remained light, he said, except for a modest increase in selling by institutional accounts. **********Samuel Thorne, a senior vice president at Scudder, Stevens & Clark, an investment advisory firm and manager of mutual funds, said that prices could easily continue to decline in the near term because of unwanted inventory in the hands of securities dealers, the absence of investor demand and ''the totally ridiculous Treasury refunding in the last week of the year.'' **********The stronger-than-anticipated rate of economic growth this year continues to be the most widely cited reason for recent increases in interest rates. Investors in fixed-income securities have apparently concluded that this strength will hasten the day when corporate credit demands expand strongly and put more upward pressure on interest rates. **********Stronger Economy Cited **********''The economy is stronger than we expected,'' said Elwood Haake, a vice president and manager of fixed-income portfolios at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. ''We still expect a few quarters of subnormal growth next year, but it is hard to expect evidence of that developing during the next few weeks or months.'' **********When the economy slows, Mr. Haake and many other analysts still expect that short-term and long-term interest rates will fall. ''The decline will just be from a higher level than expected,'' the Chicago banker said. **********Jeffrey Parker, president of the Technical Data Corporation in Boston, said that the recent pattern of price changes - which are closely followed by many speculators and traders - ''indicate that prices are headed lower.'' When the 12 percent Treasury bond fell below 100 3/4, he said the chart formations pointed more clearly toward lower prices and higher yields. **********In recent days, several analysts have estimated that yields will rise prior to the Treasury's auctions of four- , seven- and 20-year securities in the holiday-shortened week beginning Dec. 26. Because many potential buyers will be absent or noncommittal until after their January investment strategy meetings, securities dealers will set lower prices and higher yields at the auctions to protect themselves from loss. **********If prices continue to decline, analysts at Merrill Lynch concluded in commentary published yesterday that ''at the end of this month'' Treasury issues ''should be attractively priced and provide a good opportunity for investors.'' **********''Sure we are going to buy long bonds again someday,'' Mr. Thorne said. ''Right now, a 12 1/2 percent to 13 percent yield seems like a reasonable risk,'' as long as there are no signs of a significantly weaker economy. **********Short-Term Rates Rise **********Short-term interest rates also increased yesterday, though there was no indication of any change in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. **********''Whether or not the Fed is tightening, or Paul Volcker is smiling or frowning does not have a heck of a lot to do with the outlook for the market over the next few weeks,'' Mr. Thorne said. **********In the money markets, rates on Treasury bills rose by almost a tenth of a percentage point in some cases, with the three-month issue bid at 9.03 percent late in the day, up from 8.94 percent. **********The sharpest increases in interest rates was in large negotiable bank certificates of deposit in denominations of $1 million and more, where yields rose as much as a quarter of a percentage point as many New York City banks have been active issuers. **********In the last week, Treasury bill rates have increased only about a fifth of a percentage point, but the yields on three- and six-month certificates have increased nearly half a percentage point, to 9.75 percent and 10.05 percent, respectively."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/07/world/around-the-world-south-korean-president-shuffles-his-cabinet.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-07-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 145, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "South Korean President Shuffles His Cabinet", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; South Korean President Shuffles His Cabinet", "body_text": " **********President Chun Doo Hwan replaced the Deputy Prime Minister and the Interior Minister, one of his closest associates, in a Cabinet shuffle announced today. **********A presidential spokesman said Deputy Prime Minister Kim Joon Sung, who also was Economic Planning Minister, was succeeded by former Commerce Minister Suh Suk Joon, an American-educated economist. **********Interior Minister Roh Tae Woo, a former army general, was replaced by former Defense Minister Choo Young Bock.

''Discord within the P.L.O. can and must be overcome by political means, through a dialogue.'' Message to Arafat Unpublished **********When Mr. Arafat first came under challenge from within his Fatah organization and the P.L.O. demanding a more militant leadership, Moscow reportedly sent him a message of support. But in contrast with the message sent while he was warring with Israel last summer, this message was never published. **********Since Mr. Arafat quarrelled recently with Syria, the Soviet leadership has kept aloof from the struggle.  Western analysts here presumed that Mr. Arafat's visit had been called off by Moscow, and the tone of the message to Mr. Kaddoumi further strengthened speculation that the Kremlin had decided against supporting the P.L.O. leader, especially while he is at odds with Syria, Moscow's chief ally in the Middle East. **********Mr. Arafat's visit to Moscow would inevitably have included appeals for help in his dispute with President Hafez al-Assad, the Syrian leader. The analysts believe the rift in the Palestine Liberation Organization has posed serious problems for the Soviet Union's longstanding hopes for a major role in an Arab-Israeli settlement. Moscow Fears Split in P.L.O. **********Moscow's hopes have been based on its costly support of Syria and the P.L.O. A division in the Palestinian movement that might put half the P.L.O. under the control of Damascus and the other half possibly closer to Jordan could, in the view of diplomats, seriously weaken Moscow's position. **********Thus, the analysts believe Moscow has adopted a neutral stance for the moment, coupled with strong demands for a quick resolution of the conflict. **********Most diplomats suspect Moscow would settle for a new collective leadership in the P.L.O. rather than have the movement split.  Moscow's stance on the P.L.O. dispute is in sharp contrast with its pronouncements on the civil war in Chad.  In that war, the Kremlin has openly leaned toward the insurgents backed by Libya, describing Goukouni Oueddei, the rebel leader, as ''Chairman of the Transitional National Unity Government,'' and Hissen Habre, President of Chad, as ''the present head of the Ndjamena Government.'' **********Press reports on the strife have publicized advances by the rebel forces and have repeatedly criticized France and Zaire for helping the Government side. **********Yesterday, Tass approvingly quoted the French Communist newspaper L'Humanite that any foreign intervention would lead to ''further escalation and internationalization of the conflict.'' **********But Moscow has given no sign that it is prepared to go directly to the aid of the rebels."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/26/business/company-news-central-trust.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 97, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Central Trust", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Central Trust", "body_text": " **********The Central Trust Company of Toronto, which last month agreed to take over management of certain assets of the Crown Trust Company, which had been seized by the Ontario government, said it expected to make a small profit as a result of the transfer.

He said that, as long as the withdrawal was the first phase of a total pullout, he thought it could help break the impasse created by Syria's refusal to withdraw. **********Mr. Reagan added that Israel had assured the United States that they viewed the partial withdrawal as part of an eventual removal of all these forces from Lebanon.

Crocker, head of the Bureau of African Affairs and the key American policy maker for the region, said military aid now represents about 20 percent of overall American aid to sub-Saharan African countries. **********The bulk of American aid, he said in an interview this week, is designed to alleviate the critical balance-of-payments deficits in most African countries, many of which are facing their worst economic crisis in 40 years. The crisis was fostered by drought, declining food production, rising birth rates and paltry foreign exchange earnings from such traditional export products as cocoa and rubber, the prices of which are depressed on the world market. **********Broader Pretoria Ties Sought **********Key pro-Western countries, such as the Sudan, Kenya, Somalia and Liberia, received the bulk of American aid.  At the same time, the Administration has made efforts to broaden ties with South Africa in what Administration officials acknowledge is a significant break from Carter Administration policies, which they describe as having had a ''civil rights tone'' shaped somewhat by Andrew Young, the former chief delegate to the United Nations. **********Administration officials acknowledge that they have been stung by strong domestic criticism of their policy, especially from blacks who say the United States is acting in complicity with South Africa. **********Administration officials said it was partly in an attempt to blunt such charges that Under Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger, the third-ranking official in the State Department, made a speech on June 24 criticizing the Pretoria Government. In the speech he characterized South Africa's official policy of racial discrimination as ''morally wrong.'' **********The Administration is actively lobbying against a bill sponsored by opponents of the Administration's Africa policies that is to come up in the House of Representatives in mid-July. It would bar the United States from voting in favor of a $1 billion International Monetary Fund loan to South Africa. **********In the interview, Mr. Crocker said there had been ''a kind of sterile discussion'' in the past about the poverty, hunger and corruption that afflict some African countries. **********''We have made it clear that the reasons for Africa's economic malaise are, to put it mildly, not only the external recession and low commodity prices, but a whole generation of economic mismanagement,'' said Mr. Crocker. **********Administration officials say the Soviet Union, Cuba and Libya are working to destabilize several African nations. The Soviet Union, these officials say, provides 60 to 70 percent of the arms used in Africa. There are an estimated 30,000 Cuban troops and civilians in Angola, and 13,000 Cuban military personnel in Ethiopia. Libya Backs Chad Rebels **********Libya supports rebel forces in Chad, and Pentagon officials say the objective seems to be to put pressure on the Sudan and ultimately on southern Egypt. **********To counter such threats, the Administration has sharply increased military aid to African nations. In 1980 military aid to the nations of sub-Saharan Africa totaled $78 million, compared to an Administration request for $201 million in security assistance in 1984. Economic aid also climbed, but not as steeply: from $694 million to $965 million in the same period. **********In addition, the United States, according to Administration officials, has been supportive of such recently independent leftist regimes as that of Zimbabwe, to which economic aid tripled, from $24.7 million in 1980 to a proposed $75 million in 1984. Relations have been strengthened with the Marxist Government of Mozambique, with an exchange of ambassadors set to take place soon. **********By contrast, the socialist Government of President Julius K.  Nyerere of Tanzania, which has been plagued by unrest and economic disarray, has met chilly treatment from the Reagan Administration.  Economic aid to Tanzania fell from $28 million in 1980 to a proposed $14 million in 1984. Policy on Southern Africa **********Although groups such as the 20-member Congressional Black Caucus have criticized the ''militarization of our approach to African assistance,'' as its chairman, Representative Julian C. Dixon, Democrat of California, said recently, it is the issue of Administration policy in southern Africa that has stirred the sharpest verbal attacks. **********Administration policy to the region is based on what Mr. Crocker calls ''constructive engagement.'' This essentially means refraining from continuous public criticism of the Pretoria Government and seeking closer diplomatic ties with South Africa. It is based on the premise that the establishment of a more trusting American relationship with South Africa would spur it to undertake internal changes, halt its support and military harassment of nearby states and end its occupation of neighboring Namibia. **********Under the Reagan Administration, the United States has increased the number of military attaches in South Africa, provided visas to ranking South African military and intelligence personnel, permitted the sale of a computer that has a potential dual use for nuclearrelated equipment and loosened controls on some exports, including electric-shock batons, to the South African military and police. **********It also used its veto to block United Nations Security Council resolutions condemning South Africa and allowed American companies to broker nuclear fuel deliveries to South Africa although it refuses to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. **********It is Namibia, also known as South-West Africa, that has dominated African policy in the last year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/24/business/celeron-purchase.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-06-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 84, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Celeron Purchase", "print_headline": "Celeron Purchase", "body_text": " **********The Celeron Corporation unit of the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company said it had acquired the All American Pipeline Company, taking over that company's plans to build a 1,200-mile oil pipeline. **********Terms of the purchase were not available.

After years of earnings growth, profits at the nation's secondlargest soft drink bottler - after the Coca-Cola Company - fell 25 percent in 1982 and 42 percent in the first quarter of 1983. Fraud uncovered in its international bottling division in 1982 cost Pepsico millions of dollars and substantial embarrassment. Earlier this month, the company lost two top executives, each of whom was considered among the best in his field. **********Pepsico is tight-lipped about the setbacks, adding to the impression of a company embattled. Its chairman and chief executive officer, Donald M. Kendall, declined to be interviewed, although the company responded to written queries. **********Analysts Like New Products **********Despite Pepsico's defensive posture, most industry analysts said the company is coping with its problems and shows signs of surmounting them. Some are particularly impressed by Pepsico's management skills and a number of its recent product introductions, especially Pepsi Free, the cola drink that has won more than 50 percent of the caffeine-free market in the two years since its introduction. **********Pepsico also recently approved a change in its Pepsi-Cola softdrink formula - switching from sucrose to the less-expensive fructose sweetener -that is expected to provide savings and allow the beverage to be more competitive. **********''Pepsico may be having more troubles right now than Coca-Cola,'' said John C. Maxwell, an analyst for Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb Inc., ''but Pepsico management is top-notch and I'm optimistic that they can emerge from their problems.'' **********''The company is in a regrouping mold,'' said Lawrence Adelman, senior vice president and analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds. ''The key problems have been the overstatement of the foreign results, which hurt the 1982 earnings, and the massive peso devaluation in Mexico, which hurt Pepsico's sales.'' **********He added: ''Mexico is Pepsico's key foreign profit center for both soft drinks and snacks. But I think they will progressively come out of it.'' **********Mr. Adelman said that he foresees a 15 percent drop in earnings per share in the second quarter, a flat third quarter but ''a significant improvement in the fourth quarter, which will give them a good 1984.'' Frito-Lay Fraud **********In 1982, two years after it uncovered fraud in its Frito-Lay division, Pepsico discovered falsified profits reports in its Mexico and Philippines bottling subsidiaries. This forced the company to reduce previously reported net income by $92.1 million for the period Jan.1, 1978, through Sept.4, 1982. Besides dismissing four overseas senior managers, the company said in its 1982 annual report that it had adopted more centralized financial controls to prevent a recurrence. **********The profit decline and the bad publicity generated by the overseas accounting irregularities has clearly hurt Pepsico's stock. After reaching a 1982 high of $52 in the fourth quarter, it has since fallen to the mid-30's, closing at $36.125 on Friday in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. **********The biggest problem faced by Pepsico, along with the other soft drink makers, is the decline in the growth rate of beverage sales.  Last year, the increase in domestic unit sales for the industry was only 2 percent, down from 2.5 percent in 1981 and 3.1 percent in 1980. And foreign unit sales were flat in 1982, after growing at a rate of 3 percent in 1981 and 6 percent in 1982. **********The importance of beverage sales to Coca-Cola and Pepsico is clear. Coca-Cola derives 73 percent of its sales and 85 percent of profits from soft drinks. Pepsico's soft drink operations, its major revenue producer, account for 39 percent of sales and 31 percent of earnings, second only to the Frito-Lay division's contribution. **********Pepsico's net income fell 25 percent, to $224.3 million, in 1982, while sales rose 7 percent, to $7.5 billion. Coca-Cola's revenue rose 6 percent, to $6.25 billion, while its net increased 15 percent, to $512 million. Intensified Cola War **********The tougher market situation has led to an intensified war among the cola makers, with new soft drink products emerging, accompanied by multimillion-dollar promotion budgets. Coke and Pepsi have matched each other on a tit-for-tat basis since 1963 with various lowcalorie and caffeine-free drinks - and are working on yet newer variations. All this is being accompanied by marketing changes and efforts to strengthen both company-owned and franchise bottling systems. **********''In the soft drink industry, more has happened in the last 15 months than in the previous century,'' said Jesse Meyers, publisher of Beverage Digest, a newsletter in Greenwich, Conn. ''There have been new product introductions, new competition and many changes among the major players. But more seems to have happened at Pepsico's soft drink operations than elsewhere, so that the company is at the crossroads.'' **********The departures of two senior vice presidents, John Sculley, former head of the Pepsico's United States soft drink subsidiary, and Donald Smith, who headed up the food services subsidiary, came as a dramatic counterpoint to the lingering foreign scandal. While not involved in the scandal, both Mr. Sculley and Mr. Smith, analysts said, decided to pull up stakes because Pepsico's run of problems had removed some of the glow from their own futures at the company. **********Neither Mr. Sculley nor Mr. Smith could be reached for comment.  ''Sculley was the best man in the soft drink business and Don Smith is the best guy in the restaurant field,'' said Arthur Kirsch, an analyst for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ''Both were key players who could have succeeded Don Kendall.'' **********Industry watchers said Mr. Sculley will be sorely missed. Mr.  Meyers, for one, thinks that Mr. Sculley, who has become president of the Apple Computer Company, was ''the prime motivator, who sparked Pepsi into a hot No.2 contender.'' A Skilled Marketer **********A skilled marketer who obtained valuable shelf space for Pepsi-Cola in food stores and drew bottlers' loyalty, Mr. Sculley, 43 years old, is said to have wearied of the formality in Pepsico's international headquarters in Purchase, N.Y., and decided that he had ''done it all'' and should leave. He reportedly was also lured away by a $1 million bonus and a $1 million salary. **********Mr. Smith, 43, who became chief executive of Chart House Inc., a Louisiana restaurant concern and a leading Burger King franchisee, is widely considered to have been responsible for the major improvement in Pepsico's two fast-food chains, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. **********But Pepsico, while certainly unhappy about the two departures, took comfort in its staff-building efforts.  ''We have the management talent to plan and execute the strategies that surely will result in our sustained growth,'' Mr. Kendall said recently. ''When John Sculley left, we were able to accelerate a reorganization plan and fill several key positions entirely from within.''

This, in turn, has hurt our export- and import-competing industries and has led to huge trade and current-account deficits. These deficits have depressed the overall economy and were mainly responsible for the 1981-82 recession. **********There are serious flaws and misconceptions in this reasoning. In fact, the strong dollar has also had important positive effects, most notably in curbing inflation, which - in my view - outweigh the negative ones. **********As for the cause of the dollar's strength, the proposition that high or rising interest rates have been responsible is clearly contradicted by the experience of the past two years. **********In both 1981 and 1982, interest rates in the United States declined, but the dollar rose sharply. True, in the short term the dollar tends to strengthen when interest rates move up, and vice versa, but the movements have been highly asymmetrical. The dollar has tended to appreciate more than proportionately when interest rates have been rising and to decline less than proportionately when they have been trending downward. As a result, in the longer run interest rate and exchange rate trends have been moving in opposite directions. **********There are several reasons for this inverse relationship. **********First, it is not so much changes in interest rates but rather changes in interest rate differentials among various countries that determine exchange rates. Declines in American interest rates in 1981-82 were followed by declines in interest rates abroad, so these differentials remained largely constant. **********Second, a mirror image of the declining trend in United States interest rates over that period was the upturn in bond prices and, indirectly, the rally in the stock market, both attracting foreign capital here and thus, paradoxically, strengthening rather than depressing the dollar. **********Third, foreign capital has been flowing into the United States for political reasons, too, due to the greater political stability here. Fourth, the dollar's appreciation in some cases has reflected the weakness of other currencies rather than its own strength. And finally, the most important factor in the dollar's rise has been the spectacular decline in United States inflation, much greater than in most other countries. **********In short, as long as American inflation is under control and the political situation in the United States makes it a safe haven for foreign capital, the dollar will remain strong, no matter what happens to interest rates. Recent official intervention in exchange markets, aimed at resisting speculative upward pressures, is not likely to change much the dollar's position. **********CRITICS of the strong dollar hold the view that its appreciation has been harmful to the economy by hurting our export industries. There is no doubt that American exports have been on a declining trend over the past two to three years. However, this has not been so much due to the dollar's appreciation as to the prolonged worldwide recession, to the embargo on grain exports to the U.S.S.R. and to the retrenchment in several developing countries that are important markets for our products. **********The explanation lies in the structure of our exports, which have relatively low price elasticity. This is primarily due to their large capital goods component in high-technology products where price is not the most important determinant of demand. Also, in many lines of our agricultural exports the United States holds a dominant market position and is well able to fight foreign competition. Finally, one should not forget that about 20 percent of our exports go to Canada, and here the appreciation of our dollar versus the Canadian currency has been rather negligible. **********To be sure, many of our export industries have found their competitive positions deteriorating because of the rise in the dollar. But the macroeconomic extent of this deterioration has been much less than might have been theoretically expected. **********Even greater misconceptions prevail in assessing the impact of the rising current-account deficit on the overall economy. Many economists contend that this external deficit was the main cause of last year's decline in G.N.P. But this was mainly the result of the prevailing methodology of calculating the foreign balance in real terms, which leads to paradoxical distortions when there is a major shift in the terms of trade: The more favorable the terms of trade, the worse the foreign balance. **********Last year, largely due to the dollar's appreciation, our import prices declined while prices of our exports rose. But this favorable shift in the terms of trade resulted in depressing both the foreign balance and total G.N.P. in real terms. Official statistics for 1982 showed that the deterioration in the foreign balance (mainly due to the decline in export volume) was responsible for about 50 percent of the 1.9 percent decline in real G.N.P. But under a different methodology, taking into account the shift in the terms of trade, real G.N.P. would have shown a 1.2 percent decline and the impact of the foreign sector would have been only about 16 percent. **********While the negative effects of the strong dollar are being exaggerated, the positive ones tend to be overlooked. The most important positive consequence has been its contribution to curbing United States inflation. It is estimated that three to four percentage points of the total drop in the consumer price index can be attributed to the rise in the dollar's exchange rate. This has been achieved not only by the direct reduction of import prices, but also through a dampening influence on prices of domestically produced goods competing with imports. **********Moreover, the dollar's appreciation has had a strong effect on the overall improvement of the competitiveness of United States industry - it has forced both our export- and import- competing industries to cut costs to a larger extent than justified by cyclical conditions alone. In addition, the dollar's rise has had a beneficial effect on curbing inflation worldwide as exporters of products traded in dollars tended to reduce their prices not only because of weak demand, but also because they were exchanging their goods for an appreciating currency. Finally, industrial countries whose currencies depreciated vis- a-vis the dollar have gained competitive advantage in their exports; this tends to be often ignored by foreign leaders who criticize the dollar's rise. **********A strong currency is a mixed blessing for any country - it has its positive and negative effects. In my view, the dollar's strength has been, on balance, positive for the American economy and indirectly for the world economy as well. The Administration should resist pressure from foreign leaders to push the dollar down significantly. This would undermine confidence in the dollar, reverse the flow of foreign capital and reignite inflation. **********Mieczyslaw Karczmar is chief economist at the European American Bank in New York."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/06/business/japan-studies-beef-quotas.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-04-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 134, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Japan Studies Beef Quotas", "print_headline": "Japan Studies Beef Quotas", "body_text": " **********Japan's top agriculture official said today that his nation must reach a domestic consensus about expanding its quotas on beef and orange imports before resuming talks with the United States. **********Iwazo Kaneko, the Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, told Japanese reporters it could take two months for the ruling party and farm leaders to achieve such a consensus, the ministry said. **********Mike Mansfield, the United States Ambassador, met with Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe Monday and asked early resumption of the beef and orange talks.

He was in plenty of time for the evening television news shows, a Reagan Administration official noted privately with satisfaction, and he was escorted by some of President Reagan's ranking advisers. **********''This is the Prime Minister's show - I don't want to get involved,'' Langhorne A. Motley, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, declared at the fringe of the crowd as the Prime Minister articulated the Caribbean nations' fear of the Cuban troops on Grenada. **********The Prime Minister's appearance on the White House driveway, for which the press office several times invited coverage, served to raise the topic of regional fears well in advance of President Reagan's prime-time television address tonight. **********The Cuban Troop Rationale **********The concern that Cuba might try to extend its influence to more of the Caribbean nations was not mentioned by Mr. Reagan on Tuesday when he first announced reasons for the American invasion of Grenada; he spoke then of concern for American lives and restoring the rule of law on the island. **********But the Cuban troop rationale was subsequently broached and emphasized by other Administration officials in a 24-hour period that preceded the President's speech. **********Newspaper columnists were privately summoned to the White House Wednesday evening, for example, to hear a contention from national security officials that a major Cuban military buildup had been discovered ''in the knick of time'' by the invading Americans. **********As a result, Administration officials saw this point of the unfolding story rise to headline status the next morning. In the process, it seemed to de-emphasize the question of whether the Administration had made a serious enough effort peacefully to protect the American residents of the island before resorting to invasion.   Attention to Minor Details **********The officials also emphasized minor details - for example, White House briefings offered a euphemism for invasion, ''predawn vertical insertion.'' At times, President's spokesman, Larry Speakes, responded with plain, smiling silence when an explicit answer was repeatedly requested at public news briefings. He chose to remain silent for more than a day on the question of how the President had reacted to the widespread criticism of the invasion from Western allies. There were also belabored attempts at relating even the most basic chronology of events. **********It was only near the end of a long, often fractious round of press briefings Wednesday that the White House finally confirmed that it had rejected 11th- hour messages from the Grenadian Military Council purportedly guaranteeing the safety of Americans on the island. The Administration's response came six hours after President Reagan had approved the invasion and five hours before it began, the White House press office said. **********Such is historically the pattern for an Administration under critical stress. In the course of the Grenada invasion and the explosion Sunday of the Marine Corps headquarters in Lebanon, officials say, the Administration's emphasis was clearly on protecting the President from being indentified with negative developments.   Avoiding Graphic Aspects **********Administration officials acknowledge that there are limits to such a strategy, with the President finally having to address the nation tonight on both Grenada and Lebanon. But the President's critics, including Democrats frustrated by the White House's talent for public relations, say they feel that Mr. Reagan's White House is particularly attuned to avoiding the more graphic aspects of negative news. **********Through three days of the invasion, for example, the White House, while saying American casualties were low, did not offer any figures on the casualties that American troops on the island had inflicted on others, whether combatants or civilians. Similarly, a question that rival politicians have been asking is whether the President will visit Dover, Del., when the first bodies of marines killed in the Beirut explosion are returned from Lebanon. The White House said tonight that there were no such plans. **********At heated periods such as this, the Administration often tries to defend its position by tracking telephone calls from the public to the White House and dividing them by some means into ''positive'' and ''negative'' tallies as a measure of popular support for the President.  When the phone counts were released today, the President was rated ''positive'' by a ratio of 5 to 2 on Grenada and 2 to 1 on Lebanon. The Grenada invasion drew more than 7,000 calls, while the Lebanon disaster, with a far greater loss of life, drew little more than 1,500."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/20/business/finance-new-issues-65.2-million-issue-for-mobile-ala-65.2-million-mobile-ala.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-12-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 138, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": " $65.2 Million Issue For Mobile, Ala.

More than $2 billion a year in commissions are at stake. **********On Wednesday, American Airlines notified more than 20,000 travel agents that beginning Sept. 19 it will cut commissions to 9 percent from the industry standard of 10 percent. **********Almost immediately, United Airlines and Continental Air Lines said they were reviewing their commissions. A decision on whether to make a similar cut is expected today. Spokesmen for Eastern and Delta said they, too, were reviewing agency commissions. **********More confusion, however, surrounds the fees paid to the travel departments within large corporations. These in-house departments book flights for employees traveling on company business. Industry sources said that in order to win more business as the economy recovers, airlines have worked out secret payment agreements - usually involving rebates or discount fares - with travel agents and corporations. **********The sources also said that the corporations themselves have worked out secret deals with travel agents. In retaliation, some airlines have said they will reduce or eliminate corporate commissions, which have been 3 percent. They said that the secret deals make planning difficult and hurt both airlines and travel agents. **********But Delta and Eastern, fearful that they could lose business because of the deals, went the other way, and raised corporate fees to 10 percent.  Trend Is Feared **********There is concern among airlines that Delta and Eastern's reasoning will prevail, and promote an industrywide trend that could lead to hundreds of millions of dollars a year in additional costs for an industry just recovering from the recession. **********''There is no justification for increasing the level of compensation for in-plant travel offices that are not open to the public, do not have to meet personnel standards, and which do not do advertising or sales development,'' said Randall Malin, an executive vice president for marketing at USAir, which last week cut corporate commissions to 2 percent. **********The search to find the right corporate commission began about 10 days ago, when Eastern announced it had uncovered cases of competitors' paying 10 percent to corporate travel departments, instead of the normal 3 percent. Eastern said that to be competitive it had no choice but to increase its rate to 10 percent. **********Delta, based in Atlanta, quickly followed suit. But USAir, based in Washington, called the increases a ''dangerous precedent'' and said it would lower its commission to 2 percent. **********Early this week, United said it would eliminate its corporate travel department commission. Both Continental and American announced yesterday that they did the same. **********At stake in the rift over commissions is billions of dollars a year, not to mention thousands of jobs and some lucrative corporate contracts between companies and travel agencies that often extend for years. **********The Air Transport Association of America, a Washington-based airline cooperative that supervises airline ticketing, estimated that the roughly 22,000 travel agencies nationwide handled $22 billion in airline tickets last year and collected $2.1 billion in commissions. Commissions, the association said, are 6.1 percent of airlines' total cash operating costs. Only labor and fuel are more costly. **********Although revenue and commission data for the roughly 500 big companies that have their own travel departments are unavailable, travel experts estimated they book about 5 percent of the $22 billion in tickets. **********Officials said that some companies have agreed to pay corporate travel departments the higher commissions if the corporations will fly with them. **********In other cases, airline executives said, full-service agencies have been given permission, in effect, to kick back part of their commission in return for promised business. **********And in other cases, they said, travel agencies and corporate travel departments have conspired against airlines in rebate schemes, agreeing to have the agency buy the ticket and earn a 10 percent commission. The agency and company then split the commission. 'Carpetbagger Agents' **********''There have been numerous case of carpetbagger agents going inside companies and setting up deals, stealing business from full-service travel agents and in some cases funneling commissions back to corporations,'' said Charles J. Kreinar, director of sales planning at USAir. ''Individuals doing this are cornering the corporate market. It is setting a dangerous precedent because it is triggering additional rebates and hurting full- service agents.'' **********Travel agent commissions have long been a politically charged issue. Last year agents protested when the Civil Aeronautics Board board ruled that they could not be the exclusive issuers of airline tickets. One effect of that ruling was that corporations, for the first time, could issue tickets without any support from agents. Traditionally, corporations have relied on agents for ticket validation. **********The travel agents, however, form the backbone of the airline distribution system, booking roughly two- thirds of all tickets sold. Some industry analysts said, therefore, that corporate commissions are being cut to appease regular agents."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/04/business/no-headline-017607.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-11-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 107, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "No Headline", "print_headline": "No Headline", "body_text": " **********Lehman Loses Merger Officer **********Eric J.

His opposite, the conservative saver who for years watched his nest egg being nibbled away by inflation, suddenly is a winner. There are other losers, too: poor people, small businesses and homeowners. And there are many winners: travelers, money market funds and people seeking greater convenience. **********The tables have been turned by the many ways that banking has been deregulated, with many usury laws eliminated and most Federal restraints removed on what commercial banks and savings institutions may pay on small deposits. Although deregulation is far from complete, it already has affected virtually everyone. **********As a result of deregulation of interest rates, individuals and small businesses have received an estimated $40 billion more than they would have earned from ordinary passbook savings accounts, on which banks were not allowed to pay more than 5 1/4 percent and thrift 5 1/2 percent. This has sharply increased the institutions' cost of funds. **********Small bankers complain that rate deregulation has come so fast that adjusting to it is difficult.  ''A lot of banks were hurt because, slam-bang, $400 billion moved out of low-yielding accounts in one year,'' said Kenneth Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent Bankers Association, which represents small banks. **********Most bigger banks, however, seek broader powers. They want to enter the insurance business and underwrite tax-exempt bonds and even corporate securities. Savings banks and savings and loan associations have already been allowed to perform many new services, such as accepting making commercial loans. **********The services that commercial banks may offer have not been expanded substantially, but they have moved into some fields - such as stock brokerage - that they avoided in the past. **********Here is a tally of who has won and lost so far: **********The Losers **********SMALL BUSINESSES. Because banks now must pay higher interest rates on consumer deposits, they have increased the interest rates they charge on loans. In the past, many local businesses and farmers had been insulated from rising interest rates in the general economy because their banks could recycle low-cost savings deposits. **********LOW-BALANCE DEPOSITORS. The cost of most bank services has risen sharply. For individuals with large balances, the increased interest they get offsets the higher fees and interest rates that banks are charging. But for people with relatively low balances, the increases in bank charges has been greater than the increase in interest earned. They may represent as much as four-fifths of the population.  POOR PEOPLE. The poorest people are faring the worst. Many, if not most, banks have imposed monthly or quarterly fees on savings accounts with small balances. For example, the Dime Savings Bank of New York charges $1 a month on any passbook savings account with less than $500. So a family with $100 in such an account would wind up the year with only $88 of principal. The reason for the imposition of this fee, and sharp increases in many other fees, such as for money orders, is to offset the increased costs of consumer deposits. **********HOME BUYERS. Partly as a result of deregulation, it has become far more expensive, and more risky, to buy a home. Without assurance of low-cost money, financial institutions have become less and less willing to make long-term, fixed-rate mortgages. Instead, they are asking home buyers to accept floating-rate mortgages or to pay premiums for fixed- rate loans. Even though low-cost deposits have now all but disappeared, banks still must support their high-overhead branch networks, which were established to attract such deposits. **********AGGRESSIVE BANKS. Some economists argue that the higher cost of deposits has prompted many banks to make riskier loans to earn higher returns. If too many of those loans turn sour, some banks could end up with severe problems. **********OLD-LINE INDUSTRIES. As banks enter new fields, such as stock brokerage, they pose new competition for companies that traditionally have been in that area. And banks often have the important advantage of being able to raise money more cheaply in the national money markets. **********BANK EMPLOYEES. The higher cost of running a bank has forced most banks to cut costs and streamline their businesses. As a result, banks across the country have been reducing their staffs. **********The Winners **********HIGH-BALANCE DEPOSITORS. The most dramatic result so far of financial deregulation has been the higher rates of interest available to individuals and small businesses. **********MONEY FUNDS. Money market mutual funds, operated by securities firms and never subject to Government interest restraints, gave the public an alternative to the regulated banks. Because these money funds were draining hundreds of billions of dollars from the banking system, the banking industry and its regulators were forced to deregulate interest rates far more quickly than they preferred. **********BUYERS OF FINANCIAL SERVICES. As more institutions are allowed to offer a broader range of services, increased competition should prove a boon to consumers. In some areas, this already has driven interest rates on deposits higher. In addition, the entry of banks into the discount brokerage business has made it easier for individuals to shop for lower-cost brokerage services. **********CONVENIENCE SEEKERS. Deregulation can make banking more convenient by making it possible for individuals to do all their financial shopping at one ''store.'' And as deregulation proceeds, consumers may be able sit in their homes and shop for specific services across the nation via electronics. **********BANK EMPLOYEES. Although deregulation is displacing many workers from such routine jobs as tellers, it is also opening more interesting jobs. Many employees are getting an opportunity to develop more challenging skills, involving such technologies as automation and communications. **********TRAVELERS. A growing number of states, such as those in New England, have passed laws permitting regional interestate banking. In response, banks in one state have been buying banks in other states. Thus, a customer of a bank in, say, Boston, would be able to do business with affiliated banks throughout New England."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/21/world/300-tamils-to-be-repatriated-to-escape-sri-lanka-violence.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-08-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 83, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "300 Tamils to Be Repatriated To Escape Sri Lanka Violence", "print_headline": "300 Tamils to Be Repatriated To Escape Sri Lanka Violence", "body_text": " **********About 300 people from Sri Lanka of Indian origin, descendants of people who came to the island more than a hundred years ago, are to be repatriated to India because of recent ethnic violence, an Indian diplomat said today. **********The diplomat, High Commissioner S.

(Page A9.) Gemayel Seeks U.S. Backing **********When Mr. Gemayel arrived here on Wednesday, his aides said he needed American help to persuade Israel to alter the terms of its agreement of May 17 with Lebanon on the terms for an Israeli troop withdrawal in conjunction with a Syrian withdrawal. **********Syria and its supporters in Lebanon have called for abrogation or substantial revision of the agreement. Israel has refused to alter it and today Mr. Reagan affirmed his commitment to the accord as it stands. **********Mr. Gemayel said after meeting with Mr. Reagan that they were exploring ''going beyond the letter of the law to set up the most appropriate mechanism and conditions for the achievement of our common interests and policy objectives.'' This was a day with little optimism shown by Americans and Lebanese. The senior American official said in a briefing, ''There is a long way to go and both sides approach the situation without euphoria.'' The United States, he said, does not have ''a grand plan, a magical wand that will be waved to get the May 17 agreement implemented.'' **********''There has to be a series of steps,'' he added, ''some ways worked out, a major part of which is going to be the demonstration by the Lebanese Government that it has confidence in itself, the confidence of its people and of its army, to start moving into the unoccupied areas and to the occupied areas of the country.'' **********The unoccupied areas are the Shuf Mountains southeast of Beirut, where the Lebanese Army clashed in September with the Druse inhabitants. The reference to the occupied areas was to Israeli-occupied southern Lebanon. **********The senior official said that, as a result of talks here with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel, the Israelis were ready to discuss giving the Lebanese some responsibility in the south. **********The United States and Israel agreed, one American official said, that the Gemayel Government was too passive and had not paid enough attention to the complaints of the opposition. **********The Druse and Shiite Moslem factions are under Syrian influence, and the official said that, if the Gemayel Government were to make an effort to offer them a significant role, it would be a test of whether Syria was interested in ''settling for half a loaf'' in Lebanon or wanted simply ''the whole loaf.'' **********Lebanese unity talks in Geneva in early November ended with the decision that President Gemayel should visit various countries to seek alterations in the Israeli withdrawal agreement, which is opposed by Syria because it gives certain concessions to Israel in return for withdrawal. **********But Mr. Reagan said today after his meeting with Mr. Gemayel: **********''We stand by the May 17 agreement as the best and most viable basis for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon.'' **********Without mentioning Syria, he added, ''And once again, I appeal to the other external forces to leave Lebanon.'' **********Addressing Mr. Gemayel on the subject of Lebanese unity, Mr. Reagan said: **********''Your efforts to broaden the base of your Government, bringing in Lebanon's many communities, will do much to rebuild a stable and prosperous Lebanon. It will do much to restore confidence in the future. It will do much to stop the loss of so many innocent lives.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/19/business/eastern-bloc-losing-markets.html": {"writer_name": "John Tagliabue", "pub_date": "1983-09-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 677, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EASTERN BLOC LOSING MARKETS", "print_headline": "EASTERN BLOC LOSING MARKETS", "body_text": " **********Eastern European nations, badly in need of export revenue to repay their $73.5 billion debt, are losing the battle for markets in industrialized Western nations to aggressive competitors from the developing nations of Asia and Latin America, according to experts attending a conference here on East-West economic ties. **********The participants agreed that only a revival of exports to Western countries could earn the Eastern bloc the hard, or convertible, currency it needs to repay even part of its debt. And the consensus was that prospects for such growth remained gloomy. **********Some representatives, mainly from Eastern bloc countries, said repayment of the debt is now secondary to the revival of the region's trade necessary for a full-scale recovery of the world economy. **********'The Main Problem' **********''The main problem,'' said Jozef Pajestka, director of the Institute of Economic Science at the Polish Academy of Sciences, ''is that the indebted nations cannot repay their debts even if they starve themselves to death.'' **********Mr. Pajestka disclosed the results of a study by Polish economists showing that a moratorium on repayment of Poland's foreign debt until 1990 would increase the amount it owes the West to $61 billion from about $27 billion today. **********With annual export earnings projected to increase to about $8 billion, the study's authors said repayment of what Poland owes would be virtually impossible. **********Asked whether Poland considered refusing repayment, to use export earnings to pay for imports of raw materials and semi-finished products its industry badly needs, Mr. Pajestka replied, ''Whoever refuses payment first will be punished severely to set an example. No, we will go on paying, even if it's only a few cents of the interest.'' Relaxation Seen **********The two-day conference, sponsored by the Vienna Institute for Comparative Economic Studies, to mark the institute's 10th anniversary, ended Thursday. The meeting coincided with what some experts viewed as a gradual relaxation of the Reagan Administration's resistance to increased trade with the Eastern bloc. **********That is reflected in the recent visit of Secretary of Agriculture John R. Block to Moscow to conclude a grain agreement; the granting of an export license for construction equipment to the Caterpillar Tractor Company, and a decision not to invoke economic sanctions to punish Moscow for the downing of a Korean airliner. **********Despite Poland's huge payments difficulties, representatives from several countries in the East and West said a recovery of Eastern Europe's trade balance last year opened the prospects for a gradual resumption of bank credits. **********Noting that Eastern bloc countries achieved a hard currency trade surplus for the first time since the late 1960's, albeit by drastically reducing their imports, Professor Friedrich Levcik, the Institute's director, said the ''adjustment process is well under way.'' Down From $77.1 Billion **********Indeed, the surplus meant the Eastern bloc could cut its cumulative hard currency debt to $73.5 billion from a peak of $77.1 billion in 1981, Professor Levcik said, as four countries - the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, East Germany and Rumania - reduced their foreign debt burdens, and Hungary and Czechoslovakia halted the growth of theirs. **********Allen J. Lenz, director of the Commerce Department's Office of Trade and Investment Analysis, said a recent Commerce Department study of the relative competitiveness of Eastern bloc countries on Western industrialized markets showed that ''East European export performance has not been particularly impressive over the past several years.'' **********Mr. Lenz said calculations of the Eastern European share of the imports of 14 leading Western industrial countries from 1975 to 1981 showed that Eastern Europe's market share declined in 22 of 30 non-oil product groups, including clothing, organic chemicals and furniture. **********By contrast, 10 of the biggest debtor nations in the developing world, including Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Yugoslavia, expanded their market shares in 23 of the 30 product groups. Excluding Poland from the study, he said, did not markedly improve the picture. The Soviet Union, the group leader, demonstrated little skill in broadening its exports."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/20/business/about-real-estate-thrift-institutions-extending-role-as-equity-partners.html": {"writer_name": "Shawn Kennedy", "pub_date": "1983-07-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 744, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THRIFT INSTITUTIONS EXTENDING ROLE AS EQUITY PARTNERS", "print_headline": "ABOUT REAL ESTATE; THRIFT INSTITUTIONS EXTENDING ROLE AS EQUITY PARTNERS", "body_text": " **********As the state and Federal governments relax banking regulations, allowing thrift institutions to broaden their activities, the shift has had an indirect effect on real estate development. **********As mutual savings banks and savings and loan associations start to offer more attractive accounts to their depositors, as well as to increase the amount of their assets used for investment purposes, their growing involvement as equity partners in real estate development is getting a boost. **********''Equity participation in real estate projects by mutual savings banks is not an entirely new phenomenon,'' said Richard Pokriefke, a spokesman for the National Association of Mutual Savings Banks. But, he added, the new law ''has given mutual savings banks more freedom to look for ways to improve their earnings and capital positions.'' **********State banking regulations stipulate that savings banks may invest no more than 5 percent of their assets, while committing the other 95 percent to loans, especially mortgages. But a law passed in April allows the thrift institutions to invest an additional 3 percent through their service corporations. Thus, savings and loan associations have assumed a broader role as equity partners in development projects. **********''It is an investment area that is getting a lot of attention,'' said William Foley of the New York League of Savings Institutions.  He added that savings and loan associations had been involved in real estate equity participation since 1978 through the Thrift Association Service Corporation. **********While the league has no figures that show in detail how many savings banks had invested how much money as equity partners, Mr.  Foley said the range of this participation covered both commercial and residential projects in primary construction financing, rehabilitation and land development. **********In Mr. Foley's view, the lender is probably the most important link in the chain of events that make a real estate deal happen. But when they are restricted to being mortgage lenders, he said, banks are not receiving the maximum benefit for their part in the deal. ''Equity participation gives them a bigger piece of the pie,'' he said. **********The joint venture announced recently by the Bowery Savings Bank and the Georgetown Group, a privately held, diversified real estate consulting and investment company headed by Marshall Rose, illustrates the scope of the commitment being made by some thrift institutions as equity investors. Mr. Rose is the former president of the Arlen Realty and Development Corporation. **********In a 10-year partnership, the Bowery will provide the capital and the Georgetown Group will provide the real estate knowledge. The Bowery, through its BSB Venture Corporation, has committed $100 million for projects in the metropolitian area, primarily for the purchase of existing underutilized properties for development and resale. **********The venture is not Bowery's first as an equity participant in real estate projects, nor is it its first venture with the Georgetown Group, said Ellis T. Gravette, chairman of the Bowery. ''But through this partnership, we are expanding our activites in this area and we will be involved in not just one but a series of real estate ventures in an ongoing way for 10 years or more.'' **********Mr. Rose has acted as real estate development consultant for the Bowery in recent years. He was president of Arlen, the parent company of Korvette Stores, in the 1970's. **********The partnership's first investments in the city were the purchases of buildings in the Madison Square Park area at 141 Fifth Avenue, on the southeast corner of 21st Street, and at 880 Broadway, on the southeast corner of 19th Street. **********The Fifth Avenue building is a 13-story structure with about 110,000 feet of rentable space. The Broadway building, with six floors, has 90,000 square feet of rentable space. Both are loft buildings that will be upgraded for office use, Mr. Rose said, and designed to appeal particularly to advertising agencies, graphic artists and other businesses that need flexibility in space planning. **********''We are excited about the potential of the Madison Square area,'' he said. ''It is a cross between midtown and Soho, and the various new residential and commercial development projects have made it one of the most interesting new neighborhoods in Manhattan.'' **********The Bowery has also formed equity partnerships with real estate concerns in the Southwest and in the Southeast, Mr. Gravette said.

In all, five Greek ships took about 4,000 Arafat loyalists away from Tripoli, the second evacuation of P.L.O. fighters from Lebanon in 16 months. **********Mr. Arafat, who had been under siege for six weeks by Syrian-backed dissidents within the P.L.O., left without a farewell message to sympathizers or a final public appearance. He was heading for exile, probably in Tunisia, as a guerrilla chieftain without a battlefront for his followers to contest. **********Final Act in P.L.O. Rebellion **********Arab analysts said the evacuation of Mr. Arafat in effect represented the final act of a Syrian-backed rebellion that has stripped away his uncontested position as the leader of a united Palestinian movement. **********Volley after volley from automatic rifles and rocket-propelled grenades echoed and crashed around Tripoli's battered harbor as the Palestinian guerrillas and their Lebanese Moslem allies bade a traditional, cacophonous farewell to one another. The firing into the air went on for about two hours.  The volleys reached a climax at Mr. Arafat's departure and, in individual cases, when television cameras were focused on the guerrillas. But the Palestinian leader, still officially the chairman of the P.L.O., did not venture from a heavily guarded white station wagon until the huge stern door of the Odysseas Elytis had closed on him. **********Revolt Started in May **********The rebellion against Mr. Arafat started in May when middle-ranking officers in his organization, Al Fatah, the biggest of the Palestinian groups, accused him of favoritism in the appointment of field commanders and of other abuses. The rift followed serious political infighting within Palestinian ranks over what was seen as Mr. Arafat's preference for negotiation rather than armed struggle against Israel. **********As the revolt widened, Arafat loyalists were pushed back from strongholds in the Bekaa, Lebanon's eastern valley, and this port became their last redoubt. Today, it also became a symbol of Syrian and rebel success in forcing Mr. Arafat to abandon his last toehold in a country bordering Israel and to acknowledge his loss of control of the majority of Palestinian forces. **********The bulk of Mr. Arafat's once-loyal guerrillas are based in Syria and Lebanon and are believed to total 10,000, vastly outnumbering Mr. Arafat's men. **********Second Pullout in 16 Months **********Mr. Arafat's first pullout from Lebanon occurred 16 months ago, on Aug. 30, 1982, after the Israelis invaded the country and forced the P.L.O. leader to leave Beirut. He left then with a veneer of honor and victory painted over his departure, arguing that his forces had triumphed by withstanding an Israeli onslaught without collapsing. **********The departure today had no such overtones of celebration. Some of Mr. Arafat's fighters expressed bitterness that this time it had been an Arab nation and fellow Palestinians who forced the involuntary departure, not Israel.   'Fighters, Not Tourists' ''We feel very bitter because of the Arab tyrants,'' one guerrilla said. ''We have been treated unjustly. We are fighters, not tourists to travel around in ships. My correct position is not in Sudan or Yemen or Tunis, it is near Palestine. But the Arabs do not want us to take up our true position.'' **********Another guerrilla, who gave his name as Abdul Malik Mohammed, said: ''They want us to drop our guns, but a political revolution will not solve our problems. The Arab nation wants to take Palestinians' own decision. They want to kill us. We are very angry, each of us. It is very bad and miserable.'' **********A third combatant, Abdul Bari, a Moslem from Bangladesh, said: ''We are being forced. Now we have nowhere to fight.'' **********In the evacuation last year, the Palestinian guerrillas were not allowed to take their families with them. This time, 500 noncombatants joined the exodus, creating sometimes incongruous scenes.   Diapers and AK-47's **********Along the dockside, pummelled by recent Israeli naval bombardments, one Palestinian escorted his family, carrying an AK-47 rifle in one hand and a plastic-wrapped pack of baby's diapers in the other. **********Women in olive green drabs, rifles slung over their shoulders, clutched feeding bottles and babies in blue jump suits.  In one pile of belongings waiting for shipment, a toddler had been seated against a pile of blankets, framed by a rocket launcher and a light machine-gun, as if irrevocably ensnared in the Middle East's cyclical violence. **********Other families faced different destinies. At the dockside, as the air filled with the persistent, ear-splitting crackle of rifle fire, a woman sat alone and wept, gazing at the vessel transporting her husband. Her son, about 5 years old, was sitting by her side on a low wall. He took one look at her and, barely old enough to understand fully the cause of the tears, he cried, too. **********The Palestinians still under Mr. Arafat's leadership are traveling to destinations including Yemen, Algeria, Tunisia, the Sudan and possibly Iraq. The dispersal further weakens Mr. Arafat's position, Arab political analysts said, despite the publicity surrounding his departure. **********''Arafat has now been cut off from the main fighting force of the guerrillas,'' one analyst said, ''He is also away from any front near Palestine. It is virtual exile.''  'A Kind of Legitimacy' **********The analyst pointed out, however, that Mr. Arafat is still the legitimate chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization. **********''That gives him a kind of legitimacy, without military power,'' the analyst said. ''In the Arab context, what counts is who controls the military, not popularity or legitimacy or anything else.'' **********By this argument, the rebels under Col. Saed Musa have yet to establish themselves as a valid alternative, and so both sides will now seek to lay claim to credentials - Mr. Arafat by a political and diplomatic rear-guard action, the rebels by their firepower. **********Israeli warplanes circled over Tripoli today, drawing occasional and ineffective antiaircraft fire as the evacuation got under way, but there was no repetition of the Israeli naval bombardments on Palestinian positions that had gone on for the previous 10 days.   French Stand Guard **********The French escort of the Greek vessels, reportedly numbering five corvettes and the aircraft carrier Clemenceau, apparently accompanied the Greek vessels as a deterrent to further Israeli naval action. The French provided the naval escort at Greece's request. French planes took to the air from the Clemenceau to guard the evacuation. **********The Greek vessels, chartered by the P.L.O. at a reported cost of $2.5 million, flew the United Nations flag as they entered the port. Once the ships moored, Palestinian guerrillas hoisted their own green, white, red and black banner alongside that of the world body.   Lebanese Inherit Heavy Weapons **********In negotiations before his departure, Mr. Arafat agreed to leave his heavy weapons behind. Some weapons seem to have been smuggled aboard the Greek vessels, but most of the heavy equipment apparently fell into the hands of his Lebanese allies, a Moslem fundamentalist group called the Islamic Unification Movement. Now that the Palestinians have left Tripoli, a prevalent view is that fighting will at some stage resume among the nine factions in the city, some of which receive Syrian support. **********The Palestinians did not leave entirely as paupers. Along with their AK- 47 rifles, they took with them trucks, jeeps, Mercedes sedans, bottled water, suitcases full of clothes, attache cases, ammunition, beds, blanket rolls, tenting equipment, bananas and tangerines.   Portraits of Arafat **********The Palestinians who arrived at the port bore tiny portraits of Mr. Arafat encased in clear plastic around their necks. Some also wore similar emblems in the shape of Israel, with Mr. Arafat's face imposed on it. While their relationship with the Lebanese Moslem militiamen seemed cordial, the attitude of the Lebanese police at the port was less friendly. **********As the firing reached a particular crescendo and Palestinian guerrillas waved V-for-victory sings that did not reflect their plight, one Lebanese policeman turned to a colleague, shrugged and made a circular movement with his index finger by his forehead, a universal gesture depicting insanity. **********There were curiosities. One of the vessls transporting the Palestinians, the Vergina, was owned, according to Lloyd's Register in London, by the Israeli Government from 1964 to 1976, when it was named the Dan.   Fighting Ends for a Briton **********Among the departing guerrillas was an unlikely fighter for the Palestinian cause, a 26-year-old British carpenter who said he enlisted ''partly out of ideological conviction'' with Al Fatah five weeks ago. He received makeshift basic training in the fighting around Tripoli and now found himself on his way to an uncertain future in Yemen. **********Wearing a black and white headdress, an AK-47 rifle slung around his neck, the Briton, Ian Davison of South Shields in northeast England, said he wanted to fight Israel for a year or two and then return home to England."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/21/business/merger-of-2-texas-banks-rumored.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-06-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 204, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MERGER OF 2 TEXAS BANKS RUMORED", "print_headline": "MERGER OF 2 TEXAS BANKS RUMORED", "body_text": " **********Southwest Bancshares and the Mercantile Texas Corporation asked the New York Stock Exchange yesterday to halt trading in their shares, amid rumors of a merger between the two Texas banks. **********The companies said separately that they had requested a halt in trading pending an announcement. **********Both banks said they expected to make an announcement this afternoon. **********Securities analysts said that a merger appeared likely.

The reinforcements left the same afternoon. **********When reporters arrived at the town on Saturday afternoon, some of the residents were waiting on the edge of town, afraid that the rebels were returning.

''We've always been dominant,'' the 61-year-old executive says, ''and New England has always had our first attention.'' **********Now, under Mr. Brown's leadership, the Boston-based holding company is growing faster than ever by acquiring banks in other New England states.

During that period, he was credited with developing the bank's lucrative business in lending to high-technology companies scattered along Boston's Route 128. Mr. Brown, who has a master's degree in business administration from Harvard University, went to the work for the bank in 1949. **********The acquisition of banks in neighboring states has been made possible by a change in Massachusetts law that allows interstate banking on a reciprocal basis with other New England states. That means Bank of Boston can buy banks in other New England states that allow their banks to acquire lending institutions in Massachusetts. **********This regional bias, Mr. Brown said, will eventually change.

Andropov's latest offer to produce an accord on reducing medium-range nuclear weapons in Europe. **********In an editorial prepared for publication in Friday's issue, Pravda noted that President Reagan had pledged to give serious study to the offer Mr. Andropov put forward last week. The paper said this appeared to mean that the United States would like to ''adapt'' the central aspect of the Soviet proposal, a readiness to use warheads as well as the number of missile launchers as the basic accounting units, to the existing American offer. **********''A negative answer can be given to this question right away,'' Pravda said.  It said that the Soviet and American offers at the Geneva talks on reductions of medium-range nuclear weapons in Europe were incompatible. **********''These are mutually exclusive things,'' it said. ''All this is perfectly understood in Washington, although they make believe that they are going to look for solutions at the negotiating table.  Another farce intended to take in the naive is being staged.'' **********The editorial, which was taken as an authoritative reflection of Kremlin views, was distributed in advance by the press agency Tass.  It offered a gloomy assessment of the Geneva talks, which resume Tuesday after a recess. Not a Millimeter Closer **********It called the situation ''far from heartening'' and said the two sides had not drawn closer ''even by a millimeter'' in the year and half of talks. **********''There is a chance to reach agreement in Geneva because there is an objective basis for it,'' the paper said.  It contended that the United States had blocked progress because it did not want an accord that would prevent the deployment of 572 Pershing-2 and cruise missiles, set to begin in Europe in December under a plan of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. **********The newspaper said that the United States delegation would be bringing as its ''luggage'' Mr. Reagan's so-called interim proposal, put forward in a speech on March 30. **********The American proposal calls for cuts in existing Soviet deployment and the planned American deployment to an equal but unspecified number of warheads. This would allow the United States to deploy at least some of its weapons, while requiring the Soviet Union to dismantle some of its 600 medium-range missiles, including 243 triple-warhead SS-20's. **********The Soviet position is that rough parity already exists between East and West in medium-range weapons and that the introduction of American missiles would upset the balance. **********Mr. Andropov, speaking at a Kremlin dinner last week, modified an earlier proposal for reductions in the medium-range weapons now deployed by the Soviet Union and the Atlantic alliance, meaning essentially the forces of Britain and France and the so-called forward-based medium-range planes of the United States. **********He said Moscow was prepared to count not only the numbers of medium-range missiles and planes capable of delivering nuclear warheads, but the number of warheads themselves. U.S. Favors Counting Warheads **********Although the United States now also favors using numbers of warheads as a measure, it insists that the British and French missiles represent national forces that are not part of the alliance arsenal and therefore not a topic for discussion in the Geneva talks. **********The cautious welcome that Mr. Andropov's proposal received in Washington was described by Pravda as an attempt ''to delude the gullible'' into thinking that the United States was interested in an accommodation. **********The newspaper said that ''the essence of the approach adopted by the United States and NATO regrettably remains the same'' since the Western alliance continued to reject the inclusion of British and French forces in the count. **********As long as Washington holds to this stand, Pravda said, ''naturally no solution of this question is possible.'' In addition, Pravda cited American insistence on a global accord that would include deployments in the Asian part of the Soviet Union as well as in Europe. **********''The question of reductions in Soviet missiles in the Asian part of the U.S.S.R. is again being dragged into the talks, although it has no relation at all to the subject,'' the paper said. **********Pravda reiterated earlier warnings that the introduction of American medium-range missiles into Western Europe would set off a ''chain reaction'' of countermeasures by the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies.

Thus it probably was no surprise to radio listeners on the eastern Mediterranean island to hear his voice proclaim the establishment yesterday of an independent Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.  In a recent interview with a Turkish newspaper, Mr. Denktash had said that ''the Greek Cypriot is the legitimate party in the eyes of the world and Turkish Cypriots are not to be their equals.'' **********''This is a view we must destroy,'' he declared. ''We shall be equal to them.'' **********It was Mr. Denktash who, in February of 1975, proclaimed a Turkish Federated State of Cyprus and then went on to win a landslide victory the next year in an election for the presidency of the autonomous Turkish Cypriot administration that was the predecessor of the newly declared republic. **********The only nation to recognize that administration was Turkey, and again yesterday it was Turkey alone that moved to recognize the new entity on the troubled island.   A 'Charismatic Conservative' **********Mr. Denktash, a stocky, bald man who was once described as a ''charismatic conservative,'' had moved into a commanding position among Turkish Cypriots, who are vastly outnumbered by Greek Cypriots, even before Cyprus won its independence from Britain in 1960. **********But his emergence as the dominant leader did not come until an attempt in 1963 by the Greek Cypriot leadership under Archbishop Makarios to change the island's delicately balanced Constitution led to violence between the two ethnic groups. **********United Nations forces moved in to keep the peace and a ''green line'' was established to separate the relatively modest area then held by the ethnic Turks from the far larger area held by the Greek Cypriots. That division held until 1974 when Turkey, responding to a coup supported by Athens that temporarily deposed President Makarios, invaded the island and seized 40 percent of its territory. **********Over the last two decades, Mr. Denktash, who is now 59 years old, has served as the principal negotiator for the Turkish Cypriots in the talks with a series of Greek Cypriot leaders that took place on the island, in Western Europe and at the United Nations to find a solution to the situation. But nothing worked.   Negotiated With Old Friend **********One of the Greek Cypriot leaders with whom Mr. Denktash spent many hours in negotiation in the decade before the Turkish invasion was Glafkos Clerides. The two men had grown up together during the British colonial days and remained good friends even after the island became divided. **********Mr. Denktash frequently observed that Mr. Clerides was ''a fair-minded man'' but he insisted that President Makarios, deeply distrusted by the Turkish Cypriots, would sabotage any agreement that the two old friends might achieve. Archbishop Makarios died in 1977 and Spyros Kyprianou succeeded him as President. **********Mr. Denktash, who does not have the same warm relationship with Mr. Kyprianou, is said to feel that he is more than equal as a political leader to the Greek Cypriot President. **********Rauf Raif Denktash was born in Paphos, in southwestern Cyprus, on Jan. 27, 1924, a son of a judge. After attending the English School in Nicosia, the island's capital, he won a scholarship and studied law at Lincoln's Inn in London. He was admitted to the bar there in 1947. **********Mr. Denktash was married in 1949 to the daughter of a Turkish Cypriot pharmacist in Nicosia. They have two sons and twin daughters.   Served in British Administration **********After years of practicing law in Nicosia, he became a crown counsel and then acting solicitor general of Cyprus under British rule. In 1957 he resigned as solicitor general to concentrate on working for the survival of the Turkish Cypriot identity in the political turmoil and violence that preceded independence for the island. **********When he left the British Government's service, Mr. Denktash became chairman of the Federation of Turkish Associations on the island. With independence for Cyprus, he became president of the Turkish communal chamber in Cyprus's Parliament. **********Amid the violence that tore the populace apart in December of 1963, Mr. Denktash and the other Turkish Cypriot ministers withdrew from the Government. However, despite the island's division, Mr. Denktash later was re-elected as the head of the Turkish chamber and since 1973 has served as Vice President of Cyprus, although both positions are largely nominal."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/18/world/the-un-today-april-18-1983-general-assembly.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-04-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 61, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The U.N.

''No major reverses were registered'' in El Salvador's commitment to progress on human rights, the report said. **********The report acknowleged, however, that ''human rights abuses continue'' and that ''further development of democracy and the protection of human rights are not to be taken for granted.'' **********Thomas O. Enders, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, and Elliott Abrams, Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, stressed two areas of concern as they outlined the report's conclusions. **********They cited first what the report called the ''systematic ineffectiveness of El Salvador's criminal justice procedures, particularly in cases originating in political violence,'' and second the ''need for further improvement in military discipline, which must be strengthened within individual security force units on a nationwide basis.'' **********Mr. Enders cited El Salvador's release of two Salvadoran officers implicated in the murder of two American land redistribution consultants in January 1981 as a key example of the failure of that country's criminal justice system. **********But he said that there had been significant progress in efforts to prosecute the accused murderers of four American churchwomen in El Salvador in December 1980. **********This assertion was challenged by Representative Mary Rose Oakar, Democrat of Ohio, who has acted as a link with the slain women's families. Tonight she called the certification an ''outrage.'' **********The report noted that ''political violence continued to diminish - although at a slower rate than at the time of the previous certification.'' It attributed this to ''increased consciousness by the Government of the importance of more effective action on human rights, including formation of new institutions for this purpose.'' **********Specifically, the document said civilian deaths due to political violence had fallen from 800 a month in late 1980 to 200 a month in the last six months of 1982. But the report noted that the rate of decline in the country has slowed in the past six months. 'Slow Progress' Noted **********When asked about higher death estimates presented by some human rights organizations, Mr. Enders replied that the higher figures included deaths of guerrillas and others insurgents killed in fighting. By contrast, the Administration's figures, based largely on embassy surveys of deaths reported in four daily newspapers, were limited to civilians whose deaths were attributed to political violence. **********The Administration also maintained that ''efforts to control abuses by members of the armed forces were the subject of increased attention by the Government of El Salvador'' and continued to show ''slow progress.'' **********For example, the document said the Salvadoran armed forces maintain that 80 percent of about 33,000 active duty personnel in the military and security forces have received human rights instructions from the International Committee of the Red Cross. **********The Administration said the redistribution of farmland to peasants, a program whose future was in doubt during the previous certification period, was ''vigorously relaunched.'' More than 20 percent of El Salvador's farmland has been redistributed to 65,000 peasants, the report said. Report Signed by Shultz **********Finally, it cited progress in the nation's effort to establish democratic structures. ''The process rooted in the March 1982 Constituent Assembly elections proved resistant to minority or individual efforts at manipulation,'' the report concluded. **********The report was based on interviews and information accumulated by American Embassy officials and by other State Department officials from the human rights and Latin American bureaus. It was then screened by an interagency group and signed by Secretary of State George P. Shultz. **********The Administration's certification decision was swiftly denounced by several legislators and by civil liberties and human rights groups. The American Civil Liberties Union said in a statement that Salvadoran Government forces or paramilitary groups aligned with them were responsible for at least 5,339 political murders in the past year. **********''The number of reported and verified political murders demonstrates that the human rights situation is worse than ever,'' the A.C.L.U. and Americas Watch, a human rights group, concluded in a joint statement. ''Unmistakable physical evidence of torture, starvation and malnutrition'' were charged today by a team of seven American doctors and nurses who returned this week from a visit to El Salvador.

That is still an option for those seeking to save money on a foreign car, but the process has become much more complicated since the heyday of the Volkswagen Beetle. **********''Before 1973, shipping was relatively inexpensive,'' said Jean Gabella, assistant general manager of overseas sales for Renault U.S.A. But the energy crisis, which led to increases in both shipping costs and car prices, ''has changed the story,'' Mr. Gabella noted. It now costs $500 to $600 to ship a car from Western Europe to the United States. Moreover, marine insurance may add another $400 and customs duties $600 to the total. And these costs can increase substantially, since they are based on the price of the car. For these reasons, Mr. Gabella said, buying a car abroad does not really pay because ''there is very little savings for your average car buyer - if any at all - if the car costs less than $10,000.'' **********For more expensive cars, however, buying abroad can still mean savings. The disparity between the United States price and the European factory prices can be sizable, so transportation costs will eat up proportionately less of the savings. The Mercedes 190E, for example, which sells for about $23,000 here, can be bought in Germany for about $12,000, without air conditioning, sun roofs and all the other gadgets that are standard in the United States market. With those accessories, it is $19,100 at the factory in Germany. **********The trouble is, you cannot just walk into a foreign automobile showroom and plunk down your money. First of all, cars made for the domestic market in Japan and Britain are built for driving on the left side of the road. Moreover, if you ship a car to the United States, you will have to post bond to insure that you will modify the car to American standards for pollution-control and safety. **********If the car has a gasoline engine, that means you must install a catalytic converter and other pollution-control devices. You may also have to change the bumpers or the glass in order to meet American safety standards. These changes can cost several thousand dollars, offsetting the the cost savings of buying abroad. Moreover, the installations may also constrain the performance features that attracted you to the car in the first place. And your tampering with the engine will prompt the manufacturer to void the warranty. In addition, you may have problems getting certain parts in this country, since different engines are used in foreign cars marketed here than in the same cars sold in domestic markets abroad. **********If you really want to buy your car abroad, the way to do it, Mr. Gabella said, ''is to go to an authorized dealer in this country and place your order that way.'' Most of the European automobile manufacturers - but not the Japanese car makers - have ''direct purchase'' or ''tourist delivery'' programs. You can go to a dealer in the United States and put down a deposit on a car that will be produced abroad to your specifications. The car usually can be picked up at the factory four to six weeks later. **********THESE programs have taken on a bit of ritual. **********Mercedes-Benz, for example, provides those **********wishing to pick up their cars at the factory near Stuttgart with vouchers good for taxi rides from downtown to the plant. The company serves its customers breakfast or lunch at a special reception area and gives them a tour of the factory. Americans buy 3,000 Mercedes a year in this manner. And since many of them are auto buffs, according to Fred Chapman of Mercedes-Benz of North America, all this ''adds an extra dimension'' to their purchase. **********And it saves them money. The Mercedes 190E that is $23,000 at United States dealers can be picked up at the factory for about $19,100. The Mercedes 300SD, which sells for $39,500 in the United States, can be had at the factory gate for $32,800. Generally, the more expensive the car, the bigger the savings through this direct purchase plan. **********Volvo has a particularly attractive offering, the Volvo DL4A. The model can be bought in Sweden for $11,715, compared with $12,800 in the United States, and Volvo will pay the cost of shipping it to most American points. **********Even with free shipping, Herbert Levitt, sales manager of Volvo Freeport Ltd. of Long Island, said, ''Just going to Europe to buy a car is not the wisest thing to do.'' But it begins to make more economic sense, he noted, when an individual is planning a vacation in Europe. ''If you're going to rent a car and drive it around for a while,'' Mr. Levitt said, you can save a couple of hundred dollars a week by driving your own newly-purchased car instead. **********For those planning a vacation in Europe, Renault's Mr. Gabella pointed out that his company has a ''vacation-lease'' program that may enable the tourist to obtain use of a car for less than what rental agencies charge. In this program, a vacationer basically buys - through lease payments - a newly produced Renault in France, drives it, and then by prearrangement ''sells'' it to a Renault dealer, a procedure that has tax advantages for the French automobile industry, but does not reimburse the vacationer for his lease payments. That vacationer could obtain a Renault 5 GTL - sold as Le Car in the United States - for 22 days for about $490, or $769 for 30 days. The car is fully insured, is not subject to the 18.6 percent tax on rental cars, and can be returned to any of six major French cities. **********The mechanisms of buying, shipping and insuring a car overseas are well established. But the days when thrifty graduate students could think about getting a car on the cheap during a summer abroad are over. These days, buying a car in Europe makes sense only for those who can afford both a decidedly upscale car and a vacation abroad in the same year. **********Harvey D.

He i s the senior vice president of operations at Merrill Lynch, Pierce, F enner & Smith Inc., the nation's largest brokerage firm. He sits on i ts board of directors and has more than 7,800 people in his charge a nd a spacious office on the 37th floor of One Liberty Plaza in l ower Manhattan. Mr. Nigro is, in fact, a paradigm for his p rofession - a one-time computer programmer who was able to break o ut of strict information processing and into high-level management o f a major corporation. **********The prospects for management-level jobs for computer programmers and systems analysts have, in the past, been limited almost entirely to computer departments. But this seems to be changing. As computers enter almost every corner of business, the executive with a broad grounding in the area will have more and more of an edge over his or her uninitiated colleague. Moreover, the explosion in demand for computer systems is creating a disproportionate number of new managerial positions in what is often called management information services, or M.I.S. **********''There are very few disciplines today in which you can go so high so fast as in M.I.S.,'' Mr. Nigro said. ''In other disciplines, such as marketing or sales, you typically have to go through a long series of steps in the hierarchy to get to a high level of management. Our data-processing department brings the stars up fairly quickly.'' **********Of the 50 highest managerial positions at Merrill Lynch, Mr. Nigro said, seven were currently occupied by those with a background in data processing. **********''M.I.S. people are recession-proof,'' said Peter J. Schementi, vice president for management information services at CBS Inc. ''I could not think of a more rewarding career. Its prospects are very strong.'' **********Mr. Schementi said CBS generally hired recent college graduates with majors in computer science and put them on a distinct career path. They begin by doing rudimentary programming on a project team, he said, ''and there we'll find out how technically able the person is.'' **********Sometimes after only a few months, the next step is to a position as systems analyst, who is more concerned about designing a computer system to meet the need of a specific application, such as revenueand profit-forecasting, than about detailed programming. This is often a crucial step, because as a systems analyst one gets direct exposure to a company's enterprises. And it is the person who knows a company's business best who gets ahead. **********The next level is that of a systems manager, who has the responsibility of developing new computer systems for business applications and has systems analysts as well as programmers reporting to him. **********''In a place like CBS, your M.I.S. people have to know the broadcasting and records business, and the more they know, the better your computer systems will be,'' Mr. Schementi said. ''Therefore, we do a lot of cross-fertilization, switching systems people from records to radio to the network to corporate.'' **********Studies by the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics confirm the optimism of systems analysts and M.I.S. managers. In a recent study, the bureau projected that the number of systems analysts (including managers) employed in this nation by 1990 would be more than 70 percent above the levels of 1980. **********During the same period, overall employment was projected to grow only 20 percent, and all professional and technical employment to increase only 22 percent. According to the survey, demand for computer programmers will also be strong, although not so strong as the demand for systems analysts. The Labor Department forecasts employment growth among programmers will be more than 50 percent. **********''The area of systems analysts is one of the hottest occupations of the 1980's,'' said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, New York regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. ''It's an area that will increase even more than all other computer occupations.'' He added that the demand had created a substantial shortage of systems analysts and that colleges ''were not turning out enough computerscience graduates.'' **********Stuart E. Madnick, a professor of management science at the Sloan School of Management of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, confirmed the need. ''There is a shortage of available systems analysts of about 25 percent,'' he said. ''There is more demand on the analyst level, and while programmers are relatively easy to train, an analyst can only get there with experience.'' **********Frank S. Beckman, chairman of the department of computer and information science at Brooklyn College, said that the biggest influx of students in his department's graduate program - almost 60 percent - consisted of those with degrees in fields other than computer science. ''The job opportunities are so much better in computing in spite of the recession,'' Professor Beckman said. ''They'll be exploding again as soon as we get out of this recession, because the explosion in hardware is so tremendous.'' **********With the increasing demand for systems analysts, salaries inevitably rise. Mr. Schementi said that a systems trainee at CBS earned $14,000 to $18,000 a year to start, and ''goes into six figures'' for those at the top levels. At Merrill Lynch, Mr. Nigro said, recent college graduates are paid about $22,500 a year, while experienced systems analysts get between $30,000 and $35,000. **********Not everyone is recommending that ambitious students begin in management information services.  ''I think we will see the real fast-trackers being put in charge of M.I.S. for a time on their way up,'' said Michael Treacy, assistant professor of management at the Sloan School. On the other hand, he added. ''top-notch M.I.S. people are hard to come by, and if you have one, why move him out of M.I.S. into operations?'' **********Mr. Treacy said, however, that in fields such as banking or brokerage, a company's operations were so closely tied to data processing that operations were often an extension of M.I.S. ''It would be harder to imagine an M.I.S. guy at Owens-Illinois running its bottle plant,'' he said. **********Mr. Nigro said that at Merrill Lynch there were two courses open for systems people: one for those who choose to be professional technicians for their entire careers and one for those using computer systems as a stepping-stone to management. ''As long as we compensate the professional programmers well and provide them with a good atmosphere, they are very happy,'' Mr. Nigro said. ''But for those aiming for management, they do not like a stable environment.  You have to give them an opportunity to move throughout the company and finally from systems into operations. The key is to make sure you allow for both, or else you lose a good technician and gain a poor manager.'' **********Mr. Nigro said he was impressed by the professionalism of computerscience college graduates. But at the same time, he said, Merrill Lynch is hiring graduates with liberal-arts backgrounds as long as they are ''bright.'' He added that Merrill's data-processing department hires between 30 and 40 people right out of college each year. **********But as to planning a career in corporate management that goes beyond the top levels of M.I.S., Mr. Nigro stressed the need to move outside of data processing into the company's core business, such as sales or marketing, by about age 30 to 32. ''The trap is that the person does not broaden his exposure before it is too late,'' Mr.  Nigro said. **********''We are going to see more M.I.S. people taken out of the pure M.I.S. function and placed in an operating unit in a core business responsibility,'' said Mr. Schementi of CBS. ''Finally, the smartest one will get to the top.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/29/business/ryland-group-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-01-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 35, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "RYLAND GROUP INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "RYLAND GROUP INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/04/business/business-forum-a-disguised-bonanza-for-farmers.html": {"writer_name": "Harold Breimyer", "pub_date": "1983-12-04", "snippet": "-making has\n\nlong marked public policy for\n\nagriculture.

He had to have an Ever-Normal-Granary. **********When President Eisenhower sent food to hungry people abroad, as much to spare storage costs here as to help the starving in other countries, the show was embroidered as Food for Peace. **********John R. Block, the incumbent Secretary of Agriculture, found himself last winter with an over-accumulation of grain and cotton that he had helped bring about. He then joined the phrase-making crowd. To farmers who would sit out 1983, partially or wholly, he offered payment-in-kind, or PIK. The in-kind coinage was ingenious. The largess offered farmers was not to be ''dirty'' money but ''clean'' commodities. Some farmers would even get back the grain or cotton they had produced the year before. **********But the inventiveness did not end there. Mr. Block said that since the in-kind commodities were either in the Government's hands or due to find their way there, it would be costless to ship them back to farmers.  PIK was conceived not as farm aid but as ''in relief of John Block.'' Although bumper 1982 harvests and weak demand had made the oversupply worse, the Secretary's discomfiture in the winter of 1982-83 was to a large extent self-induced. Because his ideological belief in avoiding Government intervention set him against programs that reduced acreage and supported farm price, he had helped write a weak 1981 farm law and then chose to apply it flimsily in 1982. This was his first mistake. **********Trying to wiggle out of his bind, he then made his second mistake by overcorrecting the situation. He chose to be as generous in 1983 as he had been niggardly in 1982 by making the terms of PIK highly attractive. Farmers, liking gold in their teeth (though some were truly hard pressed financially) rushed to sign up. Many offered even more acreage than they were asked for. In all, Secretary Block accepted some 80 million idled acres under PIK, and in so doing converted the program from a Block bail-out to a farmers' bonanza. **********YET so much idled land risked **********damaging markets, especially **********in the case of drought, which in fact happened. Also, the size of the program swamped the local office staffs to such an extent that they could not effectively police whether farmers were protecting their idled land from erosion, which was part of the PIK agreement. **********The PIK experience teaches three lessons. First, in administration of an economic program, ideology must never be allowed to interfere with operational judgment. Any governmental commitment to underpin farmers' prices and incomes must be accompanied by effective governmental measures to keep production in bounds. Competence and brass knuckles, not ideological fervor, are needed. The more so because farmers, bless 'em, are masters at milking Government programs, and a Secretary of Agriculture must be a master at frustrating them. **********Before a second lesson is drawn, a caveat must be inserted in Secretary Block's defense. He did not write the 1981 farm law; Congress did. And he did not dream up the lax terms and generous promises (price support levels) of the 1982 program. Various farm leaders authored and promoted them. Mr. Block's sin was to listen. **********The second lesson applies to all farm law. Voluntary agricultural programs that control supplies will either be of limited effectiveness or exceedingly costly. Voluntary plans of the usual type (not PIK) will not reduce production very much because any rise in market prices benefits both participants and nonparticipants in the plan. The attraction of gambling on a free ride will always keep a sizable portion of farmers from taking part in a program. **********This shackling effect of the free rider syndrome can be offset only by offering farmers a nonshared emolument. In other words, an individualized payment. It can be in dollars or in-kind. This recourse will get bigger participation, as PIK did in 1983, but it will also increase cost to Government astronomically. **********A moral follows. At a time of big surplus, supply can be controlled effectively without incurrring excessive Government cost only by requiring farmers to accept mandatory controls on what they market. Farmers cannot expect henceforth to be paid as handsomely as they were in PIK of 1983, for taking action that is in their collective best interest anyway.  The third lesson is addressed to all future Secretaries of Agriculture. In charting a farm program course, an allowance must always be made for the fickleness of nature. Drought can come at any time. We veterans of the Washington farm scene have learned that lesson at least five times in the past 50 years. It's a shame that each new Administration, oblivious to farm program history, must learn it anew. **********Harold F.

This time, the man at center stage was Noboru Takeshita, Japan's Minister of Finance. **********In the last gasp of the budget-making exercise, Mr. Takeshita held court, as other Cabinet members trooped into his sitting room, bowed and explained at length why the commonweal would be imperiled if their ministries did not receive a few more yen than had been allotted the previous year. **********But Mr. Takeshita, who holds a black belt in judo, rarely budged.  On Thursday, the Cabinet approved a $216.2 billion budget for the fiscal year 1983, which begins April 1, just 1.4 percent more than the previous year. The increase is the smallest since 1955. **********In overseeing the crafting of such an austere spending program, Mr. Takeshita, who is 58, showed himself to be firmly in the conservative mainstream of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the issue of fiscal policy. Japan runs a large budget deficit in relation to total Government spending. One of the goals of the party's mainstream is to whittle down those deficits, which are running at more than $40 billion. **********Opponents both at home and abroad argue that, given Japan's high savings rate, it can fund current debts and more without fueling inflation. Thus, they believe Japan should give its economy a fiscal stimulus to increase growth, raise imports and ease trade frictions. **********Mr. Takeshita does not agree with this. In December, Mr. Takeshita said that to ''persevere'' in the budget-curbing endeavors was the only reasonable path. **********Mr. Takeshita's stance on fiscal policy is hardly surprising. He is leading member of his party's largest faction, led by Kakuei Tanaka, a former Prime Minister. He is widely acknowledged as one of the ''new leaders'' in the party, and a strong candidate to be prime minister in the next election in 1984. He has served in several key Government posts before, including a previous stint as Finance Minister, and has been elected to the lower house of Parliament nine times from his home district in Shimane Prefecture."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/16/jobs/cashing-in-on-the-new-business-of-banking.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Bennett", "pub_date": "1983-10-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1402, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Job Market", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CASHING IN ON THE NEW BUSINESS OF BANKING", "print_headline": "CASHING IN ON THE NEW BUSINESS OF BANKING", "body_text": " **********WEARING a bright red dress and fingering a long string of beads, Elaine R. Bond is not the typical banker. But what makes her different is not the brightness of her dress nor her sex, but what she does. For she neither makes loans nor takes deposits. She is an expert in computerization and communications. Her jargon is not that of a banker. It is that of a wizard in electronic communications. **********Before the 47-year-old Mrs. Bond joined Chase Manhattan in 1981, she had spent her career with International Business Machines. Now, as a senior vice president at Chase, she oversees the bank's use and programming of computers. About 120 professionals report to her directly, up 30 percent in the last two years. **********Mrs. Bond reflects the fact that banking has become so diversified that it is almost impossible to define a bank, let alone a banker. For banks are no longer organizations that sit back, take in deposits and make loans to businesses. Instead, they have become aggressive sellers, whether of loans, deposits, brokerage services or highly sophisticated electronic funds transfer services. **********A bank needs not only lending officers, tellers and bookkeepers, but all sorts of salesmen and technicians, ranging from specialists in telecommunications and computers, like Mrs. Bond, to those whose forte is taxes or direct-mail sales. **********This diversification has forced changes in hiring practices. It used to be that banks considered it a mark of failure to hire people from outside the institution. But today banks hardly have a choice, considering the diversity of their needs. **********''About half our staff was brought in from outside the bank,'' Mrs. Bond said. And of those that were recruited from other areas of the bank, ''all have come from the telecommunications community,'' she noted. Mrs. Bond predicted that demand would remain strong in banking for all sorts of technicians in electronics, especially for ''analysts who can help laymen become more self-sufficient in getting and submitting information.'' **********''The changes taking place in banking have opened up many job opportunities, away from the historic lines of their business,'' said John P. Lynch, vice president of Paul R. Ray & Company, a ''head-hunting'' firm. ''It's been especially apparent in the consumer-products area, where banks have been aggressively hiring people from companies like Procter & Gamble and major food-processing companies.'' **********Most analysts expect job demand, under way at all levels, to rise considerably for some time. A study of executive demand by Korn/Ferry International, a leading headhunting firm, found that since 1980 the financial-services industry had accounted for the largest demand for executives throughout the country. **********''The competition among financial-service companies is fiercer than ever with banking, insurance companies, savings and loans and brokerage houses all crossing over into one another's turfs,'' said Windle B. Priem, managing director of Korn/Ferry's financial-services division. **********''Our executive demand in that industry grew by 12 percent last year and we're beyond that in 1983. We expect the trend to carry over for the next three years,'' Mr. Priem said. He attributed it to decentralization by the large commercial banks, their diversification into new businesses and their expansion across the country.  Mr. Lynch of Ray & Company, who said the financial industry remained the best steppingstone toward a successful career (a recent survey by his firm showed that more than 22 percent of 300 top-paid executives in the nation began their careers in finance), said there was a growing awareness among banks and other financial institutions of the importance of marketing. **********This change reflects a totally new environment, where the banking business has become far more aggressive and competitive. Unlike the past, when banks considered it impolite to try to take a customer from another bank, competition is fierce today, not only among banks themselves, but between banks and other organizations that have been moving into the financial business. Some sectors of the financial industry itself have gained substantial new powers and suddenly are faced with the need to hire experts for which the institutions previously had no need. **********That has been the case for the thrift industry, which consists of savings banks and savings and loan associations. A law enacted last year gave them far broader powers. Before it was passed, the thrift institutions were largely confined to accepting savings deposits from individuals and making mortgage loans. Now, they are allowed to make commercial loans and take commercial deposits. As a result, there has been a great increase in in demand for commercial lending officers. In the last 14 months, for example, the Dollar-Dry Dock Savings Bank has hired 25 officers from commercial banks. **********Commercial banks, too, have been moving into new areas. David E. Dougherty, now 33, left the investment-banking firm of Kidder Peabody three years ago to join the Bankers Trust Company. He was hired to form a group designed to raise money for state and municipal governments and for corporations that are eligible to raise funds in the tax-exempt markets. **********Like most other major banks, for many years Bankers Trust had underwritten bond issues for tax-exempt organizations when these issues were sold at public auction. But Mr. Dougherty's job was to bring Bankers Trust into a new business of raising such money through privately negotiated transactions. And that had been the exclusive realm of the investment banks. ''It was an opportunity to start a new department,'' Mr. Dougherty said. **********IN the last three years, Mr. Dougherty, **********who is now senior vice president, has **********added 12 professionals to his staff, including a bond lawyer, a former finance director of Wilmington and a former executive director of the New York City Housing Development Corporation. **********''This is only the beginning,'' Mr. Dougherty said. ''By the end of this decade, all the major money center banks will have public-finance experts. It's an evolution that's already in progress.'' **********At the Security Pacific National Bank in Los Angeles, which has a large branch network, Irving Margol, executive vice president, said that ''10 years ago, we hardly cared what college graduates majored in, but today we're looking for people with a business or marketing background.'' **********''When we promote someone from within, through the management-training system,'' he said, ''we look for market-driven types - people who are interested in selling and cross-selling.'' **********Mr. Margol added that ''today, we have strategic planning and marketing departments that didn't exist 10 years ago.'' **********''We're also hiring product managers who typically would have gone to a Procter & Gamble or a consumer-product company,'' he said. ''We're developing new products. We're looking at our customer needs and designing and developing products. The product-development people manage a product through its introduction and, if there's a sales force necessary to support it, they become the sales force.'' **********Security Pacific, like most major banks, is owned by a holding company that operates throughout the country. The holding company is not subject to laws that prohibit banks from operating across states lines. Thus, through its holding company, Security Pacific Corporation, the company has a nationwide network of consumer- and commercial-finance companies. **********''The holding company is a new world,'' Mr. Margol said. ''We now have a discount-brokerage business, a venture-capital business, a mortgage-banking business and a leasing business,'' and ''close to 2,000 people in our data-processing business.'' **********The growing opportunities in the banking business may be illustrated by the following list of jobs at Citicorp, which did not offer them a decade ago: **********- Electronic mail manager, who trains employees to use electronic mail system. **********- Satellite communications specialist. The bank now owns its own transponders on a satellite. **********- Electronic banking account officers. They market cash-management system and electronic mail systems to outsiders. **********- Cash-management consultants, who consult with corporate treasurers around the world to help them manage their cash flow. **********- Credit scorers. These have developed complicated mathematical systems to determine individual creditworthiness. **********- Electronic data-processing auditors, who audit computer systems. **********- Telecommunications lawyer. **********- Systems analysts who developed automatic teller machines. **********- Sales representatives, comparable to account executives at securities firms, to manage an individual's personal assets. **********- Salesmen for at-home banking via television and computer. **********- Telephone salesmen for banking services outside New York State. **********- Director of information services, who markets sales of financial information. **********- Salesmen for selling time to the public on Citicorp computers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/25/world/marcos-warning-on-protests.html": {"writer_name": "Colin Campbell", "pub_date": "1983-09-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 206, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MARCOS WARNING ON PROTESTS", "print_headline": "MARCOS WARNING ON PROTESTS", "body_text": " **********President Ferdinand E.

Current Federal law limits the liability to $570 million. **********The commission also proposed that individual nuclear plants be required to pay up to $10 million a year after an accident into the nationwide fund through which victims would be reimbursed. They currently may be asked to make a one-time payment of up to $5 million per accident into such a fund. **********The changes, the commission said, would help insure full compensation for victims, while making it less likely that the Federal Government would have to make contributions of its own. All five commissioners concurred in the recommendation. **********The Price-Anderson Act, which sets the $570 million liability limit, was enacted in 1957 as an amendment to the Atomic Energy Act. It was intended to address the threat to private investors of potentially enormous claims, and to provide an adequate pool of funds for victims of an accident. The act, twice renewed by Congress, expires in 1987. Debate on the issue is expected to start next year. **********The act's liability limit derives from a two-part system. Liability insurance of $160 million is purchased by utilities, a figure the commission said should be raised to $200 million to reflect inflation. The remaining $410 million of the liability limit would come from charging each of the 82 licensed nuclear plants a fee of up to $5 million to cover damages from an accident at any of the plants. **********The agency is suggesting that, to increase the level of coverage, each nuclear plant would be subject to an assessment of $10 million a year for as many years as necessary. **********Donald Winston, a spokesman for the Atomic Industrial Forum, the principal trade association for the nuclear industry, said: ''The industry is not particularly opposed to the change but we want to analyze how it would be paid for.'' **********Statute of Limitations **********The commission also recommended that the act's 20-year statute of limitations be extended to 30 years because of the risk of latent cancer. **********The Price-Anderson Act was invoked after the accident at the Three Mile Island reactor near Harrisburg, Pa., in March 1979.

Shultz today a possible compromise on the role of Maj. Saad Haddad, the southern Lebanese militia commander, Israeli and American officials said. Major Haddad's future has been one of the chief unresolved issues in the negotiations on an Israeli troop withdrawal from Lebanon. **********The officials said Mr. Shultz informed Mr. Begin that President Amin Gemayel and other Lebanese officials had told him on Thursday in Beirut that they would consider allowing Major Haddad to remain in southern Lebanon in a lesser role than that of overall commander of the forces that will be in control of the border region. **********A senior aide to the Israeli Prime Minister said that in the meeting with Mr. Begin, Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Defense Minister Moshe Arens, Mr. Shultz was given an Israeli response that is ''a kind of compromise, a shift on a limited point.'' He said that when the Secretary of State returns from transmitting this to the Lebanese on Saturday ''we might be able to find an agreed solution.'' **********The Israelis had been insisting that Major Haddad be allowed to remain in charge of the forces in the south, but today an Israeli Defense Ministry official said that what was important was that Major Haddad have a ''leadership role'' and be rewarded for his previous service as Israel's ally in blocking the Palestine Libertion Organization in the south of Lebanon. Both Sides Want Agreement **********This was the first day during Mr. Shultz's diplomatic shuttle in which he took the lead and did most of the talking, summarizing for Israeli leaders his views of each side's positions after his initial visits to both capitals. **********According to participants, Mr. Shultz said he was convinced that both Israel and Lebanon wanted an agreement, the first step toward the possible removal of Israeli, Syrian and P.L.O. forces from Lebanon. **********Participants in today's meetings said that Mr. Shultz told the Israelis that time was working against the parties and urged the Israelis to do what was necessary to find compromises with the Lebanese. **********The concern expressed by Mr. Shultz and also by Israelis and Lebanese in recent days is that Syria, heavily rearmed by the Soviet Union, might refuse to go along with its previous pledge to withdraw its forces if the Israelis did the same. Suggests Syria Might Renege **********A senior Israeli official said that there had been reports from Damascus suggesting that Syria would refuse to withdraw if Lebanon signed any accord with Israel calling for an end to the state of war or for regulating commerce and security matters, issues now close to agreement. **********There were also some sharp disagreements during the day, officials said. A senior Defense Ministry official said the United States ''has played a less than positive role'' by encouraging the Lebanese to believe they can handle the security questions in southern Lebanon through cooperation with the United States and not in close collaboration with Israel. **********The official stressed that Israel had to be satisfied with the security arrangements in southern Lebanon for any accord to be achieved and that Israel did not believe the Lebanese forces alone could guarantee that security. **********American officials, in their briefing, repeated their concern that Lebanese sovereignty be insured and strengthened, and their confidence that the Lebanese Army, now being retrained by American military officers, was capable of maintaining the security in southern Lebanon by itself. Disagree on Supervisory Roles **********Lebanon and Israel have agreed on the setting up of joint supervisory teams in southern Lebanon, but have different views on their roles. Mr. Shultz told the Israelis that the Lebanese believe the teams should be limited to inspecting compliance of the agreement, and if the teams detect any possible terrorists should call in Lebanese forces. **********Maj. Gen. Ehud Barak, Israel's military chief of intelligence, told Mr. Shultz that the joint teams should be able to go after the infiltrators and attack them without having to wait for Lebanese units, a participant in the meeting said. **********In addition to discussing the role of Major Haddad, Mr. Shultz and the Israelis discussed the use of members of the United Nations force in Lebanon as ''observers'' at Palestinian refugee camps near Sidon and Tyre. They would help insure the security of the inhabitants of the camps and make it easier to gain the withdrawal of the estimated 10,000 P.L.O. guerrillas from Lebanon at the same time as Israeli and Syrian forces are supposed to leave. **********The Israelis have resisted proposals in the past to put members of the United Nations force in charge of camp security for fear that they might not do enough to prevent Palestinian guerrillas from using the camps for training. Under the formula being discussed, the Lebanese Army would be charged with blocking a revival of the P.L.O., but the United Nations forces would be there to prevent a repetition of last September's massacres at Palestinian camps near Beirut, Israeli officials said. **********In describing today's talks, a senior Foreign Ministry official said, ''We do have a sense that we are making progress.'' Mr. Shultz was more circumspect. He said they were ''inching forward.'' He jokingly said outside Mr. Begin's home that perhaps they had advanced ''an inch and a half.'' Later, when asked about progress, he said, ''Maybe another three-quarters of an inch.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/16/world/8-nations-propose-a-way-to-break-the-east-west-impasse-at-madrid.html": {"writer_name": "John Darnton", "pub_date": "1983-03-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 499, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "8 NATIONS PROPOSE A WAY TO BREAK THE EAST-WEST IMPASSE AT MADRID", "print_headline": "8 NATIONS PROPOSE A WAY TO BREAK THE EAST-WEST IMPASSE AT MADRID", "body_text": " **********Arguing that detente itself was at stake, eight neutral countries proposed a series of compromises today to break the East-West deadlock that has dogged the conference on security and cooperation in Europe, now in its third year. **********But the proposals that they advanced before the 35-nation meeting appeared to fall short of what the West had been demanding to support human rights in the Soviet bloc. The initial response from Western representatives was guarded and cool. **********The proposals did not include provisions to halt the expulsion of foreign reporters, to stop jamming of foreign radio broadcasts, to permit free unions the right to strike or to allow ''Helsinki monitor groups'' - groups of citizens inside countries who check on their compliance with the 1975 Helsinki accords. These provisions were among 14 amendments proposed by the Western nations last November. 'Equally Dissatisfactory to All' **********Today's initiative for a final agreement here came from Austria, Cyprus, Finland, Liechtenstein, San Marino, Sweden, Switzerland and Yugoslavia. Once before, in December 1981, the eight countries drew up a document to try to bring the conference to a successful conclusion, but it was lost in a wave of charge and countercharge that followed the crackdown in Poland. **********At a news conference after the closed session, representatives of the eight sought to depict the compromise as the best one possible in the current impasse. ''We consider it a balanced document,'' said Ljubivoje Acimovic of Yugoslavia. ''It should be satisfactory to all participating states - or equally dissatisfactory to all. Everyone has to sacrifice something.'' **********Justifying the omission of some of the human rights amendments, which they said they themselves favored, the neutrals said some of them - such as prohibitions against expelling journalists or the right to set up monitoring groups - had run into insurmountable opposition from the Soviet Union. Politics was the art of the possible, they suggested. **********The representatives emphasized what they called important advances. They included provisions insuring access to foreign missions, upholding freedom of religion and pledging international cooperation against terrorism. Western demands for greater latitude for foreign journalists were watered down somewhat. **********''We got 30 or 40 percent, not 100 percent,'' said Dr. Franz Ceska of Austria. ''But we believe the 30 or 40 percent is worthwhile.'' 'Thin on Human Dimensions' **********Western representatives said their public response would await a caucus Wednesday, but privately some indicated reservations. ''Many of our amendments appear in diluted form or are omitted altogether,'' said one Western European diplomat. ''The result is thin on the human dimensions.'' **********The compromise also does not note that Western foreign ministers appeared before the session to register a condemnation of martial law in Poland. It speaks of the right of workers to ''establish and join trade unions'' but does not mention the right of unions to join in a federation or the right to strike, as did the Western proposals."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/25/business/analog-devices-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-jan-29.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 35, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ANALOG DEVICES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Jan 29", "print_headline": "ANALOG DEVICES INC reports earnings for Qtr to Jan 29", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/28/business/forbes-s-list-of-the-richest.html": {"writer_name": "N.

He had wealthy parents. Sam M. Walton did it by selling things cheap. J.R. Simplot did it with potatoes, Robert Vesco fled with millions. **********All did what most Americans only dream about doing - they struck it rich - and they all show up on the second annual Forbes 400 list, a gossipy and not scrupulously precise ranking of the richest people in the country compiled for the latest issue of Forbes magazine. **********Though studded with the fabled names that one associates with Rolls-Royces and Tiffany paper clips - Rockefellers, Hunts, Mellons - the Forbes list proves that a lot of unknowns have also made good. **********One imagines that Mr. Walton, for example, could safely stroll into most any bank, save those in Bentonville, Ark., and cause no stir. But Forbes has him as the second-richest man in America. **********The 65-year-old Mr. Walton got his training at the J.C. Penney Company, then struck out on his own. He now owns control of the Wal-Mart discount stores, based in Bentonville. His estimated worth is $2.15 billion. He drives a pickup truck. **********He is not the only surprise in the latest Forbes tally. It has been assumed for years among those who never have to count their millions that nobody is richer than Daniel Keith Ludwig, the man known as the father of the supertanker. **********By Forbes's calculations, however, Mr. Ludwig is only the third-richest man in the country. He was No. 1 last year, but he was passed by Mr. Getty, son of the late billionaire oilman John Paul Getty, with an estimated worth of $2.2 billion. **********If there is a lesson to learn from such a list, it might be how best to accumulate canyons of gold. Although real estate, oil and media properties continued to be major sources of fortunes, it was the red-hot stock market that was the big cash cow.  Perot Recoups **********Some 25 stock fortunes more than doubled, and 35 more gained at least 50 percent. The biggest winner was Leslie Wexner, who heads The Limited Inc. His net worth, based on closing stock prices of Aug. 24, more than quadrupled. H. Ross Perot, famous for once losing $1 billion on paper when the stock market went the wrong way, got all that back. He vaulted from a worth of $325 million last year into the billionaire class. Sam Walton's Wal-Mart stock more than tripled. **********How do you lose canyons of gold? Forbes can tell you that, too, by examining the 74 people knocked off last year's list. The oil glut pinched the fortunes of several. George Lucas, despite the success of his film ''The Return of the Jedi,'' slipped off because of a divorce settlement. **********Thirteen members of last year's list - including the mob figure Meyer Lansky - fell off because they died. **********It is also getting harder to keep pace with the big money people. Last year, $100 million was enough to make the roster. This year it took $125 million. **********There were some new faces, whose sagas would hearten any youngster with big eyes. Take Kyupin Philip Hwang. He arrived from Korea with $50 and scrubbed dishes in a Lake Tahoe casino to pay for a college education. He founded a home computer company called Televideo Systems in his garage. After going public in March, his worth swelled to $600 million.  French Fries Patent **********J. R. Simplot got rich by owning the patent to frozen french fries. Donald Hall did it with greeting cards. Mr. Vesco, the fugitive financier, made the 400 by disappearing with millions. **********One of the more precarious fortunes on the list is that of Marc Rich, the Swiss commodities trader, who is under indictment on tax evasion charges. **********Incidentally, Malcolm S. Forbes, the magazine's editor in chief, is ranked 400th on the list. No net worth is given. He says that any number would be considered ''real,'' rather than an estimate like the others, and he does not know his real worth. **********The rich list is not universally loved by those who wind up on it. Nobody likes to have their finances bared, especially if they might be concerned about kidnappers or charity seekers. **********''Last year, I thought it was one of the greatest jokes I ever heard,'' Lamar Hunt said. ''They create in the public mind some fairy tale type of situation.'' **********Though Forbes put Mr. Hunt's wealth at $1 billion last year, it said that government inquiries indicated he was not that well off and so dropped him to $500 million. What does Mr. Hunt say about that? ''I had a tough year, I guess.'' **********Louis Ward, the head of Russell Stover Candies, who got on at $200 million, was less than pleased. ''I think that sort of thing is wrong in America,'' he said. ''I feel that lists such as this don't serve any worthwhile purpose.'' **********''It endangers my family,'' said Arnold Bernhard, who founded Value Line, which evaluates stocks. ''You know how many racketeers there are in the country who will come after you if they think you have deep pockets? After last year's list, I was inundated with calls. People say, if you've got all that money, give us some.'' **********One member of the 400 sued Forbes. Kenneth Davis Jr., part of the oil family, asked a court in Fort Worth to order Forbes to delete his name from the list because his privacy was being invaded. The judge, however, rejected the request.  'Price of Being Rich' **********As for criticism of the list, James Michaels, Forbes's editor, says, ''This is part of the price of being rich in an open society.'' **********Forbes does not contend that its list is complete. A number of people on it this year would have been included last year had Forbes known about them. ''The head of Computerland we overlooked last year,'' Mr. Michaels said, talking about William Millard. ''I happened to be sitting next to someone at a dinner who was talking about Computerland. I ran back and did a little arithmetic and said, by golly, we better get him on our rich list.'' **********To show how times have changed, Forbes also recapped a survey from a 1918 issue proclaiming the 30 richest Americans. At that time, a piddling $50 million made that list. On top was John D. Rockefeller, whose fortune was computed at $1.2 billion and whose was put at $31.70 a second. Nobody else was close. Second place was occupied by Henry Clay Frick, the coke and steel executive, at $225 million, with Andrew Carnegie third, at $200 million."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/17/business/advertising-coca-cola-plan-on-aspartame.html": {"writer_name": "Sandra Salmans", "pub_date": "1983-08-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 138, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Coca-Cola Plan On Aspartame", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Coca-Cola Plan On Aspartame", "body_text": " **********The Coca-Cola Company is expected to announce today that it will soon begin using aspartame in Diet Coke, the extraordinarily successful soft drink introduced nationally in January. **********Earlier this month, G.

The Senate, on a 67-to-30 vote, sent the legislation back to the House, which had approved, with great reluctance, a different I.M.F. bill earlier this year. **********The Senate-passed version was part of a larger legislative deal negotiated over several weeks among House Democrats, the Senate Republican leadership and the Administration. One of the most politically sensitive aspects of the I.M.F. bill was the Senate-approved language that would let the United States support fund loans to South Africa under certain tightly defined conditions; the House bill includes a broad prohibition on such loans. **********The Senate vote was a victory for President Reagan, who has termed the increased contribution essential for the stability of the international monetary system. Opponents have said it merely represents a bailout for commercial banks' imprudent loans to developing countries. **********But although the House Democratic leadership has agreed to the delicately structured Senate compromise bill, it was not certain that a floor majority could be mustered. **********House action on the package, which includes not only the added $8.4 billion in deposits for the fund - in addition to the current $14.6 billion commitment - but also authorization for $15.6 billion in housing programs, may hinge on the wording of the South Africa amendment. The House was expected to vote Friday or Saturday before adjournment for the year. **********The $8.4 billion United States commitment is part of a call by the I.M.F. to its 146 member nations to raise an additional $42 billion for loans. **********The compromises represented the culmination of six weeks of negotiations by Senate Banking Committee Chairman Jake Garn, Republican of Utah, who managed the bill on the Senate floor, House Banking Committee Chairman Fernand J. St Germain, Democrat of Rhode Island, Secretary of the Treasury Donald T. Regan and Budget Director David A. Stockman. To win Congressional approval of the I.M.F. bill, the Administration agreed to a bigger housing bill than it wanted and the Democrats insisted that the two authorizations be joined in one bill. **********First Housing Authorization **********The bill enacted today as part of the I.M.F. package would represent the first housing authorization by Congress in three years. **********The original House version, which passed by a margin of only six votes, ordered the United States representative at the I.M.F. to vote against any loans to South Africa. **********This language was unacceptable to both the Administration and the Senate. As a result of compromises worked out late yesterday by the negotiators, the United States is to ''actively oppose'' loans to South Africa unless the Secretary of the Treasury certifies in writing at least 21 days in advance of any such loan that the money would: **********- Benefit economically ''the majority of the people.'' **********- Reduce the ''severe constraints on labor and capital mobility.'' **********- Reduce ''other highly inefficient labor and capital supply rigidities.'' **********It was uncertain how members of the Congressional black caucus and others in the House who are actively opposed to apartheid policies would react to this language. Most members of Congress see no political advantage to themsevles to support I.M.F. funding and so are inclined to vote against the funding if there may be political risk. **********But the Democrats would risk losing the housing authorization if they toppled the compromise bill because of their feelings about apartheid. **********Loans to Communist Countries **********The House had also voted that the United States representative at the I.M.F. oppose loans to Communist countries. The Senate bill would let the United States vote for such loans if the Secretary makes findings like those required for South Africa. **********A sign of some of the difficulties the legislation faces in the House came tonight with a letter to the President from 50 Representatives serving notice that they could not support the bill because of what they said were the high interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve and the Administration. The organizer of the letter was Jack Kemp, Republican of Buffalo, who has generally been an Administration supporter. **********Debate Over Effect **********During today's debate, which ran for nearly six hours, opponents led by two conservative Republican Senators, William L. Armstrong of Colorado and Gordon J. Humphrey of New Hampshire, argued that the bill would only make the international monetary situation worse by increasing the mountain of debt in the world. **********''The banks have dug themselves into a hole and should dig themselves out of it,'' said Senator Armstrong. **********On the other side, Senator Charles H. Percy, Republican of Illinois and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that ''by taking this positive action we avoid a worldwide depression.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/18/business/merger-accord-set-by-data-terminal.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-01-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 312, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MERGER ACCORD SET BY DATA TERMINAL", "print_headline": "MERGER ACCORD SET BY DATA TERMINAL", "body_text": " **********The National Semiconductor Corporation agreed to acquire Data Terminal Systems Inc. in a twostep transaction valued at up to $50 million, the companies said today.

He declined to specify Macy's increase, but sources close to the company said it exceeded 15 percent. **********Marvin Traub, chairman of Bloomingdale's, said the season was ''extraordinarily good, with sales 15 to 20 percent over last year.'' He added that the chain's Manhattan store was running ''particularly strong,'' and ''all of our departments, from moderate to higher priced, seem to be sharing in the excellent performance.'' **********''It's a splendid season,'' said Joseph E. Brooks, chairman of Lord & Taylor. ''In our New York store, business is up 18 percent and in the area it's up 13 percent.'' **********'An Upscale Mentality' **********He said the gains were on top of an 11 percent sales increase last Christmas. People have ''an upscale mentality these days,'' Mr. Brooks said. ''They may have bought a $20 sweater for a gift last year. This year it's $25 and $30.'' **********The record rain Monday and Tuesday sharply reduced shopper traffic, costing merchants an estimated 15 percent of the business that they had hoped to ring up this week. **********Yesterday, however, business resumed its solid pace. And some store executives said that in spite of the retailing axiom that ''If you lose it, you've lost it,'' they expected that the losses from the rain would be recouped.  ''We've had an excellent season so far, with sales up 30 percent, but the rain hurt,'' said Leon Atkind, chairman of NBO Stores, the men's wear discounter. ''We think, though, that the rain slowdown means a tremendous surge of traffic this weekend.'' **********'We're Already Gaining Back' **********Robin Farkas, chairman of Alexander's Inc., said: ''We did well when it wasn't raining. Today we're already gaining back. We expect a very good Christmas, barring any more rain or a big snow.'' **********In the suburbs, the heavy traffic at the large shopping malls yesterday and before the rain was ample evidence of a strong season. **********At the Roosevelt Field Shopping Center in Garden City, L.I. - one of the area's largest malls, with 190 stores including Macy's, J. C. Penney, Alexander's and Gimbels - retailers were reporting sales increases of 7 percent to 30 percent from the period last year, with the average running about 10 percent. **********Yesterday, the mall was clogged with thousands of shoppers, part of the 500,000 that Roosevelt Field draws weekly during the holidays, about double its regular traffic. **********A Story About Santa **********And no matter how hard the mall's administration tries, some glitches occur. Roosevelt Field is featuring two Santa Clauses this year, one at each end of the mall. The center's management carefully instructs each Santa that children could be disillusioned if both were seen together. The instructions, therefore, are that when one Santa goes up the escalator, the other is to use the elevator. **********But one bright 8-year-old who had just left one Santa, raced up an escalator to catch the other coming down on the opposite side. ''I just saw you back there,'' the boy said, apparently not too disillusioned. ''How did you get here so fast?'' **********At the Galleria in White Plains, Martin C. Lally, general manager of the 150-store center, reported an average 15 percent increase in seasonal sales. ''Our night traffic is stronger than usual,'' he said. ''We're planning to stay open until 8 P.M. Christmas Eve, against 6:30 normally, and if the weather holds up, that should be the biggest day of the year.'' **********The Galleria has had ''tremendous traffic'' when it wasn't raining, and ''an exceptional'' weekend, Mr. Lally said. The crush of customers at times defied merchants' ability to serve them. At one point, for instance, The Glass Oven, a bakery in the mall, ran out of dough. The baker had to start working at 3 o'clock the next morning to knead a new batch. **********In Brooklyn, at the Kings Plaza Shopping Center, the two main stores, Macy's and Alexander's, had heavy traffic yesterday. A center spokesman said, ''The season is very positive here so far and things look promising.'' **********And the 4,800-car parking lot at the Bergen Mall, in Paramus, N.J., was also packed yesterday. The main stores, Stern's and Ohrbach's, and 80 smaller ones are having ''a very good season,'' according to Lois Grillo, a mall executive. **********The mall was enjoying ''more consistently good business'' than a year ago when things ''quieted down'' in mid-December, she said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/19/business/patentsstacy-v-jones-improving-production-of-dna.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-11-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 182, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PatentsStacy V.

Sand rejected the request. The documents had been subpoenaed by a Federal grand jury investigating possible tax evasion by Marc Rich & Company A.G., which was the parent firm of March Rich International. **********Instead, the judge ordered Marc Rich International to turn over all requested documents in the United States by the close of business yesterday. **********And he gave the firm until Monday morning to produce any remaining documents under subpoena. Most of the other documents are in Zug, Switzerland, where Marc Rich International had been based before it was sold and renamed Clarendon Ltd., itself now based in Zug. **********''By 10 A.M. Monday, New York time, the documents must be in transit,'' the judge said at a hearing at the United States Court House in lower Manhattan.  Hauling Documents to Court **********It was not immediately clear if Clarendon had complied with the court's request to relinquish some documents yesterday. Sources close to the case, however, said that about 5 P.M. workmen began hauling boxes of documents from Clarendon's 650 Fifth Avenue headquarters to the courthouse in Manhattan. **********Prosecutors and defense attorneys spent more than an hour yesterday fighting over how long it should take to produce all the documents. The Government began subpoenaing the papers in March 1982 as part of its investigation into whether Marc Rich A.G. had used an oil pricing scheme to reduce its 1981 United States income taxes. **********At one point in the hearing, Peter Fleming Jr., a Clarendon attorney, suggested that it would be imprudent to heed the Government's request to transport documents from Switzerland without photocopying them because the documents could be lost. ''Suppose the plane crashed,'' Mr. Fleming said. **********''I think one way to avoid that would be to have Mr. Fleming on the plane,'' responded Jane W. Parver, an Assistant United States Attorney in charge of the Major Crimes unit. **********''I don't want to take that risk,'' Mr. Fleming said. One-Day Extension **********In making his order to produce some documents by the end of business yesterday, Judge Sand in effect gave Clarendon a one-day extension. The judge had originally said that documents in the United States had to be in prosecutors' hands by Tuesday. He ordered that deadline after United States agents, acting on a late-night tip Monday, halted a jet at John F. Kennedy International Airport and seized two steamer trunks crammed with documents that they said came under the subpoena.  At yesterday's hearing, attorneys for Clarendon told the judge that they had been unable to meet his Tuesday deadline because its clerical staff simply did not have enough time to duplicate the papers. The attorneys asked to deliver all papers, in and outside the United States, by Aug. 22. **********Judge Sand, however, angered by what he considered delaying tactics, refused the requests. **********''We are not dealing here with a mom-and-pop grocery store,'' Judge Sand said. ''We are dealing here with a worldwide commodity-trading firm, which, I have been told, uses telexes, telephones - in short, all the devices of modern communication.'' **********After hearing a request from Clarendon attorneys that the attorneys be permitted to travel to Switzerland, where Clarendon is based, and assemble documents themselves, the judge said, ''I can't begrudge anyone wanting a trip to Switzerland.'' But he added, ''What I am trying to suggest is that 99 percent of the documents in question can be produced by a reasonably intelligent secretary or clerk. It doesn't require legal skills or your supervision until a later date.'' **********Clarendon attorneys had until 9:30 A.M. yesterday to review documents in the heavy, black steamer trunks seized at the airport. But the attorneys permitted the deadline to pass, and the trunks were placed in the custody of the prosecutors. **********According to Miss Parver, the documents in the trunks, which were sealed after being taken from the plane, will be given to the grand jury investigating Marc Rich A.G.

West and Prof. Dennis E. Logue of Dartmouth questioned our ideas about managers' role in our nation's faltering industrial competitiveness (''The False Doctrines of Productivity,'' Jan.9, and ''A Plea to Reject Economic Fashion,'' Jan.16). While we welcome debate on these issues, we believe that their comments are misleading in a number of important respects. **********Their case rests on three main arguments: American managers cannot be criticized for short-term thinking because investment in plant and equipment has actually been increasing over the period we consider; the degree of management responsibility for our current industrial problems can be appraised through the analysis of a few financial indices, and such financial tools as discounted cash flow analysis cannot be blamed for our faltering competitiveness because they are in no way biased against long-term investment. **********Mr. West and Mr. Logue begin by pointing out that the rate of growth in manufacturing investment was greater between 1972 and 1980 than in earlier years. They argue that this is evidence of United States management's long-term orientation, and chide others to ''look at the facts.'' Let's do that. **********Investment in manufacturing plant and equipment is highly cyclical, and accurate comparisons across time periods are possible only if one's numbers are based on similar points in the business cycle. The figures cited by Mr. West and Mr. Logue extend from the bottom of one cycle (1972) to the top of another (1980), leading to a clear overstatement of the increase in investment relative to long-term averages. **********A less-biased comparison would look at periods whose end dates were all at similar points in the business cycle. Comparing investment in the 1960-1970 decade (from peak to peak in the cycle) with investment in the 1970-1980 period (also peak to peak) shows that the growth in manufacturers' investment in plant and equipment has actually slowed substantially. Between 1960 and 1970, these peak expenditures increased by roughly 100 percent; between 1970 and 1980, the increase was only 50 percent. Valley expenditures showed a similar trend. **********More worrisome, Mr. West and Mr. Logue use figures for gross investment rather than net investment, which more accurately reflects additions to our capital stock over and above replacement needs. Increasing sales and workers, for example, usually require additional investment. The ratio of net equipment investment to G.N.P., which corrects for these factors, has clearly declined in recent years: from 0.022 in 1965-69 to 0.019 in 1970-74, to 0.018 in 1975-79. **********Unfortunately, even if we are investing as much as we formerly were, there would still be problems if our international competitors are investing more in capital equipment and are doing so more wisely. They are! For example, the Japanese auto producer invests about $50,000 per worker, while ours invest roughly $40,000. Moreover, the level of investment in auto production is higher than that in most other United States industries. **********The second argument made by Mr. West and Mr. Logue - that management responsibility for our problems can be determined by analyzing a few financial indices - is really related to their first. But it is both dangerous and misleading to hinge an argument over solutions to American competitive problems on the interpretation of historical plant and equipment ratios or research and development rates. The time has passed when managers could stand in fortress America and render judgments based upon how we used to do it. More forwardlooking strategic and competitive analysis is required; the alternative is complacency. **********Their third and final argument is that discounted cash flow and other financial techniques are neutral in application. Our field research shows quite the opposite, that in practice such techniques exhibit subtle and systematic biases that emphasize short-run over long-run investments. **********This bias arises partly because discounting techniques tend to be used by managers as a decision rule - a yes/ no basis for judging investment proposals - rather than as simply one more source of information to be evaluated in making investment decisions. The existence of such a screen often chokes off discussion of new projects at fairly low levels within the organization, where a new investment's strategic impact is seldom fully appreciated. It also creates an incentive to distort one's estimates in order to meet the desired rate of return. We continue to believe that for certain kinds of projects, like research and development programs, such financial tools have become more of a liability than a benefit.  WILLIAM J. NATHY ROBERT H.

Deutsch of Harvard University cautioned that the ''experience of 1929-1933 showed that there are traditional, accepted forms of economic policy that are meant to stabilize the economy, while destabilizing society itself.'' **********''It was a problem then, it is a problem now,'' he said.  The often highly charged discussions, which took place in the reconstructed Central Hall of the Reichstag, a stone's throw from the wall that divides East and West Berlin, ended this afternoon with an emotional debate in which some historians aggressively defended postwar West Germany against the charge that it failed to come to grips with its Nazi past by repressing the memory of Nazi atrocities. **********Hitler Became Chancellor in '33 **********The conference, which was attended by some 1,200 people, about onethird of them professional historians from several countries, was a central event in West Germany's commemoration of Jan. 30, 1933, when Germany's aged President, Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg, named Hitler as Chancellor. **********From the beginning, plans for the commemoration have been clouded by controversy, involving charges that West Berlin's conservative government eliminated financing for events with a leftist slant. **********The conference was organized by Berlin's Historical Commission, the Institute for Contemporary History, in Munich, and the German Society for Parliamentary Questions, in Bonn. **********On Friday, parallels between the economic crisis of the early 1930's and current economic difficulties emerged in discussions centering on the causes for Germany's economic crisis that paved the way for Hitler. **********Prof. Knut Borchardt of Munich University argued that German industrialists were driven to accept Hitler because excessive wage increases in the 1920's, which outstripped productivity growth, diminished industry profits and created the widespread unemployment that preceded the Nazi takeover. Cuts in Government Spending **********Other historians, however, said Germany's persistence in stabilizing its economy by reducing Government spending, a recipe favored by some economists today, produced the disastrous unemployment situation. **********''Why was there no Government spending?'' asked Gerald Feldman, an American historian.  Prof. Hans Mommsen of Bochum University in West Germany, said, ''Even if its real effect was limited, it might have boosted confidence and halted the downward spiral.'' **********In discussions today centering on European diplomacy in the years before World War II, Professor Deutsch said world leaders then were victims of a ''cognitive catastrophe'' caused by a ''chain reaction of ignorance.'' **********''Britain allowed Germany to rebuild its air force, not knowing that the planes would one day bomb Coventry,'' he said. ''Russia signed a pact with Germany, not knowing that German armies would one day devastate Russia itself.'' Another example, he said, was America's ignorance of Japanese intentions to bomb Pearl Harbor. An Emotional Debate **********Noting similarities with current conditions, Mr. Deutsch said European leaders in the 1930's were ''like drivers on a fog-shrouded superhighway; they simply refused to slow down, before there was a massive collision.'' **********In a lecture closing the discussion today, Hermann Lubbe, a professor of history at Zurich University, sparked an emotional debate and some booing and catcalls by asserting that what seemed like West German silence about its Nazi past in the 1950's was the ''necessary quiet within which the subjects of the Nazi Reich could be transformed into the people of the Federal Republic.'' **********Charles Maier, a historian at Harvard, called the speech a ''scandal,'' adding, ''You don't end a conference recalling the rise of Nazism by saying, but we were right to forget about it for 20 years.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/30/business/advertisingn-r-kleinfield-computers-take-aim-at-schools.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-08-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 579, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AdvertisingN.

The company recently set up a United States subsidiary, the Acorn Computers Corporation, in Woburn, Mass., with the intent of emerging as the leader in school sales. **********Most computer companies sell to all markets. Schools mean no more to them than any other market, sometimes less. Although Acorn, too, will sell its system to anyone willing to pay for it, the company plans to position itself as a specialist in education. In its ads, it calls its product ''the only computer that majors in education.'' **********To implant Acorn in the educator's consciousness, the ad agency of Levine, Huntley, Schmidt & Beaver has drummed up a $3 million-plus advertising and marketing campaign that begins next Tuesday. Full-page ads will appear in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Boston Globe, and additional ads will follow in a variety of educational journals and computer publications. Acorn is also setting up learning centers at dealers to teach potential customers about the system. **********The ads are decidedly nontechnical. They stress the fact that Acorn alone is specializing in the educational field and play off Acorn's success on the other side of the Atlantic. **********The computer is called the British Broadcasting Corporation's Microcomputer System. Designed by educators at Cambridge University, it won a competition staged by the British Government designed to further computer literacy. **********It will sell for a suggested list price of $995. The computer is essentially the same one sold in Britain, which has captured more than 80 percent of the British school market. Built into it are voice synthesis, color graphics, word processing and a local-area networking capability that allows it to be connected to other machines. **********When Acorn decided it wanted to come over here, members of the Levine, Huntley agency rolled up their sleeves and did a market overview of the computer field. Among other things, they found that computers had an estimated market penetration of 30 percent in the education field in 1981 but that that was projected to expand to 86 percent by 1986. That sounded good. **********Levine, Huntley also liked the fact that rival computer makers did not zero in on education, leaving a niche open for Acorn. ''We're trying to present them as an educational company, not a computer manufacturer,'' said Harold Levine, the chairman of the agency. **********Though deliveries of the computer will not start until next month, Acorn says that it has already lined up $8 million worth of business and expects to sell 30,000 to 50,000 systems in its first year in this country. Before long, it hopes to be the market leader. **********At the moment, Commodore enjoys an estimated 32 percent of the education market, the most of any manufacturer, while Apple has 28 percent and Tandy 14 percent. **********Acorn expects to have some 200 software packages available next month for use with its system, and eventually to compile a library of 800 titles. To make sure the software is just what teachers want, the company has established an Educational Advisory Board, composed of national educators, to write guidelines and then review software packages."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/29/world/andropov-s-pre-eminence-is-stressed-on-soviet-tv.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-12-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 659, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ANDROPOV'S PRE-EMINENCE IS STRESSED ON SOVIET TV", "print_headline": "ANDROPOV'S PRE-EMINENCE IS STRESSED ON SOVIET TV", "body_text": " **********Yuri V.

One came in an unusual show of backing for Mr. Andropov that formed the centerpiece of the evening television news. **********About 20 minutes of the half-hour show was given over to film of voters in a Moscow electoral district nominating Mr. Andropov as a candidate in the single-slate elections for a new Supreme Soviet scheduled for March. Although such sequences have been shown in the past, there has rarely been such emphasis on an otherwise routine event. **********Another indication of concern to shore up confidence in his leadership came when a reporter for United Press International approached a senior Soviet official outside the Supreme Soviet chamber in the Kremlin. **********A United Press International dispatch based on the discussion identified the official as a member of the Central Committee staff and quoted him as having said that Mr. Andropov was recovering in a hospital from an illness that would not have required hospitalization for a younger man. **********According to the dispatch, the official sought to play down the seriousness of the ailment by saying that, contrary to Western reports, the problem was not related to the kidneys. **********The official said the situation was ''complicated'' by the party leader's age.

''The money just isn't in the till,'' said a power system spokesman, after the system had informed Chemical Bank that it could not pay its debts on partially completed nuclear plants Nos. 4 and 5.

Nevertheless, three regionals have eschewed the Bell name for a more high-tech flavor: Nytex (New England and New York), U S West (14 Western states) and Ameritech (five Middle Western states). **********The rush for Texas banks by Texas banks is on. Mergers are being announced almost weekly.

Next Texas Commerce Bancshares made an unfriendly offer for Texas American Bancshares - a potential $23 billion combination. (Texas America rejected the bid of $50 a share but did not rule out a higher price.) Now First City Bancorp is buying Cullen/Frost Bankers for $288 million, creating a $19.6 billion unit. Analysts say fears of competition from financial services companies such as Sears Roebuck and the approach of interstate banking has sparked the merger mania. **********Drysdale Indictments. Two officers of the defunct Drysdale Government Securities Corporation and a former senior partner at Arthur Andersen & Company were indicted on criminal charges by a New York grand jury. Joseph V. Ossorio, Drysdale's charmain, and David J. Heuwetter, its chief trader, were accused of stealing more than $270 million from the Chase Manhattan Bank and $20 million from Manufacturers Hanover. Warren Essner, the accountant, was charged with issuing false financial statements, which failed to show the firm was ''insolvent the day it opened for business,'' in February 1982, according to Robert Morgenthau, Manhattan District Attorney. **********Washington Wrapup. The Government will sell the 14.4 million Chrysler warrants it owns to the public and not give them back to the auto maker, as Lee Iacocca had asked. The sale will bring in some $200 million ... The House and Senate passed a bill that would kill the withholding tax on interest and dividends. President Reagan is expected to sign it ... The Soviet Union agreed to buy at least nine million metric tons a year of American wheat for the next five years. The new grain agreement is 50 percent larger than the one that expired in 1981. On the news, grain prices rose sharply ... The Government's index of leading indicators rose 1 percent in June, its 11th increase in the last 12 months. **********Steel Band. United States Steel reported a $112 million quarterly loss. At the same time the company said it had pretax profits of $167 million, which were consumed by taxes, interest payments and other expenses. Bethelehem Steel had grimmer news, a $92.7 million loss and no good pretax results. If U.S. Steel can import steel from Britain, Wheeling-Pittsburgh says it can import steel from Brazil.  The No.8 steelmaker is negotiating a $40 million deal with Brazil's state-owned steel company. **********The Return of Detroit. New car sales by the Big Three rose 38 percent in mid-July, and General Motors and Ford Motor reported huge profits, continuing the trend set by Chrysler the week before.  G.M.'s second-quarter surplus totaled $1.02 billion, almost double the year-earlier period, and Ford's earnings were $542.2 million, more than double its 1982 quarter. The weak No.4, American Motors, reported a loss of $79 million in the second quarter. **********Problems are brewing for Ford, however.

''They've changed around the Plaza Venezuela five times in the last 30 years,'' Andres Duarte Vivas, a businessman here, said of one of the city's historic squares. **********''This is the Latin city that's not really here,'' a diplomat said. ''It's like some of the Arab oil capitals. Money has moved it.'' In Caracas's case that is not all bad. It does not have the wrenching poverty of other Latin American cities, and social tensions are lower. But it also does not have the graciousness of fellow Andean capitals like Quito, Bogota and La Paz. There are fewer quaintly offered courtesies here and more people in a hurry. **********''I saw a traffic jam at 5:45 this morning, and I haven't heard anyone say 'thank you' yet, so I must be back in Caracas,'' an American returning here from abroad one recent morning told a local friend. **********Despite a network of multilevel highways and elaborate cloverleafs, the vehicular snarls of Caracas are the stuff of legend. There are certain times of day that people simply cannot venture to get one place from another, although even such planning doesn't always help. **********''I remember talking to traffic experts once, and they told me that Caracas was a city where congestion never really peaks, it just rose and fell 10 percent,'' said Kim Fuad, director of the Englishlanguage newspaper, The Daily Journal. **********Many Caraquenos drive with their left arms out the window ready to plead with a neighboring motorist for entry into another lane. The fact that the gesture works, however, testifies to a patience and politeness among drivers in Caracas not seen elsewhere in Latin America. Here cars slow down instead of speeding up when they spot stranded pedestrians trying to cross the street. **********The local statistics have led people like former Planning Minister Ricardo Martinez to despair, ''There is no solution for Caracas's problems.'' There are more than 600,000 automobiles to clog its arteries, and nearly four million people live here. By the year 2000 it is expected that there will be six million people. **********The mountains that ring the city prohibit any spreading out of the population beyond the 77-square-mile basin, and the only direction to move has been up. More than 40 percent of Caracas's residents live in high-rises. Another 30 percent inhabit brick buildings in chockablock hillside slums known as ranchos. **********Jobs and relatively high wages attracted thousands of immigrants here from Colombia, Ecuador, the Dominican Republic, Guyana and Trinidad. ''This was a responsibility that no other Latin city has had to take on,'' Arturo Uslar Pietri, a leading Venezuelan intellectual, said. ''One of the ranchos is called Guayaquilito, and in another, they hoist the Colombian flag each morning.'' **********Aura Mayoral, a former television producer, said her channel used to have trouble conducting opinion-gauging interviews in the street because so many people who were stopped downtown were not Venezuelans. **********City fathers have made headway in recent years in improving public services that regularly used to leave vast sections of Caracas without power or water. Garbage no longer clutters streets as it once did since private haulers were contracted to cart it away. By the end of March, 8.7 miles of a proposed 26-mile-long subway will be functioning. **********A year-round mean temperature of 68.4 degrees, average humidity of 78 percent and a steady breeze justifies Caraquenos' claim to living in ''eternal springtime,'' even if the only things permanently in bud seem to be new high-rises. **********In fact, in those parts of the city that concrete has not covered over, wild orchids, acacias and other flowers bloom in such abundance that the guide to the city published by the Venezuelan American Association of University Women includes a list of varieties that are dangerous. Eating the seeds of a tree called the monkey cup, it warns, can cause baldness. **********A Swiss-built cable car used to carry people up past the flowering hillsides of the 7,000-foot-high Avila overlooking the city and down the far slope to the Caribbean shore, but it broke down in 1977 and has been in disrepair since. The Effect of Oil **********The case is one that is repeated through many reaches of modern-day Venezuelan life. Oil money gave the country access to expensive equipment, but the management skills were not here to keep the machinery functioning. **********''Petroleum killed off our creativity, our imagination and our productiveness,'' said Valmore Acevedo, a member of the Venezuelan Senate. **********He and his colleagues legislate in a lovely complex of period architecture, one of only several left in Caracas. In front is the leafy Plaza Bolivar surrounding an equestrian statue of the Liberator, who was born 200 years ago in a house just blocks away that is one of the city's few genuine tourist attractions. **********Pollution has driven off many of the original birds of the valley, and pigeons have taken their place. Their favorite roosting spot is the top of the statue itself, and Caraquenos enjoy pointing out that Bolivar's head is turned to the side and his expression is squeamish.  'City of the Red Roofs' **********Each morning Henrique Winckeljohann, a 70-year-old retired Government worker and native of Caracas, puts a flower in his lapel, sets his fedora at a rakish angle and comes to the plaza. ''I'm taking care of my Liberator,'' he said. ''I tried to persuade the Government to put repellent on the statue. Imagine that happening to the greatest man of the Americas.'' **********Like many Caraquenos, he spoke longingly of the ''city of the red roofs'' that no longer exists. ''One problem here is that we all talk about the city that was, not the one that is,'' Mr. Fuad, the newspaperman, said. **********That could change now that new @foreign-exchange controls have reduced the value of Venezuelan currency by 78 percent against the dollar and made frequent escapes from the city much more expensive.  Its movers and shakers will be spending more time here. **********Though its quality of life is superior to other overgrown Latin American boom towns like Mexico City and Sao Paulo, Caracas enjoys the worst reputation with outsiders, and local residents also seem to delight in complaining about it. There is no ''I Love Caracas'' spirit around. **********The French resident said she knew a French couple who recently filled an evening's conversation with gripes about living in Caracas. ''Finally I asked them how long they had stayed here,'' she said.  ''You know what they said?

''Barry is probably the most successful executive in the film business today, and deservedly so,'' said Robert Montgomery of Paul Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, a leading entertainment lawyer, who has usually been on the opposite side of negotiations from Mr. Diller. **********''Unlike other studios, Paramount has proved that a conglomerate can own a movie company and do it successfully,'' noted Arthur Rockwell, an analyst with Crowell, Weedon, a Los Angeles brokerage firm. **********Now, Mr. Diller's challenge is to duplicate that record with the other entertainment companies that make up one of the three divisions into which Mr. Davis, the successor to the late Mr. Bluhdorn, partitioned the company earlier this month. The others are financial services and consumer products. **********Which of the three groups emerges as the largest and most important, after the divestitures planned by Mr. Davis, remains to be seen. Many analysts believe that the financial-services group has more potential for growth than does entertainment. Still, Mr. Diller is generally regarded as one of the three key executives at Gulf and Western under Mr. Davis - who himself is a former chief operating officer of Paramount.  The foundation of the leisure-time group remains Paramount, which accounted for more than half of the group's $1.4 billion in revenues in the 1982 fiscal year; Paramount's contribution to the group's operating profits of $118.3 million were not disclosed, but analysts suspect that it was disproportionately large. **********The group now also includes Simon & Schuster, the book publisher; Madison Square Garden, which has the New York Knickerbockers, New York Rangers and cable television programming; the software design and research remains of Sega Enterprises; and Famous Music Corporation, a music publishing company. **********WHATEVER changes Mr. Diller makes in those businesses, he will make gradually, he emphasized. And he is not giving away whatever plans he has formed. He does acknowledge that he has ambitions for Simon & Schuster, and he turned down a feeler from by its president, Richard Snyder, to buy the company. The publisher, which has concentrated in trade and mass-market books, including the Silhouette romances, should ''become a leader in textbooks,'' probably through acquisition, Mr. Diller said. **********He also disclosed that he has discussed the possibility of starting ''from the ground up'' some consumer magazines. And he confirmed that he is negotiating to buy Time Inc.'s share of USA Network, an advertiser-supported cable network in which Paramount is a partner with Time and MCA, the parent of Universal Studios. Paramount is still seeking a way to compete in cable with Time's powerful Home Box Office, following the recent collapse, under the weight of the Justice Department's antitrust division, of its would-be consortium with MCA, Warner Brothers, Showtime and The Movie Channel. **********Mainly, however, Mr. Diller speaks of areas in which the companies, all of them in the entertainment and information business, can help each other. The ideal is ''Star Trek,'' the syndicated television series that yielded two hit movies, spun off a series of Simon & Schuster books and will result in a video game, to be released this fall. **********Mr. Diller has organized brainstorming sessions to explore more connections between movies and video games. Sega, in turn, can supply Simon & Schuster with educational and entertainment software to distribute, he said. And if it keeps the rights to its games, Madison Square Garden can be a source of programming for its own cable subscriber or for USA Network or for a regional pay-television network that might be established sometime in the undefined future. **********''I want to be in the rights business in everything,'' Mr. Diller said. ''Rights are programs, programs are ideas and ideas are value.'' **********One reason that such opportunities have been ignored in the past, Mr. Diller said, ''is that nobody had the knowledge'' of all the operation. For example, although Simon & Schuster published Jane Fonda's best-selling aerobic-exercise book, the enormously successful videocassette spun off by the book was produced elsewhere. **********On another occasion, two years ago, Madison Square Garden had proposed to sell its interest in USA Network, which was only breaking even, and had received a go-ahead from Gulf and Western, when Paramount ''luckily, luckily, by pure accident, heard about it,'' Mr. Diller recalled. ''And we said, 'You can't do it!' '' He scrambled to put together the three-way partnership. ''It was saved,'' he said, adding ruefully, ''there were a lot that were lost.'' **********At Paramount, Mr. Diller has had plenty of practice in both developing new properties and mining existing ones. By the time he arrived at Paramount - two years after its ''Godfather'' triumph, when it captured 22 percent of domestic theater rentals - the studio's fortunes had sunk. ''It took longer to turn than I expected,'' Mr. Diller said, and he contemplated resigning. Then, in 1978, the studio released ''Saturday Night Fever'' and ''Grease'' and took in 24 percent of domestic rentals. **********That was the last time, under Mr. Diller, that Paramount climbed to the top of the pole. But in each subsequent year, it has had enough reasonably successful films or an outright blockbuster to secure it second place in domestic rentals - the distributor's share of box-office receipts, after the exhibitor takes his percentage - among the major studios. **********In the movie industry, that is considered an extraordinary run. ''They never have a really bad year,'' said Mr. Montgomery, the lawyer. ''If there's no blockbuster, there are always two or three films that pull them through. Barry has a pretty sensible way of filling a schedule.'' **********This year's schedule is fairly exemplary. There were no pre-sold blockbusters, such as a sequel to ''Star Trek'' or to ''Raiders of the Lost Ark.'' But there was ''Flashdance,'' an unheralded movie with relatively unknown actors, that - like ''An Officer and a Gentleman'' last year - became an unexpected success. **********Such pictures are ''the kind of movie I love - inexpensive, with no heat,'' said Mr. Diller. A film with ''heat,'' he explained, is a sequel that has to meet the expectations raised by the first blockbuster. Next summer will bring two ''hot'' movies: ''Star Trek 3'' and ''Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,'' a sequel to ''Raiders,'' budgeted at a reported $30 million. Will they be blockbusters? ''You won't hear those words from my mouth,'' he vowed. **********PARAMOUNT'S winning streak is more than luck, Mr. Diller said, but neither does he have a formula for picking the right films. ''In my opinion, you have more assurance of succeeding with a movie because you believe in it,'' he said, ''than if you make it because you believe it has the elements, such as the right names, to succeed.'' **********But at the same time, he hedges his bets. The stellar example of creative movie financing is Paramount's ''Reds,'' whose $38 million budget was provided through a tax-leasing deal with Barclays Bank in Britain. The ingenious financing method, combined with an unforeseen change in dollar-sterling exchange rates, amply covered the cost of a film that otherwise ''broke even, plus change,'' Mr. Diller said. ''I'm proud we made 'Reds,' '' he added. ''I'm also proud we protected ourselves in every way known to man.'' **********ANOTHER factor behind Paramount's enviable moviemaking **********record, according to experts, is the company's expertise in marketing and distributing its films. ''Paramount is probably the strongest distributor out there,'' said Mr. Rockwell of Crowell, Weedon. ''They have the relationships with the exhibitors and they know what tracks - tiers of theaters - to pick.'' Paramount's consistently good performance has also endeared it to exhibitors, he added. **********Paramount, and Mr. Diller, have also been cited for expertise in promoting new films, particularly movies - such as ''Flashdance,'' ''Grease'' or ''Staying Alive'' - from which the soundtrack is played on radio and MTV to attract interest.  ''Every time Paramount opens a film, it's like a St. Patrick's Day parade,'' said Mr. Murphy of the University of Southern California. ''There's no doubt a Paramount film has opened.'' And while it advertises heavily, Paramount favors spots on local television over upfront network buys, as a more efficient way of reaching its target audience. **********The box office is only part of any movie's income, of course, and Paramount is good at tapping other sources. United International Pictures, a two-year-old partnership of Paramount, MGM/UA and Universal for the distribution of their films abroad, is very profitable, according to analysts. **********In the video cassette business, a relatively new source of revenue for movie companies, Paramount has taken the lead in slashing prices and making up in volume what it loses in margin. The strategy, combined with a succession of hit movies, has paid off: Paramount has two of the top three best-selling cassettes (''48 Hours'' and ''An Officer and a Gentleman'') and 6 of the 20 most popular rentals (''48 Hours,'' ''Officer,'' ''Airplane,'' ''Airplane 2,'' ''Grease'' and ''Star Trek 2''). **********Historically, Paramount has also been one of the strongest movie studios in the production of made-for-television movies and series, with ''Winds of War,'' ''Shogun,'' ''Joanie Loves Chachi,'' ''Happy Days,'' ''Laverne & Shirley'' and ''Taxi.'' Those series were even more valuable as syndication properties; Paramount has received windfalls from the syndication of ''Star Trek,'' ''Mork & Mindy,'' ''Happy Days'' and ''Laverne & Shirley.'' **********When it made its selections for the fall season recently, however, the networks chose only two of Paramount's 13 proffered pilots, and canceled three hours. As a result, this autumn Paramount will have only two and a half hours on the networks, including holdovers ''Cheers,'' ''Family Ties'' and ''Happy Days.'' ''That's a rather poor performance for Paramount,'' said Mr. Rockwell of Crowell, Weedon. Mr. Diller agreed. **********''We have to be competitive in that area, and we will be,'' he said, noting that he had named a new head of television production. But meeting network demands, he said, ''just wore us down. We'll service them, but I'd rather deepen in other areas.'' **********The area Mr. Diller has in mind is the production of original programming for syndication to independent stations. Its two earliest ventures - ''Solid Gold,'' a weekly one-hour music-and-dance show, and ''Entertainment Tonight,'' a daily half-hour entertainment news program - can be as lucrative as the syndication of ''Happy Days,'' Mr. Diller said, and their success has inspired him to plan a more ambitious schedule. **********In the autumn, he will add ''Taking Advantage,'' a business program made with McGraw-Hill. By next summer, Mr. Diller hopes to put together a mini- network, a three-hour block of entertainment - including a two-hour theatrical film or a Paramount made-for-television-movie, and an hour of Paramount- produced situation comedy or dramatic series - and sell it to a large number of independent stations, to be broadcast in prime time. **********''I want to make our own things and put them on the air,'' he said. **********FROM SMALL TOBIG SCREEN **********In an era when virtually every movie company chief executive seems to be a lawyer or a former talent agent, Barry Diller is an exception. Born in San Francisco, he dropped out of U.C.L.A. after four months - ''I always knew I wanted to get into entertainment'' - and worked briefly in the lower echelons of William Morris, the talent agency, before joining the American Broadcasting Companies in 1966. **********Until he joined Paramount eight years later, Mr. Diller spent his career at ABC, rising to vice president in charge of prime- time entertainment. At the age of 26, Mr. Diller made his reputation by pioneering a new form of programming, ''The Movie of the Week,'' a 90-minute feature that ABC bought for only $400,000, half of what the networks had been paying for two-hour made- for-television movies. In 1972, he introduced another innovation, the mini-series, and secured rights to ''Roots'' for ABC. **********Two years later, Gulf and Western Industries' Charles Bluhdorn hired Mr. Diller as chairman and chief executive of Paramount Pictures, leapfrogging him over Frank Yablans, then its president. Mr. Yablans, now vice chairman and chief operating officer of MGM/UA, resigned two months later. **********At the time, the rumor was that Mr. Yablans had been passed over because of an unflattering magazine article, but Mr. Diller maintains that he had already been discussing the move with Mr. Bluhdorn for several months. **********Although Mr. Diller's appointment was a surprise at the time, no one in the industry now questions his ability or dedication. He is widely described as brilliant, very hard-working and a tough negotiator. **********''A lot of people don't like him,'' said Robert Montgomery, an entertainment lawyer with Paul Weiss, who does not include himself in that group. ''They think he has a cruel mouth,'' he added, referring to remarks that Mr. Diller has made during heated negotiations. **********However, Mike Nichols, who has agreed to direct his next film, ''Heartburn,'' at Paramount, describes Mr. Diller as ''fair and enthusiastic and supportive. He knows as much about how you make a picture,'' Mr. Nichols added, ''as anyone at any studio.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/22/business/ex-brokerage-aide-enters-guilty-plea.html": {"writer_name": "Arnold Lubasch", "pub_date": "1983-12-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 487, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ex-Brokerage Aide Enters Guilty Plea", "print_headline": "Ex-Brokerage Aide Enters Guilty Plea", "body_text": " **********A former stock-dividend manager for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. pleaded guilty in Manhattan yesterday to Federal charges involving the embezzlement of more than $18 million. **********The guilty plea was made by John Efler, who was described by Federal prosecutors as ''the central figure'' in the huge embezzlement from Prudential-Bache.

The breakup will mean innumerable changes for consumers and businesses. In question and answer form, here is a discussion of those changes: **********Making Some Sense of the Divestiture **********Q. Much of the discussion of the **********A.T.& T. divestiture suggests **********that it will create many problems. Does breaking up the company really make sense? **********A. It is probably fair to say that none of the parties to the antitrust suit envisioned the outcome quite the way that it has turned out. **********The divestiture plan that finally resulted has been criticized on many counts. Some other plan could undoubtedly have been devised, but no plan would have pleased everyone. To some people, no change would seem a more attractive alternative than the current plan. But it is unlikely that the Bell System would have remained in place forever. Increased competition and other changes were beginning to occur even before the breakup was agreed upon. **********Q. Will the divestiture help or **********harm consumers? **********A. Individuals are likely to find the results a mixed bag, with some changes that are to their benefit and some that are not. **********On the positive side, consumers are likely to find more choice in telephone equipment as well as lower prices on that equipment. The quality of long- distance service offered by some of A.T.& T.'s lower-priced competitors should improve in the next few years, as well. And A.T.& T.'s long-distance rates are likely to fall. **********On the negative side, there is sure to be widespread confusion, particularly in the short run. Consumers are also likely to find it inconvenient to have to deal with more than one vendor when they are used to going to one company for everything. Long-distance directory assistance calls may carry a 75-cent charge per call, and local phone rates may rise more quickly than they may have. **********Q. The United States has the **********best phone service in the world. **********Is this going to deteriorate with **********the breakup? **********A. There is no easy answer to this question. There have been some slip- ups in recent months. But A.T.& T. has had to do two jobs at once - maintaining service at the same time it was coping with divestiture. Some recent service problems are also directly attributable to a strike this summer at A.T.& T. It is hard to predict how well the system will work once divestiture is complete and the companies can concentrate on operations. A.T.& T. executives say there is no reason why service should not be as good as before, but some observers are skeptical. **********Q. Will individual users be affected directly by the breakup? **********A. Yes. In the past, users could deal with one company - A.T.& T. - for everything related to telephone service. Now there will be different companies for buying a phone, paying phone bills, ordering phone service, requesting repairs. The phone bill will reflect this splintering, with separate pages, and in some cases separate bills, for local service, for long-distance services and for equipment rental, if applicable. **********Q. Which company will provide **********what services? **********A. The local phone company - the same one customers have always dealt with - will continue to handle local service matters. It will continue to be responsible for dial tones, for the telephone lines leading to individual phones and repairs on those lines, for local service, and for local directory listings. While the local company will be responsible for connecting customers to the phone system, it will not necessarily provide the phones themselves. But phones will be available in many places, and after buying or renting one, the customer can simply plug it into a jack. **********For long- distance service, the customer will have to go to a different company altogether, either the new A.T.& T. or one of its competitors, such as MCI or GTE-Sprint. **********The First Big Choice: Rent or Buy? **********Q. Where will telephones be **********sold? **********A. Phones are being sold in as many places, and in much the same way, as other consumer goods. They are available in electronics stores such as Radio Shack, in department or discount stores, such as Gimbels or K Mart, in specialized phone equipment stores, such as the Phone Center stores run by the new A.T.& T., and even by mail order. Some local phone companies will be selling equipment as well as service. **********Phone prices range from less than $10 for simple models to hundreds of dollars for sophisticated phones that might store certain numbers and offer automatic dialing. **********Q. Will rental phones still be **********available, or will everyone have **********to buy a phone after Jan. 1? **********A. On Jan. 1, the telephones that have been rented to users by the local phone companies will become the property of the new A.T.& T. Consumers will be given the option of continuing to rent, buying the telephone, or turning in the telephone and buying one elsewhere. A.T.& T. must continue to lease phones at least through Jan. 1, 1986, and other companies may offer rented phones as well. **********Those wishing to continue to rent phones from A.T.& T. will not have to do anything differently. The monthly rate, however, may change. In the past, local companies each set their own charges. Now, A.T.& T. will have one set of national rates. A traditional rotary phone, for example, will cost $1.50 per month, while other types of phones will cost more. At least one state, New York, is allowing its local phone company to impose a monthly surcharge on the equipment rented from A.T.& T. **********In areas that have had relatively expensive monthly prices, the monthly rental charge will fall. But in areas where rates have been low, the rental rates will rise. **********Q. Does it still make sense to **********rent a telephone? **********A. Many types of phones can be purchased for less than the cost of renting one for a year or two. If it makes sense to rent any telephones, it may be the more expensive, sophisticated phones, particularly if technology keeps advancing and new features become available each year. People who do not want to be troubled by handling any repairs may also prefer to rent, since companies that rent phones generally assume responsibility for repairs. **********Q. What factors should be considered in choosing a telephone to **********buy? **********A. Selecting a telephone will be little different from buying a toaster or radio. The numerous products in the various stores will lend themselves to comparison shopping. There will probably be books and articles that talk about the products that are available and how to choose among them. As in any buying decision, shoppers will probably want to weigh price considerations against quality, and to take into account such factors as warranties and convenience and ease of repair. **********In addition, consumers seeking a Touch-Tone-type phone should make sure that a push-button phone produces the proper tones. Many types of phones with push buttons operate on a rotary system. **********Non-A.T.& T. phones have a Federal Communications Commission number, usually found on the bottom. That number should be registered with the local phone company when the phone is installed. **********Q. Is the phone provided by **********A.T.& T. really any different **********from the other, less expensive **********phones that are advertised? **********A. When all phones were owned by A.T.& T. and leased to customers, A.T.& T. found it in its best interest to build the sets to last at least 20 or 30 years. The plastic was thick enough to withstand repeated dropping and the phone could be sent back for reconditioning three or four times and still look like new. Connections were gold-plated to ensure that they, too, lasted. **********As phones become more of a consumer item, purchased by price-conscious shoppers, most companies - including A.T.& T. - are likely to build less expensive sets that do not last as long. There is nothing, however, to preclude one or more companies from making a sturdy telephone. **********Q. How can extensions be **********added? **********A. The local phone company can provide the extra outlet, but the telephone will not automatically be provided at the end of that line. Individuals may also install their own wire to create extensions. **********Q. What if an existing telephone is wired directly to a phone **********line instead of plugged into a **********jack? Will the phone company **********convert the line into one that can **********be plugged in? How much of a **********charge would there be, if any? **********A. If a phone is attached directly to a wire - known as hardwiring - rather than being plugged in, it probably does not matter unless it must be repaired, replaced or moved. The simplest way to detach the phone is just to cut the wire attached to the phone at some point close to the wall. **********The phone can be reattached in a number of ways. It can be hardwired again, or the hardwiring can be converted to a modular jack wth a kit that costs only a few dollars. All new telephones are likely to come with lines that plug into jacks.  PICK UP CONSUMER 2 **********When Something Doesn't Work  Q. What happens when there is **********a problem with a phone? **********A. First, it must be determined whether the problem is in the phone line or in the phone itself. If the problem is in the phone line, the local telephone company is responsible for fixing it, so long as the phone company has installed the line. If the problem is in the phone, the responsibility for fixing it depends on whether the phone is owned or leased. **********Q. How is it possible to tell **********whether the problem is in the **********phone or in the wire? **********A. If there is more than one telephone on the line, check all of them. If they all do not work, the problem is probably in the wire. If only one of them does not work, the problem may be in the phone, but not necessarily. With modular phones, try switching one that works with one that does not to check. **********If the problem appears to be in the wire, call 611 and the local phone company may be able to test it at no charge and put it back in service. **********If a telephone company repair person makes a service call and the problem turns out to be in the telephone rather than the wire, the repair person will not fix the phone but will still charge for the visit. **********Q. What about repairs on a leased phone? **********A. If the phone is leased from A.T.& T., a Phone Center store will replace it without charge. If no Phone Center store is convenient, the phone can be mailed to an A.T.& T. service center. **********Q. What about repairs on a pur chased phone? **********A. If the phone was purchased from a local phone company or from A.T.& T. Information Systems before Dec. 31, 1983, or if it was purchased from A.T.& T. at any time, the local A.T.& T. Phone Center or A.T.&T. service center can handle repairs. If the phone is still under warranty, it will be fixed or exchanged free of charge. **********If the phone is no longer covered by warranty, a Phone Center will exchange it - for a price - for a completely refurbished phone. The charge will depend on the type of phone. A traditional rotary phone, for example, would cost $29.95, while a Trimline Touch-Tone phone would cost $49.95. **********Another alternative for a phone purchased from A.T.& T. but no longer under warranty would be to send it to an A.T.& T. service center for repair. The charge, depending on the repair needed, would be between $12 and $22, plus postage. But only the specific problem will be corrected; no other work will be done. **********Q. How about repairs on phones not bought from A.T.& T.? **********A. Each manufacturer and each store has its own warranty and repair policies that should be considered at the time of purchase. **********Q: Is it really worth having a phone repaired, or is it better just to buy a new phone? **********A. This is a decision that must be made on a case-by-case basis. Factors to be taken into account include the original cost of the broken phone, the cost of a replacement phone, the estimated cost of repair, and the inconvenience involved. If the machine is very sophisticated and cost several hundred dollars and the problem is in a button, it probably makes sense to have it repaired. If, on the other hand, the phone is a simple one and the problem a serious one, it may make sense to get a new phone. **********The Bills: Some Higher, Some Lower **********Q. Does the breakup of A.T.& T. mean that the prices of local service and types of service will change? **********A. Each local telephone company will be free to devise and price the services it offers, with the approval of the state regulatory commission. Nothing in the divestiture plan decrees that types of service and prices must change, although local companies will probably have to place more emphasis on their own profitability in the future than they did when they were part of Ma Bell's brood. **********Q. Are rates going to rise? By how much? **********A. The average monthly phone bill today amounts to $37, of which $11.38 is for local service. Any increases in the near future are likely to be in local rates, and not long-distance rates. In fact, A.T.& T. has said that it will probably lower its long-distance rates by an average of 10.5 percent next spring. **********Local rates are likely to rise, although increases will vary from region to region. **********Q. Is it possible to find out what rate changes, if any, are sched uled in a particular area? **********A. The simplest way to find out is to ask the local phone company. Another alternative is to contact the state regulatory commission. **********Q. Will phone companies have to offer some kind of basic serv ice for people who cannot afford to pay higher prices? **********A. To date, there is no Federal rule requiring that companies offer such service. But most companies do offer some kind of inexpensive budget option. Phone company executives point out that nothing restricts such plans to people with low incomes, and often they are chosen by consumers who make limited numbers of local calls and find that this type of plan makes sense. **********Q. There's been a lot of talk about a plan to impose a new monthly telephone fee - or ac cess charge - on residential cus tomers. Is it really necessary? A. When it became apparent that the local phone companies would be spun off from A.T.& T., it also became apparent that their local charges alone would not provide sufficient revenues. **********In the past, when local service and long-distance service were provided by A.T.& T., a portion of the revenues collected for long-distance service was channeled to the local companies. Some say it is appropriate that long-distance companies pay for their use of the local lines used to complete a long-distance call. **********Now that the local phone companies will be independent from A.T.& T.'s long-distance service, an in-house transfer of funds is no longer feasible, although the money to help support the local companies and to pay for the long-distance companies' use of their lines must be collected, one way or the other. The sum could have been gathered entirely from A.T.& T. and other long-distance carriers, which would have collected it from their users through higher fees. But this presented a problem: Holding long-distance prices high would have encouraged heavy users to set up their own long-distance systems, a phenomenon known as bypass. **********Instead, the F.C.C. devised a system of access charges, under which the long-distance carriers would pay some fees to the local phone companies for use of their phone lines, and individual phone users would pay the rest. **********Q. Where does the access charge plan stand now? **********A. Originally, the F.C.C.'s access charge plan was to have been put into effect Jan. 1. It was pushed back, however, and is now set to take effect April 3, unless the F.C.C. changes its mind again or Congress intervenes. The House has passed a bill that would kill the $2-a-month residential access charge that is now called for, but the Senate has not yet taken up comparable legislation. **********Q. Will there continue to be a **********difference between what the local **********telephone company charges for **********rotary dial service and tone serv ice? How much will it be? **********A. Since each local telephone company sets its own rates, it is impossible to generalize. But to take one example, in New York, where there is a $2.09 additional monthly charge for tone service, New York Telephone has filed a proposal with state regulators to decrease that amount by 20 percent, to $1.67.

First, it must be determined whether the problem is in the phone line or in the phone itself.

What about repairs on a **********leased phone? **********A. If the phone is leased from A.T.& T., a Phone Center store will replace it without charge. If it is wired directly into a wall outlet, the wire can be cut so it can be brought in. The Phone Center will then exchange it for a phone with a plug-in wire. But then the socket at home will have to be converted with a jack kit. If no Phone Center store is convenient, the phone can be mailed to an A.T.& T. service center. **********Q. What about repairs on a purchased phone? **********A. If the phone was purchased from a local phone company or from A.T.& T. Information Systems before Dec. 31, 1983, or if it was purchased from A.T.& T. at any time, the local A.T.& T. Phone Center or A.T.&T. service center can handle repairs.

If the machine is very sophisticated and cost several hundred dollars and the problem is in a button, it probably makes sense to have it repaired. If, on the other hand, the phone is a simple one and the problem a serious one, it may make sense to get a new phone. **********More Options In Long-Distance **********Q. What kind of changes will **********occur with long-distance service? **********A. For now, A.T.& T. will continue to provide long-distance service as it has in the past. Technically, the local phone company will provide long-distance service within nearby areas, while long-distance companies will provide service over the longer stretches. **********What will change first is the billing. Long-distance calls will be included on a separate bill because A.T.& T. will no longer be related to the company that provides local phone service. For a while, at least, A.T.& T.'s long-distance bill will be included in the same envelope as the local phone bill because the local companies will be serving as billing agents for A.T.& T. **********Q. Where do the other long-distance companies come in? **********A. A growing number of companies offer long-distance service in competition with A.T.& T. The largest of these competitors are MCI and GTE- Sprint. **********Between now and 1986, the connections between these other long-distance companies and the local phone lines will be upgraded so they are comparable to those of A.T.& T. When that happens, the local company will notify consumers of their long-distance options with a request that within a three-month period one be selected. There is also likely to be an option where a consumer will be allowed to choose among multiple carriers by dialing a four-digit access number before the long-distance number. **********Q. What will happen to consumers who do not make a choice? **********A. In that case, the local phone company will decide which long-distance company will provide their service. At this time, it appears that some of the local companies may direct the business to A.T.& T., while others may try to divide the business proportionately among competing companies. **********Q. Once a long-distance provider is selected, can the selection be changed? **********A. Yes. But once other long-distance carriers have equal access to the local phone lines, it will be up to the local phone companies to decide whether to levy a fee when someone wants to change long-distance services. New York Telephone, for example, has filed a request that it be allowed to charge $26.21 each time a customer wants to shift. **********Q. How do the other long-distance services differ from **********A.T.& T.'s? **********A. Currently, there are several differences. The competing carriers offer less expensive service, but the quality of hookup is generally not as good as A.T.& T.'s and the service is not available to callers everywhere. Also, the other services can be used only with a tone phone, or with a tone converter that fits over the mouthpiece of a rotary phone. And users of the other services have to dial more digits. **********To use MCI, for example, a caller must dial a 7-digit local phone number to reach MCI, then a 5-digit code number, and finally the 10-digit long- distance number. **********In addition, the competing carriers generally do not offer operator assistance, so calls cannot be made person- to-person or collect. **********When the other long-distance carriers are given equal access, however, many of these differences are likely to disappear. **********Q. Should a user with an average long-distance phone bill of **********less than $20 a month switch to **********one of A.T.& T.'s competitors? **********A. It may pay at least to consider what the competitors offer, especially after their connections are of equal quality. But it may also pay to look at the competitive packages now if the quality of the connection is not of paramount importance. **********Information on the various calling packages can be found in advertisements or by calling some of the long- distance companies. **********Phone Credit Cards Changing, Too **********Q: Will customers who have **********Bell credit cards still be able to **********use them after Jan. 1? **********A: Yes. Some local companies may send out replacement cards, however. In January, the new A.T.& T. will also be sending its own new credit cards to 47 million customers now holding Bell System cards.

The Allied Stores Corporation had more than a fivefold surge in its net; the May Department Stores Company had 76.5 percent higher profits, and the Dayton-Hudson Corporation had a 4.6 percent earnings increase. **********''All the results showed that inventory and expenses are under excellent control and therefore there is a good flow-through of the relatively favorable sales performances,'' said Jeffrey M. Feiner, retail analyst for Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith. ''While the rate of the earnings gains for the remainder of 1983 isn't likely to be as great, we still look for industry profits to increase 15 to 20 percent this year over last year,'' Mr. Feiner said. **********K Mart **********K Mart, the second-largest retailer after Sears, Roebuck & Company, reported a $44.6 million profit, or 35 cents a share, for the quarter, up from $5.9 million, or 6 cents a share, in first quarter last year. It was the company's second-highest net for a first quarter since 1979's $45.6 million. **********First-quarter sales rose 9.2 percent, to $3.93 billion, from $3.6 billion in the comparable period last year.  Bernard M. Fauber, K Mart chairman, said that gross profit margins rose to 27.5 percent, compared with 27.1 percent, ''primarily due to benefits from K Mart's improved merchandising programs, increasing consumer demand and the lesser impact of inflation on our cost of merchandise sold.'' **********Sales at K Mart's comparable stores - those at least one year old -rose 7.3 percent over the quarter a year earlier.  On Monday, the J.C. Penney Company, the third-largest retailer, reported an 11.5 percent gain in net income on only 1.7 percent higher sales.

Sales advanced 13.7 percent, to $761.5 million, from $669.7 million. **********Thomas M.

May Department Stores **********May Department Stores had a net income of $20.3 million, or 70 cents a share, compared with $11.5 million, or 40 cents a share, in the 1982 first quarter. **********Sales for the quarter increased 15.3 percent, to $846.8 million, from $734.4 million in last year's first quarter.

Analysts hailed the sharp drop as the strongest evidence in weeks that the money supply was under control. **********''It was positive news for a decline in interest rates,'' said Maria Ramirez, money market economist at Merrill Lynch Economics. **********Reflecting this sentiment, Government securities prices rose sharply and interest rates fell in late trading after the Fed announcement. The price of a key long-term issue - the 12 percent bond due in 2013 - shot up by 1 1/2 points, or about $15 for each $1,000, to 104 2/32. That brought the yield down to 11.50 percent from 11.65 percent Thursday. **********Credit market trading this week, until the money supply announcement, had been dominated by a belief among traders that the Federal Reserve's monetary policy had been tighter than previously thought and the Fed was therefore putting upward pressure on interest rates. As a result, yields generally rose and prices fell until late yesterday. **********Control of Supply Cited **********''The Fed has achieved control over the money supply,'' said Elliott Platt, an economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, of the new money supply report, which put M-1 at $517.2 billion on Oct. 5. He and other economists said the Fed now had room to ease monetary policy, a policy that could lead to lower rates. **********Miss Ramirez added: ''We have seen a constant weakness reported in the monetary aggregates over the last two months, and since they are well within all the targets, these numbers afford the Fed the feasibility to ease up over the coming weeks.'' **********Short-term rates also declined in response to the monetary reports. The rate on the three-month Treasury bill fell to 8.65 percent after trading at 8.76 percent late Thursday. The one- year bill rate fell to 8.92 percent after trading late Thursday at 9.07 percent. **********The Treasury's two-year note that will be auctioned next Wednesday was offered on a when-issed basis at 10.51 percent, a decline from 10.72 percent late Thursday. **********The Fed has set a growth target for M-1 of 5 to 9 percent for the rest of this year. The decline announced yesterday put M-1 growth at 7 percent, or $2 billion above a 5 percent growth rate, the low end of the Fed's range. M-1, a measure of money considered readily available for spending, covers cash in public hands and most types of checking accounts. **********During all of September, M-1 rose by $700 million, or at a rate of less than 7 percent annually, the Fed reported yesterday. This decline in growth ''means we might have a slightly negative money supply for the month of October,'' said Mr. Platt, who expects decreases in M-1 for the rest of the month. **********The Federal Reserve also reported that two wider measures of the money supply were well within the Fed's monitoring range. It said that M-2, which includes M-1 plus money market deposit accounts and various savings deposits, rose by $8.8 billion to $2,145.7 billion, in September. M-2 is now at the midpoint of the Fed's 7 to 10 percent growth goal. **********M-3 Up by $15.5 Billion **********M-3, which includes M-2 plus large time deposits, rose by $15.5 billion in September to $2,544 billion. This figure is about $10 billion below the upper end of the Fed's growth target of 6.5 to 9.5 percent. **********Bernard M. Markstein 3d, a financial economist at Chase Econometrics in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said the decline in M-1 ''appears to be the result of the Fed maintaining its level of restraint from the previous weeks together with the end of the quarterly technical factors.'' He said that, while he did not think the Fed eased monetary policy in September, ''it is easing now very moderately.'' **********Robert J. Genetski, an economist at the Harris Bank, Chicago, said the latest figures would help get ''interest rates back in control and give the Fed more room to take a slightly more expansionary step without worrying about inflation.'' **********The money supply report came amid a modest rally on the credit markets, spurred by a decline in the Federal funds rate, the cost of interbank overnight loans. **********Traders said the decline in the funds rate to 9.25 percent yesterday, after hovering at 9.38 to 9.50 percent for most of the week, was a welcome sign that credit policy might be less restrictive. After the money supply report was released, the rate fell to 9 percent. **********In addition, market sentiment improved on the news that inflation in September, as measured by the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods, rose by a modest two-tenths of 1 percent, less than analysts had predicted. With inflation under control, the Fed is less likely to rein in credit availability through a policy that enccourages higher interest rates. **********''The Fed moved early to make sure there was no explosive rise in inflation this year and this is being interpreted contructively in the credit market,'' Mr. Genetski said. **********In other data, the Fed also reported that business loans rose by $1.55 billion. Economists said the total business borrowing was still considered low for a recovery period."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/14/business/naming-of-drugs-is-no-easy-task.html": {"writer_name": "Fay Joyce", "pub_date": "1983-05-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 815, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NAMING OF DRUGS IS NO EASY TASK", "print_headline": "NAMING OF DRUGS IS NO EASY TASK", "body_text": " **********Dyazide probably won't kill weeds. Zantac never appeared as an alien invader on ''Star Trek.'' And ''Mylanta!'' is not what Scarlett O'Hara exclaimed when she saw her favorite Georgia city in flames. **********All these unusual words are names of drugs. With thousands of drugs on the market and thousands of names already patented, it is no easy task for one of the companies in the highly competitive multibillion-dollar pharmaceutical industry to come up with a title that will make a doctor or suffering consumer reach for its medicine. **********There are several ways of going about it. Some are logical and methodical and involve polling physicians. Some are creative and spontaneous and require sitting around over a few beers. And some are combinations of both approaches. **********In the end, what often pops out is an abbreviation. Take Ridaura, a gold-based drug for treating arthritis that the SmithKline Beckman Corporation, its manufacturer, hopes to introduce soon in the United States. The first three letters, rid, stand for remission inducing drug. Au is the chemical symbol for gold. And ra stands for rheumatoid arthritis. **********Tagamet, SmithKline's ulcer medicine taken by 30 million people around the world since it was introduced in 1976, is a combination of two ideas. Tag is short for antagonist, since the drug fights distress. Met was plucked from the chemical name of the compound cimetidine. **********Who knows what the British were thinking when Glaxo Ltd. of London dubbed its ulcer medicine Zantac.  ''It's just a name we invented,'' shrugged Geoffrey Potter, a spokesman for Glaxo Ltd. Americans are likely to be hearing more about Zantac in the near future; the drug, a Tagamet competitor, recently obtained provisional approval from the Food and Drug Administration. Some drug industry analysts think that Glaxo's new product may give ulcers to the makers of Tagamet. **********''It has no particular connection to the drug or the way it works,'' Mr. Potter said of the name. ''It's short and memorable and doesn't conflict with other people's trade names. The big problem in the pharmaceutical industry is to find an acceptable name that doesn't mean something it shouldn't in a foreign country. There's no real magic to it. It's often sheer slog.'' **********Similarly, at Roche Laboratories, a division of Hoffman-LaRoche Inc., they try to pick names that please the eye and ear. Valium, the tranquilizer responsible for over a billion dollars in sales, ''has a soothing sound,'' a company spokesman, John Doorley, said. **********Naming a drug can take up to several months. The marketing division of a pharmaceutical company selects several possibilities, whittling down a list that may have emerged from a brainstorming session or a computer run, or both. The short list is then sent to the lawyers, who must search trademark records to make sure those names have not already been used. **********One company, Searle Pharmaceuticals, tests the surviving candidates on druggists and physicians to see how easy each name is to spell, pronounce and remember, and to check on the connotations each one has. **********This is often instructive. After Searle invented a new artificial food sweetener a few years ago, it tested the generic name aspartame, asking potential users what they thought aspartame did. ''It came back as either a treatment for hemorrhoids or headaches,'' recalled Richard L. McGraw, a spokesman for Searle. ''We ditched the name.'' **********Opinions vary on how critical the name of a drug really is. 'A Sophisticated Market' **********''It's a sophisticated market. We don't see the name as being responsible for the use of the drug,'' said Fritz Frommeyer, a spokesman for Eli Lilly & Company. **********''It takes seven to ten years and $70 million to come up with a new prescription drug,'' said Roche's Mr. Doorley. ''The name is the easy part.'' **********But what of Dyazide and Mylanta? Dyazide is for high blood pressure, and is the most prescribed drug in the United States, according to Robert A. Holland, a spokesman at SmithKline. The first part of the word is from diuretic, which describes the action of the drug in reducing fluid in the body, and the second is from hydracholorathiazide, an ingredient. **********And Mylanta is an over-the-counter antacid (hence anta) that joined another product of Stuart Pharmaceuticals, Mylicon.  Stuart also produces a vitamin and mineral supplement for pregnant women called Stuartnatal 1 + 1. Natal refers to birth, but 1 + 1 does not refer to mother and child. Rather, it stands for one grain of iron and one milligram of folic acid. Kathy Tridente, a company spokesman, said she could vouch for the product herself. **********''My dog loved the pills,'' she confided. ''She knocked over the bottle and ate every one of them. She had a lot of spunk there.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/17/business/us-petroleum-data.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 121, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Petroleum Data", "print_headline": "U.S. Petroleum Data", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/20/world/new-us-role-seen-after-plo-fight.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-11-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 755, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NEW U.S. ROLE SEEN AFTER P.L.O.

Mr. Shultz's remarks were in a speech delivered tonight before the Council of Jewish Federations and Welfare Funds in Atlanta. **********King Hussein declined earlier this year to enter American-sponsored talks with Israel because he could not gain the endorsement of Yasir Arafat, the P.L.O. chairman who is fighting for survival in northern Lebanon against a group of Syrian-backed rebels. **********Some State Department officials have said King Hussein might take courage from the P.L.O. struggle and decide to enter negotiations without waiting for a P.L.O. endorsement.

''Well, they are wrong. Ronald Reagan has no intention of letting the search for peace lapse. We cannot afford to. Let it never be said that the United States was too busy practicing politics to pursue peace.'' **********In the speech, Mr. Shultz made a strong appeal for paying more attention to the problems of Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which are under Israeli control. **********''The Palestinians have been victimized above all by their self-appointed leaders and spokesmen who, for decades, have chased the illusion of military options and foolishly rejected the only possible path to a solution: direct negotiations,'' he said. ''The utter failure of rejectionist policies ought to be obvious by now.''  Better Treatment Urged **********He said it was important that the Palestinians be treated better than they are now if a peaceful solution is to be reached. **********''If their acceptance of a peaceful future with Israel is to be nurtured,'' he said of the Palestinians, ''they must be given some stake in that future by greater opportunities for economic development, by fairer administrative practices and by greater concern for the quality of their lives.'' **********In explaining the United States marines' continued participation in the international force in Beirut, Mr. Shultz said that if American troops were driven from Lebanon, ''our role as a force for peace would be that much weakened everywhere.'' **********''Friends who rely on us would be disheartened and would be that much less secure,'' he said. ''Moderates in the Arab world whom we are encouraging to take risks for peace would feel it far less safe to do so. The rejectionists would have scored a victory, confirming the value of reliance on the Soviet Union. Israel's security would be jeopardized.''  Support and Criticism **********Mr. Shultz repeated United States expressions of strong support for Israel and also repeated criticism of Israeli settlements in the West Bank. He added that the Administration believes that Israel must negotiate peace in the region, based on Mr. Reagan's speech of Sept. 1, 1982. **********He said ''military might and control of territory have prevented defeat on the battlefield, but true security and peace of mind can come only when Israel has gained the acceptance and recognition of its neighbors.'' **********''That is why, even as we assist Israel's capacity to defend itself militarily, the promotion of Arab-Israeli peace through negotiation is the No. 1 priority of our policy and our efforts in the Middle East,'' he said. **********Mr. Shultz said that ''a strong Israel is not only a guarantor of security for the Jewish people, but also a powerful force for freedom and a strategic partner to America and the West.''

Most of these stockholders have certificates for the shares they started with, as well as owning shares through the plan, and will at least receive a proxy for the originally held shares. **********The proxy material for the shares held in the plan, however, may be delayed in reaching the stockholders because corporations send them to the plan rather than directly to the owners. When proxies from owners of stock through a plan do not arrive in time to be counted, many corporations automatically vote the shares in the same way that the shareholder voted his original shares. **********But if you sold your underlying shares and hold only shares in the plan, there is a chance that you may not get a proxy card in time for your vote to be counted. Robert Pyle, vice president and counsel of the American Society of Corporate Secretaries, advises individuals anxious about such a possibility to call or write the company and ask that the situation be looked into. ''Generally, companies are trying to get as large a vote as possible,'' he said. **********Robert D. Ferris, a managing director of Georgeson & Company, an investor relations firm, said that, to be absolutely certain of receiving proxies, participants in a dividend reinvestment plan could also ask to have the shares in the plan registered in their name.  ''You can take a certificate for full shares out of the plan in most cases if you are that concerned,'' he added. **********Another concern of some stockholders when receiving material for an annual meeting is the format of the proxy cards through which voting takes place for issues to be considered. Complaints have been voiced that when matters recommended by the board of directors are listed on the proxies of certain companies, the first column is ''for'' and the second is ''against.'' On the other hand, matters that are opposed by the directors of these companies have the columns reversed, with ''against'' appearing before ''for.'' **********The Securities and Exchange Commission does not require corporations to place these columns in any particular order. Its rule 14A-4 states only that ''means shall be provided in the form of proxy whereby the person solicited is afforded an opportunity to specify by boxes a choice between approval or disapproval of or abstention with respect to each matter or group of related matters referred to therein as intended to be acted upon.'' Thus care in reading the cards accompanying proxy statements is the investor's own responsibility. **********The corporate secretaries' society notes that only an infinitesimal number of the proxies that it has studied reverse the order of the boxes for proposals made by independent stockholders. ''I don't see any reason not to do it in the customary way,'' Mr. Pyle said. **********However, Robert A. Byrne, senior vice president of the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, which serves as transfer agent for many companies, said: ''The format of the proxy is at the discretion of the corporation soliciting the proxy. There are as many theories as to formats as there are corporate secretaries and counsels. A lot of managements are very, very sensitive to the percentage of return and percentage of vote.'' **********Any fraction against management proposals or for stockholder proposals ''is considered by some chairman as a slap in the face,'' he added. Bank Money Fund Questions **********The rapid growth of money market deposit accounts in banks since they began being offered last December has raised some questions about aspects of bankers' procedures when handling these accounts.  For example, objections have been raised by customers who make a deposit in their account on a Saturday and find that interest is not credited until the following Monday. **********The policy at many banks appears to be the same whether the deposit is made in an automatic teller machine or at one of the relatively few branches that are open on Saturdays. In New York, both the Chase Manhattan Bank and the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company credit accounts on Monday, while Citibank has two different arrangements.  Deposits in existing Citibank accounts do not begin earning interest until Monday, but new accounts go into effect on the Saturday that they are opened. **********Sheldon D. Golub, a spokesman for the American Bankers Association, said that the procedure was usually reversed by banks when money was withdrawn from money market accounts on a Saturday. ''If you took a cash withdrawal on Saturday, you would most likely stop losing interest on Monday,'' he said.

Instead, the 4,300 residents might as well adopt the shovel as their symbol. **********For the last few weeks they have done little but dig out from under Oyama's latest outburst, a spectacular tantrum on Oct. 3 that sent lava pouring out of 17 craters and shot pillars of black smoke 33,000 feet into the air.   Like Outstretched Fingers **********The lava cut a 1,500-foot-wide swath down the mountainside and then spread like outstretched fingers, enveloping the village of Ako in Miyake's southwest corner. **********Actually, villagers say, it could have been worse. An eruption in 1940 killed 11 people, and another one in 1962 injured several dozen.  This time, thanks to an efficient evacuation plan, the 1,336 villagers escaped without harm, but 400 houses were buried under as much as 100 feet of molten basalt that reached temperatures of 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. **********Most villagers live now in barracks-like shelters set up elsewhere on the island, waiting for prefabricated houses to be ready for them in late November. But none have any doubts about their plans after that: Once the tons of lava cool, they will build permanent homes - or what passes here for permanence - right next to the houses that were buried.   'You're in Control' **********It never occurred to Shuichi Kamakawa to do anything else. His grandfather lived in Ako, and the grandfather's grandfather before him. **********''Here, you can find jobs and make a living according to your own abilities,'' said Mr. Kamakawa, who ran a small guesthouse. ''You're in control of your own life.'' **********Of course, he agreed, Oyama also exerts some control. But then he shrugged and muttered a phrase heard often on the island: ''Shikata ga nai'' - ''There is nothing we can do about it.'' **********This urge to return to a scene of probably recurring disaster is more than just a phenomenon familiar in, for instance, southern California, where cliff dwellers watch heavy rains wash their houses down to the sea and then rebuild in the very same place to await the next storm. It is even more than Japanese acceptance of natural disaster, including volcanoes, which are not in short supply. There are 67 considered to be active in Japan, or one-tenth the world total, according to the Government.   Villagers Stay Put **********What really motivates the islanders is not that they live on Miyake but rather in Ako, or in Tsubota or in the three other villages scattered across the 34 square miles of ponds and tall grass. A person from Ako would not be happy in Igaya, and so he will stay put and that is that, residents say. **********Not surprisingly, there are rivalries among the villages. In a bureaucratic anomaly, the entire island falls under the jurisdiction of the Tokyo metropolitan government. To keep animosities to a minimum, Tokyo rotates its Miyake headquarters from village to village each year. **********Cooperation seems to be the rule since the latest Oyama eruption, which not only inundated Ako but also covered the fields and houses of Tsubota with a blanket of black ash two feet deep in places. Still, one Tsubota man groused the other afternoon about how demanding he thought Ako residents had become as a result of their new misfortune.   A Touch of Venus **********From the air, western Miyake resembles the photographs of Venus, with vapors rising from a barren landscape. Enormous rocks hurled from the mountain had formed a new island just off the southern tip of Miyake, but the ocean has begun to swallow it, and it is expected to disappear soon. **********Perhaps a third of the island is covered by ash or hardening lava. Men and women scrape the ash from the roadways, and eventually it will be piled atop mountains formed from the ashes of the 1940 and 1962 eruptions. **********What on Oct. 3 had been a forest thick with trees is now a wide black scar dotted with what appears to be bleached sticks. The snaggled tops of lifeless trees poke through the pumice, which has cooled considerably but whose surface temperature is still nearly 200 degrees Fahrenheit in places. **********Shuichiro Inoue, who heads relief operations for the Tokoyo metropolitan government, estimates damages at nearly $100 million, with the authorities already having provided more than $4 million in aid in addition to private contributions.   A Habitat for Birds and Tourists **********The island depends on tourism and some dairy farming for its survival. Its thick woodlands and marshes make a fine habitat for wild birds, and tourists particularly enjoy visiting here in the late spring and summer. **********Even before Oyama erupted once again, younger people had decided Miyake was not for them. The population has declined gradually but inexorably since 1962, from more than 7,000 to the present 4,300. **********Older folks, such as Mr. Kamakawa, have no intention of leaving, although he has also had enough of the mountain's whims. ''Probably like all the other changes in society today, these eruptions are coming more and more frequently,'' he said with a laugh. **********Yoshie Sasaki said that at the age of 48 she had no plans to move either. She was sitting in a snack bar called the Phoenix, in the same seat, she said, that she had occupied when the volcano exploded. **********''For myself,'' Mrs. Sasaki said, ''I don't have the will to leave.'' Then she looked at one of her eight grandchildren, who was sitting next to her. ''But when I think of them,'' she said, ''I'd like them to get out of here.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/14/business/l-breaking-up-100594.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-08-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 236, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Breaking Up", "print_headline": "Breaking Up", "body_text": " **********To the Business Editor: **********We've been annoyed a long time over the A.T.& T. suit, but the self- righteous William G.

Wojciech Jaruzelski, the Polish leader, moved two generals into key posts.  Mieczyslaw Moczar, 70 years old, was retired from his post as chairman of the Supreme Chamber of Control, a watchdog agency. A Communist guerrilla commander under the German occupation in World War II, he was a tough in-fighter in political battles over the years and was associated with the anti-Semitic purges of the late 1960's. **********He was replaced by Gen. Tadeusz Hupalowski, who had been Minister of Administration, Local Economy and Environmental Protection. The new Minister of Administration is Gen. Wlodzimierz Oliwa, the commander of the Warsaw garrison. Walesa Summoned on Finances **********Meanwhile, Lech Walesa, the former Solidarity leader, said by telephone that he and his wife, Danuta, had been summoned to appear before tax inspectors in Gdansk on Friday. He had previously been questioned about union finances. **********Here in Warsaw, the former Solidarity press spokesman, Janusz Onyszkiewicz, who was released from internment in December, was briefly taken into custody by the security police as he was drinking coffee with a Western reporter. Mr. Onyszkiewicz, who was later released, was among former Solidarity officials who met with Mr.  Walesa in a Warsaw church on Sunday. **********The crux of the austerity program outlined today is to get more work out of a labor force that is hampered by a shortage of raw materials and inefficiency. Workers are also frustrated by high prices and by the consumer goods shortage and are resentful over the crushing of the hopes raised by Solidarity before it was outlawed last year. **********''Labor productivity in Poland is very low,'' Janusz Obodowski, the planning chief, told Parliament.  Noting that other developed countries were two or three times more efficient in their production, he called not only for harder work but also for conservation of energy, fuel and raw materials. **********According to the P.A.P. press agency, he denounced the ''simplistic approach to equality, false egalitarianism and aspiration toward identical or very similar renumeration for all, regardless of the quantity and quality of work, qualifications, skills and experience.'' **********''This is a dangerous and anarchistic tendency that political opponents tried to implant into Polish society over the last few years,'' he said. **********The austerity program includes a drive against graft and profiteering.  Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak said Tuesday that an inquiry was under way into a trade deal that he said had defrauded the treasury of $1 million. He reported inquiries under way ''against 482 millionaire criminals whose property had no basis in legal income sources.'' Labor Shortage Is a Problem **********Mr. Obodowski, the economic planner, said ''the primary source of the crisis lies in departing from principles of socialist management.'' **********One problem is a shortage of workers, with almost every factory understaffed, sometimes by hundreds of jobs. This is largely caused by a program to encourage early retirement to cut down on malingering and make way for younger workers. **********According to official statistics, 550,000 people have chosen early retirement since August 1981. At the moment, there are 256,800 unfilled jobs and only 7,000 applicants, the Government says. **********Another problem is that the output of consumer goods has not kept up with purchasing power, especially among higher-income groups like private farmers and coal miners. **********One of the major goals of the program is to reduce reliance on imported food, particularly wheat. but private farmers, who now have piles of worthless zlotys, are holding back their wheat. **********The Government program calls for stopping work on hundreds of half-built factories and for concentrating instead on small-scale projects such as cottage industries, getting pensioners to work part-time, and encouraging workers to work overtime and on days off. **********The program envisions attempts to hold managers accountable for the efficiency of their businesses.  ''The Government does not promise an immediate way out of the crisis,'' Mr. Obodowski said. '' No one anywhere has a prescription.  That would be tantamount to charlatanism. But this does not mean passivity. We will be working with the greatest energy. '' **********Mieczyslaw Mieszczankowski, an economist, has presented a gloomier assessment, telling the newspaper Zycie Warszawy earlier this week: ''Please remember that this is one of the biggest catastrophes in world economic history.

The reasons for naming Mr. McFarlane remain unclear, in light of the key role he has been playing in East- West issues and the prevailing judgment in the Administration that negotiations in the Middle East are not likely to make significant progress in the next year and a half. **********And Mr. Shultz's power over developing long-range policy on Central America, at least, was called into question by Mr. Reagan's appointment of former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger as chairman of a Presidential commission to study that area. This ran counter to the much advertised prominent role that Mr. Shultz was supposed to play in framing policy on Central America.  Some officials, particularly those in the State Department, say they look to Mr. Shultz to stitch together what has been, in effect, two contending Administration foreign policies - that of the doctrinaire conservatives who resist any compromise with the Soviet Union and that of the pragmatic conservatives who are willing to bend to pressures at home and from friendly countries abroad. The President himself is seen by these officials as being of both minds. **********Other officials, including some who appreciate Mr. Shultz, find him to be part of the problem. They say that he, too, is torn between the two philosophies. They contend that, like other senior officials, he remains cautious and unsure of his ground on many issues and that he feels fully comfortable only in his own field, international economics. **********Shultz Lists His Priorities **********Mr. Shultz said in an interview recently that his priorities for the rest of the Administration would be maintaining American military and economic strength; dealing with the Soviet Union; paying more attention to ''our own neighborhood'' in Central and South America and Canada, and the Middle East. **********He said Soviet-American relations were ''a major theme that dominates any Administration's foreign policy because it's so central.'' **********Asked about Mr. Reagan's pledge to restore the Soviet-American military balance before negotiations, Mr. Shultz said, ''I think we're in a good position to negotiate.'' He added, ''Whether it's exactly restored or not, certainly we have improved our situation greatly.'' **********''One of the things that I knew before but I have realized more intensively since being in office is the sense in which everything is connected,'' he went on, sitting, shirt-sleeved, on a satin sofa in his large, formal office.   'See Connections Early' **********''There is such a thing as a world view that you have to somehow find your way to,'' he said, ''and the creative acts are ones where you do see connections early and pursue them.'' **********To make progress in Soviet-American relations, there is talk among key Administration officials of possible changes in the National Security Council staff and among certain top Pentagon officials in the fall. **********In recent months, it would appear, Mr. Reagan has shown more flexibility and less pronounced hostility toward the Soviet Union, and there have been some changes in the Administration's arms control proposals, more activity concerning possible negotiations in Central America, an easing of restrictions on technology transfers to China and improvement of relations with Israel. **********But these steps do not constitute abandonment of the tough positions of the Administration's first two years, nor are they sufficiently decisive to produce breakthroughs. Many officials are waiting to see whether Mr. Reagan will press for some foreign policy success - perhaps a meeting with Yuri V. Andropov, the Soviet leader.   Efforts on Arms Control **********As several high-ranking Administration officials acknowledged, even if Mr. Reagan ordered greater efforts to reach an arms control treaty with Moscow, it is far from clear that he and his senior aides realize how many compromises it would require, that they have the confidence in their knowledge of the subject to make those compromises and that they could overcome the officials they placed in the bureaucracy who oppose such a treaty.  Whatever the situation in the Administration, Mr. Shultz said recently that the Soviet Union would have to negotiate seriously on arms control. Moscow's effort, he argued, ''to derail deployments'' of our missiles in Europe ''as distinct from negotiating them away, has failed now.'' **********Asked what incentives are being offered to the Russians, he responded: ''Our own strength and purpose are there, and to the extent they feel that, barring an agreement, they have to accept very high costs and very great risks, then there's an incentive for an agreement. I think that the stakes have definitely been raised.'' **********Doctrinaire conservatives and bureaucrats say it is not at all clear that Mr. Reagan's top advisers are now any more knowledgeable about the world than his original team.   Shultz Lacks Haig's Experience **********Mr. Shultz does not have the foreign- affairs experience of his predecessor, Alexander M. Haig Jr. The same is said of Mr. Clark, the national security adviser, who replaced Richard V. Allen, and of Gen. John W. Vessey Jr., Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who succeeded Gen. David C. Jones. **********Some officials said National Security Council meetings rarely last more than an hour, in part because Mr. Reagan prefers short sessions but also because those present do not have much background beyond their briefing papers. For example, a meeting in May to review the position on strategic arms reductions ended after less than an hour. **********Officials throughout the Administration sense that precisely because those in the leadership know they do not know very much, they do not like to make big decisions. Because of this, the decision- making system is weighted against big or bold steps. As in the first two years, most activity centers on the third tier of policy makers, the assistant secretaries and their equivalents.   Running Battles **********At this level there continue to be running battles, sometimes over apportioning areas of responsibility and sometimes on substance and language, on arms control and Central America. Most of these go unresolved for months until they reach the National Security Council. The decisions handed down from there, the officials said, tend to be ambiguous or narrow, so the fighting goes on. **********This has been the case, officials said, on most issues regarding Soviet-American relations and possible contacts with leftist forces in Central America. **********Decisions on other issues are put off, officials said, because they are deemed ''too hot to handle.'' This was the case with a memorandum Mr. Shultz sent to the President in mid-March calling for wide-ranging talks with the Soviet Union. After three months Mr. Clark told the State Department that it should convert the memorandum into an options paper. Even after this was done, no meeting was held. **********It was into this sort of situation that George Shultz stepped a year ago. He made immediately clear to his staff that he was determined to end the rancor that had existed between Mr. Haig and virtually all other agencies and departments. **********State Department officials say Mr. Haig used to return from the White House and relate a decision by the President, then his aides would tell him why it was bad or Mr. Haig himself would complain and make efforts to change the decision. By contrast, the officials said, Mr. Shultz conveys the decisions and when his aides complain he says,''Get on the team.''  Shultz Described as Methodical **********Key State Department officials are generally careful in what they say to reporters about the White House, as are White House officals about the State Department. They do not want to stir up problems or, worse, be accused of stirring them up. Feelings are raw between key Shultz aides and key aides to Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger. **********Mr. Shultz's aides describe him as others have: conservative, methodical and calm; as an incrementalist, a problem-solver and a mediator. He even kept his equanimity recently when Mr. Reagan dismissed Thomas O. Enders, the Assistant Secretary for Inter- American Affairs.  Leaks from the White House held that Mr. Enders was perhaps too eager for talks with Central American leftists and that he and the State Department were more ''cookie pushers'' than policy managers. **********By all accounts, Mr. Shultz's views are virtually identical to Mr. Haig's. In most cases that has meant positions similar to those advocated by senior Foreign Service officers. But unlike Mr. Haig, he does not push those positions that are contrary to what he thinks are Presidential inclinations. Unlike Mr. Haig, he subordinates himself at every opportunity to Mr. Reagan. **********Like Mr. Haig, Mr. Shultz has taken to sounding hard-line themes in Congressional testimony. Both men went out of their way to take tough positions with Congressional critics on Central America and Soviet policy. Both Secretaries felt, according to aides, that it was important for them to show ideological fidelity to Reagan political campaign themes in this forum. **********Admired in Congress **********In Congress, the prevailing judgment as that Mr. Shultz is the soundest Administration voice on foreign affairs. It is a potential power base that Mr. Shultz has not used, aides say, for fear of running a lobbying operation against the White House. **********Among Weinberger aides, Mr. Shultz is seen as a captive of the State Department, which these aides characterize as following the paths of least resistance, leading to capitulation. **********In the White House, Mr. Shultz's loyalty is much admired, but there is an uneasiness about his not having produced a success. It is rare to hear, as was often heard a year ago, ''Let George do it.'' But the White House shows little sign of giving Mr. Shultz latitude to move when he has asked for it. **********In the State Department, Mr. Shultz continues to be praised and respected, with some reservations. **********His defenders argue that international economics is the most important aspect of international affairs over the long run, and that Mr. Shultz has his priorities right. **********Some State Department activists are concerned that Mr. Shultz is not disposed to fight day in and day out for the kind of decisive action needed for a major international breakthrough.   Compromises on Arms Control **********The defenders noted that Mr. Shultz was a main force behind recent compromises on arms control talks and that he and Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige pushed through a loosening of restrictions on technology transfers to China over the opposition of the Pentagon and the staff of the National Security Cuncil. **********The defenders said they and Mr. Shultz were perplexed that his virtues seemed to have been transformed into vices by critics and complainers. Mr. Shultz's calm is now sometimes portrayed as passivity, his team-playing as unwillingness to fight for what he believes, and his mediation skills as proceduralism at the expense of substance. **********Mr. Shultz is aware, his defenders said, that time is running out on diplomacy, that once Presidential primaries begin room for maneuver is limited. They said Mr. Shultz would concentrate his energies more on East-West relations and Central America. **********Mr. Shultz, in the recent interview, added to this the Middle East. He said: ''I don't see anything wrong with our policies, and I haven't heard anybody propose a better alternative policy. The problem is not in the policies; the problem is in the difficulties in bringing them to fruition.'' **********Mr. Shultz is not going to move on all of these fronts, his aides said, by going to war with the White House. As he sees it, Mr. Haig tried this and failed. Mr. Shultz will try to use quiet persuasion on Mr. Reagan. As Mr. Shultz is fond of saying, ''It is Mr. Reagan's policy.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/03/business/week-in-business-new-esmark-offer-convinces-norton.html": {"writer_name": "Nathaniel Nash", "pub_date": "1983-07-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1039, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NEW ESMARK OFFER CONVINCES NORTON", "print_headline": "WEEK IN BUSINESS; NEW ESMARK OFFER CONVINCES NORTON", "body_text": " **********Esmark sweetened its bid for Norton Simon, the company accepted the offer and David Mahoney is getting richer. The price tag is about $34 a share, or $918 million, plus Esmark gets a ''right of first refusal'' to buy any of Norton Simon's companies for one year. This will probably discourage Kohlberg, Kravis & Roberts and last week's newcomer - Anderson-Clayton - from pursuing their own takeover bids.  As for Mr. Mahoney, right, his ''motivation all along has been to get the best deal for the shareholders,'' his spokesman said. And Mr.  Mahoney is no small shareholder. His 718,513 shares will be worth some $25 million under the new deal - $3.5 million more than the value under his initial $29 a share offer. Moreover, his five-year, $9 million employment contract will be honored, even though he will probably leave the company after the acquisition. **********More sweeteners. Lenox finally acquiesced to a $3 a share improvement in Brown-Forman's takeover bid -$90 a share, or $408 million. The china and crystal maker was evidently uncertain about the effects of its ''poison pill'' defense and was concerned about a possible flood of lawsuits by angry shareholders. Lenox chairman John S. Chamberlain will be elected to the Brown-Forman board. Of the coming merger, W.L. Lyons Brown Jr., president of the distiller and winemaker, said, ''I suppose Bolla wine could be served in Lenox crystal.'' **********A cheer went up at Sotheby's when it learned that Philip Taubman, the Michigan real estate developer, had persuaded General Felt owners, Marshall Cogan and Stephen Swid, to halt their takeover attempt of the British auction house. Felt will sell its 29.9 percent stake in Sotheby's to Mr. Taubman at $10.66 a share - a $10.6 million profit for General Felt. **********The third stage of the tax cut, which should pump some $30 billion of additional spending and savings into the economy over the next 12 months, took effect last Friday amid continuing signs that economic growth is surging. The President's economic advisers raised real growth figures for all of 1983 to 5.5 percent, up from 4.7 percent, and estimated that the faster pace of recovery would shave as much as $15 billion off the budget deficit. But they also see an unemployment level of 9.6 percent for the last three months of 1983. **********Sales of new homes rose 4.3 percent in May to their highest levels in three years, while in the same month the Index of Leading Economic Indicators was up 1.2 percent, new orders for factory output rose 1.9 percent and machine tool demand was up 28 percent. **********Turkey economics? House Speaker O'Neill's proposed $700 cap on the third and final stage of the President's tax cut failed in a 55-to-45 Senate vote. But will the opponents of the tax cut get back at Mr.  Reagan in the fall when Congress - to his displeasure - will decide whether to raise some $12 billion in new taxes called for by the recently passed budget resolution? Republican Senator Bob Dole, charman of the Banking Committee, seemed skeptical. ''My point is,'' he said, ''that a lot of these turkeys who voted for the budget resolution won't vote for the real thing.'' **********Ray Dirks was vindicated. The Supreme Court ruled that the insurance analyst did not misuse insider information in 1973 when he tipped clients of the impending collapse of the Equity Funding Corporation, an insurance fraud scheme that cost investors millions of dollars. It was a strong defeat for the Securities and Exchange Commission, which had censured Mr. Dirks for violating securities laws. In supporting Mr. Dirks's actions, the court set a new, more liberal interpretation for what constitutes illegal insider trading. **********The stock market worried about interest rates all week, falling almost 33 points early on and regaining less than half of the loss by Friday's close. The Dow finished down more than 16 points, to 1225.26. Interest rates, which were erratic during most of the week, soared on Friday after the Federal Reserve reported a surprising $600 million rise in the money supply. **********Bank deregulation moved ahead, as President Reagan's deregulation committee eliminated all ceilings on the interest rates that banks can pay on time deposits with maturities from 32 days to 2 1/2 years and asked Congress to permit banks and thrift institutions to pay interest on business checking accounts. The committee also eased penalties on early withdrawals from time deposits. As for the lowly passbook savings accounts, its interest ceilings of 5 1/4 percent to 5 1/2 percent will remain until 1986. **********Bethlehem Steel found $500 million in innovative financing for modernizing two of its plants. The Voest-Alpine Group, an Austrian state-owned company, will build efficient continuous casters for the struggling No. 2 U.S. steelmaker, which will in effect lease the units. The funds will come from a group of banks and the Austrian government. Bethlehem not only benefits from modernization, it will not carry the loans on its books. Moreover, the first payments are not due until 1986. **********Coming and Going. Thomas F. Grojean resigned as president of the faltering Tiger International. Mr. Grojean had been expected to become chairman within a few years ... ''Smiling Jack'' Gallagher, founder of Dome Petroleum and famed Beaufort Sea driller, gave up the helm to J. Howard MacDonald, who had negotiated a billion-dollar rescue program for Dome that saved it from bankruptcy ... Gerald Tsai, the mutual fund wizard, became vice chairman of American Can and part of its newly formed office of the chairman. He also was responsible for American Can's purchase of a 5 percent stake in Paine Webber ... Richard M. Morrow will succeed John E. Swearingen as chairman of Indiana Standard. **********Potpourri. Baldwin-United narrowly avoided bankruptcy again. Five creditor groups agreed to a standstill agreement covering more than $1 billion of its debt ... G.

Opposition leaders demanded proof, but nothing more has been heard of this charge. **********With 50 percent of Greek production already in state hands, ministers talk of ''socializing'' the private sector and say they are seeking industrialists guilty of ''economic sabotage.'' **********The Minister of National Economy, Gerasimos Arsenis, has said he knows of 45 bank directors - not identified - who have made ''abusive loans.'' And he has promised that the Government, already nationalizing the pharmaceutical industry, will take control of Peiraki-Patraiki, a troubled textile company.   A Warning to Companies **********The Socialist press regularly publishes the names of companies that supposedly are about to suffer the same fate as Heracles. After France's Socialist Government asserted that it had obtained a list of foreigners with secret accounts in a major Swiss bank, Prime Minister Papandreou said he had asked President Francois Mitterrand for a copy of the list. **********The Greek business community has begun to strike back. In a speech in October, Theodore Papalexopoulos, president of the Greek Industries Federation, denounced the attack on Heracles, saying it had ''caused serious damage'' to the company and to society as a whole. **********He said Government threats were creating an impression ''that nationalization, in one form or another, of all private enterprises is imminent and that we are moving toward an economy that will have central control of all activities.'' **********'Grave Consequences' Seen **********Such a climate, he went on, ''destroys not only entrepreneurial creativity but also the ability to operate on a day-to-day basis, with grave consequences for the whole economy.'' **********Mr. Tsatsos describes the attack on his company as ''political.'' The Government always knew what Heracles was up to, he declared, since it controls the company through a 40 percent stake held by the state-owned National Bank, which has four directors on the company's board."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/22/business/patents-nations-to-share-their-data.html": {"writer_name": "Stacy Jones", "pub_date": "1983-10-22", "snippet": "-day conference this week, the heads of patent offices in Europe, Japan and the United States signed an agreement to cooperate in research and operations.\n\nUnder the agreement, there will be exchanges of technical personnel, documents, microfilm a...", "word_count": 212, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PATENTS;\nNATIONS TO SHARE THEIR DATA", "print_headline": "PATENTS;\nNATIONS TO SHARE THEIR DATA", "body_text": " **********-day conference this week, the heads of patent offices in Europe, Japan and the United States signed an agreement to cooperate in research and operations. **********Under the agreement, there will be exchanges of technical personnel, documents, microfilm and electronic data, as well as cooperation in automating offices, classifying and indexing documents and sharing information on patent grants. **********Gerald J.

Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader. They assert that Colonel Qaddafi had made no effort to disguise his plan of controlling Chad and of eventually unifying all African Moslems under the Libyan banner. **********Because of the Libyan's declared goal of a greater Islamic state and his disdain for the independent African countries created from former European colonies, the Administration deems the situation in Chad very serious. **********Officials said today that if Colonel Qaddafi, working through Goukouni Oueddei, former President of Chad, was able to overthrow the Government of Hissen Habre, the likely result would be problems for nations such as the Sudan, Niger, Nigeria, Egypt, Cameroon, the Central African Republic and Senegal, all of which are pro-Western and all of which feel, in varying degrees, threatened by Libya. **********Libyans Bolstering Troops **********There is a pause in the fighting in Chad, but American officials said that, having helped Chad rebels seize about half the country, Libya was now rushing in additional forces for a possible offensive against Ndjamena, the capital city. **********So far, there are about 3,500 Libyan soldiers in Chad, along with tanks and armored personnel carriers, backed by bombers and fighters based in Libya or in the disputed stretch of frontier called the Aozou Strip, seized by Libya from Chad in 1973. **********In addition, the rebel forces, under former President Goukouni, have about 1,500 lightly armed troops. There are also believed to be a further 1,000 or 1,500 armed men assigned to the Libyan-led Islamic Legion in Chad, officials said. **********The forces of Mr. Habre total about 3,000, officials said, and they are bolstered by a growing French force that may reach 2,000 and 2,000 Zairians. The United States, which has supplied military aid, has flown two Awacs reconnaissance planes to the Sudan for possible use if France - which has a security treaty with Chad - decides to commit fighter planes in defense of its former colony.   We Are Coming to a Crunch' **********''I guess you could say we are coming to a crunch,'' one Administration official said. ''Qaddafi may try to push on further south, or he might be planning to partition Chad and avoid a battle with the French, but even that would be unacceptable to us and to everybody else since that would permanently destablize Chad and put Libyan troops right on the western borders of the Sudan.'' **********''American policy is for Libya to get out of Chad,'' he said. ''The Libyans should not be in Chad. We have to show the Libyans they cannot win in Chad. We also have to do what we can to get the Africans united in pressing Qaddafi out.'' **********Colonel Qaddafi has sent troops into Chad before, but each time was prevailed upon to withdraw, most recently in 1981, when by a twist of history, Mr. Goukouni, then President, asked him to pull his forces out. **********Mr. Goukouni, however, lost out several months later in a power struggle with Mr. Habre, a former colleague from northern Chad who turned against him many years ago.   C.I.A. Backed Habre With Money **********The United States at one time backed Mr. Habre with Central Intelligence Agency funds when he was operating out of the Sudan and Libyan forces were in Chad. **********But when the Libyans departed, the United States urged him not to continue his civil war with Mr. Goukouni, and instead work toward unifying Chad, a senior Administration official said. Mr. Habre rejected this advice. **********Mr. Goukouni then fled Chad and made his way to Libya once again to seek help from Colonel Qaddafi. Early this year, American and French intelligence noticed large-scale movements of troops and equipment toward Libya's border with Chad.   Qaddafi's Book Is Cited **********In describing their interpretation of Colonel Qaddafi's designs, experts on Libya begin with his so-called ''Green Book,'' which sets forth the revolutionary ideology that the Libyan leader calls the ''third universal theory.'' **********In it, he advocates a restructured world. And that explains, officials say, Libya's backing for subversive or revolutionary and terrorist groups in such places as Latin America, Northern Ireland and the Philippines. **********He has placed his emphasis, however, on Africa, and in the belt that cuts across the continent below the Sahara, where more than half the population is Moslem. In Chad, for instance, 50 percent of the population is estimated to be Moslem, the rest Christian or tribal. In Niger, the percentage of Moslems is 85 percent, in the Sudan, 60 percent. **********''As Qaddafi sees it, since the Arabs are already spiritually united through the Koran, there is a connection between Arab unity and Islam,'' a leading Nigerian scholar, Oye Ogunbadejo, writes in the current issue of International Security, a journal published at Harvard. ''Only the artificial political boundaries, created by the former colonial powers, and the reactionary regimes in the Arab states prevent the realization of total unity.'' **********Colonel Qaddafi has been accused of financing or directing subversive plots in such varied countries as Morocco, Niger, the Sudan, Egypt, Tunisia, Ghana, Upper Volta, Nigeria, Gambia, Somalia, Senegal and Mali. He has also been accused by the United States of sending assassination teams abroad and of providing safe haven for many known terrorists, including the plotters of the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre. **********Mr. Ogunbadejo and others have said that, given the discontent inside Libya, the signs of occasional mutiny in his 55,000-man army, and his vast $13 billion arsenal, Colonel Qaddafi seems almost eager to embark on foreign adventures to distract his people.   Special Attention From U.S. **********The Reagan Administration, from the start, has singled out the colonel for special attention. It has severed relations with Libya, and banned imports of oil from there. But although France has also reacted with concern to Libyan moves in Africa, it has refused in part for economic reasons to treat Colonel Qaddafi as a pariah. It buys oil from Libya and argues that it is important to keep lines of communication open with the Libyans. **********In addition to this specific difference, President Francois Mitterrand of France has sought to distance his policy toward Chad from Washington's. But American officials in the White House, Pentagon and State Department all said today that American and French policy has been closely coordinated. **********One State Department official, with long experience in French affairs, said: ''I can't remember a crisis with better consultation between Paris and Washington.'' **********''Mitterrand's problem is that it is a tenet of French policy not to be seen marching arm in arm with America,'' the official said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/12/business/plans-for-bl-ltd.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-05-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 68, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Plans for BL Ltd.", "print_headline": "Plans for BL Ltd.", "body_text": " **********The Conservative Government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has agreed to sell shares of the stateowned BL Ltd. to the public as soon as possible if it wins reelection in June, the Minister of State for Industry, Norman Lamont, said.

He was dismissed Nov. 18, 1981. Although he had worked at Nationwide since December 1966, he was covered neither by a personal employment contract nor by a union contract - a status known as employment at will, which has traditionally meant that the employee can be dismissed at any time for any reason. Recently, though, more and more courts have recognized exceptions to that doctrine. **********Examples of Wrongful Discharge **********For example, many courts have ruled that the company is guilty of wrongful discharge when an employee is dismissed for refusing to perform tasks that are against public policy. In past cases, employees have been protected when they have refused to perjure themselves or have blown the whistle on corporate wrongdoing. **********In the Novosel case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia, said that an attempt to control an employee's political expression was also against public policy, so that political adherence to the employer's views could not be made a condition of employment. **********''This case raises a whole new area for employers to be concerned about: whether they can terminate employees for what they say or what political actions they take,'' said Charles Bakaly, a California lawyer who specializes in defending management in labor cases. **********''It goes further than any case I've ever seen in upholding employees' First Amendment rights,'' he said. ''From this decision, it would not be much of an extension to say that workers have the right to tell their boss that he stinks, or to go on television and announce that the company's products are no good. The ramifications of this decision are incredible.'' **********Focus on Political Expression **********Although the Novosel decision, issued on Oct. 26 and written by United States Circuit Judge Arlin M. Adams, mentioned general free- speech concerns, it focused mostly on freedom of political expression. **********''The protection of an employee's freedom of political expression would appear to involve no less compelling a societal interest than the fulfillment of jury service or the filing of a worker's compensation claim,'' the opinion said. ''An important public policy is in fact implicated wherever the power to hire and fire is utilized to dictate the terms of employee political activities.'' **********Mr. Novosel's complaint ''discloses no plausible and legitimate reason for terminating his employment, and his discharge violates a clear mandate of public policy,'' the court said. **********Since the Circuit Court decided only the legal principle that such a firing might be illegal, the case was sent back to the trial court for further proceedings to determine the facts of Mr. Novosel's particular case. **********Richard C. Polley, the lawyer who represented Nationwide, said the company would ask the court for a rehearing by all the judges on the circuit. ''We think the decision is an aberration,'' he said. ''This wasn't just an employee not supporting the legislation, it was an employee who opposed it and went to upper-level company personnel to express his views against it.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/21/business/executive-changes-056865.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-11-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 299, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "body_text": " ***********  Del Monte Corp., San Francisco, has named R.

Ikle, the third ranking official in the Pentagon. **********The tone of the speech, which Mr. Ikle is to deliver to the Baltimore Council on Foreign Affairs, includes some of the harshest criticism of Congress by the Reagan Administration on this or any other foreign policy issue, Administration officials said. They said it was endorsed last week by White House aides over the opposition of some State Department experts on Latin America. An advance text was made available by a foreign policy adviser involved in its preparation. **********It says, in part, ''As long as Congress keeps crippling the President's military assistance program, we will have a policy always shy of success.'' It also says: ''The President's policy for Central America has not been given a chance to work. Congress has denied the President the means to succeed.''  'An Arsenal for Insurgency' **********In addition, the speech offers the clearest statement to date by the Administration on United States opposition to the Nicaraguan Government. **********''We must prevent consolidation of a Sandinista regime in Nicaragua that would become an arsenal for insurgency,'' the text says. ''If we cannot prevent that, we have to anticipate the partition of Central America. Such a development would then force us to man a new military front line of the East-West conflict, right here on our continent.'' **********Senior Administration officials said the speech will be the kickoff for an intense Administration campaign this fall to fight for increases in security assistance to El Salvador and Honduras and against a cutoff in American support for Nicaraguan rebels. **********Congress has not completed action on a series of requests for supplemental security assistance for El Salvador and Honduras for the current fiscal year, but the Senate and House committees involved have approved less than half of the $110 million in extra money asked for El Salvador. The House voted last month to end support for Nicaraguan rebels.  'We're Fed Up' **********''We've had it with the opposition in Congress,'' a senior Administration official said today. ''We're fed up with their interference on one hand and their lack of support on the other and we intend to fight for what we think is a minimum American commitment in the region.'' **********The decision to go on the attack, which was reportedly supported by Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger, William P. Clark, the White House national security adviser, and William J. Casey, the Director of Central Intelligence, appears to end a protracted debate within the Administration about how best to deal with Congress on Central America. **********The State Department has advocated using a conciliatory posture to try to negotiate compromises with Congress on security assistance and support for Nicaraguan rebels. **********This tactic was openly ridiculed by Defense Department officials, including Mr. Ikle, who argued that the best way to handle Congress was to hold out for the Administration's goals and make Congress take responsibility if American policy failed. **********Administration officials see the coming fight as a crossroads for American policy in Central America. They are particularly concerned that a failure to obtain continued financing for Nicaraguan rebels in the 1984 fiscal year, which begins next month, will lead to a serious setback for United States interests in the region. The Administration has requested $50 million to finance rebel activities in fiscal 1984. Warning of a 'Second Cuba' **********The House, which has voted to cut off financing for the Nicaraguan rebels in fiscal 1983, is not expected to approve any money for the operation in budget bills for 1984. The Republican-controlled Senate, which has not supported last month's House cutoff, is likely to vote to extend the financing, forcing the two houses to resolve the issue when the budget legislation comes up for compromise negotiations between the House and Senate. **********The text of Mr. Ikle's speech warns that a failure to extend financing could allow Nicaragua to become a ''second Cuba'' that would pose a direct military threat to its neighbors. In a direct slap at the House vote to cut off money for the rebels, the text says, ''The House, in effect, voted to establish a sanctuary for the Sandinistas.'' It goes on to charge that a failure by Congress to continue financing for the rebels would be tantamount to creating ''safe havens'' for terrorist and insurgent attacks."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/09/world/us-is-exploring-new-vatican-ties.html": {"writer_name": "Francis Clines", "pub_date": "1983-12-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 520, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. IS EXPLORING NEW VATICAN TIES", "print_headline": "U.S. IS EXPLORING NEW VATICAN TIES", "body_text": " **********The Reagan Administration said today that it was exploring the establishment of stronger relations with the Vatican. **********The State Department confirmed that it was consulting with officials at the Vatican on the question of closer relations.

On Thursday, Warner Communications reported that it had lost $283 million in the quarter because of poor performance in its Atari unit, and on Friday, Texas Instruments said it had lost $119 million in the same period. **********All three companies have been caught in a spiral of price cutting and sharply diminished sales in what a year ago was a booming home entertainment market, consisting mostly of video games and lowpriced computers. **********While industry experts say they expect a healthy demand to emerge for inexpensive home computers once the machines are capable of performing sophisticated tasks, they express doubts that video games will prove to be more than a fad. **********Mattel, noting its fiscal second quarter does not end until July 30, cautioned that ''the magnitude of the second-quarter operating loss is not yet fully determinable.'' **********But analysts suggested that the recent experiences of Atari and Texas Instruments made it likely that Mattel's second-quarter pretax loss may exceed the $100 million mark. In the first quarter, ended April 30, the company lost $20.4 million on sales of $197 million. In last year's second quarter, Mattel earned $17.1 million on sales of $329.7 million. **********In yesterday's statement, Mattel said that ''actions are being taken to minimize operating losses in the electronics division.'' Spencer Boise, a company spokesman, declined to elaborate, but a month ago Mattel laid off about 260 workers in its Hawthorne, Calif., headquarters. Industry analysts speculated yesterday that more layoffs would be required for the company to reduce its overhead. **********''After what happened to Warner and Texas Instruments, this announcement does not surprise me,'' Edward J. Atorino, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, said yesterday. ''Mattel had a disastrous first quarter, and the second quarter just got worse.'' **********Mattel makes the Intellivision home video game line, which at one time appeared as if it might make a strong showing against Atari, once the leader of the video game market. ''The company had a product advantage at one time, and could have made some strategic moves,'' noted Martin Romm, an analyst with the First Boston Corporation. Squeezed by Coleco **********But the company lost its chance, Mr. Romm said, and was quickly squeezed by Coleco, which introduced a highly popular video game system. Coleco was the only video game machine manufacturer to report a profit in the second quarter. It said earnings rose 23 percent, to $9.1 million; sales rose 45.5 percent, to $126.3 million. **********There were also indications yesterday that Mattel was considering getting out of the home computer business, which it entered earlier this year. The company is currently test marketing the Acquarius, its first computer, in Los Angeles, Chicago, Atlanta and Detroit. ''We will continue to support the Intellivision product category,'' Mr.  Boise said. But he said the company ''was currently reassessing'' its support for computer products. **********The Acquarius, to be sold for about $200, was plagued with technical problems even before it was delivered to stores in its test markets. And it was delivered at a time when retailers across the country are seeking to dump their inventories of unsold home computers and the software cartridges that fit them. Shift in Executive Group **********If the company abandoned its home computer efforts, it would mark the first shift in policy since Mattel reported the resignation of Joshua W. Denham, president of the electronics division, two weeks ago.

Vartanian, the F.S.L.I.C.'s general counsel, said that similar suits were being prepared against officers and directors of ''9 or 10'' other savings and loan associations, whose deposits were insured by the agency and which were forced into mergers to avoid failure. **********Last February, a similar suit was filed against the First Savings and Loan Association of Suffolk, Va.  According to a news release issued yesterday by the F.S.L.I.C., New York and Suburban had $500 million in assets and was failing when it was forced by the agency to merge into another New York City institution, the Anchor Savings Bank, on May 29, 1981. So far, the F.S.L.I.C. has provided $137 million in such assistance. **********The suit, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges that, for 16 months, the directors of New York and Suburban refused to allow the F.S.L.I.C.  to merge the failing thrift unit into a stronger institution unless the agency and the successor institution ''agreed to the continued employment of the president and chairman of the board.'' **********The suit does not state the amount being sought. The F.S.L.I.C.  said that it would ask the court to set the figure, but Mr. Vartanian noted that the suit says the association lost $35 million while the directors delayed a merger for 16 months. **********''We don't try to sue everybody because their financial institution could not weather the financial crisis,'' said Ralph Christy, the agency's deputy counsel. But he said the F.S.L.I.C. would act when it believed the management and directors of an association had acted imprudently. **********Mr. Vartanian said that ''the board feels very strongly in this area; the protection for deregulation has clearly got to be strong enforcement against those who abuse the responsibilities that deregulation implies.'' **********He added that, in the future, ''suits will range from golden parachutes while the institution was insolvent, and negligent management, to action against officers and directors, and in some cases their lawyers, for criminal violations.''

Only Mr. Bandes, an attorney, could be reached. He said that he had not heard about the suit and that he could not comment on it. **********The suit also charges that ''at a time that the association was insolvent and sustaining large operating losses, the directors engaged in self-dealing and violated a written agreement with the bank board by approving substantial salary increases to its president and chairman of the board and fee increases to its directors,'' according to the news release. The bank board is the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates the nation's savings and loan associations. **********The suit also says that during the same period ''directors inappropriately voted to pay the president and chairman of the board more than $124,000 in accrued vacation pay in violation of the association's own established policies,'' the release said. **********In addition, the suit charges that the directors refused to comply with directives from the bank board relating to how New York and Suburban accounted for losses taken on trading in so-called Ginnie Mae securities. The suit says that the board asked the thrift institution to write the entire losses off immediately, but that instead it amortized the losses over a period of time."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/16/business/kroehler-manufacturing-co-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 63, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "KROEHLER MANUFACTURING CO reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "KROEHLER MANUFACTURING CO reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/02/business/century-factors-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-03-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 56, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CENTURY FACTORS INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "CENTURY FACTORS INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/31/business/rolls-airplane-unit-has-loss.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-03-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 71, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rolls Airplane Unit Has Loss", "print_headline": "Rolls Airplane Unit Has Loss", "body_text": " **********Rolls-Royce Ltd., the state-owned airplane engine manufacturer, said it had a 1982 pretax loss of $132.4 million against a profit of $26.2 million the previous year.

He also emphasized he would welcome any help the central Government could provide. This move, he added, was not meant to be a prelude to the establishment of a Druse ''ministate.'' **********'Conscientious Objectors' **********But Mr. Jumblat raised some suspicions about his ultimate intentions in the minds of senior Government officials today when he visited several hundred Druse soldiers who had gone to Hammana, a Syrian-occupied town some 18 miles east of Beirut. The soldiers there are acting as ''conscientious objectors,'' refusing to take part in any attempt by the Lebanese Army to use force to impose its authority over Druse-controlled areas. **********The several hundred Druse soldiers who have asked to be relieved of fighting responsibility make up only a small part of Lebanon's 34,000-man army. In a speech at the Hammana barracks, Mr. Jumblat called on all Lebanese Army soldiers to follow the Druse example and refuse to fight. **********In a hastily called meeting with reporters this evening, Farouk Jabber, a presidential adviser, said of Mr. Jumblat's actions: ''I reckon it is an attempt to really partition Lebanon on a cantonlike basis. There are many indications that what Mr. Jumblat is doing is trying to realize his part of the Syrian strategy at the moment in Lebanon.'' **********Conference Hopes Dampened **********The exchange of charges between Mr. Jumblat and the Gemayel Government dampened hopes for a quick convening of the proposed national reconciliation conference, which is to bring together Lebanon's factional leaders in an attempt to find a solution to the country's conflicts. **********Neither a date nor a location for the proposed conference has been agreed upon yet, and as one senior official put it: ''The dialogue at this point is at zero. The situation is so dangerous. If Jumblat attacks the Government and army and sets up his own administration, what are we going to discuss?'' **********The latest conflict between Mr. Jumblat and the Gemayel Government began Saturday morning in Beit Eddin, 18 miles southeast of Beirut in the heart of the Shuf Mountains, where Mr. Jumblat addressed a gathering of Druse leaders. **********'Civilian Administration' **********In a prepared statement read to the gathering, Mr. Jumblat announced it had been decided to set up a ''civilian administration'' in the Shuf and Aleih regions controlled by the Druse. It would handle civilian affairs ''during the extraordinary conditions the country is now living through'' and would serve as a Druse pressure bloc to get the Government to extend more services to their areas ''when peaceful conditions are established,'' the statement said. **********The administration would consist of a general assembly made up of the military forces in the regions and representatives from each village, overseen by a higher administrative committee. **********Mr. Jumblat appeared to be genuinely suprised today at the reaction by the Gemayel Government to this announcement, which he saw as a natural response to the human problems in the Druse-controlled areas. **********The Druse have long argued that the central Government has neglected economic development in their districts, while lavishing it on Christian regions. In addition, as a result of the fighting in the last year in the Shuf and Aleih regions, roads, water, electricity and all social services are badly in need of repair. Travelers through the Shuf on Saturday found Druse gunmen in some areas exacting a $2 toll from drivers to pay for the repair of roads.   Basic Services for Citizens **********''Everybody is afaid of this so-called local administration,'' Mr. Jumblat told reporters today in Hammana. ''We have undertaken these measures yesterday just to facilitate for the citizens of the Shuf some basic things: water, electricity.'' **********He added: ''It is not a separatist movement, and we are ready to cooperate with the state. I don't know why Amin Gemayel suddenly woke up at 12 P.M. and decided we were announcing some partition. That is ridiculous.'' **********For reasons that are not immediately clear, it was not until midnight Saturday that Mr. Gemayel was made aware of Mr. Jumblat's announcement. When he did learn of it, he called an emergency meeting of his top advisers, the state-run Beirut radio said. **********By this morning, pro-Government newspapers were on the streets with large headlines complaining about Mr. Jumblat's ''partitionist'' plans. Both the state-run radio and the Christian Phalangist radio picked up the theme, as Mr. Gemayel held a series of meetings with senior Government officials and national political figures.   Christian Ministate **********Several Lebanese political analysts said the Government was overreacting to Mr. Jumblat's move. The presidential adviser, Mr. Jabber, was asked why the Government was so concerned about Mr. Jumblat's moves while it seemed to ignore the ministate that has been run for the last eight years by the Christian Phalangist militia, which was founded by President Gemayel's father, Pierre. Mr. Jabber avoided answering the question. **********Senior Government officials explained that they had evidence that the Syrians wanted to set up local administrations loyal to them in all the Syrian- controlled regions of Lebanon, and they see Mr. Jumblat's actions as serving this Syrian plan. They also see his moves as satisfying Israel's stated objective of creating a Druse-controlled buffer zone between Israeli troops and the Syrians and Palestinians. **********Mr. Jumblat did little to allay Government suspicions about his ultimate aims when he visited the Lebanese Army garrison in Hammana today. The barracks is in a Syrian-controlled area where there is only a token Lebanese Army presence. In the past two weeks, the Commander in Chief of the Lebanese Army, Maj. Gen. Ibrahim Tannous, has allowed some 270 Druse soldiers and 30 Druse officers to go the Hammana barracks so they would not be faced with the choice of having to either fight their fellow Druse or leave the army. **********According to Defense Ministry sources, General Tannous proposed a compromise under which he agreed to treat the Druse soldiers as ''conscientious objectors,'' provided they stayed in the Hammana barracks and did not take up arms against the Lebanese Army.   Appeal for Support **********Mr. Jumblat told the cheering crowd of several hundred soldiers, the vast majority of them said to be Druse: ''We are appealing to all the soldiers and officers to join us. We as politicians and they as soldiers stick to the fact that the Lebanese Army should remain united, but it should not be used before the national reconciliation, and it should not be used in purely internal Lebanese issues.'' **********The soldiers in the garrison issued a list of demands that called for, among other things, the return of all Lebanese Army units to their barracks until national reconciliation had been achieved and a serious review of the army's command structure in order to prevent its involvement in internal affairs and ''its bias in favor of one faction, which is now the case.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/18/business/credit-markets-more-confidence-on-rate-fall.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1983-04-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 671, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MORE CONFIDENCE ON RATE FALL", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; MORE CONFIDENCE ON RATE FALL", "body_text": " **********The credit markets grew more confident last week that interest rates were likely to decline this year. After a few days of inactivity, the credit markets closed with a flurry as investors were eager buyers of new corporate issues, while prices rose modestly for Treasury issues. **********Although not all of the $1 billion of corporate issues were instant sell-outs, analysts said that the overall reception was good. Many of the major issues were not announced until Thursday, or even Friday in the case of $200 million of Aaa/AA+-rated 11 percent debentures of the Atlantic Richfield Company. **********The market's ready acceptance of $1 billion of new corporate issues last week was proof that investors still see good value in bonds, even though a sharp drop in interest rates is not expected anytime soon. **********Richard Bianco, head of the fixed-income trading area at Dillon, Read & Company, said that ''investors are buying bonds more for income and not as much because of prospects for capital gains. I still expect some capital gains, but that is no longer the main attraction.'' Changed Outlook on Inflation **********One reason for the change in investor attitude is the changed outlook for inflation. Not only are bond yields high compared with recent inflation rates, but they are also high compared with the inflation that is expected in the future. **********Expectations that inflation will not accelerate were confirmed in a recent poll of 497 institutional decision makers by Richard B. Hoey, chief economist at A.G. Becker-Warburg Paribas Becker Inc. Survey respondents included investment officers, corporate financial officers, bank portfolio managers, stock portfolio managers, economists and other analysts. **********The consensus of this group was that inflation during the next 10 years will rise at an annual rate of 6.3 percent, which would be down from 6.6 percent in December 1982 and well below the 8.8 percent annual price increases expected during the next 10 years in an October 1980 survey. A breakdown of the inflationary expectations showed that while prices were expected to rise by only 4 1/4 percent in the 12 months ending December 1983, the price gains would increase in later years. **********Comparing the 10-year inflation outlook with the 10.47 percent yield on 10-year Treasury notes at the time of the survey resulted in a real interest rate of about 4 percent, half the 8 1/4 percent real interest rate in September 1981. Bullish on Markets **********Mr. Hoey's survey also showed that decision makers were bullish on the stock and bond markets, as three-fourths of the survey group expected to reduce their holdings of cash or near-cash securities during the next three months. About four-fifths of the respondents expected stocks to outperform bonds during the next 12 months. **********The bullishness of institutional investors may bode well for the stock and taxable bond markets, but it could have less of an impact on the tax-exempt bond market where individuals account for an estimated three-quarters of all purchases. **********''Income tax payments are very much on the minds of investors, and the recent increase in buying of municipal bonds can be traced directly to concern over how little income the tax system allows the general public to keep,'' said S.E. Canaday Jr., a vice president at John Nuveen & Company. 'Too Much Too Soon' **********Even though the general trend is for lower yields later in the year, Mr. Canaday said the ''current rally seems to be a little too much too soon.'' As the April 15 income tax payments fade in memory, he said the heavy supply of new tax-exempts could cause prices to fall slightly. **********The latest economic and banking statistics give no definitive clues to future changes in interest rates. The economy is recovering, as shown by the 1.1 percent increase in industrial production for March, but analysts say that an increase in credit demands and inflationary pressures might still be a few quarters away."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/21/world/around-the-world-yugoslavia-says-albania-threatens-to-use-force.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-01-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 182, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Yugoslavia Says Albania Threatens to Use Force", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Yugoslavia Says Albania Threatens to Use Force", "body_text": " **********The Yugoslav Government accused Albania today of ''openly threatening to use force'' against it and demanded an end to what it termed Albania's hostile policy. **********A protest note handed to the Albanian Ambassador, Lika Seiti, also attacked Enver Hoxha, the head of Albania's ruling Communist Government since 1944, and accused him of making ''monstrous fabrications'' about Yugoslavia to divert attention from his own problems. **********This was an allusion to Mr. Hoxha's recent assertion that his Prime Minister for 27 years, Mehmet Shehu, had been a spy for Yugoslavia.

''But we are watchful here and we know how to dodge.'' **********A Most Laissez-Faire Capital **********In most cities of the world, a place like the Yaba railroad market would certainly seem outlandish and would probably be prohibited. In this most laissez-faire capital, however, hardly anyone gives it a second thought. **********The market consists of a hundred- odd wood, cinderblock and corrugated metal stalls pressed close against either side of a half-mile stretch of railway tracks near the station at Yaba, a congested neighborhood of crumbling buildings crisscrossed by open sewers and blotched by hills of rubbish. **********From the stalls, Mr. Boniface and the other merchants spread their wares directly onto the rails, where the customers, well-heeled and down-at- the-heel alike, meander about, browsing and haggling. Other traders who have no stalls just set up folding tables on the rails. **********There are shirts and pants, shoes and socks for sale, as well as sheets, pillowcases, towels and brightly printed material by the yard. Soda, fruits, vegetables and bread are also sold on the tracks, and now and then a barber will give a customer a trim between the whistles of the trains. **********When that whistle blows, the entrepreneurs of Yaba casually and quietly pick up their things and move off to one side - or at least to the next track over - until the train has passed.   The Rent Is Cheap **********The mother of the Yaba market is economy. At most markets in Lagos, the rental of a stall costs as much as 100 naira, or $135 at the official rate of exchange, and the rent may be demanded many months in advance. At Yaba, the selling space is practically free. **********''Years ago the police would come and beat you and try to make you close down,'' said a trader who asked not to be named. ''Now we dash them a little,'' he said, using the local term for giving a bribe, ''and it has been a year since they stopped worrying us.'' **********''It still works out much cheaper to be here than to rent a stall in Tejuoso or Jankara,'' he added, referring to two of Lagos's best-known official markets.   Members of the Ibo Tribe **********Nearly all the traders at Yaba belong to the Ibo tribe, people from the region of Nigeria formerly known as Biafra.  Many Ibos came to Lagos in search of a living after the Nigerian civil war at the end of the 1960's, a war that successfully crushed the Biafran independence movement and left the region poor and starving. **********A few set themselves up as textile merchants along the railroad tracks near the Yaba station, a convenient location for many neighborhood commuters. In time other Ibo traders joined them, and before long Yaba won a reputation as a bargain-hunter's paradise. **********''Everything is much cheaper here,'' said John Bolingo, a merchant. ''See this shirt? In a shop it would cost you 35 naira. But here? Twenty-two naira. Maybe I could even sell it to you for 20. That's why everybody comes to Yaba. Senators, legislators, all kinds of officials.''  The Traffic Jam Traders **********There are other traders in this city who make their living in an equally thrifty but no less precarious fashion, selling such goods as sunglasses, video and audio cassettes, fruit, biscuits and magazines on the highways during Lagos's notorious traffic jams. **********''Most of those boys are Ibos, too,'' said Arthur Uchegibo, a Yaba textile trader. ''It's a risky business, but we are an industrious people and used to fighting to survive.'' **********A senior British diplomat here said that when he first arrived in Lagos he avoided the traffic jam traders. ''I thought they'd probably take my money and run or something,'' he said. ''But it's just the opposite. They run after you to give you your change. It must be a sort of code of honor among them. And it's a bloody convenient way to shop.'' **********There is some disagreement about just how perilous it is to be a roadside or railroad track salesman. ''People get killed here sometimes,'' said Chief Patrick Anani, the stationmaster at Yaba. But he could not recall the last time anyone had actually been hit by a train. **********''The people who say it's dangerous are just trying to get rid of us,'' Mr. Uchegibo said. ''We know what we're doing. We know when the trains are coming and we have no trouble getting out of the way.'' **********Mr. Boniface added: ''And what if it is dangerous? Where else are we to go? This is our livelihood. We have no other.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/28/world/around-the-world-spain-will-reshape-military-command.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-10-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 135, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Spain Will Reshape Military Command", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Spain Will Reshape Military Command", "body_text": " **********The Spanish Government has approved plans to overhaul the chain of command in the armed forces to bring them more firmly under Government control, a Government spokesman said today. **********The measures, decided at a Cabinet meeting Wednesday night, are designed to strengthen the role of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and his Cabinet in deciding military policy, the spokesman said. **********The move followed the dismissal last month of a senior army general who criticized the Government, raising fears that some sectors of the armed forces were not fully reconciled to Spain's new democracy. **********Under the proposed changes, the existing post of president of a joint commission of army, navy and air force chiefs of staff would be replaced by a single military chief of staff."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/14/business/hotel-check-in-computerized.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-09-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 190, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hotel Check-In Computerized", "print_headline": "Hotel Check-In Computerized", "body_text": " **********The Hyatt Hotels Corporation today introduced a computer terminal that allows guests to check in and out of its hotels by using a credit card.

Long, chairman of the panel, the Foreign Operations subcommittee, said after the 7-to-5 vote.  ''There will be no more dollars until we see measurable progress.'' **********In the compromise, proposed by Mr. Long, the committee attached four conditions to the appropriation: **********- Appointment by the President of a special envoy with ambassadorial rank to help the Salvadorans hold free, fair and safe elections. **********- Review by the Administration of all evidence pertaining to the murder of four American churchwomen. **********- The opening of prisons and detention centers to ''unnanounced and unrestricted'' inspection by the Red Cross. **********- Release of political prisoners and early enactment of an amnesty law.  Administration officials said Mr. Reagan had asked former Senator Richard B. Stone of Florida to become the special envoy. (Page A13.) Wednesday night, Mr. Reagan is to address a joint session of Congress on the problems of Central America.  Immediately after the vote today, Mr. Long distributed copies of a letter from Secretary of State George P. Shultz that acknowledged the Administration's intent to comply with the committee's conditions.  Mr. Long, a Maryland Democrat, visited El Salvador last weekend and said he had found ''a real willingness on the part of the leadership of El Salvador to come to grips with their problems, especially on human rights.'' **********In his letter, Mr. Shultz sought to answer Congressional criticisms of Salvador's treatment of political prisoners. He also said he had ordered a high-level inquiry into the slaying of the churchwomen in 1981. More broadly, he said the Administration was promoting judicial changes in El Salvador. **********The committee earlier rejected, 7-5, a Republican move to provide the full $60 million requested by the President, and then voted 6-6 against a Democratic move to delay action for 90 days. The swing vote on Mr. Long's compromise proposal was cast by Representative Matthew F. McHugh, Democrat of New York, sponsor of the unsuccessful proposal to delay action, who said that rejection of Mr. Long's proposal would enable the Administration to spend the full $60 million. **********The committee action capped a day of intensive congressional activity concerning Central America. The Senate held a closed, 90-minute session in which members of the intelligence committee were questioned concerning Administration activities in the region. **********Mr. Reagan meanwhile met with members of the House intelligence committee, including several who spent recent days in Central America, to lobby against a Democratic proposal that would cut off covert military aid to Nicaraguan rebels and instead provide overt aid to friendly nations to help stop weapons flowing to guerillas in El Salvador. The committee is scheduled to meet Thursday on this proposal. 'We Have a Problem' **********Representative Edward P. Boland, Democrat of Massachusetts, was asked afterward whether he still believed that the Administration had violated a prohibition - of which he was the author -against providing covert aid for the purpose of overthrowing the Nicaraguan Government. ''I think we're beyond that question now,'' he said. **********The real question, he said, was ''whether the activities there are really in the interests of the United States.'' Pressed on whether he thought the law had been violated, Mr. Boland responded, ''My own judgment is that we have a problem with it.'' **********The House subcommittee vote came six weeks after Mr. Reagan asked for $110 million in additional military aid for El Salvador, of which $60 million was to be diverted from aid already appropriated and $50 million was to be in a new appropriation.  The Senate Foreign Operations subcommittee approved diversion of the entire $60 million, but the Senate Foreign Relations committee recommended only $30 million and attached conditions. The House Foreign Affairs commiteee has disapproved the $50 million in new aid, and the matter is still pending in the Senate Foreign Relations committee. **********Voting for Mr. Long's $30 million compromise today were: Democrats: Mr. Long, Mr. McHugh, Mr. Wilson.  Republicans: Mr. Kemp; Mickey Edwards, Oklahoma; Bob Livingston, Louisiana; Jerry Lewis, California.Voting against the compromise: Democrats: Mr. Obey; Sidney R. Yates, Illinois; William Lehman, Florida; Julian C. Dixon, California; William H. Gray, Pennsylvania.  Republicans: None.  Lieut. Gen. Wallace H. Nutting, the senior United States commander in Latin America, has recommended increasing the number of American advisers in El Salvador from 55 to about 150 and eventually to about 250, according to people who attended private meetings between him and visiting members of Congress this year.

Myers, the retired chief actuary of the American Social Security system, who went to Grenada on a technical mission for the Organization of American States on Oct. 13, said he flew out of Pearls Airport on Monday on one of four small charter flights carrying about 30 people. **********In a telephone interview, Mr. Myers said that there had been no difficulty leaving and that he had been told other flights left the island that morning when a four-day curfew was lifted. **********Canadian Embassy officials here also reported that they knew of several flights in and out of Pearls Airport on Monday through information from the Canadian High Commission, or embassy, in Barbados.One official said Canadian efforts to charter a plane from the Leeward Islands Air Transport Company to fly out 40 Canadian citizens from Grenada before the invasion had been blocked not by closing of the Grenadian airport but by a political decision of the Caricom group, the 13-nation Caribbean economic organization, to sever air links with Grenada. **********Owned by Caribbean Governments **********The Leeward Islands Air Transport Company is owned by the governments of Caricom, he said, so that the decision last week of the Caricom governments to sever air links with Grenada caused cancellation of the company's normal flow of scheduled daily flights to Grenada as well as blocking the company's charters. **********Previously, American officials had asserted that the interruption of regular flights and the problems encountered by the Canadian charter flight were evidence that the Grenadian airport was not operating reliably on Monday and thus helped justify the Administration's decision to use force Tuesday. **********''We did not know who was in charge there,'' Mr. Speakes said Wednesday. ''What they told us, we simply did not trust. There was no way we could be at all assured that their promises would have been kept.'' Without offering evidence, he insisted then and again today that the Grenadian airport was closed Monday. **********Caricom's temporary air embargo of Grenada followed the killing of former Prime Minister Maurice Bishop of Grenada, the imposition of a military curfew on Grenada on Oct. 19 and the closing of the airport that day. But Canadian officials and Mr. Myers reported that the curfew was eased on Saturday during daytime and lifted completely at 6 A.M. last Monday. **********Last weekend, morever, four American diplomats had flown to Grenada to meet with the leftist military rulers of the island and were told that Grenada's Revolutionary Military Council would reopen the airport Monday. Mr. Speakes said later that the United States felt it could not trust the offer because the airport would not permit landings and Washington was uncertain who was in control of the island. **********Nonetheless, Mr. Myers described fairly normal airport routines in operation Monday afternoon. He said Grenadian customs officials were processing departures normally, stamping passports and collecting airport taxes. He said four small, privately operated charter planes all evidently based on nearby islands had flown into Grenada and flew out of Pearls Airport between 2 and 6 P.M. **********''We went through the usual customs formalities and paid the airport tax,'' he said. ''There were no armed guards at the airport. There were just the usual customs officials. Nobody with a rifle.''  Left on 9-Seat Plane **********He and his wife, Ruth, left on the last of the four planes, a two-engine, nine- seat white Islander plane that had been originally chartered by the local office of the Scotia Bank. They shared the plane with two other men in Grenada on O.A.S. business, one a Jamaican and the other from Colombia, as well as a Caribbean banker, his wife and two children. **********American diplomats in Barbados have said American efforts to arrange an evacuation charter Monday broke down when Grenadian officials asked for six hours' advance notice of the plane's landing time and said they could not promise the safety of Americans en route from their residences to the airport. Mr. Myers said he had not encountered any violence traveling to the airport from the Spice Islands Inn, where he and his wife had stayed."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/20/business/bearings-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-01-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 56, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BEARINGS INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "BEARINGS INC reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/18/business/advertising-tv-workshop-adds-magazine.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1983-04-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 204, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TV Workshop Adds Magazine", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; TV Workshop Adds Magazine", "body_text": " **********The Children's Television Workshop, already the publisher of three successful magazines for youngsters, is now going to join the developing crush in the computer magazine field.

The party, for around 100 employees of the Merona Sport Company, was held in a loft decorated in authentic turn-of- the-century French trappings. **********Meanwhile, Mike Roman, president of Mixing Bowl Ltd., in Chicago, has ordered and will be dishing up 2,000 pounds of boneless chicken breasts, 1,200 pounds of tenderloin beef, 700 pounds of mushrooms, 600 pounds of baking hams and 420 heads of broccoli this holiday season. He will also serve 1,200 loaves of his special zucchini bread. **********Mr. Roman, the people at Breadline Catering Inc., and most other caterers declined to predict just how profitable this holiday season may be. But they did say it is one of their busiest ever. And nearly all of their work, they said, is for business customers. **********''We're doing around 25 percent of our year's business in December,'' said Boyce Brawley, part-owner of Breadline. ''Most are corporate parties of 500 to 1,000 people, where corporations are saying 'thank you' to their clients or employees.'' **********Breadline is what is known in the trade as an ''outside caterer'' - it brings its food to lofts, houses, yachts and other places, wherever someone is throwing a party. That is in contrast to hotels and restaurants that may also do special events, but mainly in their own establishments. **********Catering for a thousand people can ''easily'' cost $100,000 this year, Mr. Brawley said. Prices range ''from $25 per person for a cocktail party with assorted hors d'oeuvres, to $100 per person for a sitdown meal with full service, depending on the company's style and the time of day.'' **********And if clients are inclined toward expensive imports - Norwegian salmon, Russian caviar, and fresh fruits from New Zealand and Australia, and the pricier French champagnes are big at this time of year - the bill is, naturally, higher. **********Aside from the tension and round- the-clock work involved in turning tons of raw food into succulent holiday fare, the caterers' biggest headache is finding the people to do it all. **********Mr. Roman's company, for example, which had sales of $1.3 million last year, must triple its staff for December and therefore advertises widely for temporary help. Others, such as the Silver Palate in Manhattan, a wholesale and retail outlet, recruit assistants from a list of holiday reserves that includes ''out-of-work actors, students or freelance journalists,'' said Ellie McGowan, the catering coordinator. **********And what do these folks earn? ''Almost $90 for their first four hours of work on Christmas and New Year's,'' she said. ''This is probably our busiest time, and with Christmas, Thanksgiving and New Year's all within a month of each other, it's just a rat race.'' **********In addition to ''executing parties'' at Christmastime, the Silver Palate prepares and sends gourmet gift baskets, packed with their own chutneys, preserves, mustards and baked goods, that cost from $25 to $250. **********'Corporate Gift Giving' **********''This is a time for corporate gift giving, '' Mrs. McGowan said, citing clients such as Time Inc., Lehman Brothers and Compton Advertising. **********And regular caterers are so busy at this time of year that many companies seek out ''design'' consultants such as Harriette Rose and her husband, Dr. Martin Katz, owners of Gourmet Advisory Services in New York. They do not cook. Instead they call themselves ''party planners,'' and arrange the menu and decor for individual parties, preside over the results and charge 15 percent of the final bill as a consultation fee. **********Mrs. Rose, looking splendid in a gold lame gown one evening last week, was keeping close track of the all-desserts Christmas buffet she had put together for a real estate developer's 200 clients at the Helmsley Palace Hotel in New York. More than 3,000 individual desserts and glazed fruits, including 400 assorted chocolate truffles and Moroccan crepes, freshly prepared before the guests, were the stars of this show. **********Teeth in Jeopardy **********''They're going to walk in here and their teeth are going to fall out,'' Mrs. Rose said as she surveyed the scene just before the guests began arriving. ''I want the lights down and the ashtrays in place,'' she instructed. ''I want the mood in here.'' **********The mood is pretty good at the Vista International Hotel in New York's World Trade Center, where many of the holiday parties in the city's financial district are catered. **********''People's businesses have turned around this year,'' said Roger Davis, director of food and beverages at the hotel, a Hilton International affiliate. ''There's been an upturn in the economy and there's a much healthier attitude to spending. I certainly can't attribute it to anything else.'' **********The Vista's banquet halls and restaurants are expected to take in $1.4 million this month alone, about $400,000 more than average. **********''We've had to triple our bar and banquet service, and probably will double our profits over last year,'' Mr. Davis estimated. ''On Tuesday we had 1,650 people from a Wall Street investment house. That brought in $128,000.'' **********In the last three weeks alone, the Vista has ordered about 40 ''steamship rounds'' of beef, each weighing around 85 pounds and serving 250 people, Mr. Davis said. Beer orders have doubled to 4,800 bottles a week; orders for white wine have jumped to nearly 1,900 bottles a week. Scotch, twice as popular as other liquors, is running at about 900 quarts a week. **********Caterers of all kinds in the United States had sales of $814 million in 1982 and will reach at least $880 million this year, according to the National Restaurant Association. With the recovery under way in the service sector, catering sales are expected to achieve growth rates of 10.5 percent this year and 10.7 percent in 1984. A recent Department of Commerce survey found that there were 3,320 ''social caterers'' in the United States. **********Despite their expense, Christmas parties remain a ritual. ''These parties are really business tools, reaffirming a company's relationship with employees or clients,'' said Mr. Brawley of Breadline. **********Even so, some employees, at least, have mixed feelings about them. **********''It was a fine party,'' said one who attended the gala Christmas celebration put on by Ogilvy & Mather International, the advertising agency, at the Roseland Ballroom in New York last year, ''but I would have liked the money in my paycheck much more.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/01/world/around-the-world-paris-reports-sending-more-arms-to-chad.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-07-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 131, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Paris Reports Sending More Arms to Chad", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Paris Reports Sending More Arms to Chad", "body_text": " **********French officials said today that the Government had delivered 200 tons of military equipment to Chad since rebel forces captured a town in the north of the country last week. **********Previous reports had put the total at 35 tons. **********The officials said seven cargo planes containing arms, ammunition and vehicles had been flown to Ndjamena, the capital, in the last few days.

Shultz to make any apparent headway with President Hafez al-Assad of Syria on the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Lebanon leaves the country partitioned between Israel and Syria indefinitely, with the Lebanese Government's control limited to parts of Beirut. **********For the short run, State Department officials said, American efforts will probably be limited to what one official called ''damage control'' - maintaining contacts with Syria through the joint ''working groups'' agreed to by the Syrians today and trying to insure that Israel and Syria avoid a direct clash in the Bekaa, Lebanon's eastern valley, where their forces are virtually head to head. **********The lack of progress reported by Mr. Shultz has seemed to undercut American prestige in the region. The Lebanese and the Israelis, who both agreed to the terms for Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon at the urging of Mr. Shultz in May, are expressing concern privately and publicly over the American inability to obtain comparable results from the Syrians. **********The Israelis privately are accusing the United States of mishandling the situation. They are now saying that Mr. Shultz and his special envoy, Philip C. Habib, spent too much time trying to get them to agree to terms and not enough in pressing the Syrians to agree. They said Mr. Shultz and Mr. Habib assured them that if they agreed to withdraw, Syria would follow suit, assurances the Israelis say were unfounded. **********The Lebanese, under pressure from Syria not to agree to anything with Israel, are worried now that the United States will not be able to prevent the Israelis from reducing their forces and setting up a permanent zone of occupation in southern Lebanon, which would encourage Syria to remain permanently in its sector as well. **********White House and State Department officials said they wanted to wait for a full report from Mr. Shultz before commenting, but they remarked that they were not surprised at Mr. Shultz's reporting that he was unable to persuade Mr. Assad to be more forthcoming. They said there never was any expectation by Mr. Shultz or his senior advisers that he would achieve a breakthrough on this brief trip. Shultz Decided to Make Stop **********Nevertheless, they said that Mr. Shultz, by the time he reached Pakistan last Saturday on his round-the-world mission, decided that it would be more useful to stop in the Middle East than to fly over it. He recommended to Mr. Reagan, then in California, that he go to Syria and the other key countries in the region for a firsthand, unfiltered view of Syria's reasons for refusing to withdraw. Mr.  Reagan agreed. The White House said at the time that Mr. Reagan had talked with Mr. Shultz on the phone. Officials said that in fact, Mr. Shultz talked only with Robert C. McFarlane, the deputy chief of the National Security Council staff. **********What Mr. Shultz heard from Mr. Assad today, officials said, was apparently what Syria has been saying publicly for weeks: Syria is determined not to let Lebanon's agreement with Israel take effect.  The pact, in which Israel agreed to withdraw only when Syria and the Palestine Liberation Organization did also, would give Israel political, economic and security concessions from Lebanon. Syria's Condition for Pulling Out **********Syria says the accord would move Lebanon into Israel's sphere of influence. Since Syria can block the carrying out of the accord by refusing to leave Lebanon, the Syrians say they will agree to withdraw only if the Israelis do so without any concessions. This would not be acceptable to the Government of Prime Minister Menachem Begin, which has justified its invasion of Lebanon 13 months ago on the ground that it stands to gain virtual normalization of relations with another Arab country. **********Having been rebuffed by the Syrians both this time and when Mr.  Shultz met with Mr. Assad in May, the Reagan Administration must review its policy, officials said. Mr. Shultz's inclination, his aides say, is to be patient and assume that something can eventually be worked out and that contacts with Syria, Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries must be maintained in the hope that in time the Syrians will change their position. **********But one Administration official said today that such an appproach would play into Syria's hands by building up Mr. Assad without any certainty of success for the United States. One official said that in his view the United States was too conciliatory. He said that after the Syrians refused to receive Mr. Habib in May, it was a mistake for Mr. Shultz to go ''cap in hand'' to Syria today without Mr. Habib along. Mr. Shultz told reporters that Mr. Habib asked not to accompany Mr. Shultz. New Approach and U.S. Politics **********The official said he expected some White House officials to consider a different approach, particularly as they become more involved in planning a possible Reagan re-election campaign. They would try to take advantage of the relatively harmonious relations with Israel and to blame the Arabs, particularly the Syrians, who are heavily armed by the Soviet Union, for the lack of progress in the Middle East. **********This same argument can be used, they said, to explain the setback to the Administration's other major Middle East diplomatic initiative - Mr. Reagan's call last Sept. 1 for negotiations on the Palestinian question. The Reagan plan has, in effect, been shelved since King Hussein of Jordan decided in April not to join negotiations because the P.L.O. refused to give him its backing. **********In both initiatives, the effort to have Syria withdraw from Lebanon and the Reagan plan, the Administration counted on Saudi Arabia's behind-the-scenes influence to help. But in each case the Saudis were unable or unwilling to do much for the Americans. **********Saudi officials have said privately that although they give millions of dollars to Syria and the P.L.O., they are no more able to force them to do anything than the United States is able to get Israel to stop building settlements on the West Bank or to withdraw on its own from Lebanon."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/14/business/banks-and-oil-pricing-outook.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Bennett", "pub_date": "1983-02-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1854, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BANKS AND OIL PRICING OUTOOK", "print_headline": "BANKS AND OIL PRICING OUTOOK", "body_text": " **********A sharp decline in world oil prices could hurt the nation's banks more because of their loan exposure to the energy industry than because of their loans to oil-producing countries. **********This conclusion, which emerges from interviews with bankers and economists in the United States and overseas, sees the potential for many commercial energy producers and related companies to be squeezed by a steep drop in energy prices. This, in turn, could cause large losses at many banks that are active energy lenders, and the failure of some. **********At the same time, banking experts point out, direct loans to the energy producing countries are relatively safer because the major industrial nations would likely mount rescue operations to prevent any from collapsing. **********A sharp decline in the price of oil is considered possible in coming months because of the world's reduced energy requirements and the resulting disagreements among members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries about how to defend prices. **********Richard O'Brien, a London-based economist for the American Express International Banking Corporation, estimates that the banking industry could withstand an oil-price drop to $25 a barrel, an assumption shared by many bankers. American refiners paid an average price of $33 a barrel for imported oil in the fourth quarter of 1982. **********Even so, most bankers refuse to discuss the possibility that the average price of oil could drop below $25. ''A price of $25 to $26 a barrel is worst-case thinking,'' said William D. Breedlove, vice chairman of the Interfirst Corporation, the biggest bank holding company in Dallas and a major regional lender to the energy industry. **********Although accurate figures are hard to come by, it is estimated that American banks have at least $35 billion on loan to domestic energy companies, compared with about $43 billion to less-developed countries that are heavily dependent on oil revenues. Banks throughout the world are believed to have at least $70 billion on loan to energy companies and about $119 billion to oil-and-gas producing third world countries. **********But where such heavily indebted oil producers as Mexico and Venezuela would likely be helped by the leading industrialized countries should their revenues fall sharply, bankers note that there is little chance of such a rescue operation being mounted for the hundreds of small and medium-sized companies that might be pushed into bankruptcy by a price decline - or for the banks that lend to them. **********In fact, several American banks last year were able to avoid substantial write-offs of their loans to foreign governments only with the help of Federal aid and central bank intervention. Even so, some had to report large losses on loans to commercial borrowers overseas. **********At home, too, many banks last year had to write off large amounts of commercial energy-related loans. Such problems, for example, led to the failure of two medium-sized banks - the Penn Square Bank of Oklahoma City and the Abilene National Bank of Texas - and to huge losses that severely shook several larger ones. Neither the Government nor the Federal Reserve System intervened to save the banks or to soften their losses. **********Last month, the GHR Energy Corporation, a Louisiana oil and gas producer that is the nation's third-largest privately held industrial concern, filed for Chapter 11 under Federal bankruptcy laws as the result of lower demand and prices for its high-cost oil. GHR owed $375 million to American and foreign banks. **********''Obviously, everyone has to be concerned, but the prospects of a crisis are dim,'' said Mr. Breedlove. More than 30 percent of Interfirst's business loans are to the oil and gas industry. No Reliable Numbers **********James McDermott Jr., director of research for Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, a securities firm that specializes in bank stocks, stressed that the paucity of information made any predictions difficult.  ''You try to get aggregate figures and you go crazy,'' Mr. McDermott said. **********The Federal Reserve compiles some statistics, though. At the end of 1982, it says, the nation's large banks had $29.6 billion on loan to what it describes as ''mining'' companies. Economists believe that most of this total, in fact, was to oil and gas producers. In addition, the Fed reports that banks had $5.6 billion on loan to domestic petroleum refiners. **********These figures, however, do not include American bank loans to foreign energy producers, or loans by foreign branches of American banks to domestic and foreign energy producers. They also exclude many loans made to companies that provide goods and services to the energy industry. **********More reliable figures are available for bank loans to developing countries that are dependent on oil and gas exports.  The Morgan Guaranty Trust Company estimates that banks worldwide have $64.4 billion on loan to Mexico (with American banks accounting for $25.2 billion); $27.2 billion to Venezuela ($10.7 billion); $8.2 billion to Indonesia ($2.4 billion); $7.7 billion to Algeria ($1.2 billion); $6.7 billion to Nigeria ($1.2 billion), and $4.7 billion ($2.2 billion) to Ecuador. Loans Put at $70 Billion **********Bank economists concede they have less reliable figures about loans to energy companies. Abraham Gulkowitz, a vice president and economist of the Bankers Trust Company, estimates that total bank lending to the energy industry worldwide might be about $70 billion, unchanged from the level a year earlier. But some of this total is overlap, or loans already included in the borrowing figures for countries. **********The Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, the nation's fourthlargest bank, had almost $5 billion on loan to the energy industry at the end of 1982, up 20 percent from the previous year.  Few other major banks disclose their loans to the oil industry, but each is believed to have several billion dollars in energy loans outstanding. **********In oil-producing areas such as Texas and Oklahoma, banks are particularly vulnerable to declines in the price of oil because a disproportionately large part of their portfolios are accounted for by energy loans. According to data compiled last year by Mr.  McDermott, energy loans accounted for at least 30 percent of total loans at many bank holding companies in Texas. Service Loans Vulnerable **********In many cases, bankers observe, it is harder to collect debts from companies that service the oil companies than from the producing companies. ''We can stand some price drop on the exploration and production side,'' said Michael Hegarty, senior vice president of the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, ''but what gets hurt is the service sector.'' **********But oil- and gas-producing companies can also be highly vulnerable, especially if they are operating in high-cost areas. Last year's big energy-related losses came from production and service companies that operated in highly speculative regions. **********Perhaps as much from wishful thinking as from scientific analysis, bankers contend that the price of oil will not plummet, that the OPEC countries will reach agreement on pricing and that even if they do not, market forces will keep the price of oil from falling too low. **********Bankers emphasize, however, that even if the price of oil were to stay above $25, no one knows for sure what the effects would be on the banks. **********''Every bank presumably is running its own numbers and sorting out its own position, and no bank is going to tell any other bank where it stands,'' said Edward L. Hoyt, vice president of Morgan Guaranty.  ''Therefore, it is almost impossible to make generalizations.'' Banks Hazy on Own Portfolios **********Further clouding any attempt to draw conclusions from the numbers is the fact that many banks have problems analyzing their own portfolios. One banker, who asked not to be identified, explained that a single loan can sometimes involve thousands of properties and as many as 50 different oil prices. ''Who's got time to analyze it?'' he asked. **********Indeed, much depends on how a bank's energy loans are structured and to whom they are made. Understandably, bankers are most confident about loans to major multinational oil companies, with their vast and diversified resources. The outlook becomes far more complicated when loans to medium-sized and small companies are considered. **********Critical elements that come into play are the amount of taxes that must be paid and other overhead costs. These vary widely from project to project. **********A rule of thumb is that the more a company pays in taxes, the less it would be hurt by a drop in the oil price. The after-tax cost of an $8 decline in the price of a barrel of oil for an American company paying a ''windfall-profit'' tax of 70 percent and income taxes of 50 percent would be only $1.20, bankers say. Role of Tax Exposure **********The other $6.80 would be absorbed by Federal, state and local governments. A company with lower taxes, but higher overhead costs, would be much more vulnerable. **********Thus, the inability to generalize about the cost of producing a barrel of oil compounds the problem of determining the impact of a lower oil price. But the main problem today is that, until last year, most oil and gas loans were made on the premise that energy prices would continue to rise sharply. **********According to William E. Pelley, senior vice president of Bankers Trust's energy group, and Herbert W. Krupp, vice president, banks usually provide loans to finance new drilling and exploration projects only when they are secured by existing producing properties. **********Before a loan is made, engineering studies determine the size of the oil or gas reserves and the rate at which these reserves could be retrieved. Mr. Krupp says the margin of error seldom exceeds 10 percent or 15 percent, but some mistakes are made. Estimating Reserves **********Using such reports, a bank determines how much oil will be produced, usually over 15 years. The bank then estimates the perbarrel price for that entire period. Until last year, the estimates had been for dramatic increases. In 1980, for example, Bankers Trust estimated that the price of oil would rise at a rate of almost 10 percent a year, to $90 a barrel by 1990. **********Based on these estimates, and after subtracting overhead costs, the bank would determine how much money the property would clear over the life of the well. The ''conservative'' banks usually were willing to lend half this amount. Thus, if the estimates were correct, the property would generate double the income needed to pay the loan. As the borrower made principal payments, however, the coverage increased. **********But with the possibility of a sharp decline in the price of oil and in other energy prices, the estimates on which the loans were based could be far from the mark. In the worst cases, even excluding the expense of debt repayments, the costs of running a well would be so much higher than the current price of oil that it would have to be closed and the loan written off."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/25/business/finance-new-issues-a-pennsylvania-issue-is-priced.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-05-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 117, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Pennsylvania Issue Is Priced", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; A Pennsylvania Issue Is Priced", "body_text": " **********An $85 million Commonwealth of Pennsylvania capital improvement general obligation issue was won in competitive bidding by the First Boston Corporation. **********The bonds were priced to yield 5 percent in 1983 and 9.35 percent in 2002. **********Moody's rated the bonds A and Standard & Poors rated them A+.

But testing showed it to be a dangerous fake, incapable of doing what a genuine Westinghouse circuit breaker should do. **********That is just one example of large- scale industrial counterfeiting that was presented at a meeting here last month of American and European manufacturers intent on bringing the phenomenon under control. **********Government Action Sought **********In a communique after the meeting, they called on their governments to take stronger action against the pirating of patented, trademarked products. **********''What is frightening is the extent to which counterfeiting is jeopardizing the health and safety of consumers, not just their pocketbooks,'' said James L. Bikoff, president of the International Anticounterfeiting Coalition, which represents 135 major American corporations and trade associations. **********As every summer visitor to Italy knows, the counterfeiting of expensive brand-name goods like handbags, clothes and cosmetics has been going on for a long time.

Testing showed they were fakes, made of weak steel and constituting, in the words of a British court, ''a serious danger to the public.'' **********Spare parts, industrial components, processed foods and patented drugs are now all being counterfeited on an increasing scale. According to a study prepared by the Commission of the European Community, trade in pirated goods now accounts for about 2 percent of total world trade and is starting to make a serious dent in the sales of established companies, adversely affecting their employment and exports. **********Estimates of Losses **********Mr. Bikoff puts the value of worldwide trade in forged automobile parts alone at $12 billion a year. The American motor parts industry reckons that counterfeiting has cost it 14,000 jobs, while the European industry says it has lost 6,000 jobs. **********Swiss watch makers estimate that 100 million fake Swiss watches are sold annually for about $500 million.

The development came as Mr. Mitterrand and top Government officials held a hectic round of meetings on economic policy and the flagging negotiations in Brussels on the Common Market's monetary system. **********On Monday, European heads of government are to gather in Brussels for a regular two-day summit meeting that is expected to be dominated by discussions of the currency crisis. **********Premier Could Be Affected **********The high-level meetings in Paris were seen as a prelude to France's first Cabinet shake-up since the Socialists assumed power 22 months ago, a shuffle that officials said could involve the appointment of a new Prime Minister to replace Pierre Mauroy. **********Mr. Mitterrand will address the nation on Wednesday, and his spokesman said this evening that the President might announce Cabinet changes then. Discussion of an impending Cabinet shake-up has dominated the news here since the Socialists suffered substantial, but not overwhelming, losses in municipal elections that ended last Sunday. **********After Mr. Jobert's announcement of his resignation, the Finance Minister, Jacques Delors, flew back to Paris from Brussels, where talks on the revaluation of European currencies remained deadlocked. **********Prime Minister Mauroy returned to Paris from his political stronghold, Lille, soon after being installed for a new term as Mayor there. Mr. Mauroy's arrival was 24 hours ahead of schedule. **********Mr. Jobert's resignation removes from the Government the only minister who was not a member of one of the three parties of the left - the Socialists, the Communists and the Movement of Left Radicals. He is the leader of a small party of his own, the Movement of Democrats. Had Role in Key Decisions **********Mr. Jobert was involved in some of the Mitterrand Government's most disputed decisions, including the contract signed with the Soviet Union to bring gas to Europe through a pipeline from Siberia built with European credit and using European technology. It was also Mr.  Jobert who decided to subject imported Japanese videorecorders to intense inspections at an understaffed customs house in Poitiers.  This protectionist move choked off the flow of the foreign-made videorecorders to France for some time. **********But over all, France's foreign trade deficit has gone up dramatically, amounting in January alone to about $1.4 billion. In his statement explaining his resignation, Mr. Jobert said he had taken ''a rather poorly delineated post'' and lacked the means to undertake ''a coherent and effective policy.'' **********Today's discussions among Government leaders focused heavily on the talks in Brussels, whose outcome will strongly influence both the course of the next phase of Mr. Mitterrand's presidency and the makeup of any new Cabinet. **********An agreement to devalue the franc - it would be the third devaluation since Mr. Mitterrand took office -would probably be part of an overall austerity program aimed at curbing inflation and reducing the foreign trade deficit. Devaluation Opposed **********In the Brussels discussions, Mr. Delors is defending the French position opposing devaluation. But the Finance Minister, an ideological centrist who is regarded in political circles as the favorite to succeed Mr. Mauroy, hinted at a new round of austerity today after the second of two meetings he held with Mr. Mitterrand. **********Mr. Delors said he was preparing ''economic and social measures which should permit us to improve our performance and significantly reduce our external trade deficit.'' **********Mr. Mauroy, who has been reported by associates to be less sympathetic than Mr. Delors to a new austerity program, nonetheless underlined the importance of continuing ''an implacable struggle against inflation'' in an address at Lille this morning. **********''We should all be conscious,'' he said, ''that as long as the rate of inflation in France is higher than that of our principal partners - above all the Federal Republic of Germany - our money will be menaced.'' **********But there are members of Mr. Mitterrand's Socialist Government, particularly on the left, who favor leaving the European monetary system and pursuing a ''go it alone'' strategy that could involve protectionism. Delors Popular With Bankers **********These opponents of devaluation and further austerity measures also point to the possibility that an American economic recovery, combined with lower oil prices, could pull France out of its economic doldrums. **********Should the Government pursue such a strategy, Mr. Mauroy might stay on, or would probably be replaced by someone other than Mr. Delors, whose centrism has made him popular among bankers and other businessmen and unpopular with left-wing Socialists and with the Communist Party, which holds four ministries in the current Cabinet. **********Mr. Mitterrand has been described by aides as favoring a more austere policy to curb imports and inflation, and today's statements by Mr. Mauroy and Mr. Delors were seen here tonight as further indications that such a policy was in the offing. **********However, the Communist Party, which suffered substantial losses in the municipal elections, has issued a steady stream of statements supporting the Government's original, more left-wing agenda, statements seen as pressure against further austerity measures. Communists' Position Weak **********Many politicians here believe the Communists are in too weak a position to leave the Government now. If they should withdraw, Mr.  Mitterrand's administration would still have a working majority in Parliament majority but might face difficulties from the labor union movement, where the Communists are strong. **********Devaluation of the franc is also a special source of fear here for the political left, which has historically seen devaluations used by political conservatives as a symbol of an inability of the left to run the economy. **********As if to underline this fear, Francois Leotard, secretary general of the center-right Parti Republicain, said today that he feared ''that we will have tommorow a lessened and diminished franc, and thus a lessened and diminished Government.'' 'Important Things' Foreseen **********Speculation that a ministerial shake-up would be announced today was fueled by Mr. Jobert's resignation and Mr. Delors' announcement this morning that he had to leave the Brussels talks because ''important things will happen today in Paris and one must be there.'' The Government's official journal was also warned to be ''on alert'' for publication of a special issue on Monday. **********But early this evening, Michel Vauzelle, Mr. Mitterrand's spokesman, said that no announcement of Cabinet changes was forthcoming.

Instead, it is flat broke, with a broken spirit and an empty treasury. **********The Brazilian ''miracle'' - the spurt of growth from the late 1960's to the late 1970's - became the economist's model of the way to manage expansion from agrarian stagnation to the newly industrialized stage. **********Now, however, Brazil is in its third year of recession, and the country that once was the world banking system's ideal borrower pleads for loans just to pay the interest on its debts. **********How Brazil fell to a position where it is known best today for the weight of its $92 billion foreign debt, larger than that of any other country, is a matter that absorbs all those who have a stake in the country - Brazilians themselves and the industrial world, which relies for much of its own prosperity on the health of developing countries such as Brazil. **********Leading Brazilians both inside and outside the Government cite the effects of the sharp rise in oil prices during the 1970's on an economy that had been building its future on imported oil. They blame Western banks for heaping an insupportable burden of loans on the country. And they blame the United States for incurring budget deficits of $200 billion a year that have forced up world interest rates and hence affected the ability of Brazil to make interest payments. **********Ultimately, however, they blame Brazil's technocrats, the people who took the bankers' money. **********The technocrats were the planners, economists, engineers and technicians whom the military dictatorship, itself reluctant to govern, appointed to run the economy after the generals seized power in 1964. The technocrats are elected by no one, and in time they became accountable to no one, their critics say. **********''They became the owners of the truth,'' said the head of one of Brazil's biggest industrial companies, a man who depends on Government contracts for much of his business and therefore asked not to be named. ''They believed too much in themselves.'' **********Target of Cartoons **********The technocrats get little praise now for their part in the Brazilian ''miracle.'' Ant^onio Delfim Netto, the planning minister and No. 1 technocrat, is an almost daily target of newspaper cartoons. **********''There's a drought in the northeast, and there's flooding in the south,'' one current joke goes, ''so the technocrats decided that, on average, everything is fine.'' **********The technocrats are largely faceless to most Brazilians. They number in the thousands and proliferate in the second and third levels of government, especially in such ministries as finance, agriculture, mining and industry. Many come from the universities. **********Some Leading Technocrats **********They include Finance Minister Ernane Galveas; Celso Affonso Pastore, who is president of the central bank; the heads of some of the country's biggest state-owned companies, and a few retired generals, such as Jose Costa Cavalcanti, president of the second-biggest Government company, the Electrobras utility. **********Some Brazilians say that others share responsibility for the economic reversals. **********''It was the whole regime - the military, the technocrats and the industrialists,'' said Edmar Bacha, an economist at Catholic University in Rio de Janeiro who is now a visiting professor at Columbia University. ''All of them chose not to go for prudent management and opted instead for the crazy policies of Delfim Netto.'' **********'Pharaonic Projects' Cited **********The technocrats' errors, in the view of many Brazilians, involved Pharaonic projects, many of which were conceived to protect Brazil from future oil-price shocks. **********For example, until the current economy forced them to postpone some, the Government-owned power utilities were building enough plants - hydroelectric, nuclear and coal - to produce more power than Brazil is expected to need well beyond the year 2000. **********In addition, a multibillion-dollar railroad, with many costly bridges and tunnels, is being built alongside a railroad that, critics contend, might have been rehabilitated at much lower cost. **********And a huge mineral development project called Carajas, which could make Brazil the world's leading producer of bauxite and aluminum, is under construction. Some businessmen praise Carajas, but others contend it should have waited until some of the other projects had started repaying loans. **********The technocrats are also blamed for Brazil's system of indexation. This program attempts to synchronize the entire economy - wages, prices, interest rates, rents - with inflation. **********Indexation was conceived partly to curb inflation. But as Brazil's foreign trade accounts turned negative, the Government resorted to repeated devaluations of the cruzeiro. **********With the devaluations, the cost of imports rose correspondingly. This raised the cost of living, helping to create more inflation that was fed back into the system of indexation. **********Many in Brazil also accuse the technocrats of creating an industrial dise quilibrium that has made Brazil excessively dependent on imports. **********To reduce the impact of imports, the technocrats sought to build an industry diversified enough to produce all the country's consumer goods. However, their critics charge, imports kept rising because the industries still had to import machinery, components and raw materials. **********Critics also charge the technocrats with creating state-owned companies that became overstaffed and less efficient than privately owned companies. **********The technocrats guided Brazil into important industries - steel, oil, banking, heavy construction, mining and transportation - and then established state-owned companies in those industries. **********State-owned banks now handle half the banking in Brazil. State-owned manufacturing companies account for a third of the revenues of the country's 500 biggest companies, up from 15 percent at the end of the 1960's. **********When the world recession forced layoffs, losses and many bankruptcies on much of the private sector, the protected state companies were largely untouched. **********The technocrats are also accused of favoring middle-income Brazilians. Many in this class, employees of the state or state-owned companies, received special benefits, notably year-end bonuses of one, two or three months' pay. **********The wages of the middle class and the rich rose faster than those of the lowest paid, widening an already broad gap in income distribution. **********Outside Factors Are Blamed **********The technocrats publicly acknowledge few missteps. ''We are a victim of factors in the outside world,'' Mr. Galveas said. The main one at the moment, he said, is the American budget deficit and high interest rates. **********Indeed, few Brazilians would undo much of the work of the technocrats. They have constructed one of the developing world's most sophisticated networks of roads, banking, telecommunications and electric power to service a widely diversified industrial base that could enable Brazil to outperform most other countries in a world upturn. **********And with the power plants, the now widespread use of domestically produced alcohol for automobile fuel and the redoubled development of domestic sources of oil, the technocrats have cut in half the country's dependence on imported oil. **********''You don't want to be too harsh,'' said a senior Western diplomat here of the technocrats. ''They were doing things that had never been done before. But they took some gambles, in energy, mining and internal development, that required great sums of money and long payback periods. A lot of those projects are still soaking up money.'' **********Response to 1979 Oil Shock **********Some prominent Brazilians who see far more gains than losses in the technocrats' programs nevertheless cite one important error - the technocrats' response to the second oil shock of 1979 - for the severity of the country's current economic plight. **********''There were three options then,'' said Roberto Campos, former Ambassador to the United States and Britain and a member of the Government's Social Democratic Party in the Brazilian Senate. **********Brazil might have merely accepted a recession, as the industrial countries did, he said. It might have accepted a reduction of growth, as did developing Asian countries, among them Taiwan and South Korea. ''This was the prudent option,'' Mr. Campos commented. Instead, he said, Brazil, like Mexico and Venezuela, sought to suppress imports and attempted, less aggressively, to promote exports. **********'Should Have Reversed Gears' **********''Brazil,'' he added, ''financed its adjustment rather than adjusted. This was not irrational at the time. You could still get good interest rates. Our mistake was in adhering to that option when it became apparent that it was incorrect. We should have reversed gears.'' **********Even within the Government the technocrats are now under fire. One of the few popular ministers, Helio Beltrao, resigned in November. The Minister for Social Welfare and the man in charge of ''debureaucratization,'' a successful program to reduce paperwork required of the nation's citizens, Mr. Beltrao cited cuts in his welfare budget for his resignation. **********In public comments a few weeks earlier, Mr. Beltrao described the technocrats as men with a ''vision of an imaginary country not at all our own.'' He said they had been ''dominated by the fascinating exercise of abstract planning, by the optical illusion of centralized decisions and macroeconomic theories, by the rapture of important and sophisticated decisions, incompatible with our reality and the reality of our modest standards and the incomes of our people.'' **********Dispute on People's Needs **********The technocrats are also charged with ignoring the needs of the population in the drive to industrialize Brazil. **********''They were trying to imitate the development of the advanced world and failed at improving the life of the people, said Celso Pe,canha, the leader of the small Labor Party in the House of Deputies and former governor of the state of Rio de Janeiro. **********''The straight road to development is the education of the people,'' Mr. Pe,canha said. ''Today we have 7.5 million children, 7 to 14, who don't go to school because they have to work so they can have enough to eat. Eighteen million Brazilians are illiterate - 25.5 percent of the population. This is the central problem of Brazil.'' **********Moving Toward Democracy **********Brazilians now believe they can see the demise of the all-powerful technocrat in President Joao Baptista Figueiredo's commitment to ''abertura,'' the process of restoring democratic government. **********The economic crisis has accelerated the process. To placate the International Monetary Fund and Western commercial banks, the technocrats imposed three anti-inflation plans to restrict the rate of wage increases. The Government had to withdraw them, however, in the face of widespread opposition from a newly vocal Congress that was popularly elected last year in one of the important steps along the route toward abertura. **********Finally, in October, the Government, the technocrats and the leaders of Congress negotiated a plan that the legislators would accept. **********And with the recent acceptance by the I.M.F. of Brazil's new austerity program, the country can expect to get more than $11 billion in fresh loans. That aid, plus signs that the incipient recovery of the world economy is spreading, would seem to assure some relief for Brazil. **********But businessmen and economists here question whether the economy built by the technocrats has the strength to deal with the fundamental imbalances. **********''Brazil accepts adversity as long as it sees a solution,'' said Peter Landsberg, former chairman of the country's biggest private company, Shell Brazil, the Shell oil subsidiary in Brazil. ''But we see no solution.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/17/business/american-software-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-jan-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-03-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 57, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AMERICAN SOFTWARE INC reports earnings for Qtr to Jan 31", "print_headline": "AMERICAN SOFTWARE INC reports earnings for Qtr to Jan 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/26/world/central-american-nations-refuse-to-join-us-boycott-of-nicaragua.html": {"writer_name": "Marlise Simons", "pub_date": "1983-09-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 677, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CENTRAL AMERICAN NATIONS REFUSE TO JOIN U.S. BOYCOTT OF NICARAGUA", "print_headline": "CENTRAL AMERICAN NATIONS REFUSE TO JOIN U.S. BOYCOTT OF NICARAGUA", "body_text": " **********Four Central American nations, despite their hostility toward Nicaragua, have refused to join the Reagan Administration's informal economic boycott of the Sandinista Government, officials in the region say. **********Central America, including Nicaragua, is facing its most serious economic crisis in years and must improve its economic cooperation, the officials said in interviews last week. **********The Reagan Administration, in what it says is part of an effort to keep Managua from supplying arms to rebels in El Salvador, has cut off United States aid and much of United States trade with Nicaragua and blocked Managua's requests for several crucial international loans. **********Washington has also asked the West European donors to Nicaragua to stop their aid to the Sandinistas, diplomats from West Germany and the Netherlands have said in recent interviews.

Baxter, the Justice Department's antitrust chief, offered business executives specific benchmarks today that should make it easier for them to judge when companies can do joint research without violating the law. **********Mr. Baxter's statement, probably the most explicit ever made on the subject by any Administration, could be another incentive to increased joint research and development efforts by American companies. Many business executives have complained that American antitrust laws have helped undermine the nation's ability to compete successfully against Japan and other foreign countries. **********Leaving Room for Competitors **********Mr. Baxter, while inclined to belittle this contention, nonetheless described in detail the circumstances under which it would be unlikely that joint ventures would be challenged. **********In general, he declared, such collaborations are likely to be permissible when the participants account for no more than half of an industry and when their joint efforts would still leave room for four to six competing ventures in the field. **********''That should be regarded as per se O.K.,'' Mr. Baxter, Assistant Attorney General for the antitrust division, told a meeting sponsored by the National Association of Manufacturers. **********It is often argued, Mr. Baxter observed, that joint ventures pose a danger of exclusivity because some company that would like to participate is left out. But the real problem - if there is one - is not whether such ventures are too exclusive but whether they are too inclusive, he said. If an entire industry were to combine to do research and development, he said, this would amount to repealing the patent system that has been devised to foster competitive innovation. **********Mr. Baxter warned that collaborative research should be done by groups no bigger than is necessary to take maximum advantage of the economies of scale. In doing so he made it clear that measurements of industry participation should not necessarily be confined to American companies but should take into account other producers throughout the world. **********James P. Carty, an antitrust specialist for the manufacturers group, praised Mr. Baxter's formulation as likely to provide some additional ''comfort'' for corporate officials contemplating joint ventures. **********He and other participants in the conference, however, took issue with Mr. Baxter's broader contention that United States antitrust law is a negligible factor in the nation's trade deficit - $19 billion last year - with Japan. **********''A lot of people feel it has a chilling effect,'' Mr. Carty said.  The Administration's legislative proposals on antitrust matters include a provision that makes joint research efforts subject to a so-called rule of reason. This, in effect, means that each case can be examined and argued individually in contrast to per se cases in which certain behavior, such as price-fixing, is illegal on its face. **********Mr. Baxter's package calls on Congress also to abolish treble damages for private antitrust suits in per se cases, limiting recovery to actual damages suffered. **********Products are protected much better than processes, he noted, prompting another element of the Administration bill to extend the patent on a process to the product that results from it. Under present law, foreign companies are able to obtain a patented process, develop a product from it and then sell the product in this country with impunity."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/05/world/white-senator-is-slain-by-attackers-in-zimbabwe.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-04-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 397, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WHITE SENATOR IS SLAIN BY ATTACKERS IN ZIMBABWE", "print_headline": "WHITE SENATOR IS SLAIN BY ATTACKERS IN ZIMBABWE", "body_text": " **********A white Zimbabwean senator, his daughter and a British citizen who was visiting them were slain by 20 to 30 assailants who attacked their farm in Matabeland Province Sunday night, a Government spokesman said today.

''You never had a recession ending with those rates.'' **********Investment Growth in '84 **********A study prepared by Mietfinanz, one of Germany's largest capital goods leasing concerns, released in January, said capital goods investment in the 13 major industrial sectors would likely shrink 6.7 percent this year. A major reason for the shrinkage, the study said, was political uncertainty. Because of the long lead time for capital goods investments, it said, investment growth could not be expected before 1984. **********The March 6 election pits the present coalition Government of conservative Christian Democrats and Free Democrats against the Social Democrats, traditional proponents of deficit spending to finance generous welfare programs. Also opposing the conservative Government are the Greens, a coalition of environmentalists, pacifists and opponents of nuclear power, whose platform contains a no-growth economic plank that unsettles German businessmen. **********The flagging investment rate led to a recent bitter exchange of charges by the Christian Democrats, who attributed it to fear of electoral gains by the Social Democrats and Greens, and denials by their opponents. **********The investment lag remains a disturbing trend on an otherwise brighter economic horizon. For 1982, the current account surplus was equivalent to $578.5 million, ending a string of deficits beginning in 1979, when exports failed to offset a skyrocketing oil bill.  Consumer prices rose only 3.9 percent, after 5.9 percent in 1981, enabling bank interest rates to decline dramatically.

''They need clear directions.'' **********Bankers note, however, a growing hesitancy among businessmen toward both major parties, because of overriding policy similarities and because of recent Christian Democratic policy shifts that seem to reflect uncertainty on economic policy. **********The coalition Government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, which took office last October, embarked on a policy of budget austerity, coupled with efforts to shift Government budgeting from consumptive spending, like welfare, to ''investive spending'' aimed at rebuilding the nation's industrial base. **********Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg, chief architect of Government policy, has listed as its major elements a $1.04 billion, two-year housing program; public works projects, including construction of power plants and a nationwide cable communications network; and corporate tax relief, to favor business investment, to be paid for by a repayable loan, or tax, to the Government by high-income groups. **********''We have waited a long time for this kind of fundamental reorientation,'' Otto Wolff von Amerongen, head of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce, exulted as he commented on Government policy at the group's annual meeting recently. **********Nevertheless, the business community was unsettled in January by the announcement that the Christian Democrats, if re-elected, planned to convert the repayable loan to a direct tax. Some bankers also questioned the Government's economic priorities. **********Economists at Frankfurt's Dresdner Bank said the decision to emphasize housing starts was wise from a political standpoint, because of the immediate multiplier effect in creation of jobs and purchases of construction equipment and building materials. **********But they said housing was essentially a consumer product, so the program failed to carry out the Government's promised shift from consumptive to capital goods investment. Moreover, they said, doubts remain among experts whether Germany has a real housing need. Optimistic Note **********There were also doubts about the extent that fiscal policy alone could alleviate the investment slump. ''Because of public sector deficits, fiscal policy is dead,'' said Mr. Wermuth of Citibank.  ''When tax receipts were ample, we didn't get rid of deficits, especially by cutting claims on gross national product.'' **********One spark of optimism among bankers was the prospect of declining oil prices, which they said would bolster the payments situation of countries that are traditional purchasers of Germany's export goods. **********Flagging export orders, crucial to Germany's economy, which depends on exports for nearly one-third of the gross national product, have deepened the current recession. **********But the bankers cautioned that export growth as a result of lower oil bills in nonoil exporting countries would not come immediately, meaning there would be little real effect before 1984."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/03/business/homestead-financial-corp-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 49, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HOMESTEAD FINANCIAL CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "HOMESTEAD FINANCIAL CORP reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/08/business/off-price-retailers-go-public.html": {"writer_name": "Pamela Hollie", "pub_date": "1983-11-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1301, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "OFF-PRICE RETAILERS GO PUBLIC", "print_headline": "OFF-PRICE RETAILERS GO PUBLIC", "body_text": " **********For at least three well-known off- price clothing merchandisers, the time was right for taking their family-owned businesses public over the last six months.

In June, the 31-unit Burlington Coat Factory Warehouse Corporation went public, rising $66 million for the Milstein family.

But some of it is the same merchandise that found in department stores, only cheaper. **********Price brings in the customers.

With stores from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to Peabody, Mass., Syms plans to open three more by the end of 1984. **********Volume Is Essence of Business **********The essence of the off-price business is volume, but its health depends on supply. Some manufacturers still call ''off-price'' retailers undertakers, because of their relationship with manufacturers. When the economy slips into a recession, manufacturers look to off-price retailers to keep their factories running. **********Manufacturers routinely work ahead by 18 months. If such a manufacturer has over-ordered fabric and then the orders do not come in, he may be faced with the problem of too much fabric. He can sell it to a jobber for 20 percent of its cost. Or, he can sell it to an off-price discounter for the full price. **********The condition of such a sale usually involves the manufacturer making goods at cost for the off-price retailer. This keeps the factory open and the employees working. The off-price merchandiser, as a consequence, gets his goods at a much lower price than if he had made an order in advance. **********Move Toward Diversification **********Sy Syms, who has worked with manufacturers for 20 years, is counting on their loyality during the current retailing upturn. But the 57-year- old executive is also hedging his bets, should the popularity of off-price merchandising fade. **********In 1980, Mr. Syms bought A. Sulka & Company, a 90-year-old London haberdashery, which sells $2,500 silk- lined cashmere dressing gowns and other luxury clothing. This high-margin, high-overhead business contrasts sharply to the Syms image, but provides the company an escape route. These are not businesses that will merge, the company said. **********For the owners of Dress Barn, Burling Coat Factory and Syms, the overriding advantage of taking their companies public was that it meant no change in company control. Company president, Elliott S. Jaffe, and his family retained 47.5 percent of the Dress Barn. Monroe G. Milstein and his family still own 65.22 percent of the Burlington Coat Factory. And, Mr. Syms kept 82.3 percent of his company and most of the money from the public sale of stock. **********Stock Prices Are Flat **********In each case, movements in the prices of the stock have been relatively flat. The Dress Barn opened at $23 a share on the over-the-counter market in May, and its bid price yesterday was the same. Burlington Coat opened in June at $28 a share, went as high as $41, and reached its low of $26 yesterday on the over-the-counter market. And in Syms' short trading history, its stock has fluctuated between a high of 17 7/8 and a low of 15 1/4, closing yesterday at 15 3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Such stock offerings are common among entrepreneural companies in which the founders or their families want to raise money without losing corporate control. The owners sell only a portion of the stock they own to the public. Sometimes the money goes toward expansion; in other cases, when the founder sells his own holdings, the proceeds go to him. **********In the Syms Corporation offering, the $44 million in proceeds went to Mr. Syms, who still owns 56.9 percent of the shares outright and controls another 25.1 percent as the sole voting trustee of a trust established for his branch of the Merns family.  Mr. Syms runs his operation almost single-handedly. Last year he paid himself $575,000 as chairman and chief executive officer, $226,619 as head of the Syms Advertising Agency and the corporate Mr. Syms paid the private Mr. Syms $645,259 for a store lease. **********Total Control of Board **********Even though the company is public, Mr. Syms is able to personally elect all of the directors of the company and to approve all corporate transactions without minority shareholder approval. **********The Syms Corporation, which was incorporated in New Jersey on July 11, 1983, has three subsidiaries: the off-price chains called Syms Inc., five high-priced A. Sulka & Company stores and Syms Advertising. The advertising company, which produces ads written by Mr. Syms featuring the executive, his daughter Marcy and his son Robert. The Syms slogan is: ''An educated consumer is our best customer.'' **********Four of Mr. Syms' six children work for the company. Three of his sons are vice presidents and his 32- year-old daughter, Marcy Syms Merns, is the $45,000-a-year president. **********Mr. Syms has an older brother named George Merns, who has a chain of conventional discount clothing stores under the Merns name. Mr. Syms joined his brother in the 1950's, but broke away in 1959 to start his own stores under the Syms name. George Merns has no corporate involvement in Syms. **********Because the company is required by the Securities and Exchange Commission to refrain from public comment for 90-days following the offering, none of the Merns family could grant interviews."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/24/business/venezuela-seeks-imf-help.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-05-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 208, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "VENEZUELA SEEKS I.M.F.

If, as seems likely, a renewal agreement is not ready then, an extension of one year can take effect. **********With a caretaker Government in charge, negotiations for mainland installations are more problematic. According to official Portuguese sources, Washington has asked permission to build a satellitetracking station and to use several bases on the mainland in exchange for more military aid. **********Under the current agreement the United States gave Portugal $60 million in military aid. In a related agreement it has also given $80 million in economic aid in the last four years to the Azores, a mid-Atlantic archipelago first used for bases by the British in World War II. President Reagan is seeking to increase military aid to Portugal to $90 million this fiscal year, a 50 percent increase. Crisis Has Wide Effects **********Prime Minister Francisco Pinto Balsemao's resignation in December, because of fighting in his rightist parliamentary coalition, plunged the country into political uncertainty. President Antonio Ramalho Eanes has called an early general election and has asked the caretaker Government to remain long enough to pass urgently needed legislation. Mr. Balsemao agreed to remain in office temporarily but has questioned whether a caretaker administration can pass major bills, including an austerity budget. **********In addition to leaving ministries without operating money, the crisis has stopped progress on several important issues, including talks on Portugal's entry into the European Common Market and on a loan from the International Monetary Fund. **********The military agreement with the United States, which started in 1951 and was renewed four times, is a major source of military and economic aid. Formal negotiations for renewal began in Lisbon on Dec. 6, but a subsequent session set for Jan. 10 did not take place because of the political situation. **********Complicating the negotiations, from the American standpoint, is the Portuguese insistence on reaching agreement first on the Azores base and then dealing with the other requests. **********''The items are separable,'' Mr. Balsemao said in an interview.  ''We have an agreement concerning the Azores. We are ready to negotiate a new agreement. That's one item. Another is eventual requests by the U.S. for facilities outside the Azores. Our position is they have to be considered separately.'' What Portugal Wants **********In return for granting the other requests, he said, his Government wants help re-equipping the armed forces and a comprehensive labor agreement for people working in the bases. The American negotiators are expected to argue that the Administration has a better chance of persuading Congress to go along with a package agreement covering both the Azores and the mainland installations. **********The situation with regard to United States access to bases in Spain appears to be a major factor in the Portuguese negotiations, with Washington searching for possible alternatives now that a Socialist Government has taken over in Madrid. **********A new five-year agreement that gives the United States the right to station 12,000 military personnel at four bases in Spain was signed in July 1982 by the previous Government but has not been ratified by the Spanish Parliament.

Volcker that might shed light on the direction of interest rates. **********In advance of Mr. Volcker's testimony this week before the Senate Banking Committee, which will hold hearings on his reappointment as the Federal Reserve Board's chairman, interest rates barely moved in light trading of government securities. **********Traders and investors also said they were awaiting indications later this week of any decisions on monetary policy taken at today's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, a Federal Reserve panel that sets monetary policy. 8 1/2 Percent Since December **********Although much of the discussion in the financial markets has focused on the likelihood of an increase in the discount rate that the Fed charges on loans to banks, many Fed watchers warned that it could decide to raise short-term rates without increasing the discount rate from the 8 1/2 percent level at which it has remained since last December. **********''The public is afflicted with discount rate phobia,'' said George Hester, a vice president in the government securities division at Paine Webber Inc. Even if rates for overnight bank loans continue to fluctuate around 9 1/4 percent, Mr. Hester added, ''that does not mean that the Fed has to raise the discount rate'' to that level. **********Concern over the discount rate was underscored last Thursday when Larry Speakes, the deputy White House press secretary, publicly urged that the Fed not change the rate. Changes in the discount rate are often considered a signal of Fed policy. Unsure on Credit and Rate **********By using moral suasion to prevent commercial banks from borrowing at the Fed's discount window, many analysts said the central bank could raise short-term interest rates, but leave the discount rate unchanged. Currently, analysts are uncertain if the Fed will make credit scarce enough to cause short-term rates to rise further, and are even more unsure about the future of the discount rate. **********In yesterday's trading, overnight bank loans in the Federal funds market were at 9 1/8 percent most of the day, down slightly from the 9.39 percent average for the week ended July 6, but well above the level of 8 1/2 percent to 8 3/4 percent that prevailed for most of the first half of the year. **********Among short-term securities, the average rates for Treasury bills at yesterday's auction were little changed from last week's sales.  The three-month issue averaged 9.07 percent, down from 9.10 percent last week, while the six-month issue averaged 9.26 percent, up from 9.2 percent. The six-month rate was the highest since Sept. 20. **********Based on the auction results, the maximum rate for six-month savings certificates offered by banks and thrift institutions rises to 9.51 percent from 9.45 percent. The maximum rate for three-month certificates is the same as the average of the three-month bill issue. Doubt on Announcement **********In advance of Mr. Volcker's upcoming appearances, many analysts doubted that the Fed would announce an increase in the discount rate. ''When rates are going up, you expect the Fed to be more reluctant to take prominent actions such as raising the discount rate,'' one trader said. ''It's just the opposite of last year, when the Fed was cutting the discount rate and wanted to call attention to the fact that rates were coming down.'' **********If the highly visible discount rate is to be increased soon, analysts estimated it would likely happen after Mr. Volcker's Congressional appearances, but before the Treasury announces on July 27 a huge $15.75 billion financing that may include a record $4 billion of 30-year bonds. **********Many economists said that low inflation might still point to lower bond yields later this year or next. However, Edward J. Sawicz, an economist at the Discount Corporation of New York, commented that, in the immediate future, the prospects for increased short-term rates are hurting the bond market. ''Even if the Fed raises short-term rates, some investors will wonder if the increases are enough'' to slow money supply growth and prevent inflation from rising in future months, he said. Near Year's Lowest Levels **********Among Treasury note and bond issues outstanding, prices declined by an eighth of a point or less, and remained close to their lowest levels of the year. The 10 1/2 percent notes due in 1987 were offered at 98 18/32, to yield 10.96, compared with the average price of about 99 5/8, to yield 10.62 percent, at an auction in late June. In the long-term bond market, the 10 3/8 percent issue due in 2012 was offered at 92 1/8, to yield 11.3 percent. The high price for the 10 3/8 percent bond was in early May when it was at 101, to yield 10.26 percent. **********In the tax-exempt market, dealers said that prices were firm in light trading yesterday. Among this week's major financings, a $89 million issue of Aa-rated Minnesota general obligation bonds was postponed to Wednesday from today. Investment bankers estimated that Minnesota bonds due in 2003 would be sold with a yield of about 9 1/4 percent under current market conditions. **********''The supply of new issues is extremely light, and it looks like it is going to stay that way for the next two to three weeks; unfortunately, demand is almost equally as light as the supply,'' said S.E. Canaday Jr., a vice president at John Nuveen & Company, a municipal bond firm. Dearth of Electric Bonds **********One reason for the light supply in the tax-exempt market has been the dearth of electric revenue bonds in the wake of the problems experienced by the Washington Public Power Supply System. Since the Washington State Supreme Court held a month ago that the system's contracts were invalid, there have been no major borrowings by agencies whose bonds are backed by their sales of electricity to municipalities. **********There has been a flurry of financing by housing agencies to fill the void left by the electric revenue bonds, with many recent issues selling well with a yield of about 10 percent for bonds due in 25 to 30 years. **********Following are the results of yesterday's auctions of new threemonth and six-month Treasury bills: (000 omitted in dollar figures) 3-Mo.

Inside the building, older children worked at arithmetic. **********The school and others like it are playing a key role in a gradual transformation that is taking place in rural India. **********Basic schooling is expanding at a rapid rate in the Indian countryside, where three-quarters of India's people live. Planners expect that universal education will soon be a fact for children up to 10 years old. **********Literacy rates are rising steadily as a result, particularly among the younger generations. Already, say those who live in this hamlet of 500 people in the middle of the Ganges plain, the shift in attitude that comes with literacy is under way. **********A measure of this transformation was provided by a small group of boys lounging outside the school where the students were doing their arithmetic. Their fathers needed them to work in the fields, they said, so they could not go to school. **********When India became independent 36 years ago, these boys would have represented the majority, especially here in Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, where illiteracy, overpopulation, poverty and disease are especially prevalent. **********Those doing their lessons inside the school would have been part of a small minority, representing only 1 or 2 of every 10 children their age. **********Today, the proportion is almost exactly reversed: the boys standing around outside represent only about 2 or 3 in 10; those inside, 7 or 8 in 10. **********The major reason, said Munni Lal, the 42-year-old elected headman of a group of three villages of which Naubasta is one, is that most parents have realized that education helps young people to get better jobs, to get off the farm and move to the city. **********There are, however, limits to the change. So far, the free schooling is confined to primary education, the first five years of school. **********Nationally, 83 percent of all children in that age group are enrolled in school, against 35 percent in 1947. The Government expects this figure to reach 95 percent soon. **********At higher grade levels, enrollment is much lower: 40 percent in the middle- school grades of sixth through eighth, and 22 percent in high school. **********Moreover, the enrollment level for girls is much lower than for boys: 66 percent nationally in first through the fifth grades, compared with 99 percent for boys. It is only 27 percent for girls in grades sixth through eighth, compared with 52 percent for boys. **********In rural areas, female literacy is estimated at less than 20 percent. Female school attendance is rising, however, and perhaps half the girls in Naubasta now attend school. **********By spending some $4 billion a year on education - second only to defense - India has been able not only to expand educational opportunities since independence but to do it in the face of a population that has roughly doubled, to more than 700 million. **********The national literacy rate, a bare 16 percent at independence, has more than doubled, to 36 percent, according to the 1981 census. But that figure includes children under 5 years old, so the effective rate is higher, officials say, perhaps 42 percent. Among Indians 10 to 25 years old, it is estimated at better than 50 percent. **********In Naubasta, the real expansion in schooling has come largely within the last decade. In 1947, there was one primary and one intermediate school serving the three villages. **********The Naubasta primary school, which has an enrollment of 120 and an average daily attendance of 70, was established in 1969. Three more primary and middle schools were established, in 1975, 1976 and 1977, and three months ago a nursery school opened."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/10/business/westburne-international-industries-ltd-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 58, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WESTBURNE INTERNATIONAL INDUSTRIES LTD reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "WESTBURNE INTERNATIONAL INDUSTRIES LTD reports earnings for Qtr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/03/business/plymouth-rubber-co-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-nov-27.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 71, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PLYMOUTH RUBBER CO reports earnings for Qtr to Nov 27", "print_headline": "PLYMOUTH RUBBER CO reports earnings for Qtr to Nov 27", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/30/business/advertising-078425.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1983-11-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 58, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ADVERTISING", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING", "body_text": " **********Glick & Lorwin **********Creamer Inc. has acquired 30-year- old Glick & Lorwin, an educational and professional relations firm that specializes in corporate and association-sponsored curriculum materials and teaching aids.

Some are still hoping for a renewal of the Jordanian-P.L.O. dialogue on entering American-sponsored negotiations with Israel over the future of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. **********Depending on their political viewpoints, some Palestinians hold Israel responsible for discouraging negotiations by continuing construction of Jewish settlements in the territories. Most blame the United States for failing to force Israel to halt the settlements.  Some pro-Jordanians blame Palestinian radicals for refusing to abandon their illusions and confront political reality. And some pro-P.L.O. figures blame King Hussein for resisting the creation of a Palestinian state and seeking merely to reoccupy the West Bank. **********On Sunday, King Hussein issued a statement of frustration with the P.L.O., asserting that the organization had withdrawn from understandings reached earlier on a joint approach with Jordan to possible talks. Evidently, hard-line Palestinian factions had rejected the concept of Jordan's negotiating on the P.L.O.'s behalf. Time May Be Running Out **********The collapse of the effort has distressed many West Bank and Gaza Palestinians, who fear that time for compromise is running out in the face of the extensive settlement construction by the Government of Prime Minister Menachem Begin. About 30,000 Jews now live on the West Bank, where about 800,000 Arabs reside, and about two-thirds of the land has been effectively declared off-limits to Arab construction, residence or agriculture. **********The plan put forward by President Reagan last September called for a freeze in Israeli settlements and the eventual transfer of at least parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to Palestinian rule in association with Jordan. But it opposed a Palestinian state. The Palestinian National Council, the governing arm of the P.L.O., rejected the plan, as did Prime Minister Begin. **********There is a widespread conviction among Palestinian Arabs that the Israelis want to make life miserable for them and thereby drive them out of the territories. **********This was reinforced by reported remarks Tuesday by the outgoing Chief of Staff of the Israeli Army, Lieut. Gen. Rafael Eytan. Israeli radio, television and newspapers quoted him as telling Parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that for every incident of stone-throwing by Arab youths, 10 settlements should be built. ''When we have settled the land,'' he was quoted as saying, ''all the Arabs will be able to do about it will be to scurry around like drugged roaches in a bottle.'' Acute Disappointment **********As a result, there has been growing support in the territories for a more moderate P.L.O. and Jordanian position as a possible way out from under Israeli occupation. Such a position envisioned accepting peaceful coexistence between Israel and a Palestinian entity on the West Bank and Gaza. The failure to achieve this has been met with acute disappointment. **********''I think this is the end,'' said Jamil Hamad, a Palestinian journalist from Bethlehem, ''and it's a very terrible end, a frightening end. He who says no to the Reagan plan should offer me, as an occupied man, an alternative, a hope. I think the Reagan plan, the Hussein readiness to talk, demonstrated a hope. Think of me as a Palestinian, occupied. What kind of hope are you offering me? Who is going to give me hope? It's very, very frightening.'' **********Former Mayor Rashad al-Shawa of Gaza said he did not see how King Hussein could act alone, without P.L.O. support, especially in the face of the Begin Government's determination to settle and hold the territories. ''He is afraid, and he's justified in being afraid, that he'll burn himself without accomplishing anything,'' he said. **********''I think it is very unfortunate that such a situation has arisen,'' he continued. ''I think it is a grave mistake that such a breakdown should take place.'' **********''But on the other hand, I feel that the undecided action taken by the United States has encouraged the extreme elements to take still more extreme stands and to influence the moderates. The United States has within its power sufficient influence to stop Israeli settlement in the territories. Merely to talk about doing its best to stop the Israeli settlements - I don't believe that is serious enough for us who call ourselves moderates.'' Trust in the United States **********Criticism of the United States for failing to influence Israeli policy is a pervasive theme in Palestinians' assessments of the impasse. **********''The United States is powerful,'' said Mustafa Natshe, the acting Mayor of Hebron, on the West Bank, ''but they don't use their power in the right way.'' Washington could have cut aid to Israel and forced a halt in settlement, he contended, in which case ''there would be more trust in the United States, and I think things would have been changed between King Hussein and the P.L.O.'' **********''That's ridiculous,'' Mr. Hamad countered. ''I believe the Reagan Administration was willing to exert pressure on Israel to stop settlements'' if King Hussein offered to negotiate. ''Why are they not saying that the Soviet Union is responsible for sabotaging this effort, which is more logical?''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/09/world/girl-11-slain-in-west-bank.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-12-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 43, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Girl, 11, Slain in West Bank", "print_headline": "Girl, 11, Slain in West Bank", "body_text": " **********Unidentified gunmen firing a rifle from a car shot and killed an 11-year-old Palestinian girl, Aya Behesh, and seriously wounded her sister, Faya, today in the center of the occupied West Bank town of Nablus, Israel radio said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/29/business/business-net-off-in-japan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-08-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 148, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Business Net Off in Japan", "print_headline": "Business Net Off in Japan", "body_text": " **********Recurrent profits of all Japanese corporations fell 6.1 percent, to 16,132 billion yen in the fiscal year 1982, which ended March 31, after a 12.8 percent decline in the fiscal year 1981 from 1980, according to the Finance Ministry. **********The declines reflected the recession in Japan and abroad, it said. **********Total corporate sales rose 2.4 percent, to 901,850 billion yen, but sales by the manufacturing industry fell 1.3 percent, their first year-to-year fall since statistics were first compiled in the fiscal year 1960, it said.

In Washington, Martin S.  Feldstein, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, quickly responded: ''I don't believe there is any basis for believing that there has been any change in current Administration policy.'' And Marc E. Leland, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, under orders from a reportedly outraged boss, Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan, said Mr. Sprinkel was ''speaking for himself.'' **********That spat remains to be resolved. Nonetheless, the Europeans are clearly rooting for the United States to demonstrate a greater concern for the financial strains that the industrial world's longlived recession has caused and the potential for the recession to escalate into a depression. **********The Europeans cheered in late summer, when Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, seemed to shift Fed policy onto a more stimulative course. And they have watched eagerly as the Reagan Administration has wrestled to prepare an economic game plan for 1983 that would insure a quick and lasting recovery for the weak United States economy. **********The Europeans themselves are groping for a strategy that will bring their major industrial economies that same result: growth, without the risk of another virulent bout of inflation. Several countries have already begun to walk this course; Sweden and Austria, for instance, have carefully aimed discretionary public spending at boosting investment, rather than at increasing personal consumption, while Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Italy and Sweden have all either introduced wage and price freezes or refused to raise wages automatically in line with inflation. **********Last week, the ministers of the so-called Group of 10, the 10 wealthiest Western countries, and Switzerland, asked the International Monetary Fund and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to develop by late spring proposals for economic growth that would not reignite inflation. **********THE O.E.C.D., an organization of 24 industrial nations, will make its recommendations when its ministers meet in Paris in May, the I.M.F. when its ministers gather in Washington in June. The Europeans are convinced -and they hope the United States is, too - that the fight against inflation has gone far enough, indeed, too far, and that the dangers posed by international debt and a stagnant world economy now far outweigh the dangers of inflation. ''Is there an increasing asymmetry of risk? That is the question,'' said Silvia Ostry, one of the architects of the O.E.C.D.'s economic policies. **********The Europeans' hunt for a growth policy is a variation on an old theme -the ''locomotive'' strategy of 1977 and 1978, in which the three most successful Western industrial nations - the United States, West Germany and Japan - were expected to push or pull weaker nations into prosperity by expanding rapidly themselves. Their growth would generate demand for exports in less prosperous nations throughout the world, leading eventually to a chain reaction of growth around the globe. That strategy, which rested on the Keynesian theory that a large fiscal stimulus should be applied to the whole economy, was proposed by a panel of economists headed by Paul McCracken, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under former President Richard M. Nixon. But the locomotive stalled on rising oil prices and was sidetracked completely by the dollar crisis of 1979. **********Now, the O.E.C.D. is casting about for a more sophisticated approach, under which any stimulus would be carefully channeled into noninflationary areas and would be combined with other measures designed or intended to make economies function more efficiently - and with less inflation - as they move toward full employment. **********The view in Europe is that the choice is simple, and inexorable.  Either those countries that have gotten a grip on inflation - and now have what the Europeans call a ''margin of maneuverability'' - address the international debt crisis, and finance a gradual adjustment to create a larger market for exports, so that third-world countries can export and import more, or they rely on a ''marketplace adjustment,'' which the Europeans fear could be jolting. In a marketplace adjustment, this view holds, private banks would cease to lend, the poorer nations would be forced to reduce or eliminate imports and a depression would ensue. Economists see Poland and other East European countries, which have canceled many orders with the West, as examples of what might happen to curtail world trade if the financial situation is not eased soon by a return to growth in the major industrial nations. **********To the Europeans, there is no real choice. The only option for policy makers is growth. That was the message that came out of last week's meeting in Paris of finance ministers from the Group of 10, and Switzerland. It was the message the Europeans thought they heard from Washington through Mr. Sprinkel. **********His remarks about third-world debt and recession anticipated the ministers' final communique, issued Tuesday, in which they acknowledged that faster growth is needed to expand world trade, and reduce debt problems and unemployment. **********There is no point in giving the I.M.F. more money to finance a gradual reduction in third-world debts unless these countries can export and expand their earnings as well, economists have warned.  Nonetheless, the finance ministers agreed to increase to $19 billion from $7.1 billion the amount of money their countries will make available to heavily indebted countries. **********And so the locomotive has been rolled forth again, this time sporting what the O.E.C.D. calls a ''differentiated'' outlook for the Western economies. In the United States, Japan, West Germany and Britain, inflation has come down sharply and current rates are roughly comparable. Yet growth prospects differ. The United States seems headed for a mild recovery with growth in the 2 to 3 percent range. Japan may do a little better. But the German economy, shaken by falling exports and political uncertainty, is likely to contract for the third consecutive year, and Britain faces near-stagnation. **********Unlike 1977, there is a feeling now among O.E.C.D. economists that any new recovery strategy must be more subtle.  The O.E.C.D.'s specific recommendations, to be made in May, are of course still unknown. But they were foreshadowed last month, when a panel of 26 economists brought together by the Washington-based Institute for International Economics and chaired by its director, C. Fred Bergsten, produced its own blueprint for ''a coordinated economic recovery strategy.'' The panel's report is very close, O.E.C.D. sources say, to what they hope to propose in May. **********This time, the O.E.C.D.'s emerging tactic, labeled ''The Differentiated Recovery Strategy,'' is an attempt to work out for each major country a set of detailed policy prescriptions that meet governments' concerns and which, when put together, would do more to promote recovery than what any nation could do alone. And, the economists are betting that there will not be a shock of higher oil prices to get in the way of growth this time around. **********IN fact, all Western governments have already started to stimulate their economies through a relaxation in monetary policy and lower interest rates. ''Germany, Britain and Switzerland are all now following mildly stimulative monetary policies,'' said Hans Maast, chief economist at the Swiss Credit Bank in Zurich. So far, Mr. Maast argues, this relaxation is free from inflationary dangers because oil prices are weak, personal savings are increasing and trade unions, shellshocked by rising unemployment, are keeping wage claims moderate. **********Yet the power of the financial markets in the United States is keeping the Federal Reserve on what one O.E.C.D. economist called ''a knife edge.'' Too much laxity could arouse inflationary fears, push interest rates up, boost the dollar and force European countries to jack up their rates again to protect currencies. **********Dr. Klaus Wieners, chief economist at the Westdeutsche Landesbank in Dusseldorf, West Germany, says that further monetary relaxation offers the most credible strategy for securing faster expansion, because restrictive budgetary policies could be politically difficult for governments. **********A key element in the emerging European approach to growth policy will be to to encourage countries that have already won the battle against inflation to divide their deficits into two parts, an ''automatic'' deficit, which is created by recession and will disappear with it, and a ''discretionary'' deficit, which results from specific governmental policies that can be controlled. This division should help governments focus attention on the parts of the budget they can increase directly to spur recovery. **********THE strategy would be to move ahead rapidly with such stimulus, but with care. The Bergsten panel urged that money go for infrastructure projects, such as repairing bridges and highway systems and not for new social programs that are difficult to curtail or cancel when the economy picks up. The O.E.C.D. believes such discretionary government spending should be carefully aimed at boosting investment rather than personal consumption, as some of members countries have already done. **********However difficult the challenge of persuading governments to adopt a coordinated recovery strategy, there is a growing belief that the world promises to pay a heavy price for its present economic performance. The Bergsten panel said, ''The perpetuation of stagnation raises the specter of a breakdown of the world economic order.'' Contributing to that breakdown is the inability of thirdworld countries to repay their debts."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/29/business/retreat-set-by-texas-instruments.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "1983-10-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1366, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "RETREAT SET BY TEXAS INSTRUMENTS", "print_headline": "RETREAT SET BY TEXAS INSTRUMENTS", "body_text": " **********Texas Instruments Inc., battered by its second huge quarterly loss, announced yesterday that it was ending production of its 99/4A home computer and pulling out of the home computer business. **********''In order to limit further financial drain on T.I., we have made the decision to withdraw from the consumer home computer business,'' the company said in a statement attributed to Mark Shepherd Jr., its chairman, and J. Fred Bucy, president. **********That announcement came simultaneously with the company's report that it had lost $110.8 million in the third quarter of this year, after a $119.2 million loss in the second quarter. The latest loss was in contrast to net income of $36.9 million, or $1.57 a share, in last year's third quarter. **********Loss on Computers **********In home computer operations alone, the company lost $330 million before taxes, including a write-off associated with pulling out of the business. In the second quarter, it lost $183 million on home computers, bringing total losses in two quarters to more than $500 million. **********The statement said that production of the company's home computer would cease in November and that there would be ''significant'' layoffs at the company's home computer operations.  The company said it would also substantially lower the price on the 99/4A to help clear remaining inventory from the store shelves. The computer now sells for a $149 retail price plus a $50 rebate. **********Business Model Continued **********Texas Instruments said it would continue to make and sell its Professional Computer, a more expensive personal computer designed primarily for business use. It also said it was remaining in the calculator business. **********The company did not specify how many layoffs it would have or what the price cuts would be. Charles W. LaFara, a large mail order distributor of the home computer products in Oklahoma City, said that he had heard from T.I. employees that there would be 4,000 layoffs and that the price of the computer would be reduced to $47 wholesale, from $147, with the rebate removed. ''I think I'm going to be sick,'' Mr. LaFara said. **********The pullout raises the prospect that existing owners of the T.I. home computer will find it more difficult to obtain servicing and new programs to run on the machines. There are more than a million owners of the low- priced machine, making it by some estimates the second most widely owned computer, after the Commodore VIC-20 and ahead of the Apple II. **********Texas Instruments said that it would continue to provide service for the machine. It did not say who would provide software for the machine, but it appeared clear that new software would be developed only if other companies thought they could make money doing it. **********Home computer sales are estimated to represent less than 10 percent of the company's revenues, which fell in the third quarter to $1.01 billion from $1.05 billion in the same period last year. Not counting consumer electronics, revenues climbed 11 percent, the company, whose major product is semiconductor chips, said. **********The announcement marked the latest casualty in the home computer and video game businesses. Although demand for home computers is growing rapidly, supply has been growing even faster, leading to oversupply and steep price cuts. Mattel Inc. has already pulled back on plans to market a home computer, and there is speculation in the industry that Warner Communications' Atari is also considering withdrawing from the market. **********New Companies Entering **********At the same time, new companies are entering the business, moving it in a new direction. Coleco Industries recently started shipping its Adam, and the International Business Machines Corporation is expected to introduce its home computer next week. Both these new machines are in the $600 to $1,200 price range and are more useful than the computers like the 99/4A, which is limited to playing games and some simple tasks unless a lot of equipment is added. **********While many industry analysts had speculated that T.I. would pull out of the home computer business, the company has been insisting it would stay in. Less than two months ago, it hired a Procter & Gamble executive to revamp its consumer operations. Yesterday's announcement was, therefore, something of a surprise, especially coming just before the heavy Christmas selling season. **********Texas Instruments said that retail sales of the 99/4A were disappointing and that there was still excess inventory on retail shelves, which limited new orders and led to an operating loss in the quarter. ''With this situation continuing into October, it became clear that fourth-quarter demand would not be sufficient to prevent large additional losses,'' the company said. **********''The first nine months of 1983 have been the most difficult period in the history of T.I.,'' the two officials said in the statement. ''We believe that, with the painful, but correct, decision to withdraw from the consumer home computer business, that period has now ended.'' **********Favorable Response Expected **********The company's withdrawal from home computers is bound to be greeted favorably on Wall Street. Analysts have long noted that, even though home computers are only a small part of T.I.'s business, the losses were so large as to outweigh the profits from all other divisions combined. **********Analysts have also often said that T.I., whose other businesses include semiconductor manufacturing, larger computers, seismic exploration and defense electronics, is not cut out for consumer business. It withdrew from digital watch business two years ago. **********The Dallas electronics company, with 1982 revenue of $4.33 billion, said that its loss came at a time when its businesses other than consumer products were improving. For the first nine months of 1983, T.I. lost $222.9 million, in contrast to a profit of $101.5 million in the first nine months of 1982. Revenues climbed slightly to $3.28 billion from $3.22 billion. **********Painful Saga Ended **********The withdrawal from the home computer business marks the end of a saga that has been embarrassing and painful for Texas Instruments from the start. The company in 1979 was one of the first to market a computer strictly geared toward home use, as opposed to office use. But the machine, which sold for $1,150, was too expensive and was a failure. **********Starting in the middle of 1982, however, prices began dropping to as little as $100 for essentially the same machine that sold for $1,150 a few years earlier. Sales of the Texas Instruments home computers, as well as those of other manufacturers, started soaring late last year, and it looked like the T.I. home computer was on its way to success at last. **********This year, however, Texas Instruments ran into problems in February when it had to withdraw its computer from the market briefly because of an electrical problem. It also started losing money because prices were too low, while Commodore International, its chief rival, could continue to produce its VIC-20 at the same low price for a profit. The Texas Instruments computer also ran into problems because other computers had more software. **********Earlier this month, it was learned that T.I. did not plan to introduce a more powerful home computer, the 99/8, that it had been previewing to retailers for more than six months. **********T.I. is not the only home computer manufacturer to have problems. In addition to Mattel's pullback and delays in getting Atari computers to market, Coleco was late shipping its Adam computer, meaning it will fall far short of its sales goals for the year. And Commodore, the only company that has been profitable, is now running into problems because of a shortage of disk drives and what retailers say is a high defect rate in its Commodore 64 computer. **********The home computer field thus resembles a battle in which all sides kill one another off and no one is left standing. This will make the path clearer for I.B.M. At the same time, ironically, there might be a shortage of home computers in stores this Christmas because of the carnage wrought by the previous oversupply. a $149 retail price plus a $50 rebate."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/11/business/credit-markets-note-and-bond-prices-jump-rates-on-bills-are-down.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1983-02-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 727, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Note and Bond Prices Jump; Rates on Bills Are Down", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; Note and Bond Prices Jump; Rates on Bills Are Down", "body_text": " **********Prices of Treasury notes and bonds rose sharply yesterday with traders encouraged by rumors that the Federal Reserve was leaning toward further reductions in short-term interest rates, and by signs that the economy was not recovering as quickly as has been expected. **********By late in the day, government securities dealers were no longer talking about a ''glut of unsold issues'' and were quoting sharply higher prices and lower yields for short- and long-term Treasury securities. **********Rates on Treasury bills, for example, fell by more than an eighth of a percentage point, with three- and six-month issues bid at rates of 8.16 percent and 8.26 percent, respectively. The greatest price gains came in the note and bond market, where issues due in 1990 and beyond rose by a point or more. The new 3- , 10- and 30-year Treasury issues sold last week were all traded at prices higher than those set at last week's auctions. **********The initial price jumps came early in the morning, and were based on reports that the Federal Reserve Board's chairman, Paul A.  Volcker, expects that interest rates will continue to decline. Since monetary policy makers at the Fed met this week, traders concluded that Mr. Volcker's comments mean further reductions in short-term interest rates. **********While there was no doubt that press reports influenced trading yesterday, many analysts noted that there were still no signs that the Fed had taken actions to reduce interest rates. The overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market, a closly watched benchmark for other short-term interest rates, traded around 8 1/2 percent yesterday, the same level as in the past five weeks. Relatively High Rates **********Mr. Volcker has been well aware that current interest rates ranging from 9 to 11 percent in the Treasury market are unusually high relative to a 5 percent inflation rate that shows no signs of increasing. For that reason, some analysts said that a comment by Mr. Volcker that interest rates are too high need not be a signal that declines are imminent. **********Morgan Stark, a senior vice president at Chemical Bank, commented that Mr. Volcker's thinking may have changed little in recent months. ''But the market felt less threatened,'' he said, since many analysts have been warning recently that the Federal Reserve might raise short-term rates in an effort to reduce growth of the money supply.  ''The Fed still has the problem of how to get interest rates down without inducing inflationary behavior,'' Mr. Stark added. **********Economists at Ried, Thunberg & Company, an advisory firm that specializes in interpreting Federal Reserve actions, said in a publication yesterday that the inflationary potential of recent money supply growth will not suddenly disappear when the Fed announces today new definitions for some money supply measures. They doubted that ''the Fed can redefine'' the money supply measures ''and immediatley follow up with a further ease in monetary policy - and retail credibility.'' Retail Sales Figures a Factor **********In the afternoon, prices received more impetus when the Commerce Department announced that retail sales in January rose only one-tenth of 1 percent, well below the increases of 1 percent or more that market participants expected. The small increase, combined with a downward revision in December's retail sales, showed that the economic recovery is still not strong. A weak economy would provide more reason for the Fed to foster lower interest rates, traders said. **********In the tax-exempt market, prices improved yesterday, though not quite as much as in the Treasury market. For the week, prices rose slightly. **********Among recent long-term issues, the 10 7/8 percent bonds due 2008 of the Municipal Assistance Corporation were traded among securities firms at a price as high as 99 3/4, and were offered among dealers at a price of 99 7/8. The Baa-1/A-rated bonds were publicly offered earlier this week at 100. **********Among high-grade general obligation bonds, underwriters said that there was a modest pickup in demand for a $50 million issue of Texas bonds that had been repriced to increase yields by about a tenth of a percentage point. Originally, the Aaa-rated bonds were offered by a Bankers Trust group with yields ranging from 5.75 percent in 1987 to 7.25 percent in 1993 and 8.3 percent in 1998."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/07/business/valuation-by-merrill-lynch-disputed.html": {"writer_name": "Raymond Bonner", "pub_date": "1983-12-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1719, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "VALUATION BY MERRILL LYNCH DISPUTED", "print_headline": "VALUATION BY MERRILL LYNCH DISPUTED", "body_text": " **********The Labor Department and Merrill Lynch & Company are caught up in a dispute over whether the nation's largest securities firm compromised its independence in evaluating the assets of an insurance company owned by Allen M. Dorfman, a longtime associate of organized crime figures. **********The dispute arises out of the desire of the health and welfare fund of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters to buy Amalgamated Insurance Agency Services Inc., which had handled the union's claim processing for 30 years. **********Amalgamated was owned by Mr. Dorfman, who was murdered gangland style last January, a month after he was convicted on charges of conspiring to bribe a United States Senator. Before his murder, the teamsters' fund wanted to buy out Mr. Dorfman's business in order to purge itself of past charges of engaging in unlawful activity. **********According to the Labor Department, Merrill Lynch's involvement in the Amalgamated evaluation in 1982 was part of ''a charade of respectability.'' **********Merrill Lynch told the teamsters' fund that Amalgamated was worth $10.75 million. But the Labor Department says that for the fund to pay that amount ''would constitute a serious waste of fund assets,'' according to a court filing. The department says the assets are worth no more than $1 million, and that there was ''no substance or foundation'' for the investment firm's appraisal. **********Merrill Lynch's attorney, in a letter sent to the Labor Department last Friday, countered that the department's charges were ''one-sided, unfair and unjustified.'' **********The teamster fund paid $250,000, plus expenses, to Merrill Lynch for what it asked to be an independent evaluation of Amalgamated. **********''We are continuing to discuss with Labor Merrill Lynch's role,'' said George W. Lehr, executive director of the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Health and Welfare Fund, the full title of the teamsters' fund. He added that the fund's trustees would decide at their meeting in Chicago later this month what action, if any, to take against Merrill Lynch. **********Merrill Lynch's role in evaluating Amalgamated was a factor in the firm's losing a bid to manage the assets of the teamsters' pension fund, which was awarded recently to Morgan Stanley & Company. **********Mr. Lehr, a former Kansas banker, was brought into the fund several years ago when it was the subject of numerous Federal investigations. He has attempted to eliminate the practices and associations that had led to investigations of criminal activity by the fund. As part of this effort, he was seeking to remove Amalgamated from Mr. Dorfman's control. **********The agreement signed by the health and welfare fund and Merrill Lynch provided that in evaluating Amalgamated, Merrill Lynch would meet with representatives and lawyers for the fund and Amalgamated ''together and not separately.'' **********According to the Labor Department, however, there were ''unauthorized ex parte communications'' between Amalgamated and Merrill Lynch, ''apparently in an attempt to cause'' Merrill Lynch ''to arrive at a higher valuation.'' An ex parte communication is one in which not all relevant parties are present. **********Asked why the fund and Mr. Dorfman did not simply negotiate a figure - the usual manner in which a buyer and seller agree on a price - Mr. Lehr said, ''With all the past dealings, the past allegations and all the litigation, any such dealings would be tainted and would not be acceptable to Congress, to the public, to the Department of Labor.'' **********Mr. Lehr explained that Merrill Lynch had been selected because ''it was the single best name available among investment bankers - certainly one of the four or five best.'' **********The fund even insisted that it pay the entire $250,000 - as opposed to splitting the cost with Amalgamated - ''because we didn't want anyone to accuse us of being influenced by Dorfman,'' Mr. Lear explained. **********Now, in spite of the fund's efforts, it has become involved in another imbroglio, in which Merrill Lynch's independence is being questioned. **********The fund and Amalgamated had agreed to be bound by the evaluation placed on Amalgamated's assets by an investment banking company. The contract further provided that ''to insure that the value determined is fair and reasonable, the investment banking firm shall be independent of and shall not be deemed to represent either of the parties.'' **********Recommendation Disputed **********According to Mr. Lehr, Merrill Lynch was recommended to the fund by Albert Jenner, founder of one of Chicago's largest law firms, Jenner & Block. A partner in Mr. Jenner's law firm, Michael Rovell, who represents Mr. Dorfman's estate, denied that anyone in the firm had recommended Merrill Lynch to the fund. **********Mr. Jenner, acting as attorney for Mr. Dorfman and Amalgamated, had already asked Merrill Lynch to act as consultant to his law firm on the evaluation, according to court documents. **********The approach had been made to Henry Meers, managing director of Merrill Lynch White Weld Capital Markets in Chicago, the investment banking unit of Merrill Lynch. Mr. Meers had known Mr. Jenner for more than 50 years. **********With Jenner & Block lawyers, Mr. Meers specifically discussed the value of the Amalgamated assets, as well as the methods by which the assets could be evaluated, in order to arrive at a higher value, according to court papers. **********Mr. Meers, when he began discussions with the fund, did not advise it of these prior contacts, according to the Labor Department. **********The prior discussions between Jenner & Block and Merrill Lynch have come to light in a lawsuit in which the Department of Labor and the fund have charged that Mr. Dorfman defrauded the fund of $13 million. **********The suit, which is pending in the United States District Court in Chicago, involves a variety of complex issues, and it is not at all certain what the specific result would be if the court agrees with the department's contention that the assets were overvalued. **********Merrill Lynch is not a party to the litigation. As part of the proceedings, however, the fund and the Labor Department, as plaintiffs, took the deposition of Mr. Meers. They are planning to take Mr. Jenner's deposition next week, Mr. Rovell said. **********Value Defended by Merrill **********During the deposition, in response to a question by Mr. Rovell, Mr. Meers said that he was not influenced by his relationshp with Mr. Jenner, that there was ''no question in my mind'' that Merrill Lynch acted professionally and that $10.75 million was a fair value to the fund. **********When the Labor Department attorney, Page H. Jackson, was questioning Mr. Meers about the relationship between Merrill Lynch on the one hand and Jenner & Block and Amalgamated on the other, Mr. Meers's attorney objected. **********''What does it have to do with anything?'' David T. Pritikin asked. **********''It basically goes again to the independence of Merrill Lynch White Weld in the matter, and I think goes to the credibility of the value determination made,'' Mr. Jackson said. **********At the request of Merrill Lynch, Judge Hubert L. Will has placed the deposition and 53 documents, including memorandums of discussions between Mr. Jenner and Mr. Meers, minutes of Merrill Lynch meetings and papers relating to the evaluation process, under a protective order, which means they are not part of the public record. **********Earlier Discussions Held **********Merrill Lynch turned down the offer from Jenner & Block to act as adviser to the transaction at a meeting on Dec. 14, 1981 according to Mr. Meers. Among the reasons given by Mr. Meers in his deposition were that Merrill Lynch lacked the necessary expertise and that ''we did not want to be Dorfman's banker.'' **********A few weeks later, however, Merrill Lynch accepted what was essentially the same assignment when the offer came from the fund. **********Merrill Lynch declined to comment about any of the matters covered in the deposition because it is under a protective order. The firm provided a letter written by its attorney, Mr. Pritikin, to the Labor Department last Friday. Among other things, Mr. Pritikin explained that Merrill Lynch had accepted the offer from the fund because it ''believes that by performing its agreed role in the fund-Amalgamated transaction, Merrill Lynch would contribute to the realizations of efficiencies and reforms sought to the fund's management and by the Department of Labor.'' **********Mr. Pritikin also pointed out that in reaching its determination of the value, Merrill had retained Arthur Andersen & Company. The Chicago- based accounting firm was paid by the fund for its services. Arthur Andersen is also outside auditor for Jenner & Block. **********Arthur Andersen concluded that Amalgamated was worth $9.7 million. The Labor Department, in one of the court filings that is public, contends that ''the $9.7 million figure in Arthur Andersen's report does not represent fair value to the fund, fair market value or then-current market value of the assets transferred to the fund.'' **********Arthur Andersen determined that Amalgamated's computer software was worth $5.9 million. But the Labor Department contends that its worth to the fund was ''significantly less'' than $750,000. Arthur Andersen also determined that Amalgamated's work force was worth $3,579,000. The Labor Department contends that the value ''is less than $900,000.'' **********A spokesman for Arthur Andersen, who asked that his name not be used, said the firm was ''not familiar with the specifics of the allegations'' by the Labor Department - they were filed with the court in Chicago on Nov. 18 - and therefore could not comment. **********Another line of questioning pursued by the Labor Department during the course of Mr. Meers's deposition related to how and why Merrill Lynch added $1 million to the Arthur Andersen figure. **********The department's lawyer said, during the deposition, that the $10.75 million figure appeared in the final report and only one other place - Mr. Meers's file. **********Asked where the $10.75 million figure in his file came from, Mr. Meers answered: ''That could easily come when I might have been on the phone and just wrote it down or suggested to somebody else. I haven't any idea what this relates to.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/06/business/japan-us-talks-on-oil.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-07-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 148, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Japan-U.S.  Talks on Oil", "print_headline": "Japan-U.S.  Talks on Oil", "body_text": " **********Japan and the United States held discussions today on the possibility of shipping Alaskan oil across the Pacific to Asia, diplomatic sources said. **********The talks were the latest in a series on energy cooperation between the countries following the visit to Washington earlier this year of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone. **********United States legislation prohibits the export of Alaskan oil by any company, foreign or domestic, but the Reagan Administration has said it wants this tight clamp at least partially lifted. **********The oil could go to any country around the Pacific rim, but Japan would probably be the major importer, the sources said.

This law, which I authored, allocates no money - not one penny - for direct compensation of textile companies, manufacturers of children's sleepwear, or retailers who suffered huge financial losses as a result of the Government's decision to ban Tris. **********Rather, it merely confers jurisdiction on the Court of Claims to hear cases regarding Tris-related losses due to the Government's ban. It is, above all, a simple and equitable way to provide these corporations with their day in court - an opportunity to prove they were damaged by conflicting government regulations regarding the use of Tris. **********One point should be made, however. Should some or all of these companies be successful in proving that they were legitimately damaged by the Government, the Congress would have to appropriate money at some later date to pay some or all of these claims. There is nothing wrong with that, since the Government would be responsible for paying damages it created. **********I sponsored this legislation because companies affected by the Tris ban made good-faith efforts to comply with the Government's mandatory flammability standards, and in doing so, suffered huge financial losses. **********Those companies' decisions to use Tris were based on the knowledge that the chemical had been tested and found to meet all the appropriate government standards at that time. Indeed, there was no credible and convincing evidence that Tris was, in any way, a health hazard. **********When the ban on Tris was first ordered, these same companies made good-faith efforts to comply with the law again, despite the fact that it meant a great deal of harm to them. **********This is, therefore, not an issue over the appropriateness of the Government's decision to recall products which are injurious, although some manufacturers maintained that Tris was banned without sufficient and convincing proof that it was indeed dangerous. Rather, this is a response to the clear-cut issue of conflicting Government regulations - cruel in their effect on corporations that acted in good faith to comply with the law. **********The question then is: Does the Government, at the very least, have a responsibility to hear these cases and to afford those who claimed they were injured by a regulatory action an opportunity to be heard? I believe the record will clearly show that the Government has such a responsibility. The legislation, of course, does not guarantee recovery of financial losses by those claiming injury, but merely insures their right to be heard. **********The history of why this legislation is necessary explains in part why Congress passed, and the President signed, the Tris legislation.WHEN the Commerce Department set mandatory standards to lessen the f lammable nature of children's sleepwear in 1972, Tris was one of s everal flame retardants available then that met those standards. Butf ive years later, at the request of the Environmental Defense Fund, t he Consumer Products Safety Commission banned the sale and further p roduction of all children's sleepwear containing the f lameretardant. The ban required manufacturers to repurchase any c hildren's clothing with Tris. **********Springs Mills, a textile company in my state, brought legal action against the commission. Following a May 1977 hearing, District Court Judge Robert F. Chapman issued a temporary injunction preventing the C.P.S.C. from enforcing its Tris regulations against Springs Mills.  And in the ensuing trial, Judge Chapman struck down the commission's ban against Tris. **********In his ruling, he found that ''Tris was the only flame retardant available to effectively treat polyester, acetate, and triacetate fabrics used for children's sleepwear, which would enable the sleepwear to comply'' with the Commerce Department's original standards on flammability. According to the court, ''this had the practical effect of the Federal Government ordering that Tris be used.'' **********''Now another department of the same government has not only banned Tris, but ordered the repurchase of articles containing it,'' he said. In his ruling, the judge also found that due process of law had been denied in the Tris ban. Yet, the days of Tris were effectively ended after all the publicity. **********On Jan.20, 1978, the Senate unanimously passed a bill to aid over 100 companies in their $50 million loss resulting from the actions of the commission. The bill would have given the Court of Claims jurisdiction to hear arguments by manufacturers, producers, distributors and retailers and to determine the amounts of loss. The House of Representatives passed this bill in October 1978 by a vote of 304 to 90. But President Carter ''pocket vetoed'' the bill in November. **********I then introduced legislation in the 96th Congress, and it was passed by a unanimous vote in the full Senate in December. But it died in the House Judiciary Committee. **********Then, in the 97th Congress, I reintroduced the legislation. Again the Senate passed it unanimously, and the bill finally cleared the House late last month. The President has since signed it into law.

The French-born economist, now in his 22d year at the University of California at Berkeley, made his mark on the profession 24 years ago in a 114- page monograph filled mostly with elaborate mathematical formulas. **********The book, ''Theory of Value: An Axiomatic Analysis of Economic Equlibrium,'' drew enthusiastic reactions from his peers. A reviewer for the American Economic Review, the paragon of economic journals, concluded that ''it would not surprise me if it turned out to be one of the few classics of our period.'' **********Professor Debreu, now 62 years old, is little known outside the economics profession, but when he was named today as the 1983 recipient of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science, his colleagues regarded it as part of the natural course of events.  'An Economist's Economist' **********''Gerard Debreu is an economist's economist,'' said Bent Hansen, chairman of the economics department at Berkeley. ''His work is very abstract, very fundamental. But everybody in the profession quotes him and must demonstrate that they know his work.'' **********Kenneth J. Arrow, a Stanford University professor in economics and operations research, said Professor Debreu in recent years had made great strides in developing mathematical tools for discovering the prices at which supply meets demand in several complex economies. ''His work includes a number of major innovations with practical applications,'' Professor Arrow said. **********Herbert Scarf, a Yale University economics professor, said Professor Debreu is greatly concerned with how economic models are framed. This, as Professor Debreu pointed out, makes him an heir to the pioneering theories of the late John von Neumann, the originator of game theory. ''I have been greatly influenced by von Neumann,'' Professor Debreu said. **********At a morning news conference on the Berkeley campus, Professor Debreu reasserted his reputation as a pure researcher, saying he did not want to use the occasion to discuss his views of the Reagan Administration's economic policies. Enjoys the Academic Life **********He turns down consulting offers from the companies whose econometric forecasting models owe much to his life's work. ''I'd like to stay with basic research and the academic life, which I enjoy very much,'' he said. **********Professor Debreu said he was distressed that his Nobel award might imply to the general public that all is well with basic research in mathematics and economics. ''The present condition is alarming,'' he said, alluding to cutbacks in state and Federal financing of basic research at Berkeley and the National Science Foundation. **********Gerard Debreu was born July 4, 1921, in Calais, France. He was graduated from the Ecole Normale Superior in Paris in 1944. After receiving his doctorate in economics from the Universite de Paris in 1946, he served two years as a soldier in the French occupation forces in West Germany. **********He came to the United States in 1950 as a research fellow with the Cowles Foundation for Research in Economics, in Chicago, and moved with the foundation to Yale University in 1955. He went to Berkeley in 1962.  Lunch at Home Every Day **********He and his wife, Fran,coise, who were married June 14, 1945, live in the Berkeley Hills above the campus. They have two daughters, Chantal and Florence, and five grandchildren. **********Professor Debreu became a United States citizen in 1975. His friends describe him as ''very French'' in manners and interests. He lunches at home every day with his wife, an accomplished choral singer, and thrives on long hikes in the Point Reyes National Forest, in Marin County. **********''He is a great hiker, and has taken me to isolated spots to watch the sea lions,'' said Dr. Hansen, the department chairman. Professor Debreru is also very formal, Dr. Hansen added, ''very hard to penetrate for most people, but inside a very, very warm person.'' Berkeley students rate him a ''star teacher,'' Dr. Hansen said. Fascinated by Proust Work **********Beyond economics, Marcel Proust's ''Remembrance of Things Past'' is one of Professor Debreu's continuing objects of fascination. ''No matter what happens in life, you can always find something in Proust that relates,'' Dr. Hansen said. He added that he thinks Professor Debreu might silently identify with Proust's ''obsession'' with developing, as he put it, ''a piece of intellectual work.'' **********Professor Debreu is now trying to link complexity theory, a new theory of algorithms, with the economic theory of information. But he said he thinks he keeps his work in better perspective than did the 19th-century French author. **********''My appreciation of Proust is in his style, subtlety and taste,'' Professor Debreu said. ''I prize conciseness very much, and that is certainly something that you cannot accuse Proust of. His compulsion, as you know, eventually killed him. I'll try to escape that fate.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/08/business/imf-terms-to-venezuela.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-06-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 157, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "I.M.F.

Two prisoners who were released before the law went into effect were found dead here by the Red Cross; some reports said they had been killed by uniformed men. **********Dr. Kirio Waldo Salgado, a member of the Amnesty Commission, said 59 former political prisoners had been in contact with the panel, and he estimated that 80 percent of these were trying to obtain exit visas. **********It is unclear how many of the Salvadorans freed have already left the country. Mexico, Canada, Belgium and possibly Australia will accept political refugees, Dr. Waldo Salgado said. **********Like the young woman who was implicated by her neighbor, most of the former political prisoners say they are still confused as to how they managed to end up spending the last year in jail. **********One 21-year-old man sat with his mother and uncle waiting to be interviewed by the commission. He was a student a year ago when armed guards came to his home. He said he had never been involved in any political activities and was never accused of a crime in the 12 months that he spent in jail. **********''We were always supporters of the Government,'' said his mother, who was anxious to get her son a visa to leave the country. ''But we don't know what to think now.'' Forced to Join the Guerrillas **********A 30-year-old man at the Amnesty Commission's camp said he had been forced to join the guerrillas and stayed with them for 15 days before slipping away one evening. **********''I deserted because we were treated badly and poorly fed,'' he said.  Another of the men at the camp said he had narrowly missed being arrested by the National Police in Ahuachapan on June 10. His wife was in a hospital, he said, and he was visiting her when armed men went on a door-to-door search for the Salvadorans suspected of having ties to the left. **********The young man, who said he had been working with one of El Salvador's five guerrilla groups as a political agent, learned that the police had visited his sister's house. **********Afraid that he would eventually be arrested and killed, he said, he fled, riding on the back of a truck to San Salvador to seek out the Amnesty Commission."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/09/world/soviet-aide-implies-sakharov-is-mentally-ill.html": {"writer_name": "John Burns", "pub_date": "1983-12-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 578, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SOVIET AIDE IMPLIES SAKHAROV IS MENTALLY ILL", "print_headline": "SOVIET AIDE IMPLIES SAKHAROV IS MENTALLY ILL", "body_text": " **********A prominent Soviet official implied at a news conference today that Andrei D. Sakharov, the physicist and human rights campaigner, was mentally disturbed. **********The official, Vitaly P. Ruben, who is chairman of one of the two houses of the Supreme Soviet, the nominal Parliament, called Dr. Sakharov ''a talented but sick man'' and said an article the physicist published in the West earlier this year had invited an American nuclear strike on the Soviet Union. **********''A sane person would not say such things,'' Mr. Ruben said, tapping his head with his forefinger in a gesture suggesting mental trouble. **********Dr. Sakharov's article, which was smuggled out and published in Foreign Affairs, warned the West against letting the Soviet Union gain a nuclear advantage. The Soviet press condemned the article, implying that Dr. Sakharov was a traitor. **********Mr. Ruben spoke at a news conference marking United Nations Human Rights Day. His remarks about Dr. Sakharov were in response to questions from Western reporters. **********The questions focused on Dr. Sakharov's banishment in Gorky in 1980 in an evident effort to isolate him from Western contacts. Gorky, a city of 1.4 million people, is closed to foreigners. **********Mr. Ruben, a former Premier and President of the Soviet Latvian republic, is chairman of the Soviet of Nationalities, one of the two chambers of Parliament. He said the order to exile Dr. Sakharov to Gorky stemmed from ''humane considerations'' involving his health. Those who issued the order ''sought to help a sick person,'' he said, and were concerned ''mainly for his peace of mind.'' **********Mr. Ruben occupies a position of little policy-making significance. Nonetheless, Western diplomats attending the news conference said they were concerned at the possibility that the remarks might reflect a view at higher levels in the Soviet hierarchy. **********The confinement of dissidents to psychiatric institutions has been a common expedient in recent years. Dr. Sakharov's wife, Yelena G. Bonner, has told Western reporters of her worry that the authorities might be planning to place her husband in an institution. **********At another point Mr. Ruben said the decision to exile Dr. Sakharov from Moscow was also intended to keep him from divulging secret information to Western ''emissaries, correspondents or whatever guise they may come in.'' Dr. Sakharov was a key figure in Soviet nuclear weapons development until he began publicly questioning policies in the late 1960's. **********His familiarity with secret data was also cited by Tass, the Government press agency, earlier this year when it disclosed an official decision to deny Dr. Sakharov permission to go abroad. The physicist has received numerous invitations to teach and conduct research in the West. **********During his time in Gorky, Dr. Sakharov has suffered from an old heart ailment, possibly aggravated by a hunger strike he undertook with his wife in 1981 in a bid to win approval for the emigration of his daughter-in-law to the United States. The bid succeeded, and the young woman now lives in Boston with her husband. **********Mr. Ruben said that, apart from being confined to the city of Gorky, Dr. Sakharov lived ''a normal life'' and was able to continue his research. The official also referred to medical treatment that he said the physicist was receiving. **********''The Soviet doctors are taking all necessary measures to restore his health,'' he said.

Elgort that began at Young & Rubicam, where as a team they first won wide attention as creators of the ''Give a damn'' campaign for the New York Urban Coalition and the advertising that helped put John V. Lindsay in City Hall. **********Mr. Isidore's two former partners, Mr. Lefkowitz, the art director, and Mr. Elgort, who is a copywriter like Mr. Isidore, are joining Wells, Rich, Greene as group creative directors. **********The Isidore Lefkowitz Elgort agency, though, will remain a subsidiary of Della Femina, Travisano & Partners, as it has been since 1979. But some of the accounts that had been there are now being served by the 15 employees at Isidore & Paulson in its space at 485 Madison Avenue. **********Those accounts, which Mr. Isidore thinks will be billing $11 million by year's end, are the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, KYW News Radio in Philadelphia and the First National Bank of Chicago, for which it is doing a special project. **********Additionally there is a client that cannot for the moment be named. And it was on this assignment that Mr. Isidore and Mr. Paulson, both 50 years old, test-marketed a partnership. They found, they reported in a joint interview yesterday, that they work well together. **********Actually, the two - brought together by a mutual acquaintance -had been having frequent conversations since December. The initial concept was that Mr. Paulson would join I.L.E. and supply the marketing muscle that had been missing from the beginning in 1973. **********That missing ingredient, Mr. Isidore says now, is what kept his old agency from making it. Despite its promise and good press, the shop never really did make the big time. **********Asked about this yesterday, he said: ''We didn't have an adequate defense against the big agencies. They have the marketing strength that small agencies can't respond to. Now we can offer an unusual combination of both.'' **********Mr. Paulson, who is president and chief executive of the new agency, while Mr. Isidore is chairman and creative director, had worked on Procter & Gamble business for 20 years, most of that time at Compton Advertising. When he joined D.D.B. in 1977 as a senior vice president-managing director, and when he was later named president of the New York operation, there were those who thought that D.D.B., renowned for all its traditional creative strengths, was trying to bolster up its marketing side. **********Mr. Paulson, a former Navy lieutenant, graduated from Ohio State and from the Wharton School, where Compton recruited him.  His new partner is a Rutgers graduate who worked at Rumrill-Hoyt before joining Y.& R. In 12 years there, he rose to copy chief.  When he and his two associates left Young & Rubicam in 1971, their first step was Lois Holland Callaway, where Mr. Isidore was president under George Lois, the chairman. **********The three left when they decided they knew how to run their own agency.  Mr. Isidore maintained that his parting with Della Femina, Travisano has been amicable.

So much so that she chose not to follow in the footsteps of her late father, who was a lawyer, when she graduated from Harvard Law School last June. Her desire to combine work with pleasure led to the concept of Ultrasport, which was born during a phone conversation with Karen B.

She turned to individual sports and specialized for a while in cycle racing. In 1979, she combined her skills and was the only woman to finish the Iron Man  Triathlon in Hawaii, a 2.4-mile ocean swim, a 112-mile cycle race and a full marathon. **********Her interest in such endeavors goes beyond the mere physical, as her master's degree in applied physiology and anatomy from Boston University would indicate. **********She thinks deep thoughts about sports and about why such solitary pastimes as long-distance running and swimming are so popular. ''The sense of satisfaction and accomplishment may be difficult to acquire otherwise, since everyone in most fields is dependent on the opinions of others,'' she said. **********Money for the adventure is coming from an investment by Robert S. Kretschmar's Seavex, an advertising representatives firm, and from a limited partnership established for the purpose. **********Some of the money went for subscription-solicitation brochures given out at marathon meets, and for ads with a similar purpose that appeared in 13 special-interest magazines. **********The results caused some optimism at headquarters.

Instead, the active near March contract closed up 5 cents an ounce at $14.75, after ranging between $14.89 and $14.67 on New York's Commodity Exchange. **********''The silver market has reached an awkward point,'' said Martin M.  McNeill, senior vice president of the Sinclair Group, a leading metals brokerage house. ''On the one hand, one finds the market extremely bullish; on the other, everyone knows that a major correction is inevitable.'' **********But waiting for a sizable retreat has been frustrating and costly since the latest advance in silver began last November, when the price jumped above the $9 level. Subsequent countdowns began just before and after the price of the metal reached ''whole numbers,'' or full dollars, Mr. McNeill said, noting: **********''From $10 onward, as the silver price neared or passed a round number, two things happened. One, those who had paper profits decided it was prudent to convert some of them into cash, while others sold the metal short, also in expectation of a correction. Although these moves tended to blunt the advance for a few days, they didn't halt the rally. Now the countdown is on the $15 level.'' **********Silver last sold for $15 an ounce in the early days of January 1981, a year after the metal fetched a record price of $50. Because silver is still selling at a third of its record level, most speculators do not think $15 is too high a price to pay for a metal that sold for below $6 last June 21, based on the near March futures contract. **********But even they are hesitant to climb aboard a rally that has not had a significant correction in three months, Mr. McNeill added.  Howard Levine, vice president and chief metals trader at ACLI International Commodity Services Inc., said the belief that prices would rise much further was based largely on the belief that any significant economic recovery would be beneficial to silver, which is basically an industrial metal. Mr. Levine said: **********''Many buyers also view silver as an inflation hedge, believing that the only way the industrialized nations and the poorer heavily indebted countries can solve their economic and financial problems is through massive reinflation.'' **********As for the failure of gold futures to rise with silver, as has been the pattern recently, he said: ''Gold has been under some pressure because of heavy Swiss selling the past two days. Whether these sales were on behalf of producing countries has not been ascertained as yet.'' **********Yesterday, the Comex spot February gold futures closed off 10 cents an ounce at $505.70, while the active April contract slipped 50 cents, to $511. ''As is the case with silver,'' Mr. Levine said, ''gold traders are also waiting for a correction and are wary of adding to positions over the $500 level until this happens.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/12/business/little-chance-seen-of-cuts-in-deficits.html": {"writer_name": "Johathan Fuerbringer", "pub_date": "1983-09-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1007, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LITTLE CHANCE SEEN OF CUTS IN DEFICITS", "print_headline": "LITTLE CHANCE SEEN OF CUTS IN DEFICITS", "body_text": " **********With Congress returning to work Monday, the economic outlook is still good. But the chances for shrinking the Government's record budget deficits are fading. **********The curious twist is that, if the economy were getting worse, the fiscal outlook might be improving. As the situation stands now, the Government and the economy face the prospect of $200 billion annual budget deficits. **********Congressional leaders involved in the spending and tax decisions have acknowledged in interviews that the chances of raising taxes this fall or making further reductions in projected spending are very slim. **********At the same time, they say the failure to meet the tax and spending targets in the Congress's own budget outline could deal a serious blow to the budget process. Refusal to meet these objectives would be the first wholesale rejection of the budget process since the beginning of the Reagan Administration. **********While economists argue over whether the economy will suffer from this problem, nobody knows for sure what will happen. Said one Congressional economist who asked not to be named, ''There is a very strong possibility the recovery will continue through 1984 with these deficits. But the question is, should we take such a high risk?'' **********Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, the Democratic chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, said: ''I don't think we can do anything without the President's support. I believe the Administration will try to muddle through until the elections are behind them. I don't see any break in the stalemate.'' **********Today, on NBC News's television interview program, Meet the Press, Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas and the chairman of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, also spoke about a move to cut the budget deficit. ''I say this as candidly as I can,'' Mr. Dole said. ''Without the help of the President and the Speaker, it's going nowhere.'' **********There is no sign that the President, who has admantly opposed any tax increases this year or next, is going to change his mind. Last week, the Treasury's assistant secretary for tax policy, John E. Chapoton, said that even the President's standby tax increase proposal is ''dead for this year.'' That proposal asked Congress to approve this year a three-year, $145 billion package of tax increases that would become effective Oct. 1, 1985, if the deficits are still too high.  No Mandate From Constituents **********Representative James R. Jones, a Democrat and chairman of the House Budget Committee, as he was touring his Oklahoma district last week, said, ''Members are not going to come back with marching orders from their constituents to cut spending and raise taxes.'' **********Mr. Jones said that as of now he does not expect Congress will raise the $73 billion in taxes over three years or cut the $12 billion in spending called for in the budget resolution that Congress approved in June. ''We are going to try to dispense our obligations,'' he said of his committee. ''But trying and succeeding are very different things.'' **********The first signal of the inability of Congress to meet the requirements of the budget resolution is expected to come by Sept. 23, the deadline for committees in the House and the Senate to send their budget committees' proposals for tax increases and spending reductions. **********''I don't see how we can'' meet the deadline, said Mr. Rostenkowski, whose committee must propose the tax increases. Some staff aides in the House and the Senate expect the first move to be an extension of the deadline, but they think this will just delay the inevitable. **********Representative Leon E. Panetta, a Democrat from California and a member of the House Budget Committee, noted that ''It's a harmful blow for the budget process.'' **********If, for example, the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee refused to propose the tax increases called for in the budget resolution, the committees could bring their own proposals to the floor of the House and the Senate. But Mr. Jones and Mr. Rostenkowski acknowledged that the Democratic leadership in the House would be reluctant to take such a move because it would allow the President and other Republicans to use a vote for tax increases against the Democrats next year. **********''The leadership will have to weigh the budget process versus the political process,'' said Mr. Jones. **********In the first two years of the Reagan Administration, the prospect of large budget deficits galvanized Congress and the Administration into agreeing on additional spending reductions and tax increases. But this year there is no new momentum to work to reduce budget deficits because nothing went wrong with the economy during the summer recess.  Favorable Economic Data **********Before leaving in early August, Mr. Jones, Mr. Rostenkowski, Mr. Dole and others said it would take a sharp rise in interest rates or some other negative economic data to focus attention on the deficit and enable Congressional leaders to force the Administration into discussing both tax increases and spending reductions. **********But while interest rates began to rise some in August, they have declined slightly recently. And the data on the growing recovery are showing a vibrant, but not too strong, rebound, As a result, the stock market, taking heart, appears ready to move to another record high. **********With this deficit outlook, the pressure will fall mostly on the Federal Reserve, as it has in the past, to steer the course of the economy. Opinions differ on what will happen. **********Paul A. Volcker, the chairman of the nation's central bank, has argued that the projected deficits will keep interest rates high, especially long-term rates, which will make the recovery slower than it would otherwise be. **********In addition, he contends that large deficits will bring nearer the day when interest rates are forced high enough, by the increased competition between Government and private borrowing, to shut down the recovery."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/26/business/tandy-to-introduce-notebook-computer.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-03-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 547, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TANDY TO INTRODUCE 'NOTEBOOK' COMPUTER", "print_headline": "TANDY TO INTRODUCE 'NOTEBOOK' COMPUTER", "body_text": " **********As the latest entry in the expanding field of small computers, the Tandy Corporation will announce Tuesday a four-pound, $795 machine that is a text editor, bookkeeper, appointment calendar and telephone directory. **********Tandy calls the battery-powered device, the Model 100, an electronic notebook, largely for business executives on the road.  Analysts said yesterday that they were impressed by the machine, both because of the low price and because Tandy was bringing it to market ahead of an expected rush of Japanese competitors. **********Tandy is betting that the functions will satisfy the needs of most executives for a portable computer.  But the programs that direct the Model 100 are built into read-only memory chips. While this fixed programming reduces the cost and size of the machine, it makes it difficult to perform specialty tasks. **********Nor does the Model 100 have much memory capacity. The $795 model can store about 8,000 characters, or roughly four typewritten pages of text. For about $1,100, the company will offer a model with four times more memory. **********The Model 100 is about the size of a fat book, with a rectangular liquid crystal display screen across the top. The user can see eight lines at a time, each of them 40 characters long. **********While the keyboard feels like a typewriter, some of the more common text-editing tasks, such as moving paragraphs or deleting words, require several keystrokes. **********The most advanced feature is the telecommunications package, which will automatically dial the telephone and send and receive information from an office computer or another data base. **********''It is an interesting machine and it will do well,'' said Clive Smith, with the Yankee Group in Boston. ''Tandy's strategy is to have a product for every market and every niche.

In 1978, when the company turned out its first desktop computers, largely for hobbyists, the sale of computer equipment accounted for 2.4 percent of its store sales; by June 1982, as the company introduced more sophisticated machines, that figure rose above 30 percent. **********Tandy executives said yesterday that the company chose not to attempt to pack more memory and functions into the Model 100 in order to keep costs down. The company plans to make other read-only memories. **********Some analysts speculated that software manufacturers would soon make programs on cartridges that could plug into the Model 100.  Japanese competition in this sector is heating up. Epson has announced a similar machine, but with a smaller screen and capable of performing fewer functions.

''Mobilize all your ardor without repression.'' As he began the next line, ''Tenderness united will never be conquered,'' the audience erupted into a roar accompanied by clapping. The line was a play on the Chilean protest call, ''A people united will never be conquered,'' and they sang it over and over. **********It was an example of the growing popularity of what is called ''canto nuevo,'' or ''new song,'' a music of protest and a search for roots that reflects a political reawakening among Chilean young people. **********As in the 1960's in the United States, the stirring of young people and their music has grown here over the last two years to become a driving force behind the current protests by Chileans demanding a return to democratic rule. The protests have shaken this country, which has been ruled by General Pinochet since he overthrew the Marxist President, Salvador Allende Gossens, 10 years ago. **********Rodolfo Seguel, the jailed union leader who led two national protests in May and June, is only 29 years old. Many of the other union leaders who led copper miners in walking off their jobs two weeks ago in their first political strike against the Government were just as young. **********In recent months some university campuses have become hotbeds of protest. Teen-agers, many frustrated by the lack of jobs - unemployment now stands at a little over 20 percent - have turned at least a half dozen demonstrations into small riots over the last six months. **********Political leaders under the age of 40 are considered the untried youths of their field because political activity has been banned since General Pinochet took power. But it is these young political leaders who have been most vocal in assailing the Government in recent weeks while those who are older have for the most part been silent. **********''We watch with anguish how the existing institutions depart from our juridical history,'' 53 political leaders aged from 30 to 40 said in a statement issued last week. The institutions, the statement went on, ''make it impossible to return to an authentic democratic regime.'' Last Presidential Vote in '70 **********Roughly three million of this Andean nation's 11 million people are between the ages of 18 and 32, according to a 1981 census. They make up 40 percent of the country's eligible voters, but they have never voted in a presidential election. The last one, in 1970, was won by Mr. Allende. **********All Latin America has a history of youth-led uprisings. Student riots protesting against Mr. Allende were part of the chaos in this country that led to his overthrow. But Chilean campuses had been mostly quiet since then as the military took over the administration of both public and private universities. Many leftist student leaders were exiled, jailed or ordered by the Government to leave school. **********Most Chilean youths seemed to prefer a peaceful coexistence with the Government as they turned their attention to practicalities such as studies and jobs and, in the economic boom years of 1976 to 1981, cars and discotheques. **********But the economy is now in depression. The national income shrank 14 percent last year and unemployment soared. Many young Chileans say their political awakening came when they found they could not pay their university tuition or find jobs. **********Memories of the political chaos under Mr. Allende have also faded.  ''The Government's warnings of communism do not carry much weight with the young,'' said a Western diplomat. Youth Secretariat Established **********The Government had set out to enlist youths. The National Youth Secretariat was founded soon after General Pinochet seized power, but its attempts at political education and forming the ''Pinochet Youth Movement'' failed. The secretariat now sponsors mostly sports events. **********Some among the nation's youth support the Government. A conservative intellectual movement formed at Santiago's Catholic University in the late 1960's remains strong on some campuses.  Disenchanted with political parties, the movement calls for cooperation with the military to build a democracy in which business, labor and professional associations would largely replace parties, which have been suspended while the ban on political activity remains. **********The movement was an influence behind the economic and engineering ''whiz kids'' who took over many Government ministries after the 1973 coup. But it is becoming widely discredited as being collaborationist, and even many of the Government technocrats, now aged in their late 30's, are disillusioned. **********''When my job crosses the line to appear political, I quit,'' said a young, highly placed economic official. Music Has Greatest Impact **********The political protest began to emerge when young painters, poets and playwrights tested the limits of Government censorship, which bans anything the Government construes as political. But it is music that has the greatest impact because of its popular access. **********Adherents define canto nuevo as an attitude toward life. ''It is essentially humanist,'' Ricardo Garcia, an impressario and record producer, said in an interview. Mr. Garcia is considered the father of the music because his company produces most of the songs and coined the term for it. **********Its styles include hard rock, Andean Indian tunes and folk songs.  Themes range through the current economic problems, love, hometowns, humorous foibles and the arms race. Political topics usually enter the songs in the form of double-entendres. **********Canto nuevo is closely linked with similar music that has become popular among youths under the military Governments in nearby Argentina and Uruguay as well as mostly apolitical music out of Cuba.  Slant Is Often Leftist **********Its enthusiasts here include soldiers and officials, but it is young professionals and intellectuals who are quickly coming to dominate the music and give it a protest, often leftist, slant. Many self-exiled singers, such as Mr. Grondona, have been returning to add leadership. **********The Government has responded by prohibiting festivals of the music, limiting the amount of time it can be performed on television, and, last year, jailing Mr. Garcia, the record producer, for a week for releasing a song by an exiled singer. **********But the music nonetheless continues to be heard increasingly, often on private radio stations and widely circulated tapes, in church recitals and in the drafty, backstreet cafes such as the one here where young people huddled over hot wine into the early morning hours. **********''We're witnessing our time,'' Pato Valdivia, a popular 28-year-old singer said in an interview.

The idea was good, but not good enough to save its telegraph business, and the company soon merged with Western Union. **********The idea, however, lived on. Today, after many lean years, the singing telegram has re-emerged as a multimillion-dollar business offered through a network of musical competitors - which typically charge $25 to $100 per delivery. And a substantial peripheral business in cookie-grams, balloon-grams, stripper-grams and the like has also sprung up. **********''In the first 30 years or so it was never done right - it really was not entertainment,'' observed Robert J. Jasper, who says ''starvation'' brought him to found a singing telegram company, Western Onion, four years ago. ''It was only in the last few years that companies like mine all over the country have made it entertainment. I call it vaudeville to go.'' **********But the singing telegram business has long had a touch of vaudeville. On July 28, 1933, a Western Union operator named Lucille Lipps sang ''Happy Birthday'' to Rudy Vallee. Mr. Vallee later recalled the episode as ''a phony stunt by the publicity people,'' although Western Union recalls it as the first singing telegram. **********Despite initial criticism by Western Union executives concerned with the propriety of the medium, the company's messengers delivered musical greetings in person until World War II. Singing by phone operators was resumed after the war, but faced declining popularity until Western Union dropped the service in 1974. **********Singing telegrams have seen a rebirth of sorts in the last decade.  Two New York companies, Music Box Musical Messages and Garrett-Gram, revived the idea in 1973, adding catchy lyrics and a Broadway-style delivery. The idea caught on fast, and dozens of companies entered the field. Even Western Union, which dropped its own service in 1974, has jumped back in, delivering about 50 orders a day via Music Box.  ''Times change and we discovered that there is a market,'' said Donald Detcher, a Western Union spokesman. ''There are novelties and fads of all sorts and all of a sudden they reappear. We simply respond to the public's demand to communicate.'' **********Some say the musical message boom peaked two or three years ago, but business today is still strong. Singing telegram operations with names like Fleeting Greetings, Otter Conspiracy and Telebelles dot the Yellow Pages in most major cities, and at least four companies deliver greetings nationwide. Selling Franchises **********The giant in the field, a Las Vegas, Nev., company called Eastern Onion, claims sales of more than $8 million a year from novelty telegrams of all kinds - or roughly 180,000 messages. It has sold 42 franchises at $15,000 to $25,000 apiece, plus 5 percent of revenues, and business ''is getting better and better,'' according to Jim Flatt, its president. **********The industry is not universally untroubled, however. One of the largest services, National Singing Telegrams Ltd., which also was once named Western Onion, dropped out of business last year, as have many smaller companies. And Mr. Jasper's Western Onion, a Spokane, Wash., service that specializes in tutu-bedecked serenaders, is being sued by Western Union over its name. **********More important, the business is crowded - perhaps overcrowded.  ''There must be thousands of really small singing telegram groups all over the country,'' said Mr. Flatt of Eastern Onion. ''You've got to freshen up your ideas all the time to stay in.'' **********Dick Miller, a former theatrical agent who founded Garrett-Gram in 1972, concurred. ''Everyone all over is doing singing telegrams, but a lot of them have gone out of business,'' he said. ''Three or four years ago it became more a trend than anything else, and now the trend is curbing back to reality. Because of the bad economy, people are sending singing telegrams carefully.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/26/business/company-reports-wometco-enterprises-inc-n.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-04-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 39, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "** Company Reports ** WOMETCO ENTERPRISES INC (N)", "print_headline": "** Company Reports ** WOMETCO ENTERPRISES INC (N)", "body_text": " **********Qtr to March 26 1983 1982 Revenue 106,843,000 103,938,000 Net inc 4,662,000 b5,174,000 Share earns .27 .30 b-Includes a gain of 777,000 from the sale of real estate.

Without those agreements, foreign banks have been unwilling for the past week to pay out new loans needed by Argentina to keep up with interest payments. More than $500 million in loans have been held up. **********The local judge, Federico Pinto Kramer of Rio Gallegos, a Patagonian city 1,300 miles south of here, also appeared to soften his stand. **********Banker Held for Two Days **********The judge released from jail Julio Gonzalez del Solar, the president of the central bank, who had been detained since Monday for questioning about a refinancing contract that the judge considered a violation of national sovereignty. Nevertheless, the judge said, the investigation of Mr. Gonzalez del Solar would continue. **********Foreign banks have frozen all fresh credits to Argentina since Judge Pinto Kramer ruled on Sept. 24 that planned refinancing agreements on much of the nation's $40 billion in foreign debt violated ''national sovereignty'' by giving New York State courts some jurisdiction over payment disputes. **********He specifically cited the refinancing of $200 million owed by Aerolineas Argentinas, the state airline. That contract was considered a model for agreements to refinance $5.5 billion in debts of other state entities. **********A Standard Clause **********The clause permitting jurisdiction to courts in New York, where many major bank lenders are situated, is standard in many international loan agreements. **********The judge's objections reflected the rising public criticism of the refinancing efforts, particularly the jurisdiction clauses, which have been publicly characterized as an affront to Argentina's sovereignty. **********Nevertheless, there has been no call for repudiation of the foreign debt. The major party candidates in the national election, scheduled for Oct. 30 and the first in a decade, have called for a postponement of negotiations until a civilian government takes office in January, in hopes of improving repayment terms. But they have also asserted that the debts would be repaid. **********The first signs of a solution to the cur rent refinancing crisis came early today when Enrique Billote, head of the appeals court in the Patagonian city of Comodoro Rivadavia, took jurisdiction of the case from Judge Pinto Kramer and told reporters that he considered the Government's appeal of the judge's ruling ''well founded.''

''But the whole affair raises questions about the risk of lending to this country.'' **********For more than a week, according to foreign bankers and economic officials, Argentina has been on the brink of default because it has not kept up with interest payments on the $40 billion debt, the world's third largest. Top officials here of American banks said today that the arrears had risen to several hundred million dollars. **********Earlier Steps by Central Bank **********Last Friday, the central bank blocked the purchasing of dollars to take out of the country, a move intended to preserve foreign reserves. These have dwindled to $200 million, according to foreign diplomats, from more than $600 million a month ago. **********Today, the bank also ordered commercial banks to turn over dollars they receive in payment for Argentine exports. The banks otherwise could use the dollars to cover withdrawals from dollar accounts held in Argentine banks. **********Adding to the crisis atmosphere, many Argentines jammed banks today to try to make withdrawals from their dollar accounts, which are allowed only for certain savings deposits, for fear deposits might be nationalized. **********Diplomatic sourcess said there was as much as $700 million deposited in dollars in Argentine banks, although bankers said the amount has been dropping steadily. **********Depositors standing in lines outside banks said today that they feared the Government would nationalize dollar deposits altogether and convert them to pesos, as Mexico did in a similar crisis earlier this year. **********Mr. Gonzalez del Solar, the central bank president, had been held at Judge Pinto Kramer's ''disposition'' in Rio Gallegos, where he was flown after being taken into custody on Monday as he returned from a meeting in Washington of the International Monetary Fund. **********Charges May Be Filed **********The judge said today that he was considering charging the banker with ''prejudicing'' national interests in approving the debt contracts. The charge is one step below treason and conviction carries a jail sentence of up to 20 years. **********Judge Pinto Kramer said he had interrogated the banker this morning. **********''We cannot put the sovereignty of Argentina below the laws of New York State,'' the judge said. **********The judge, who is 39 years old, said he had been coming ''under pressure from all sides,'' receiving telephone calls and visits from officials, businessmen and politicians pressing him to either release or prosecute the bank president, depending on the caller's position in the growing political dispute here over the foreign debt. **********Judge Pinto Kramer said he would not be railroaded in his investigation. **********''I feel peaceful with myself,'' he said, ''because I know I am acting under the guidance of the law. I don't have anything to do with politics.'' **********As for Mr. Gonzalez del Solar, 67, a Harvard University graduate who has held top economic positions in many governments and in the International Monetary Fund, he spent last night in the Rio Gallegos jail, officials said.

''The realignment was strictly an internal European affair. The important issue for the U.S. is the overvaluation of the dollar in relation to the yen.'' **********More fundamentally, however, analysts said the turmoil in Europe's foreign-exchange markets in the last few days highlighted a basic weakness in the world economy: failure of the major industrial nations to coordinate their economic policies, particularly their monetary policies.Focus on Monetary Growth **********''The European Monetary System is a fundamentally flawed idea,'' declared Allan H. Meltzer, professor of economics at Carnegie-Mellon University and a prominent monetarist. ''It tries to fix foreign exchange rates without fixing monetary growth rates. It should be the reverse.'' Most economists - monetarist and nonmonetarist alike - agree that some policy coordination is necessary before currency stabilization can be achieved. **********On the broader economic issue, economists said unstable currency values had bred an uncertainty that slowed world trade last year for the second consecutive year, aggravating the world recession. **********According to the secretariat of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the physical volume of goods moving in international commerce fell 2 percent last year, while their dollar value was down 6 percent amid a decline in oil prices. **********''The uncertainty in the exchange markets is without parallel,'' said Eugene A. Birnbaum, a private economic consultant in New York.Paris-Bonn Tension Is Noted **********Mr. Birnbaum has long advocated returning to a fixed, but adjustable, system of foreign-exchange rates like the one set up at Bretton Woods, N.H., in 1944. That system collapsed in the early 1970's. **********The worldwide problem of monetary coordination and currency instability, economists said, was illustrated in the tension between France and West Germany this weekend. **********The French money supply, according to data published by the International Monetary Fund, grew at a rate of about 14 percent in 1981 and 1982 under the Government of President Francois Mitterrand. Many economists believe that this rapid monetary growth contributed to inflation in France. **********By comparison, the West Germans - under the administrations of both Helmut Schmidt and Helmut Kohl -have followed a much tighter monetary policy and thus have a much lower inflation rate and lower interest rates. West Germany's money supply rose at an average rate of less than 2 percent over the last two years, and inflation has averaged 5.25 percent.Comparison of Interest Rates **********Short-term interest rates in France have been averaging slightly over 13 percent this month, while those in West Germany were less than 6 percent. **********The 5.5 percent increase in the value of the mark and the 2.5 percent cut in the value of the French franc announced yesterday were intended to compensate for the price disparities that had developed because of the differing trends in the two countries. **********Horst Duisberg, who oversees foreign-exchange trading for the European-American Bank, said the effect of the currency realignment would depend a great deal on how much Mr. Mitterrand was willing to do to slow inflation in France. **********''We'll know more on Wednesday,'' Mr. Duisberg said, ''after Mitterrand makes his announcement. He has to do some unpopular things - raise taxes, cut imports and get inflation down.''Proposal for a 3-Nation Link **********Professor Meltzer has proposed that the central banks and governments of the United States, West Germany and Japan link their monetary policies in such a way as to eliminate inflation gradually. **********''Other countries that wish to do so could make a similar commitment,'' he said, ''or could fix their exchange rates in relation to one of the three currencies or could remain outside the system.'' **********He argued that the proposal would help reduce uncertainty and increase stability in a number of ways.

Traders also noted that the Federal Reserve' willingness to arrange $2 billion of temporary purchases of Treasury securities for a customer account, when federal funds were trading at 9 1/4 percent, was a sign that the central bank was not trying to make reserves scarcer in the system. **********''The lower trend in the funds rate, coupled with the exectuion of customer repos when Fed funds were in the 9 1/4 percent area has erased some of the negative feeling in the marketplace about the current Fed policy stance,'' analysts at Merrill Lynch Economics Inc. said in commentary published daily. **********Small Steps Seen **********While economists disagree about whether the Fed will ease or tighten monetary policy, they agree that the adjustment is likely to come in small steps. Until there are clearer signs that Fed policy is being adjusted, many market participants are focusing on the heavy supply of Treasury issues between now and year-end. **********Besides the $8 billion of two-year notes to be sold today at a yield estimated at just over 10 1/2 percent, the Treasury announced yesterday plans to sell, on Nov. 29, $6 billion of notes due in five-years, two months. **********At yesterday's auction of Treasury bills, rates were slightly higher than a week ago, as the three-month issue averaged 8.81 percent, up from 8.78 percent, while the six-month issue averaged 8.96 percent, up from 8.91 percent. In advance of tomorrow's auction of one-year bills, the outstanding one-year bill was bid at a rate of 9.06 percent. **********In the long bond market, the bellwether 12 percent Treasury issue due in 2013 was offered at 102 15/32, up 7/ 32, to yield 11.69 percent. **********'Exerting Upward Pressure' **********Government securities dealers and economists are not the only ones who point to heavy sales by the Treasury as a reason for high and rising interest rates. The summary of the minutes of the Oct. 4 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee said that some members of the committee believed ''the Treasury's large borrowing needs were already exerting upward pressure on interest rates and that greater pressure could be expected if relatively large Treasury credit demands continued and were augmented by growing business demands for a substantial amount of external funds.'' **********The failure of Congress to pass the tax bill last week means that current law will not allow issuance of tax-exempt, single-family mortgage revenue bonds after Dec. 31. Investment bankers said yesterday that a flood of such issues is unlikely because many states have already issued their allotment of bonds, and because authorization for more single-family mortgage bond financings is expected to be one of the first items on the agenda when Congress reconvenes. **********Elsewhere in the tax-exempt market, a $40 million issue of pollution control revenue bonds issued by the New Hampshire Industrial Development Authority on behalf of the Public Service Company of New Hampshire was repriced to raise yields slightly. The bonds, which are not rated, carry some of the highest yields in the tax-exempt market, ranging from 12 1/4 percent for bonds due in 1988 to 13 3/4 percent in 2003. **********Investor Concern **********The high yields on the issue reflect investor concern about the financial health of the Public Service Company of New Hampshire, which will use proceeds to financing pollution control facilities for the Seabrook nuclear power project. Last week, the investor owned utility sold $100 million of 15 percent bonds due in 2003 which were offered at a price of 96.93 to yield 15.50 percent. The company's bonds carried speculative grade ratings of Ba-3 from Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Bx from the Standard & Poor's Corporation. **********A recent study by analysts at Shearson/American Express Inc. of nuclear power plants in which municipally owned utilities are involved noted that the Seabrook project has an above average rating from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, but there a great deal of uncertainty about cost and future financing. The most recent estimates by New Hampshire officials is that the two Seabrook units could cost more than $8 billion, making it the most expensive nuclear plant under construction, measured by cost per kilowatt. **********Following are results of yesterday's auctions of new three- and six- month Treasury bills: (000 omitted in dollar figures) Average Price **********Both these issues are dated Nov. 25.

His remarks confirmed earlier press reports from the Bekaa that guerrillas in the September Martyrs Battalion had rebelled and attacked a P.L.O. clinic at Taalbaya, about 35 miles east of here. A spokesman for Mr. Arafat said the clinic had eventually been recaptured by forces loyal to the P.L.O. chairman. **********The battalion derives its name from the month in 1970 when Palestinian guerrillas in Jordan fought King Hussein's army. The guerrillas were eventually forced to leave Jordan. **********A Lebanese newspaper, As Safir, reported today that pro-Arafat guerrillas tried but failed Friday night to seize a P.L.O. supply office in Damascus. **********The newspaper, known for close contacts with the guerrillas, said the attackers had withdrawn after two of them were wounded in the attempt. **********The target was one of six guerrilla supply centers captured by the rebels shortly after the conflict broke out.  At the military level, the rebellion is led by Col. Abu Musa, the deputy commander of the P.L.O.'s operations room. Seven other senior officers have joined his ranks. **********At the political level, the opposition to Mr. Arafat's 18-year-old leadership of Al Fatah is led by Abu Saleh, one of the group's top 10 figures. **********Mr. Abu Saleh, who is known for his leftist leanings, and his support for Syria, Libya and the Soviet Union, has set up an office in Damascus that speaks for the rebels. **********The mutiny was touched off May 17 by anger over Mr. Arafat's reorganization of the P.L.O.'s military command.  Other P.L.O. leaders later denounced Mr. Arafat's policy toward Israel and an overall Middle East settlement, accusing him of what Col. Abu Musa described as ''capitulating to American designs.'' **********The 44-year-old colonel has his headquarters in Al Manara, a small village in eastern Lebanon where a battalion of Al Fatah is stationed. **********There are about 6,000 Palestinian guerrillas in the Bekaa, and about 4,000 in northern Lebanon.

In that period the Guatemalan Government, headed by Gen.  Romeo Lucas Garcia, was severely criticized by the United States for human rights abuses. **********After the hearing Larry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a group that has generally opposed Reagan Administration policies in Central America, said: ''It is disgraceful that this nomination didn't get the close scrutiny that it deserves.  The issue at stake is Stone's integrity. He says he worked to improve Guatemala's human rights performance.

Soviet Sees Two U.S. Objectives **********The Soviet press agency, in commenting on President Reagan's latest proposals on strategic arms limitation, said the plan to raise the proposed limit on missiles from 850 to possibly 1,200, according to Administration officials, while retaining the ceiling of 5,000 nuclear warheads for each side was intended to accomplish two goals. **********The first is to facilitate the deployment of two new types of missiles, one of them the MX, and the second is to force the Soviet Union to reduce its force of land-based missiles, which Tass called the backbone of the Soviet arsenal. **********The Soviet Union now has 2,350 strategic, or long-range, missiles, based on land and on submarines, and the United States has 1,600.  Because of the larger number of multiple warheads on American missiles, there is a rough balance in warheads, at 7,500 each. **********Tass said that Mr. Reagan's statement that he was adjusting his proposals to introduce new flexibility into the Geneva talks was ''mere words, and nothing more.'' **********''No desire to achieve a mutually acceptable accord, mentioned by the President, is in sight'' the agency said. ''On the contrary, his statement reveals something quite different - the aspiration to undermine by any means the principle of equality and equal security of the sides on which rested the talks on SALT I and SALT II.'' **********The reference was to the first and second strategic arms limitation agreements, the latter signed by President Carter but not approved by the Senate after the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.  The Tass commentary lacked the authority of an official government statement, but was considered to be an accurate reflection of the Kremlin's views. **********Tass said Mr. Reagan had ignored the proposals put forward by the Soviet Union, which include a 25 percent reduction in all nuclear weapons carriers, including missiles and bombers, and a ban on longrange cruise missiles. **********The Soviet Union has also proposed a freeze on existing arsenals while the talks continue, with an agreement eventually banning all new types of weapons and technological improvements to existing arsenals. Soviet Worried by Two Aspects **********Soviet assessments of the United States proposals have focused on two aspects. The Russians consider deep cuts in the number of missile launchers and a separate limit on land-based launchers an effort to emasculate their nuclear forces, two-thirds of which are land-based.  They also feel that the United States, by concentrating on missiles and excluding other types of weapons, is attempting to retain the freedom to deploy cruise missiles, the B-1 bomber and other advanced systems. **********The Tass commentary contended that Mr. Reagan, though relaxing the ceiling on launchers, still sought to limit Soviet land-based missiles. **********Tass said the President's latest offer was the result of a commitment to Congress to intensify efforts at Geneva in return for support for his plan to deploy 100 MX missiles. **********The other new type of missile to which Tass alluded appeared to be the Midgetman, a proposed small single-warhead mobile missile whose deployment over the next decade was urged by the arms commission that devised the plan to deploy an initial battery of MX missiles in existing silos."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/02/world/reagan-urges-us-investors-to-back-latin-america-policy.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-06-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 95, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Reagan Urges U.S. Investors To Back Latin America Policy", "print_headline": "Reagan Urges U.S. Investors To Back Latin America Policy", "body_text": " **********President Reagan, denying that there had been any change in his policy in the Central American nations, today urged corporate investors to support his program. **********''They must have our help in stemming that violence so that you can go forward with investment,'' the President said, speaking at the White House to the Council of the Americas, a business group. **********''It is a pleasure to speak to a group that does not need to be convinced of Latin America's vital importance to the United States,'' Mr. Reagan declared."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/08/world/bonn-voting-second-look-news-analysis.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-03-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 860, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "News Analysis", "print_headline": "BONN VOTING: SECOND LOOK; News Analysis", "body_text": " **********Despite Sunday's electoral victory by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic-led coalition, Mr. Kohl and many Western diplomats here are talking in terms that suggest that the Reagan Administration should not interpret that victory as an openended or unqualified mandate to station new intermediate-range missiles in West Germany. **********Though the missile issue played a central role in the campaign, and served as a political shorthand for talking about the Western alliance and the United States, all parties agreed in their electoral post-mortems that Mr. Kohl won because many voters believed his coalition could pull West Germany out of its deepest economic trough since the war. **********''I'm afraid there will be a lot of misreading of the whole thing,'' a well-placed Western diplomat said today, with an eye on Washington. ''This just wasn't an election about stationing missiles.'' **********'This Hope Was Decisive' **********At a subdued news conference today, the Chancellor plainly linked the Christian Democrats' 48.8 percent share of the vote and the party's impressive in roads into working-class areas like the Ruhr to awakened hopes that his coalition could turn the economy around.  ''This hope was decisive for the election,'' Mr. Kohl said. **********Mr. Kohl twice turned aside suggestions that he had won a mandate to deploy 108 Pershing 2 and 96 cruise, or low-flying, missiles in West Germany. Instead, as he has throughout the campaign, he expressed the hope that the Christian Democrats' convincing victory would persuade the Soviet Union to reach an agreement with the United States at the Geneva medium-range missile talks. **********The goal of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization at Geneva, he said, was not ''all or nothing'' - a catch phrase the Chancellor uses to distance himself from the Reagan Administration's ''zero option'' for abolishing all medium-range missiles in East and West. **********Mr. Kohl has said in public and private that if there is no choice - if the Geneva talks remain blocked - he will accept the missiles.  But there is no enthusiasm for this option, and he is now widely expected to press the Reagan Administration, without acrimony or publicity, to reach a compromise in Geneva. The Greens Promise Resistance **********Missile deployment at the end of this year raises some nasty scenarios. Having won 27 seats in Parliament, the Green Party, a coalition of pacifists and environmentalists, promised today to spearhead popular resistance to the new weapons. **********Moreover, in the wake of their defeat, the Social Democrats may well continue their leftward course on security issues, which so far has fallen short of outright opposition to the missiles. ''We could come to a situation in which we reject stationing,'' Karsten Voigt, the party's security spokesman, said today. **********Running up their second-best totals since West Germany held its first national elections in 1949, the Christian Democrats ended their reputation as a predominantly southern, Roman Catholic party. They outpolled the opposition Social Democrats in every region except the small city-states of Bremen and Hamburg. **********Even in North Rhine-Westphalia, where the Ruhr Basin steel industry is rooted and where the Social Democrats hold an absolute majority in the state legislature, Mr. Kohl's conservatives emerged as the biggest party. The victors' private polls showed that a majority of women and skilled workers voted for the Christian Democrats. End of 2 Decades of Growth **********The Social Democrats, by contrast, fell from the 42.9 percent of the vote that they won under Chancellor Helmut Schmidt in 1980 to 38.2 percent. This undid two decades of steady growth, throwing the party back to the level of 1961 when it took 36.2 percent of the vote in a losing struggle against Chancellor Konrad Adenauer. **********The ingredients of defeat included Mr. Kohl's insistent argument that 13 years of Social Democratic rule, which ended last autumn, were responsible for record unemployment and state debt. Many bluecollar workers seemed to feel that their jobs would be safer under the Christian Democrats. **********According to some politicians today, the Social Democrats and their candidate, Hans-Jochen Vogel, also alienated traditional working-class constituents by flirting with the Green Party, which favors no-growth, small-is-beautiful economic models. Mr. Vogel indicated that he would accept Green backing in Parliament to become Chancellor. Kohl Tapped Traditional Values **********While the Social Democrats' campaign was crafted by leftist intellectuals in Bonn who tried to tap a reservoir of West German patriotism, Mr. Kohl appealed to traditional middle-class values of hard work, savings and sacrifice and tried to evoke the pioneering spirit that helped reconstruct the country after the war. **********Mr. Kohl, who for a decade has been his party's leader, suffers a condescending press in Bonn, where he is portrayed as unsophisticated, rambling in speech and lacking any specific competence except politics. But the Chancellor, who considers himself Mr. Adenauer's spiritual heir, evidently connected with West Germany's broad middle class. **********A West German journalist, musing today over the extent of Mr.  Kohl's personal triumph, said, ''We have regularly underestimated him.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/18/business/american-pad-paper-co-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-feb-28.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-03-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 56, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AMERICAN PAD & PAPER (CO) reports earnings for Qtr to Feb 28", "print_headline": "AMERICAN PAD & PAPER (CO) reports earnings for Qtr to Feb 28", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/16/jobs/middle-east-prospects-room-for-specialists.html": {"writer_name": "Judith Miller", "pub_date": "1983-10-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1847, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Job Market", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MIDDLE EAST PROSPECTS: ROOM FOR SPECIALISTS", "print_headline": "MIDDLE EAST PROSPECTS: ROOM FOR SPECIALISTS", "body_text": " **********CAIRO FOR decades, the Middle East has held a special allure for Westerners, with visions of Arabian sands, colorful Bedouins and romantic desert oases. But in the last 10 years, the nature of the enticement has been replaced by prospects of easy money in sheikdoms swimming in oil. Tens of thousands of Americans have come to the Arab world to work since 1973, when the price of oil began skyrocketing. **********Today the picture is changing again because an oil glut has generated economic contractions in the Arab oil states. Fewer large new contracts are being awarded; projects under way are being scaled back; Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, on paper, are running budget deficits. **********Nonetheless, job prospects for Americans - generally men - with special skills are still good, though more limited than before, according to private business representatives and American Embassy officials in Arab countries where Americans have traditionally worked. There are still a lot of foreign companies and expatriates doing business in the region, but there is definitely less growth, said Theodore A. Rosen, counselor for commercial affairs at the United States Embassy in Cairo. **********Mr. Rosen and other experts agree that job opportunities for younger Americans, especially those just out of college without work experience, are fewer. ''Those starry-eyed kids wandering around Turkey, Egypt and in North African and other easily accessible Arab countries hoping to find a good job are definitely taking a risk,'' Mr. Rosen said. Employers who are looking for younger people, he added, seem to prefer adventurous types who have knocked around the region a little and know how things work because they have made their own way. **********He urged those coming to the area without a firm job prospect to save enough money to get home in case they do not succeed. Have that round-trip ticket or a credit card ready, he counseled. **********A knowledge of Arabic is preferable, and in some jobs it is essential. This appears to be less important in a country like Egypt than in the Persian Gulf states. **********Some places where Americans have traditionally worked are no longer attractive, for political reasons or because of armed conflicts taking place within their borders. Lebanon, Iran, Iraq and Libya fall into this category. Syria is also not amenable to American workers. **********Analysts say that there are basically two categories of Arab countries in which Americans now work: accessible and restrictive. The distinction is tricky, because virtually all Arab states require entry visas, work permits and letters of sponsorship to work. But in accessible countries, such as Egypt, Turkey, Jordan and several in North Africa, it is still possible to enter without a job and look for one. **********In restrictive countries like Saudi Arabia and most of the gulf states, a firm job offer is required for entry. In addition, an American who comes to work in Saudi Arabia, officials say, must come alone. His family is permitted to follow three to six months later. **********Saudi Arabia and the gulf states, in particular, are under intense pressure to reduce the number of expatriates working in their countries. As a result, companies in the Arab world that are still hiring seek only foreigners with special skills and a lot of experience. **********For example, there is still a reasonably good market in Bahrain for American professionals with banking experience, according to George T. Boutin, American commercial attache in Manama, the capital. But Bahrain, like most of the the gulf states, is pursuing a campaign to hire more of its own nationals for mid-level positions. **********Kuwait is still recruiting bankers and other professionals such as investment analysts and computer technicians. But it, too, has drastically reduced spending, and Western diplomats report that some of the contracts awarded to the more than 1,000 Americans working in Kuwait are not being renewed, especially in the oil sector. **********THE same is true in Qatar, where about 200 Americans work. Talent is still sought, but in specialized areas, such as medicine and nursing. **********The largest American work force in the Arab world is in Saudi Arabia, where, according to embassy figures, some 65,000 Americans live. Expertise in agriculture is high on Saudi Arabia's wish list; the kingdom is actively encouraging investments in that field, and seeking people with foreign expertise to help the country become self-sufficient in food production. But company representatives say many Americans who have been working in Arabia are being replaced by South Korean and other foreign workers. **********The situation is the same in the United Arab Emirates, said one embassy official. Americans who demand at least a $50,000 salary, medical costs, school tuitions, a villa, home leave each year and other benefits are simply pricing themselves out of the market, he said. In the Emirates, the official said, the five American hotel chains employ almost no American managers or professional staff members.  In Israel, on the other hand, the job market seems somewhat more congenial to Americans. Israeli employment experts say, for example, that the country is eagerly seeking workers in two fields: engineering and computers. **********According to Michael Ziv, head of the overseas department of the Labor Ministry's bureau for the placement of professionals, the bureau receives about five job offers for every electrical engineer it handles, and about 10 offers for every computer professional. Mr. Ziv said the rapid growth of all technical professions in Israel had created such an enormous demand for industrial, electrical and chemical engineers, software developers, programmers and systems analysts, that ''in many places the development may have to stop if there is no increase in manpower.'' **********Newspaper articles in recent months have held that the country will need 5,000 engineers that it does not now have in the coming decades for the two main national projects on the drawing board: a canal between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea, and the Lavi air force jet. **********The Israeli economy has a fairly healthy demand for several of the service professions, notably nurses and dentists, but a Labor Ministry official cautioned that Israel is primarily interested in giving jobs to Jews willing to settle there. The Israeli economy has a demand for several of the service professions, notably nurses and dentists, but Olga Rachmilevich, director of absorption for the Association of Americans and Canadians in Israel, said that American-trained accountants and bookkeepers generally had no problem finding jobs, and that the developing Israeli advertising industry had created some new demand for graphics and layout personnel. **********Skilled labor carries a high premium in Israel. Mrs. Rachmilevich said Israel even hired precision-instrument operators on a contractual basis from Britain. And unskilled labor, from hotel to construction workers, is also in demand.  Those interested in working in Israel should apply to the Jewish Agency, which coordinates immigration to Israel. Its headquarters is in New York City, with offices around the country. **********Jewish Americans are likely to encounter special scrutiny when they apply for jobs in Arab countries, though Arab governments assert that they are seeking only to keep what they term Zionists, not Jews, from working within their borders. **********Saudi Arabia and the gulf states strongly prefer male workers, no matter what the skill. In fact, male Arab, Moslem, Arabic- speaking workers have top priority virtually everywhere in the region. Women are at the bottom of the job spectrum in Arab countries, according to one gulf-based official who, like most when asked about jobs for women, did not want to be identified. **********Western women, even single, live and work in almost every country in the Arab world, but their numbers are few. Egypt appears to be the most receptive to female workers, but even here local resentment of foreign women supervisors is sometimes strong, officials and business people agree. **********Black Americans, business people say, do not seem to encounter any special problems working in the area, but like women, they are few in number. **********In general, Americans who want to work in the Arab world should seek such jobs in the United States. The Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, for example, recruits mainly in Texas. The same is true of the American University in Cairo, which has an office in Manhattan. Some oil companies send workers from Houston almost directly to oil rigs in the gulf. **********Virtually all the professionals here, whether they are engineers, managers or teachers, find their jobs in the United States, according to Ronald G. Wolfe, director of America-Mideast Educational and Training Services Inc., in Cairo. If they are hired locally, they will probably receive a local salary, which is shockingly low for some Americans, Mr. Wolfe added.  Job-seekers in the Middle East should be prepared for great competition. The rector of Gulf University in Bahrain told friends recently that he had received about 1,000 job applications for each opening. The intensity of the competition has helped drive down salaries for expatriate workers. Mr. Wolfe, for example, said he recently hired an assistant from the United States for $7,000 a year. The applicant agreed to pay her own air fare to Egypt. **********If you work here, you've got to read the contract carefully, Mr. Rosen of the United States Embassy warned. Living, including housing, in the Middle East is much more expensive than some people think. There are some exotic diseases in the region, and if you get sick, you might have to be flown to Europe. An $80,000-a-year salary in Saudi Arabia sounds good, but it might not be nearly as attractive if you have to pay $30,000 to $60,000 a year to rent housing, which he cautioned is a distinct possibility. **********But, Mr. Rosen said, there are lots of work opportunities in the Middle East for those who are persistent and patient. **********Commercial attaches, such as Theodore A. Rosen of the United States Embassy in Cairo, offer the following general advice for those seeking work in the Middle East: **********- Contact the Departments of State and Commerce in Washington and write to the embassy of the country in which you wish to work. Get from those nations' embassies a list of American companies operating in their areas, as well as information on visas and currency restrictions. **********- If there is a special business association in your area, get in touch. The Egypt- U.S. Business Council, for example, has an office at the United States Chamber of Commerce in Washington. **********- Look for work with an American company that has extensive operations in the Middle East. You may not secure an immediate posting to the region, but many companies are eager to recruit people in America who wish to work abroad. **********- Talk to people in your town or city who have worked in the Middle East. Many jobs are secured through word of mouth. **********- Read business publications and newspapers' classified sections carefully: many companies recruit in this way, not just through headhunters."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/20/business/new-oil-fever-grips-ireland.html": {"writer_name": "Barnaby Feder", "pub_date": "1983-08-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1094, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NEW OIL FEVER GRIPS IRELAND", "print_headline": "NEW OIL FEVER GRIPS IRELAND", "body_text": " **********An obsession with geology, visions of bounty, and a certain looniness - these and other unmistakable symptoms of oil fever are sweeping Ireland again. **********Three years ago, that fever was sparked by promising test drilling in deep and hostile Atlantic waters off Ireland's west coast. This time, the focus is off the south coast in the shallow, tamer Celtic Sea, where evidence is accumulating daily that the Gulf Oil Company has discovered a field that could finally bring hard- pressed Ireland into the ranks of the oil producing nations. **********''I don't want to contribute to the euphoria,'' said Edward A. Collins, the Trade and Energy Department minister responsible for oil development. ''The expert advice is that we can't reach any conclusions yet on recoverable reserves.'' **********Test Results Promising **********However, Gulf's flow and oil-quality data for the first tests and the field's location in shallow waters just 20 miles off the coast near Waterford have been such that even conservative oilmen have been saying privately they would be very surprised if the field was not exploitable. **********More important, perhaps, the find has included eye-opening results from previously untested zones of the Celtic Sea bed that date from the same geologic age as the most productive North Sea oilfields. Whether or not the Gulf block is a winner, the odds have shot up that others in the region could be. **********''We really are at the start of a new era,'' said Donald Sheridan, managing director of Atlantic Resources Ltd., the small Irish exploration company that owns a one-third interest in the block where Gulf is drilling. ''From the data that Gulf has published, we are undoubtably in a new oil province.'' **********The test drilling shows oil flowing at a rate of 10,000 barrels a day, including a large amount of high-quality light crude that is more valuable to refiners. These data, and reports about the zones in which the oil has been found, have convinced industry sources that there is a good chance the field can produce the 50 million barrels needed to make it profitable. **********Could Ease Import Costs **********Less-informed speculation has wandered as high as 300 million barrels and raised hopes that Ireland might be able to satisfy its need for 100,000 barrels a day for up to a decade. The country pays $1 billion annually to import oil and oil products and even a small find would have a major impact on Ireland's negative trade balance, according to Michael Scanlon, Mr. Collins's deputy at the Trade and Energy Ministry. **********Even if the discovery is all Ireland could hope for, it will be several years at least before oil could be marketed. Indeed, the final tests on whether the field is commercial will not be completed before next spring.  The Government is still formulating the tax mechanism for oil, although laws giving it a right to participate in up to a 50 percent stake and specifying royalties of 8 to 16 percent of sales value, depending on the production level, are already in place. **********In any case, the prospect of Irish oil has roused the normally somnolent Irish Stock Exchange, where trading has been frenzied. ''There's enormous speculation, far larger than anything I have ever seen before,'' said a partner at J.& E. Davy, Ireland's largest stockbroker, who asked not to be identified. ''It's several multiples higher than two years ago, when interest peaked in the Porcupine Basin off the west coast.'' **********Checks From Tourists **********The center of the speculation has been Atlantic Resources, which also has interests in several nearby blocks. But several other Irish oil exploration companies, including Aran Energy, Bula and Eglinton, have been caught up in the rising interest. One broker told an Irish newspaper that two American tourists had walked into his office and given him two certified checks for $10,000 each to invest. **********The activity has been mirrored on the London Stock Exchange, where some of the companies are also traded, and analysts say that interest has been intense. **********There are plenty of reasons why the investors have been mesmerized. To start with, some Irish newspapers have provided them almost daily with unusually accurate information on the drilling results, to the dismay of some of the oilmen involved. Gulf, Atlantic Resources, Union Oil (the third partner in the block), and the Government all deny being the source of the leaks. Whatever the source, the leaking has turned the exploration and stock market reaction into a running front-page story. **********A Colorful Cast **********There is also a fascination with the colorful cast at Atlantic Resources. The company was organized in 1981 by James Stafford, a well-connected entrepreneur from Wexford who has founded or been a key figure in six other oil companies, including Aran and Eglinton. **********His major early backer was Fitzwilton Securities Ltd., the investment firm headed by Anthony J. F. O'Reilly, president of the H. J. Heinz Company, an Irishman known at least as well here for his rugby exploits as for his subsequent rise through the executive ranks of the Pittsburgh-based food concern. **********Atlantic's board of directors was packed with influential Irish politicians and businessmen, all of whom made hefty profits when the company went public. Later additions to the board included John P. McEnroe, father of the tennis star, John McEnroe, who is reported to be an investor. **********While all of the Irish oil companies have seen their shares move up dramatically, Atlantic stands out. Following a disastrous new share issue in June, the stock had fallen to 42 Irish pence. Since mid-July, it has leaped on good news from the Celtic Sea to a peak of 675 pence. **********'A Possible Savior' **********Investors aren't the only ones taking the news seriously. ''In many respects, it's regarded as a possible savior here,'' said Desmond O'Toole, the real estate appraiser who heads the Chamber of Commerce in Waterford, the severely depressed manufacturing city that is nearest the oil find.  Waterford businessmen are already organizing to service the inevitable boom in offshore exploration and, they hope, production. **********Waterford is looking nervously over its shoulder at Cork, Ireland's second-largest city, which is almost as close to the field and already is the base for servicing the Kinsale natural gas field. Kinsale, which is operated by the Irish subsidiary of Marathon Oil, is Ireland's only domestic source of hydrocarbons and meets about 15 percent of the nation's energy needs."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/10/world/burma-under-general-s-rule-keeps-to-itself.html": {"writer_name": "Colin Campbell", "pub_date": "1983-10-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 467, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BURMA, UNDER GENERAL'S RULE, KEEPS TO ITSELF", "print_headline": "BURMA, UNDER GENERAL'S RULE, KEEPS TO ITSELF", "body_text": " **********The bomb that killed at least 16 South Koreans and three Burmese today exploded in a closed and tightly ruled country that has only recently tried to strengthen its ties with such Western- leaning nations as South Korea. **********A socialist republic that is officially neutral, Burma has remained remarkably isolated from foreign journalists because of restrictions in effect since Gen.

Carried by British Stations **********The interview was shown on British stations and it caused several members of the Labor Party opposition today to raise questions about the Prime Minister's physical condition after surgery in August to repair a detached retina.  They said she appeared haggard in the interview and suggested she might not be physically able to carry out this week's trip and another visit scheduled next week to Canada and the United States. **********''Mrs. Thatcher's physical appearance indicates she needs a long rest,'' said Martin Flannery, a left-wing Labor Member of Parliament from Sheffield. **********''Why did it take her 17 days to comment on the shooting down of the Korean airliner? What has been preventing such a voluble, talkative woman from commenting during this period? Everybody was wondering where she was. It seems completely out of character unless there is some other reason.''  'In Fine Fettle' **********Government sources said Mrs. Thatcher was ''in fine fettle'' and if her television appearance looked odd it may have been attributable to the poor lighting provided by the Dutch television crew that interviewed her here. **********The Prime Minister is scheduled to meet with Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch Prime Minister, and with the West German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, during her trip, during which she will also visit several British military bases. **********It is expected that she will seek reassurances that unity will be maintained on the decision to proceed with the deployment of American nuclear missiles by the end of the year. Most of them will be deployed on British, Dutch and German soil. **********Meanwhile, a top Soviet journalist said in an interview carried here today by the BBC that the first public reports coming out of Moscow on the downing of the jet were probably misleading. **********''I think in this respect our military people are guilty,'' said Prof. Viktor Afanasiev, editor in chief of Pravda. ''Probably they let some inaccuracies slip by. Perhaps they were not certain what had happened.'' **********Mr. Afanasiev, a member of the Communist Party's Central Committee, was interviewed here while he was on his way to a meeting of high-ranking Soviet military and foreign affairs experts in Edinburgh this week with British and American counterparts. He said he did not know why initial Soviet reactions to the incident were so inadequate. **********''This is my own simple version,'' he said. ''I cannot claim to know. I would not say I was very pleased with our first reports.'' **********The visit of the Russian delegation was approved by the Foreign Office despite the uproar over the Korean jet.

The Irish Republican Army took responsibility for the slaying. **********A message delivered to news organizations in Belfast said the assassination ''should be a salutary lesson to those loyalists who stand foursquare behind the laws and forces of oppression of the nationalist people.'' **********The killing of Mr. Graham, who was a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly and chairman of the Ulster Young Unionist Council, appeared to signal an important departure from recent I.R.A. tactics. For more than a year the paramilitary force has taken care to select targets associated with security forces in the British province as it sought to spread its political influence among more moderate elements of the Roman Catholic community. Shootings 'Counterproductive' **********When gunmen two weeks ago raided a Protestant church, killing three members and wounding seven, the I.R.A. disassociated itself from the shootings, calling them counterproductive for republican goals. **********Before Sinn Fein, the group's political arm, demonstrated surprising voter appeal among nationalists in voting for the Assembly, the I.R.A. had waged open warfare against loyalist politicians. In 1981, Robert Bradford, a Member of Parliament from the same South Belfast district represented by Mr. Graham, was murdered at a political meeting by I.R.A. gunman. That same year the 86-year old former Speaker of the old Northern Ireland Parliament, Sir Norman Stronge, was killed along with his son by the I.R.A. **********Last month the chairman of the Armagh District Council, James Armstrong, was killed by an I.R.A. bomb, but he had associations with provincial security forces. Mr. Graham had no such connections but was considered a strict advocate of law and order. **********James Molyneaux, leader of the Official Unionist Party, to which Mr. Graham belonged, called the killing a ''disaster for our party because he was an elected officer and one of our management team, a spokesman on home affairs specializing in legal matters and legislation dealing with terrorism. **********''Had Mr. Graham not been murdered,'' Mr. Molyneaux said, ''he would have become the leader of our party, such was his caliber.''  Voice of New Generation **********Other Unionists saw the slain man not so much as a political leader but as the voice of a new generation of educated Protestants who hold strong views on law and order and object to extremists on both sides of the sectarian conflict. **********Last month he said that he had information that he and five other leading Unionists were targeted for assassination by republican paramilitary forces who were trying to enlist loyalist extremists in the plot. **********In September, The Times of London printed a lengthy letter from Mr. Graham in which he strongly supported the use of informers in Ulster courts to obtain convictions of republican and loyalist terrorists. **********''The community as a whole in Northern Ireland,'' he wrote, ''is at last seeing the stranglehold of the terrorist organizations, on both sides, being broken.'' **********Mr. Graham's murder was expected to reinforce Unionist demands on London to step up security measures in the province. After the church shootings two weeks ago, the Official Unionist members of the Assembly, including Mr. Graham, withdrew from participation in the legislature until stronger measures were taken.   Honor Guard for Slain Man **********Last weekend, British Army special counterinsurgency forces shot and killed an I.R.A. suspect and wounded two others in the first undercover action taken as a result of the clamor raised by the Unionists. On Tuesday, the dead man was buried with an I.R.A. honor guard and Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, was a pallbearer."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/05/business/consumer-rates.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-06-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 73, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CONSUMER RATES", "print_headline": "CONSUMER RATES", "body_text": " **********In percent              Passbook Savings   5.50        At savings institutions              Tax-Exempt Bonds   9.78       Bond Buyer 20-Bond Index              6-Month Savings Certificates   9.00       Maximum rate at savings institutions              Money Market Funds   7.80       Donoghye's Money Fund 7-Day Average              Bank Money Market Accounts   8.20       Bank Rate Monitor Index              Home Mortgage   13.13       Federal Home Loan Bank, national average              Unsecured Personal Loans       Minimum rate, 3-year-maturity       Chase Manhattan, New York   16.50       Continental Illinois, Chicago   16.00       Bank of America, San Francisco   19.00"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/14/world/cuba-sets-five-days-of-mourning-for-its-dead.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-11-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 336, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CUBA SETS FIVE DAYS OF MOURNING FOR ITS DEAD", "print_headline": "CUBA SETS FIVE DAYS OF MOURNING FOR ITS DEAD", "body_text": " **********Cuba declared five days of mourning today as it prepared for the return to Havana of Cubans killed resisting the American-led invasion of Grenada. **********The bodies were due to be flown to the capital today after identification in the eastern city of Holguin, where they were flown Saturday with several Grenadian dead. **********A Government communique did not give the exact number of Cuban dead, but earlier lists of the missing indicated the number could not exceed 24. **********National mourning will last until a mass rally is held Monday night in Revolution Square in which Fidel Castro is expected to speak. **********The communique said the people would pay tribute ''to their heroic sons who died as they worked in international solidarity with the people of Grenada, resisting the brutal aggression of imperialism towards that brother country.''

And 50-year-old Coleco, which normally seeks its fortune through electronic games, swimming pools and equipment and those noisy, squat plastic tricycles, has hit a phenomenal winner with its first doll. The R.& E. brass are predicting sales of more than three million in 1983, a record for doll sales in an introductory year. **********Yesterday in his office with Mr. Kolker, Mr. Schwarzchild, who had just arranged to stop advertising for the dolls until there were enough around to meet the demand, said he was expecting similar consumer excitement when advertising starts for Coleco's Adam computer. **********But first the conversation centered on the Cabbage Patch Kids. They are mass-produced, but no two are alike, thanks to different combinations of skin and eye color, hair color and style and clothing. And the two men are trying very hard to understand their phenomenal success. **********''If you treated a Shirley Temple doll as if it were alive, people would treat you as if you were crazy,'' said Mr. Schwarzchild, ''But because this is so ugly, it allows everybody to get into the fantasy that they are real.'' **********''The key,'' injected Mr. Kolker, ''was understanding that kids also want to feel one-of-a-kind and say to themselves, 'No matter how I look, I'm special.' '' **********They credit Alfred R.Kahn, senior vice president-marketing at Coleco, with realizing that there was something very special going on down in Cleveland, Ga. There, an artist named Xavier Roberts, who makes soft sculpture, had set up a truly different doll factory in 1977. He calls it Babyland General Hospital, and women dressed as nurses administer an adoption oath and supervise the signing of adoption papers for the dolls. Cigars are also handed out. **********But those dolls sell for $125 to $1,000, depending on the accessories, and are never called dolls, but ''little people.'' **********The version that is being mass- produced under a licensing agreement by Coleco are sold for $19.95 and up, and would not have been called dolls in the TV commercials either, but the networks insisted on it. The agency is just as interested as Mr. Roberts is in preserving the fantasy that the kids are born one night a year in the cabbage patch and he spends the rest of the year finding homes for them. **********The agency, after many focus- group interviews, created two 30-second spots, one extolling the kids and the other their accessories. It began running the spots in New York in June and then expanded advertising to new areas weekly, first to Philadelphia and Boston, and then to Chicago, Detroit and Minneapolis. Once the spots hit the network on Sept. 23, both network and spot TV were used. But because of the huge demand for the dolls, most of the ads have been pulled, and the only ones that are on now are the commercials in syndicated shows, which take a couple of weeks to pull. **********Coleco originally considered the doll as a Christmas toy, but the consumer excitement has caused a change of heart. The Cabbage Patch Kids are now a year-round item, and as soon as there is enough product, or when there is a new product, TV advertising will be unleashed once again.  Coleco became a Richard & Edward's client a year after the agency started in 1976, coming in from Helitzer Advertising, where both Mr. Schwarzchild and Edward Mandell, now executive vice president and creative director, had worked. **********Helitzer was also a toy specialty agency. And toys have been Dick Schwarzchild's calling since, after majoring in English at the University of Connecticut, he decided he didn't like being either a supervisor in a metal rolling plant in Flushing or a management trainee in a cigar-rolling plant in Wilkes-Barre. Instead, he opened a toy store in the latter location, right across the street from the area's biggest toy discounter. **********It wasn't long before he switched inventory to hobby items. That led eventually to a job as vice president for advertising and marketing with Aurora, the model car makers, and that led to Helitzer. **********So it is a man with considerable experience who says, ''There are four possible combinations. You can have a good product and bad promotion. A bad product and good promotion. A bad product and bad promotion or a good product with good promotion. These days you don't go to market without a good product and good promotion.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/10/world/3-students-arrested-in-korea.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-04-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 54, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "3 Students Arrested in Korea", "print_headline": "3 Students Arrested in Korea", "body_text": " **********Three South Korean students have been arrested on charges of leading an anti-Government demonstration, the police said today.

This is not a false alarm.'' **********During the recession, he noted last week, some managers were required to wear two hats, but now they intend to hire assistants.  Attrition was low, Mr. Erdlen said, resulting in relatively few openings as wary employees hung onto their jobs. **********Encouragement for middle managers is also provided by a host of management recruiting firms that regularly survey their clients. **********William E. Gould, executive vice president of the Association of Executive Search Consultants, recently said: ''Top-level positions are the first to come back in a recovery, followed by second-tier executives. The next category experiencing demand will be the middle management ranks, and then lower middle management will be picking up.'' In this breakdown, middle management includes salaries of $60,000 to $99,000, while lower middle management is below $60,000. **********According to the consensus, the reduction of senior staff positions has about ended, and corporations are beginning to fill executive vacancies and to revive lower middle management jobs that had been abolished. **********Management Recruiters International of Cleveland polled 1,850 personnel managers recently before predicting that ''hiring of management and professional people will skyrocket in the third quarter.'' **********Management recruiters are paid a fee by companies to fill individual executive and middle management posts for them. Most recruiters say they do not deal with unemployed managers but instead look for prospects who work for other companies. **********There is good news for middle managers from outplacement firms. In contrast to management recruiters, outplacement firms guide the dismissed employee, usually a top or middle manager, until a new job can be found. They provide the job seeker with advice and support to ease the trauma of being thrown out of work, as well as office space and a telephone. The company that is dismissing the manager pays the outplacement firm a fee for all this. **********Unemployed managers often tap the ''hidden'' job market, relying on suggestions from friends and interviews with companies that may have openings but do not advertise them. **********James E. Challenger, president of Challenger, Gra & Christmas, a Chicago-based outplacement firm, said job-seeking middle managers are ''better off than six months ago except for one group - the younger managers aged 38 through 43.'' He said: ''These are people who had advanced relatively fast in their companies, and they are having trouble finding jobs with equally good salaries. They used to be the group most in demand, but companies now are buying more experience with the same money.'' **********A younger middle manager, Mr. Challenger said, must generally look longer before finding a job - about four and a half months, compared with three and a half months for managers in other age groups. Women managers have a harder time finding jobs than men do, he said. And older job seekers in the 55-to-60 age bracket require anywhere from four and a half to five months to find work. **********Even during the darkest days of the recession, middle managers guided by outplacement firms were able to find jobs, Mr. Challenger said, although it took longer than now. **********More middle managers seeking jobs nowadays, he noted, are willing to move to another part of the country, and he estimated that 35 percent do have to move, compared with 20 percent before the recession. **********''Some companies that said they would not add people are adding them now,'' Mr. Challenger said. ''We know of a textile company that six months ago was not hiring anybody. It just hired two men at $42,000 and $55,000.'' **********More companies now show responsibility toward employees they displace, for whatever reason, and their use of outplacement is increasing. Staff members at a lower level sometimes benefit, Mr.  Challenger said. ''Why, we even handled one person with an $8,000 salary,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/06/world/pope-praises-luther-in-an-appeal-for-unity-on-protest-anniversary.html": {"writer_name": "Henry Kamm", "pub_date": "1983-11-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 834, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "POPE PRAISES LUTHER IN AN APPEAL FOR UNITY ON PROTEST ANNIVERSARY", "print_headline": "POPE PRAISES LUTHER IN AN APPEAL FOR UNITY ON PROTEST ANNIVERSARY", "body_text": " **********Pope John Paul II, in a letter issued today, praised Martin Luther, the father of the Reformation who was excommunicated from the Roman Catholic Church, saying the world is still ''experiencing his great impact on history.'' **********His comments were contained in a letter to the president of the Pontifical Secretariat for the Union of Christians, Johannes Cardinal Willebrands, to mark the anniversary of Martin Luther, whose 500th birthday will be celebrated next Thursday. The text of the letter was made public by the Vatican, **********In a related development, it was announced that Pope John Paul would preach on Dec. 11 in a Lutheran church here. The announcement was made by Christoph Meyer, the dean of the church, the Evangelical Lutheran Christoph Church, which has served the resident German community for 168 years. The service will be held in German, and the Pope will preach in the language of Martin Luther. **********The letter from the Pope to Cardinal Willebrands, was dated Oct. 31, 1983, the anniversary of the date in 1517 when Luther nailed his 95 theses on the door of the castle church of Wittenberg, Germany, giving birth to the Protestant Reformation. The Pope wrote the letter to Cardinal Willebrands, the Archbishop of Utrecht, in German. **********The Pope referred to Luther as the theologian who ''contributed in a substantial way to the radical change in the ecclesiastical and secular reality in the West.'' He continued: ''Our world still experiences his great impact on history.'' **********The Pope noted with satisfaction that the Protestant churches had declared the anniversary year to be an occasion that should serve ''a genuine ecumenical spirit'' and said that he saw this as a ''fraternal invitation'' to a joint reflection on the history and inheritance of Luther. **********Roman Catholic and Protestant studies have yielded a more balanced picture of Luther's personality and the realities of the 16th century, the Pope continued, and shown that ''the rupture in ecclesiastical unity cannot be reduced to the lack of comprehension by Catholic Church authorities or solely to Luther's lack of understanding of true Catholicism, even if both factors played a role.'' **********The Pope called for continued historical research, ''that does not take sides, motivated only be the search for truth,'' to provide ''a true image'' of Luther and the Reformation. ''Guilt, wherever it exists, must be recognized, on whichever side it is found,'' the Pope wrote.   Continue Search for Unity **********John Paul called on Cardinal Willebrands to continue the ecumenical dialogue in quest of restoration of Christian unity and offered a special prayer and blessing for this work. **********''The clarification of history that turns to the past and whose significance persists must go in equal steps with the dialogue of faith which we at present embark on to look for unity,'' the Pope wrote. **********The Pope said the anniversary year was ''an occasion to meditate, in Christian truth and charity, on that event engraved in history that was the epoch of the Reformation.'' **********''It is time that we distance ourselves from historic events and assure that they are often better understood and evoked,'' the Pope said. John Paul said Luther was a man of ''profound religiousness'' who was ''driven by the examination of eternal salvation.''  Papal Visit Arranged Last Year **********Mr. Meyer, the dean of the Lutheran church where the Pope will preach next month, said in a telephone interview that the Pope's visit had been arranged more than a year ago, when John Paul paid a Sunday afternoon call to the Roman Catholic parish in which the Lutheran church is situated. The Catholic authorities invited Mr. Meyer and the board members of his congregation to attend the service for the Pope. **********To Mr. Meyer's surprise, one of the board members approached John Paul and asked him whether he would participate in a Lutheran service during the anniversary year.

F. Hutton as a forecaster, the economist, Theode C. Langevin was caught by tracing the phone calls he made to the computer. Officials then let him tap into a computer programmed with phony money figures so that he could be caught ''with his hands in the cookie jar,'' an official said. **********Money supply data, if obtained in advance of its release each Friday by the Federal Reserve, would be of tremendous value to a forecaster working in a brokerage house that trades in stocks and bonds. Interest rates and yields of Government securities and bonds often move up or down when changes in the growth rate of the money supply are reported. **********Mr. Langevin, 34 years old, went to work for Hutton in New York after leaving the Federal Reserve on Nov. 19. But he was at Hutton for only 10 days before being asked to leave because of the allegations of his computer-tapping, according to Thomas Rae, Hutton's general counsel. **********At Hutton, Mr. Langevin was a ''Fed watcher,'' whose job was to predict Reserve policy and its impact on the the credit markets.  Information filed in Federal District Court here by an Assistant United States District Attorney, William S. Block, indicated that Mr.Langevin tried to gain access to the Federal Reserve's computers in late November, just after he had left the Reserve for Hutton. **********The information document, which is a little more than two pages long, said that Mr. Langevin had used the name of someone still working at the Federal Reserve and that person's access code to the computer to try to get at the money supply data by calling up the computer through the use of a terminal connected to a telephone.  Based on a normal procedure, according to former employees, Mr.  Langevin's computer access code, if he had his own, would have been canceled even before he left the Federal Reserve. **********Mr. Langevin is the first person to be formally charged with trying to get secret money supply data from the Federal Reserve computer system, and his case has raised questions about the security of the system. **********It also caused concerns in the financial markets because the information on the nation's money supply, if known before its official release, could give someone an early indication of the probable course of interest rates. That would provide an invaluable edge in playing the bond market. **********Officials said that the information in the dummy computer program was fabricated money supply data. The court filing did not say whether Mr. Langevin obtained accurate information in earlier attempts. Mr. Rae of Hutton said, however, that Mr. Langevin ''prepared no figures for Hutton nor were any of his figures used for Hutton's proprietary account or those of our customers.'' **********An official in the United States Attorney's office said that when an information document was filed in a felony case it often meant the defendant was expected to waive his right to a grand jury indictment and plead guilty to the charge. The maximum penalty for the charge of fraud by wire is five years in jail and a $1,000 fine. Hearing Expected Next Week **********A hearing is expected next week, the official said. Mr. Langevin, reached at his home in Laurel, Md., said he had no comment. His lawyer, Leslie G. Fein, also declined to comment. A spokesman for the Federal Reserve, Joseph Coyne, referred all questions to Mr.  Block. Mr. Block would not comment on the charges. **********Because neither Mr. Langevin nor his lawyer would comment, there is no indication whether Mr. Langevin will plead guilty. Former employees of the Federal Reserve who knew Mr. Langevin could not say why he reportedly tried to tap the computer. But some suggested that he might have ''ended up over his head'' in his new job as a ''Fed watcher,'' under considerable pressure to produce accurate forecasts of interest rate movements. **********Mr. Langevin worked at the Federal Reserve for almost seven years and for the last 18 months of his employment was an economist in the Federal Reserve's research and statistics division, according to the information. **********Former officials said that his job required him to gather bank deposit data used in computing money supply changes and he would have had access to the computer. But it could not be confirmed if Mr.  Langevin had access to the computer on his own while he worked at the Fed. Details Sketchy **********The details of what Mr. Langevin did are still very sketchy because no officials will comment on the record and little is said off the record. But, apparently, Mr. Langevin at some point after Nov. 12, according to the information, devised his scheme to tap the computer. **********The information document said that an attempt to tap the computer was made on or about Nov. 22, just days after he joined Hutton.  Officals indicated that there were other attempts, but the information is based on only one call. **********Officals said that the computer recognized this attempt but will not say how. After that, the Federal Reserve informed the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Attorney's office here. Apparently, the phone lines into the computer were then fixed so that incoming calls could be traced. In this way, officials said, the code Mr. Langevin reportedly used was traced back to him at Hutton. **********It was then that Hutton officials were informed of the investigation, officials said, and then the dummy program was added to the computer. **********Mr. Rae of Hutton said that the company had cooperated with the F.B.I. and knew that Mr. Langevin was under investigation several days before he was asked to leave the company."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/28/world/castro-and-foreign-policy-his-own-master-news-analysis.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "1983-07-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 799, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "News Analysis", "print_headline": "CASTRO AND FOREIGN POLICY: HIS OWN MASTER?; News Analysis", "body_text": " **********In a speech here Tuesday summarizing the accomplishments of his 25 years in power, Fidel Castro seemed to play down Cuban ties to the Soviet Union. ''Not in the past, not now or ever have we made decisions at a cost to others or expected others to fight for us,'' the Cuban leader said. **********A Cuban journalist, analyzing the remark later, suggested it was a message to those who believed that the Soviet Union, Cuba's economic underwriter, was also responsible for the defense of Cuba and its military involvement abroad. **********The crowd listening to the President applauded most enthusiastically at such references to the country's self-reliance.  Mr. Castro dwelt on what he said was an ''atmosphere of terror'' the United States was trying to create around Nicaragua, asserting it was seeking to deploy troops in Central America through military maneuvers now beginning in the region. He made no direct reference to the role of the Soviet Union in Cuba's development until he came to a series of fraternal greetings at the end of his speech. **********Isolating the 'Anglos' **********Realistic or not, the strategy outlined here this week by Mr.  Castro and by Deputy Foreign Minister Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, who talks frequently with Western journalists, is apparently aimed at several constituencies. **********Playing on a traditional theme of anti-Americanism in Latin America, the policy appears to seek the isolation of the hemisphere's ''Anglos'' symbolized by the United States. **********The policy also stresses the commitment of Cuba to what amounts to making the region safe for ''socialism'' -almost a mirror image of the Reagan Administration's emphasis on curtailing the spread of ''Communism.'' The stuggle going on in Central America, Mr. Castro said, was ''not local, but worldwide.'' **********Finally, the Cubans appeal to an economically strapped third world with assurances that the capitalist system is moribund - racked, Mr.  Castro said, by ''exploitation, racism, prostitution and drugs'' - and that the developing nations with their tightly controlled systems will be among the world's leaders ''within the next 25 years.'' Some Old Themes **********While the tenets of Cuba's foreign policy may not be new - Mr.  Castro said many similar things while chairman of the group of nations calling themselves nonaligned - they appear to weather well despite their reliance on well-worn anti-imperialist jargon. **********The Cuban leader's call for the isolation of the United States and the promotion of ''our Latin America'' has found more sympathetic ears since the war in the Falkland Islands, when the alignment of Washington with the British produced an outpouring of Latin American self-awareness. **********Even Nicaragua sided with Argentina during that war, despite the fact that Argentines were then training rebels trying to overthrow the Government in Managua. The Argentine advisers have now all but disappeared from Central America. **********During the war, Argentina's Foreign Minister, Nicanor Costa Mendez, came to Havana for a conference and was warmly welcomed. Relations between the two nations have been better ever since, according to Cuban officials. **********Venezuelan diplomats also report some repairing of bad relations between Havana and Caracas after the war for what all Latin Americans call the Malvinas. Bolivar's Name Invoked **********On Tuesday Mr. Castro invoked the name of the Venezuelan-born liberator Simon Bolivar and drew him into the revolutionary pantheon.  Turning to the Communist world, Mr. Castro assured his allies that Cuba's revolution was always at heart a Communist revolution. He said it was the work of Marx, Engels and Lenin in conjunction with the thinking of the 19th-century Cuban hero Jose Marti that gave the Castro revolution its understanding of the problems facing Cuba and allowed the Cubans to develop ''many years ahead of the countries of Latin America.'' **********The threads of Cuba's policy come together on an issue like Nicaragua, which is portrayed as a poor nation sharing Cuba's revolutionary goals while being terrorized by the United States. **********Mr. Alarcon praised the efforts of the Contadora Group nations - Colombia, Mexico, Panama and Venezuela - to bring peace to Central America because they were working ''outside the inter-American system.'' Cuba was excluded from the Organization of American States in 1962. **********Important to the carrying out of Cuba's foreign policy in the third world as well as in Latin American and European capitals is a new generation of Cuban diplomats and development experts who have grown up or been educated during the Castro years. An international presence both militarily and in civilan advisory roles, they exude a self-confidence that third world and some Western diplomats say is very effective."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/29/business/talks-on-north-sea-oil.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-03-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 67, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Talks on North Sea Oil", "print_headline": "Talks on North Sea Oil", "body_text": " **********Douglas Hurd, Britain's Deputy Foreign Secretary, said today that North Sea oil producers are having an ''informal conversation'' with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries following this month's reduction in the benchmark price of oil.

Seven members of Mr. Begin's coalition did not support his candidate in the voting, which was secret. **********The 61-to-57 vote, with 2 blank ballots, was a setback for the coalition, but it seemed unlikely to have major repercussions. The Prime Minister, brushing off the defeat with a smile and the comment, ''C'est la vie,'' said he would not join several coalition legislators in support of early parliamentary elections unless all the small parties in the governing bloc agreed. The small parties fear a drubbing in an early election, so Mr. Begin's condition appeared to reduce the chances of one. **********Because the presidency is ceremonial and carries no governmental authority, the substantive effect of Mr. Herzog's victory is not expected to be great. Israel's five previous Presidents have stayed aloof from political issues of the day, acting only as symbols of the state, receiving ambassadors' credentials and the like. **********It has even been difficult to get public figures to accept the post. Until the current President, Yitzhak Navon of Labor, was elected in 1978, those chosen were generally considered not to have further political ambition. **********President Navon has revised that image by becoming a somewhat activist President and by emerging as a potential leader of the Labor Party after he leaves office in early May. **********As President, he has largely avoided divisive issues but has stepped in to adopt a moral tone at crucial moments. During the bitter election campaign of 1981, for example, when Begin supporters were disrupting Labor rallies, he pleaded for mutual respect. And after the massacre of Palestinians in Beirut by Lebanese Christian Phalangists last September, he called for the creation of an Israeli commission of inquiry, resisted by the Government. **********Mr. Herzog is a former general and a former diplomat whose tenure as chief delegate to the United Nations made him well known to Americans. An outgoing and congenial man, he is expected to keep the presidency energetic, highly visible and above politics. He began immediately to avoid partisanship, playing down the political significance of his victory and telling reporters that the secret ballot was intended precisely to minimize the political overtones of the election. **********''I already don't feel that I'm the opposition candidate anymore,'' he said.

Page 29. **********WASHINGTON. Dec. 2 - A senior White House official said today that President Reagan had been angered by the tone taken by Larry Speakes, his spokesman, in commenting on Wednesday about Martin S. Feldstein, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. **********The official said Mr. Reagan objected to the manner, but not the substance, of Mr. Speakes's repeated criticism of Mr. Feldstein for his public insistence on the need to reduce the Federal deficit through tax increases. **********On Wednesday, in response to a question, Mr. Speakes said all of Mr. Reagan's aides were familiar with his position on these matters, ''with the possible exception of the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.'' **********Mr. Speakes also repeatedly pronounced Mr. Feldstein's name two different ways, provoking laughter from some reporters. And he joked that, although the economist was in attendance at a lunch with the President, ''maybe he won't make it to dessert.'' Mr. Reagan was reported by the White House official, who asked not to be identified, to have thrown down on his desk a copy of The New York Times reporting the Speakes comments, saying ''I don't like this. This is not the way I want to operate.'' The official said the President made the remark at a meeting with top aides on Thursday.  The official said: ''It's one thing to criticize Feldstein on the substance of the policies. He's been a problem for us. It's another thing to be sarcastic about it and mispronounce his name. It's another to make him a martyr.'' **********Two Pronunciations of Name **********Mr. Speakes said this evening that he had pronounced the name alternately as Feld-STINE and as Feld-STEEN because he had long had difficulty in remembering that Mr. Feldstein uses the Feld-STINE pronounciation. ''I frequently make that mistake,'' Mr. Speakes said. **********Mr. Speakes added that President Reagan had not informed him personally of any unhappiness with the comments he made Wednesday, but he said that others had told him Mr. Reagan was unhappy with the suggestion of ridicule implied in the repeated mispronounciation. He added that The Times had ''mishandled'' its account by suggesting that he was making fun of the name. **********''I would never ever make fun of anybody's name,'' Mr. Speakes said. ''My own name is vulnerable on that account.'' He added that the tone of ridicule at the briefing was set by the sarcastic questions of reporters. **********During the briefing, Mr. Speakes announced that Mr. Feldstein had not been invited to a high-level meeting then under way between the President and aides on the budget and economic issues. Told that Mr. Feldstein might in fact be in attendance, Mr. Speakes - amid much laughter - sent an aide to find out why he was there. **********Mr. Speakes's criticism of Mr. Feldstein had been provoked by recent speeches by the economist suggesting that the Federal deficit had grown because of tax cuts and increases in military spending, not because of increases in domestic spending.  This runs counter to Mr. Reagan's emphasis of blaming domestic spending programs for the deficit. **********Stand on Taxes **********In addition, Mr. Feldstein has pushed hard for a standby tax increase, to take effect in 1985 if Congress accepted the President's spending cuts, if the projected deficit was above 2.5 percent of the projected gross national product and if the economy was expanding. Mr. Feldstein, a former Harvard economist who joined the Administration last August, has made clear his view that the tax will be necessary. **********While the plan was supported by Mr. Reagan in January, the Administration has since played it down and raised questions about whether Mr. Reagan would resubmit it. **********Mr. Speakes's comment at the briefing on Wednesday, coupled with anonymous comments made by White House officials, suggested that Mr. Feldstein was under rising pressure to soften his warnings about the Federal deficit or resign. **********Mr. Feldstein, responding to the criticism by Mr. Speakes, said the next day that he would not resign unless asked to do so by Mr. Reagan. **********Mr. Speakes said tonight that it was decided 10 days earlier among top Presidential aides that the next time he was asked about Mr. Feldstein at a briefing, he should respond with a rebuke.

As partners in the Arabian American Oil Company, or Aramco, which produces and markets much of Saudi Arabia's oil, they are forced to purchase crude from the Saudis at prices higher than competitors pay for similar quality oil produced by others. That has squeezed their profit margins for petroleum products refined from Saudi crude. **********Mobil and Texaco were also hurt by sharply reduced demand for refined products in Europe and the strength of the dollar, which reduced earnings in terms of dollars for petroleum products sold in foreign currencies. **********Analysts said they were not surprised by Shell's narrow earnings decline because the company, which ranks ninth among domestic energy concerns, confines its refining and marketing operations almost exclusively to this country. **********The reduced earnings reported by Mobil and Texaco came the day after both Exxon and the Standard Oil Company of California, also partners in Aramco, reported weak fourth-quarter earnings, in part because of the Aramco problem. **********''We're expecting some improvement in 1983, but that's premised on an expectation that oil prices won't break,'' said James S.

Affects '82 Tax", "body_text": " **********UPON figuring out your income tax now and finding that money is owed the Government, all may not be lost. There still may be a way of easing the tax bite. **********The Individual Retirement Account, of course, is the welladvertised vehicle. But there are ins and outs to setting one up just now for the 1982 tax year. Can a person deduct an I.R.A. on a return before actually buying one? What happens if you have already filed, have a fat return and now want to open an I.R.A. with that money? **********Generally speaking, contributions can be made to an I.R.A. to reduce the 1982 tax up until April 15, plus any extensions. ''It's one of the few things I can think of,'' said Thomas Sherman, personal finance planner at Coopers & Lybrand, ''that a person can do three and a half months after the end of the year and still have it affect the prior year's tax liability.'' **********The maximum contribution is 100 percent of earned income, up to a maximum contribution of $2,000. Persons with a nonworking spouse can contribute $2,250 and married couples who both work can put away $4,000. The latter, for example, would generate a $2,000 tax saving in the 50 percent bracket. **********The answer to whether a person who has already filed a 1982 Federal return can still take advantage of the tax benefit is ''yes.'' Simply open an I.R.A. and file an amended return on Form 1040X. That can be done until April 15, but no extensions are allowed if the return has already been filed. **********''Take a situation,'' said Samuel Murray of Arthur Andersen & Company, the accounting concern, ''where just shortly after the year you do a rough calculation and figure you've overpaid your taxes. You quickly file a return to get the refund. Then you hear you can get a $2,000 deduction for a contribution to an I.R.A. You could use the refund to open an I.R.A. and then file a 1040X to claim the deduction.'' **********People who claim a deduction for an I.R.A. on their return without actually opening one - but with the idea that they have until April 15 to do so - may run afoul of the Internal Revenue Service.  Theoretically, a refund could be generated with this deduction and the money utilized to open the I.R.A. ''This kind of makes the service a little irritable,'' Mr. Murray said. ''Your first return was fraudulent, they would say, because you showed a transaction that hasn't occurred.'' **********That is indeed the I.R.S.'s stand. Ellen Murphy, an I.R.S.  spokesman, said that ''a return is supposed to show completed transactions.'' Mr. Murray and Keith Rollins of Ernst & Whinney, another accounting firm, both dispute the I.R.S.'s reasoning, however. ''I feel,'' Mr. Murray said, ''that if at the time you filed the return you intended to contribute $2,000 to an I.R.A. and you did indeed on or before April 15 - I fail to see where the fraud is.  There's nothing in the statute that says you must make it no later than the time you filed the return.'' **********Mr. Rollins agreed, adding: ''If I've got a client in that situation who hasn't yet made the contribution I'm not going to tell him that it's wrong as long as he makes the contribution by April 15.'' **********Unless you are willing to challenge the I.R.S., however, it appears that the no-contribution, no-deduction policy prevails.  Financial advisers urge the opening of I.R.A.'s as a general proposition for most people. Earnings in the I.R.A. accumulate taxfree until they can be withdrawn - without penalty starting at age 59 1/2. Mr. Sherman of Coopers & Lybrand notes that, with changes coming in Social Security, people will be forced to rely more on their own assets in retirement. **********Shorter term, of course, the I.R.A. gets less attractive. Opening one to avoid paying taxes with the intent of ending it later in the year does not work well. A person might be willing to pay the 10 percent penalty if there could be a saving, say, of $1,000 in taxes, but when the I.R.A. account is closed the money goes back into gross income. ''At least you deferred the tax for another 12 months,'' Mr.  Murray said. ''There isn't a great advantage in doing it.'' Holding the money for at least two or three years, however, might at least put you ahead of the game with the cumulative return on investment.  The 10 percent penalty is ''not terribly severe'' if circumstances dictate that you get at the funds, Mr. Sherman said. **********Financial advisers say that people ought to get in on I.R.A.'s even if money must be borrowed to set one up. Borrowing costs are taxdeductible. **********Cindy Bailey, manager of the Chase Exchange, a financial advisory program at the Chase Manhattan Bank, said that, even though an I.R.A. might be financed with a personal loan carrying perhaps 17 to 19 percent interest, it is still worth it for people in higher brackets. ''Our experience here is that a lot of people find it easier to make the loan payments than to save on their own for the I.R.A.,'' she said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/04/business/profits-scoreboard-078325.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-08-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 75, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Profits Scoreboard", "print_headline": "Profits Scoreboard", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/02/business/hyatt-s-risky-braniff-venture.html": {"writer_name": "Agis Salpukas", "pub_date": "1983-09-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1224, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HYATT'S RISKY BRANIFF VENTURE", "print_headline": "HYATT'S RISKY BRANIFF VENTURE", "body_text": " **********The disclosure statement mailed to the 80,000 creditors who have approved the Hyatt Corporation's plan to revive Braniff Airways contains a warning: ''There has never been an air carrier that has resumed an airline operation with as many as 30 aircraft following a reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code.'' **********The unprecedented nature of the attempt, approved yesterday by Federal Bankruptcy Judge John Flowers, is only one of numerous factors that make clear the extreme risk in trying to put Braniff back in the sky and keep it there, using the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport as its hub. **********Not only would a new Braniff need to offer fares and services that distinguish it from American and Delta, its two powerful rivals at Dallas-Fort Worth, but it also would have to break their stranglehold on the passenger traffic there. They control 80 percent of it. **********Test for Pritzker **********Airline executives and industry analysts said in interviews that the attempt to revive Braniff may be the toughest test to date for Hyatt's chairman, Jay A. Pritzker, whose marketing skills and ability to turn around troubled companies are widely acknowledged. **********''Just because he's been sucessful in the hotel business doesn't mean he can build an airline,'' cautioned the leader of one of Braniff's creditor groups who did not want to be identified. **********In fact, Mr. Prizker's enthusiasm for his reborn airline so far has outrun his ability to deliver a clear and detailed marketing strategy for it, according to the leaders of several creditor groups who spent months negotiating the current agreement. Mr. Pritzker has said only that he has not chosen a name for the new Braniff, that he would recruit the best management available and that the new carrier would offer more amenities than its competitors do. **********''It's pretty clear that when you have a freely competitive industry and you are in a commodity business you have to have a very special product or be a low-cost producer,'' said John V. Pincavage, the airline analyst for Paine Webber Mitchell Hutchins. **********High Ratings **********Michael Derchin, who follows airlines for the First Boston Corporation, said: ''I don't think there is any way they can come in just as a regular airline. Why would anyone want to switch from American and lose out on such things as their frequent flier program?'' He added that both American and Delta consistently score high in surveys on quality of service and customer satisfaction. **********That the two have carved out strong positions at the Dallas-Forth Worth Airport is beyond question. Last June, for example, American carried 63 percent of the passenger traffic there. It is also in the midst of a $76 million expansion program at the airport. Delta, which carried about 20 percent of the passengers, has a $39 million expansion under way. **********Any attempt by a newcomer to lure customers with heavily discounted fares would probably not work, the analysts say. The other carriers most likely would simply match the fares, just as they did when the old Braniff tried that gambit in the months before it filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code on May 13, 1982. **********Braniff and Delta ''would not leave any breathing room,'' Mr. Derchin said. Both airlines are rich in cash, he noted, and would grind down a new carrier that tried to make it on lower fares alone. **********A Strategy Suggested **********Mr. Derchin and others think there is a strategy that might be successful for the new Braniff, though it would be difficult to put together. **********He pointed to Midway Airlines, based in Chicago, which has created a special service called Metrolink. The service, which began on June 19, provides five daily flights between Midway Airport in Chicago and La Guardia in New York and caters to the frequent business traveler. **********For prices below the regular coach fares of the major carriers, Midway offers two-abreast seating on its DC- 9-30's, more carry-on luggage space and better food, as well as schedules to attract the business traveler. **********Another carrier, Air 1, based in St. Louis, has been pursuing a similar business-traveler strategy since April 1. It offers what it describes as first-class service for the price of regular coach. **********The Link to Hyatt **********Although Mr. Pritzker and his management team are still drafting their strategy, he has indicated to various creditor groups that the new Braniff would cater to the business traveler. It would also be closely tied to the hotels of the Hyatt Corporation and would almost certainly use Hyatt's marketing arm to sell the airline. **********The new Braniff is expected to fly to most large cities in the Southwest, as well as major cities, such as Chicago and New York, in the Middle West and the East. **********There is wide agreement in the industry that with deregulation and the proliferation of discount fares many business travelers feel cheated. Most cannot book far enough in advance to qualify for discount fares, yet travel in the same seats and get the same food as the discount passengers. **********''There is a tremendous amount of dissatisfaction,'' Arthur C. Bass, chairman and chief executive officer of Midway, said in an interview. **********Under the plan approved by the creditor groups, Hyatt would assemble $70 million in capital and loans for the new airline. This was the amount that the former chairman of Braniff, Howard D. Putnam, said was the minimum needed to give the airline a chance to establish itself. **********According to the disclosure statement, about $27 million would have to be spent just on preparations, before the airline could put a plane in the air. The carrier, which has begun to recruit its executive staff, plans to hire 2,000 former Braniff employees. **********The 30 Braniff jets appear ready for service except for repainting, but analysts do not expect they will be flying before February. **********In its filing with the bankruptcy court earlier this year, Braniff estimated that in its first year of operations it would generate about $377 million in revenue and have a net loss of $14 million. By the following year, the carrier estimated that it would have a profit of $27 million. **********Much of this assumes that the airline's major unions will fulfill their promise of major wage concessions and flexibility on work rules. Salary and benefit levels will be a key to keeping the carrier's operating costs low enough to achieve the profits needed to keep flying. **********Its timing, however, could be fortunate. Mr. Pincavage of Paine Webber noted that airline travel has been recovering since last spring and that fare discounting has moderated. By early next year, he said, ''everyone should make some money and get away from the discounting problems.'' **********Judge Backs Plan **********FORT WORTH, Sept. 1 (Reuters) - Judge John Flowers of Federal Bankruptcy Court today confirmed the reorganization plan filed by Braniff, which filed for protection from creditors under the Federal bankruptcy law in May 1982. **********After hearing objections from representatives of the company's subordinated bondholders, the judge ruled that the plan was fair and equitable. Opponents of the plan have 10 days to appeal. Otherwise, Braniff can proceed with its reorganization."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/17/world/somalia-announces-invasion-of-2-areas-by-ethiopian-forces.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-07-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 234, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SOMALIA ANNOUNCES INVASION OF 2 AREAS BY ETHIOPIAN FORCES", "print_headline": "SOMALIA ANNOUNCES INVASION OF 2 AREAS BY ETHIOPIAN FORCES", "body_text": " **********Somalia announced today that Ethiopian troops with air support had invaded the central part of the country at dawn today and that there were many casualties. **********There was no independent confirmation of the announcement, nor did the Ethiopian official press issue any similar reports. **********''All enemy invasions have been checked and heavy losses inflicted on them,'' the official Somali press agency quoted the Somali Defense Ministry as saying.

It led the active list, with a volume of nearly 2.7 million shares. **********The actual divestiture is set for Jan. 1. It will result in a slimmed-down version of the current A.T.& T. and seven regional holding companies that will provide the bulk of the nation's local telephone service. A.T.& T. owners will receive one share in each of the seven regionals for every 10 shares of A.T.& T. they hold and, in addition, will retain their current number of parent company shares. **********''Right now, the only game in town until Monday centers on what the present A.T.& T. is worth,'' said Mark D. Luftig, the chief utility analyst of Salomon Brothers Inc. ''We're saying it's worth $68 a share by the end of the first quarter of 1984.'' **********Analysts were assigning their own set of values to A.T.& T. and its component parts prior to the biggest corporate breakup in this nation's history. **********At the First Boston Corporation, Harry Edelson said: ''I'm estimating the value of all the pieces at $65 and I think the price will get there soon. We put out a buy recommendation last week when A.T.& T. went below $62. The company's present dividend yield of around 8.5 percent provides a nice cushion.'' **********At Prudential-Bache Securities, James M. McCabe calculated the value of the A.T.& T. package at $71.60 a share. ''I think the sum of the parts will be trading in the low 70's shortly after the divestiture,'' he said. **********''If you buy the A.T.& T. stock now, my feeling is that sometime in 1984, if you add up all the pieces, you'll make money,'' said Howard W. Shawn of Cowen Asset Management, a unit of Cowen & Company. ''Just where you'll get the gain - from the new A.T.& T. or the regional companies - I don't know.'' **********Yesterday, the high-stakes game centered on taking estimates provided by A.T.& T.'s freshly released statistics for the eight new companies and arriving at some indicated value for the various stocks, which are to be issued by late February. Along with a wealth of other information, Ma Bell projected annual dividends and earnings for the various components. From that starting point, analysts worked out their various estimates of what prices the eight stocks might sell at after divestiture. **********Thus, depending upon the accuracy of the estimates, if either the new A.T.& T. or any of the seven regionals sell in the market at a price sufficiently below the anticipated worth, it would be construed as a buy. Conversely, if the price were sufficiently above the anticipated worth, it could be considered a sell. For each regional, of course, one share of the present A.T.& T. would represent one-tenth of the estimated price to conform with the divestiture formula. **********''One method of calculation uses the analyst's estimated yield for each of the eight companies and then divides that yield into 100 to get the reciprocal,'' Mr. McCabe said. ''Next you multiply that reciprocal figure by the company's indicated annual dividend to arrive at the price you think it is worth.'' **********Using this method, he arrived at a price of $20 for each share of the slimmed-down A.T.& T. parent. Mr. McCabe's estimated per-share worth of the seven regionals: Nynex, $67; Bell Atlantic, $80; BellSouth, $104; Ameritech, $67; Southwestern Bell, $66; U S West, $68, and Pacific Telesis, $64. ''My estimated prices for U S West and Pacific Telesis,'' he said, ''are probably relatively high in comparision to other projections.'' **********If his projected prices for the seven regionals are added up and then divided by 10, and the estimated price of the new A.T.& T. is added to this total, the sum comes to $71.60 a share for the package. **********At Salomon Brothers, Mr. Luftig used a different approach to arrive at his approximate $68 figure. The value of the new A.T.& T. by his method is $19.20 a share, estimated at roughly 9.5 times earnings. For the regionals, he took the annual dividend and divided that by an estimated yield to arrive at a price. The value of the total package works out precisely to $67.41. **********Mr. Luftig's exact per-share projections for the worth of each regional company: Nynex, $68.57; Bell Atlantic, $69.19; BellSouth, $94.55; Ameritech, $64.86; Southwestern Bell, $67.88; USWest, $61.71, and Pacific Telesis, $55.38. ''We dropped our estimate for BellSouth from $103 previously and raised the estimate for Pacific Telesis from $50,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/02/business/loblaw-companies-ltd-reports-earnings-for-yr-to-jan-1.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-03-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 55, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LOBLAW COMPANIES LTD reports earnings for Yr to Jan 1", "print_headline": "LOBLAW COMPANIES LTD reports earnings for Yr to Jan 1", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/20/business/international-harvester-narrows-loss-in-period.html": {"writer_name": "Phillip Wiggins", "pub_date": "1983-05-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 354, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL HARVESTER NARROWS LOSS IN PERIOD", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL HARVESTER NARROWS LOSS IN PERIOD", "body_text": " **********The International Harvester Company, struggling to avoid bankruptcy, reported yesterday that it had narrowed its loss in the second fiscal quarter to $159.1 million, from $201.1 million a year earlier. **********The Chicago-based company, which has been hurt by the protracted weakness of the agricultural equipment and truck market, said that the loss in the quarter ended April 30 included $69 million in onetime expenses associated with the restructuring of its operations and a $6 million loss from the sale of the company's constructionequipment business to Dresser Industries in November. **********Sales in the latest three months fell 27 percent, to $995 million, from $1.26 billion, the company said.

It was an industry leader in using advanced technology. When hard times hit, it was the first steelmaker to file for bankruptcy reorganization. And last year, six months ahead of its bigger competitors, it won wage concessions from its workers. **********Now the Detroit-based manufacturer of flat-rolled steel is out front again, this time demonstrating that by slimming down and cutting costs, debt-ridden steel companies can survive. After accruing losses of more than $100 million since 1980, it expects to earn between $3 million and $5 million this quarter on sales of about $100 million. The company is now privately held and its figures cannot be verified. **********''Two years ago, I said we'd survive but no one believed me,'' said R. Milton Deaner, McLouth's president and chief executive, who joined the company after it filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws in 1981. ''We're not completely out of the woods, though.'' **********Revived as Private Company **********Seated in a conference room in the company's orange-brick headquarters in downriver Detroit, the soft- spoken, 59-year-old executive credited McLouth's new owner, Cyrus Tang, and an improved economy, for reviving the company. **********Mr. Tang, a Chicago-based industrialist, acquired McLouth's steelmaking assets in late 1982 by signing $46.5 million in 10- and 25-year notes with the company's secured creditors. The company's book value was $140 million and the replacement value was $1.2 billion. He then set up the McLouth Steel Products Corporation, a new privately held company. **********Mr. Tang, who was away on vacation, was unavailable for comment. **********Although McLouth's vital signs are much improved, the company is not without problems. It has little capital for modernization, its workers are clamoring for more say in how the mills are run and, like other domestic steelmakers, it is suffering from depressed prices. **********Was Ranked as 11th Largest **********McLouth has traditionally been the nation's 11th-largest steelmaker, but its current position is unclear. **********It entered the steel business in 1949 with the assistance of the General Motors Corporation, which wanted another local steel supplier. In the 1950's, McLouth sprinted ahead of its competitors in installing modern technology but, by 1981, a precipitous drop in steel demand and the heavy debt caused by installing modern steelmaking furnaces pushed McLouth into insolvency. **********Thanks to Mr. Tang's bargain- basement purchase of McLouth, the company's current debt ''is probably the lowest in the industry,'' said Mr. Deaner, who came to the company in 1981 from the National Steel Corporation. Shortly before the company filed for reorganization that year, its long- term debt stood at about $160 million. **********Savings in Reorganization **********Reorganization provided the new McLouth with another cost advantage. Freed from its former obligations, the company was able to relinquish its partnership interest in a Michigan iron ore property. **********Thus, while other domestic steelmakers must bear the costs of carrying large, underutilized iron ore reserves or long-term contracts to buy ore at high prices, McLouth has been free to shop around for ore just when prices have plummeted. This has saved the company about $2 million a month, Mr. Deaner says. **********McLouth also saves about $1 million a month by running its flat-rolling mills only at night, when electricity rates are cheaper. **********Mr. Tang was also able to wring wage concessions from his workers. After initially resisting, the workers agreed to reduce their average compensation to $18 an hour, from $23. Estimating that these concessions save McLouth $20 million a year, Mr. Deaner asserted: ''I don't think we could survive without them.'' **********Workers today say they feel ambivalent about the concessions, which they approved by a 3-to-1 margin. **********David Mullins, who works in McLouth's mill in Trenton, 15 miles south of Detroit, said: ''In my opinion, we gave up too much, but we did save our jobs.'' Mr. Mullins, a 30- year-old father of three, was called back to work last May after a 14- month layoff. **********Many workers feel that, along with the 15 percent stock ownership and 15 percent profit-sharing they received in exchange for their concessions, they should have a greater voice in how the company is run. **********Lower Sales to Auto Industry **********McLouth now sells only one-third of its steel directly to the auto industry, down from as much as 75 percent several years ago. According to Mr. Deaner, the shift reflects Detroit's output of fewer and smaller cars and the company's efforts to diversify its customer base to protect it from the auto industry's cyclical swings. **********Some analysts, however, suggest that the decline is a reflection on the quality of McLouth's steel, a factor largely caused by its inability to afford the latest in production equipment. ''Once upon a time, McLouth had state-of-the-art equipment, but no longer,'' said Charles A. Bradford, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith. **********Mr. Deaner, conceding the need to upgrade McLouth's plant, said he ''dreamed'' of having $150 million to build a new galvanizing line to meet the auto industry's increased demand for rust-resistant steel. **********Pending modernization, however, McLouth's strategy is to guarantee market share by keeping its costs - and prices - down. Thanks to its lower costs for ore, debt and labor, and the higher productivity it realizes from its continuous casting equipment, it is able to produce steel more cheaply than most of its domestic competitors, although it will not divulge the figures. **********''Imports hurt us not so much with the volume, but with selling price,'' Mr. Deaner said. ''We've been forced to discount, and anyone who says he is not doing it is a liar.'' He predicts that because of increased volume, steel prices will rise by 5 percent to 10 percent early next year. **********With one of its two blast furnaces closed, McLouth is operating at 60 percent of capacity and shipping steel at the rate of 1.2 million tons a year, Mr. Deaner said. ''We're producing as much with 2,000 production employees now as we did with 3,000 a few years ago,'' he said. **********Asked whether the company could survive another 1982, Mr. Deaner said: ''I think so, but I don't want to think about it. Let's hope the industry never has that bad a year again.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/22/business/essex-corp-reports-earnings-for-yr-to-dec-31.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-03-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 41, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ESSEX CORP reports earnings for Yr to Dec 31", "print_headline": "ESSEX CORP reports earnings for Yr to Dec 31", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/05/business/steak-n-shake-inc-reports-earnings-for-qtr-to-dec-22.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-02-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 68, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "STEAK 'N SHAKE INC reports earnings for QTr to Dec 22", "print_headline": "STEAK 'N SHAKE INC reports earnings for QTr to Dec 22", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/11/world/around-the-world-pakistani-visits-soviet-as-afghan-talks-near.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-06-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 138, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pakistani Visits Soviet As Afghan Talks Near", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Pakistani Visits Soviet As Afghan Talks Near", "body_text": " **********Foreign Minister Sahabzada Yaqub Khan met with Foreign Minister Andrei A.

The adoption of a negative attitude toward the newly established republic will only serve to eliminate the possibilities of agreement.'' **********This was viewed as a warning, particularly to Greece, that Turkey was ready to give its full backing to the new nation. Turkey has kept a force of 20,000 troops on Cyprus since the 1974 invasion with the aim of protecting the ethnic Turkish minority. Mr. Turkmen declared tonight that the presence of Turkish forces there was ''dependent on the will of the new republic'' and that the existing defensive alliance would remain in force. **********Mr. Turkmen received the Greek Ambassador twice today, at the ambassador's request, briefing him on developments in northern Cyprus and later notifying him of Ankara's decision to recognize the new government. **********Western diplomatic sources here were stunned by the news of the establishment of the Turkish Cypriot republic. Diplomatic sources believed that Pakistan and Bangladesh, which have close associations with Turkey, would also recognize the Turkish Cypriot nation.   De Facto Nation Since 1974 **********Diplomats pointed out that northern Cyprus had already existed as a de facto nation since the 1974 Turkish military invasion and the ensuing population exchange and had now been declared independent in law. **********In general they felt that the new nation could continue to function so long as it had Turkish economic, political and military backing but that this did not mean international recognition or admission to the United Nations. **********The Turkish Cypriot leader, Rauf Denktash, called on all Moslem nations last summer to recognize an independent Turkish Cypriot nation when the time came. Some Turkish sources believed that Saudi Arabia might recognize the new republic but they felt that most of the Arab countries would not want to jeopardize good relations with Greece. **********Mr. Denktash has repeatedly threatened to take action for several years but each time has been discouraged by the Turkish Government, which has insisted on giving the United Nations- sponsored talks a chance.   Turkey in an Interim Period **********Foreign Minister Turkmen declared that Turkish Cypriots could not be held responsible for the failure of nine years of negotiations and added that ''Turkish Cypriots enjoy the right of self- determination as much as the Greek Cypriots.'' **********Mr. Denktash chose this time to make his break from Greek Cyprus because Turkey is in what amounts to a period of interim rule, according to sources who met with the Turkish Cypriot leader recently. **********The Turkish military rulers are to hand over the Government to the leader of the conservative Motherland Party, Turgut Ozal, within two weeks following Mr. Ozal's recent election victory. Turkey's President, Gen. Kenan Evren, met today with Mr. Ozal and the leaders of the two opposition parties and briefed them on the Cyprus developments. **********Mr. Ozal refrained from commenting on the Cyprus situation except to quote a passage from his party's program that states, ''We are respectful of and support the decisions to be taken by the Turkish Cypriot community concerning its own position.''  Wide Support Voiced **********The Turkish Cypriot cause is a popular one in this country and statements of support have come from all sectors of the Turkish political spectrum. **********Former Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, who ordered the 1974 military invasion of Cyprus, approved the Turkish Cypriots' decision, which he said was a consequence of Greek intransigence. He said he felt the move would provide the necessary momentum to find a solution through establishment of a federal republic in Cyprus. **********The leader of the new Social Democracy Party, Cezmi Kartay, declared, ''The declaration of independence of northern Cyprus is inevitable and a natural consequence of the behavior of the Greek Cypriot community against Turkish Cypriots' rights and security.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/25/world/reagan-policy-in-central-america-after-2-years-tough-tone-softens.html": {"writer_name": "Bernard Weinraub", "pub_date": "1983-01-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2475, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Series", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "REAGAN POLICY IN CENTRAL AMERICA: AFTER 2 YEARS, TOUGH TONE SOFTENS", "print_headline": "REAGAN POLICY IN CENTRAL AMERICA: AFTER 2 YEARS, TOUGH TONE SOFTENS", "body_text": " **********The Reagan Administration, once given to tough statements about the need to confront insurgencies in Central America, has softened its tone. **********The new approach consists of substantial economic aid mixed with military assistance, support for democratic social change and a deliberate retreat from the Administration's early statements portraying the poor and weak countries of Central America as dominoes of the East-West conflict. Administration officials say the approach amounts, in some ways, to a bipartisan continuation of Carter Administration policies. **********But there are conflicting assessments both within and outside the Administration of how much the policy itself has really changed. Assertions of Progress **********State Department officials say that events in the region have taken a positive turn and that left-wing movements there have lost their momentum. In contrast to two years ago, Administration officials assert, guerrillas in El Salvador and Guatemala no longer threaten to topple the Governments there. Nicaragua's leftist Government, which has sought to blunt the powers of the Roman Catholic Church and the press, has lost considerable support at home and abroad. Costa Rica, Panama and Honduras are openly supporting American policy. **********''When the Carter Administration left, the situation was in total retreat and there was a state of panic that the region was going to turn into a bunch of little Nicaraguas,'' said one ranking State Department aide, a career official. ''Today that panic doesn't exist, and you find a symmetry unusual in foreign policy between the way we treat our adversaries and the way we treat our friends. You'll find us pressing for democratic reform in countries like Salvador and Guatemala and Honduras, while we push for precisely the same thing in Nicaragua.'' **********Critics and human rights activists strongly disagree. They contend that, in failing to press for negotiations with insurgents in El Salvador and adhering to a policy in Nicaragua designed to undercut the Cuban-supported Sandinist Government, the Reagan Administration has strengthened rightist forces in the region and stirred political polarization and unrest. **********''The policy is mindless, categorizing all left-wing movements in Central America as implacable enemies of the United States and legitimate targets for extermination,'' said Robert E. White, a career diplomat who served as Ambassador to El Salvador until his ouster in 1981. **********He said in an interview that the Administration was making a ''fundamental miscalculation'' in failing to negotiate with some groups and individuals on the political left who may have once been Marxists. ''We freeze them out,'' he said. ''We categorize them as permanent revolutionaries. We don't give them room to change. Central America is a fluid place, and we don't accept the notion that there may be important democratic elements on the left.'' 'Alienates Our Allies' **********Mr. White added: ''The Carter Administration insisted that negotiations between the Salvadoran Government and the revolutionaries was the road to peace, and the Reagan Administration rejects negotiations. By rejecting negotiations, it alienates our allies in the region and places our policy totally in pawn to the Salvadoran military, people who can't compromise, can't negotiate, because they have participated in so many killings. In any peace negotiations they would lose power and possibly something else.'' **********Elliott Abrams, Assistant Secretary at the State Department's Bureau of Human Rights, responded: ''One should always recall the fundamental change in American attitude towards Nicaragua and El Salvador took place in the last period of the Carter Administration.  It was under the Carter Administration that aid to Nicaragua was stopped and that military assistance to El Salvador was started.'' **********He added: ''There's a lot of myth-making now, but the fundamentals of Central American policy were apparent before Ronald Reagan even took office. In Nicaragua, we're not going to support the Sandinists while they're slowly strangling pluralism, and we're not going to try to force the Salvadoran Government to share power with a guerrilla movement dominated by Communists.'' **********Other Government officials, however, and some Republican Congressional aides privately criticize overall Administration policy in Central America as ''not terribly clear,'' ''not very well articulated'' and ''tremendously misunderstood.'' These critics point to confusion about the scale of American clandestine support for opponents of the Nicaraguan Government, including the so-called Somocists, or those aligned with the discredited Government of Gen.  Anastasio Somoza Debayle, who was overthrown in 1979. 'Misperception' of the Right **********''The support for the Somocists is stupid, and it's even more stupid because the Administration got caught,'' said one Republican aide on Capital Hill who asked to remain anonymous. **********William LeoGrande, a specialist on Latin America for the Senate Democratic Policy Committee, said the early months of the Reagan Administration were marked by a ''real misperception of what the right is in Central America.'' **********''There's a realization that it's not possible to side with the right and gain political support in Congress sufficient to let you proceed with your policy,'' he said. ''These two reinforcing policies have led them to a policy which is more in the middle. But the basic flaw in the policy is that there's still too much emphasis on the military dimension as opposed to the political dimension.'' **********Precisely what the Administration seeks in Central America is, in the words of Thomas O. Enders, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, ''an end to the export of subversion,'' from such countries as Cuba, and the ''development of democratic institutions in the region.'' Mr. Enders is the dominant figure in Central American policy, according to various Administration officials. Key Shapers of Policy **********Others who have key roles in shaping the region's policy include L. Craig Johnstone, head of the Office of Central American Affairs; Luigi R. Einaudi, head of the Office of Policy Planning Coordination at the Bureau of Inter-American Affairs; Mr. Abrams, head of the Bureau of Human Rights; Nestor Sanchez, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Inter-American Affairs, and Constantine Menges, national intelligence estimates officer for Central America at the Central Intelligence Agency. **********Gen. Vernon Walters, a roving envoy who operates in considerable secrecy, and Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, the United States delegate to the United Nations, have also played roles in developing Central American policy. Officials say the National Security Council has been relatively muted in the shaping of that policy. **********The policy itself has passed through two distinct phases, which are labeled ''pre-Haig'' and ''post-Haig'' by State Department officials. From the first days of the Administration, Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. made Central America, and especially El Salvador, a pivot of United States policy. Mr. Haig termed the situation ''global in character,'' and said Soviet-sponsored subversion spread by Cuban surrogates and the Sandinist Government in Nicaragua were threatening El Salvador as well as Honduras and Guatemala. **********What intensified the situation, Administration officials say now, was the potential for an anti-Soviet showdown in Central America and the threat of direct American involvement in the region - a threat that the Defense Department sought to quell. Pentagon officials argued that it did not make sense to take a military stand in such a potentially uncertain battleground as Central America, and that the option of interdicting Cuban Navy supply lines to guerrillas in Central America was unfeasible. Opposition to Military Moves **********''Haig used to say that he wanted to do more, but it was the Defense Department that was always opposing military moves,'' a State Department official said. ''They didn't like doing anything, he would say. Whenever he proposed something they had a thousand and one reasons why it couldn't be done. 'We don't have the ships, we don't have the men, we don't have this or that.' '' **********A knowledgeable Congressional aide normally sympathetic to Administration policy said: ''A lot of what the Administration said early on was counterproductive. It scared people. It was fuel for the propaganda mills of the Sandinists in Nicaragua. It created a heightened tension that might not have emerged had the policy been softer, lower-keyed.'' **********''There was an extraordinary amount of rhetoric, such as drawing the line against international Communism in El Salvador, and so forth, that overstated the nature of the problem and tended to put it in the nature of an East-West situation almost exlusively in terms of public perception,'' a ranking State Department official said. **********Recently, Senator Nancy L. Kassebaum, a Kansas Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, noted that even when the war in Lebanon dominated the news last summer, the mail to her office from constituents in Kansas was dominated by one foreign policy issue: concern that American troops would get involved in Central America.  Administration officials now say that, contrary to popular impression, no serious consideration was given to a buildup of forces in the region. 'Emphasis on Economics' **********As Mr. Haig's successor, George P. Shultz ''sought to get away from the image that we see the problem solely in East-West terms,'' one aide said. ''I don't think you're going to see Shultz say that we're going to draw the line in Salvador.'' **********Another State Department official said, with a trace of criticism: ''It's difficult to see a Shultz Central American policy at this point, except for the quiet rhetoric and the emphasis on economics.  That is, in order for these countries to succeed militarily, in order for them to defeat the guerrillas, they have to succeed economically.'' LATIN/First and last add **********The cornerstone of Administration policy has been to press for economic and social development through the Caribbean Basin Initiative. But Washington's original partners in the project, Canada, Mexico and Venezuela, have dropped out. By late last year, despite strong last-minute pressure from the White House, Congress had only approved one part of the three-part package of aid for Caribbean and Central American nations: $350 million in emergency economic assistance. Proposals for trade preferences and investment incentives died during the lame-duck session of Congress, and Administration officials now say the issues will be raised in the 98th Congress. **********At this point, the Administration is proposing $82.5 million in military aid in the 1983 fiscal year to five countries in the region: Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Panama. **********This includes $61.3 million in military aid for El Salvador. As a condition for continuing military aid, President Reagan certified to Congress on Friday that El Salvador was making progress on human rights. No U.S. Aid for Nicaragua **********The Administration has requested $348.3 million in economic aid for Central America. El Salvador, which would receive $164.9 million, is the largest recipient of economic aid, followed by Costa Rica, which would get $95 million. Nicaragua is to receive neither military nor economic assistance from the United States. **********To Administration critics as well as policy makers, the region itself stirs ideological and political differences that seem difficult, perhaps impossible, to bridge. This month, for example, the Administration lifted the five-year-old embargo on arms sales to Guatemala and proposed the sale of $6.3 million in spare parts and other equipment for the nation's air force. **********Administration officials said the Government of Gen. Efrain Rios Montt had taken ''significant steps'' to end human rights abuses and was a considerable improvement over his predecessor, Gen. Romeo Lucas Garcia, whose repressive policies were anathema to both the Carter and Reagan Administrations. General Rios Montt seized power last March. **********Critics have charged that the Rios Montt Government has carried out numerous massacres in Indian villages in a major counterinsurgency offensive launched last July. ''The result is that the level of military action in the countryside is probably lower now than it was three or four months ago but the cost to the people has been immense,'' said Mr. LeoGrande of the Senate Democratic Policy Committee. Progress Cited in Honduras **********In the view of Administration officials, ''considerable progress'' has been made in Honduras, a nation with a relatively peaceful history and stable governments. But critics such as Richard E.  Feinberg, director of the foreign policy program at the Overseas Development Council assert that, in using Honduras as the key base to support covert activities against neighboring Nicaragua, and in stepping up American military aid to the nation, the Reagan Administration has weakened the authority of the year-old civilian Government and may tip the balance of power in the nation in favor of the military. There have been frequent border clashes between Honduras and Nicaragua. **********''Continuing support for democratic elements in Honduras has been diluted,'' said Mr. Feinberg, a specialist on Central America who worked at the State Department's Policy Planning Staff from 1977 to 1979. He added: ''Under Carter the attempt was to edge out the military Government in favor of a civilian government. Under Reagan the emphasis has been reversed.'' **********Even in Costa Rica, critics say, the normally peaceful, stable nation has been shaken by rightist and leftist terrorism. Although the nation has no army, it has received more than $2 million in United States equipment and training for its civil guard. This was largely prompted by border incidents and tensions with Nicaragua. **********Ultimately, critics say, tensions have been heightened in part by the Administration's failure to exploit certain democratic tendencies in the Nicaraguan Government, thereby moving the Sandinists closer to the Cubans and the Soviet Union. Anxious to Show Flexibility **********Administration officials, such as Mr. Enders, say Nicaragua has ''regionalized'' the conflict by supporting insurgents in El Salvador and expanding its ''terrorist and aggressive actions against Honduras and Costa Rica.'' **********In recent months Mr. Enders and other officials have been anxious to show flexibility, urging the Salvadoran Government to contemplate a ''political solution'' to the war, and blaming the guerrilla-led opposition for refusing to accept negotiations. At the same time the Administration has proposed a regionwide ban on the import of weapons and the use of foreign military advisers. **********''I think we're reacting like diplomats in any administration, a little bit by the seat of our pants,'' a State Department official said. ''There is a series of basic principles within which we're trying to work and, frankly, I think it's far more coherent and developed than much of our policy towards the rest of Latin America or the rest of the world.'' **********He added: ''Actually, what's most striking is the continuity of policy. There's been a dramatic change in personnel and of underlying philosophy. Yet both Administrations have found their choices proved to be fairly narrow, the instruments they had were quite limited.  People don't quite believe it, but there are limited economic and military resources for Central America.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/11/world/the-talk-of-ndjamena-for-ruined-chad-s-survivors-steak-filet-and-cotes-du-rhone.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Cowell", "pub_date": "1983-08-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1195, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FOR RUINED CHAD'S SURVIVORS: STEAK FILET AND COTES DU RHONE", "print_headline": "THE TALK OF NDJAMENA; FOR RUINED CHAD'S SURVIVORS: STEAK FILET AND COTES DU RHONE", "body_text": " **********As countries go, Chad has claims to fame that hold no joy. It vies, for instance, with Bhutan for the title of the wold's poorest country. It challenges Eritrea, almost, as the theater for Africa's longest-running chronicled battle and war.  Somehow, in this battered and potholed capital, where the wind sighs gently from the river and admits defeat to the desert's heat, it survives. And with style, too. **********''I am sorry sir,'' the waiter might say at a new restaurant, ''the Beaujolais is finished, but there is C^otes du Rh^one.'' There's ice cream, too, at $9 a liter, imported from France, and French cheese and filet steak. All this is in the street called Avenue Charles de Gaulle, where past battles have left buildings pocked and battered and ruined, unlit and heavy with menace, and in a country whose best fighting men are locked in murderous fighting against Libyan-backed insurgents, far to the barren north. **********African capitals often do not resmble capitals at war because wars are distant and invisible. Ndjamena is different. It looks like a place where the war was fought so bitterly that the conflict itself got tired of the city and moved on, abandoning its stunted creations to idle sightseeing - here the ruined cathedral; there the gendarmerie archway, shattered years ago; here the street lamp that fell on the sidewalk and no one moved; there the countless buildings sculpted not so much by human hand as by bullet and rocket, shell and grenade.   Safety in an Amulet **********That was the legacy of the fighting in 1980. The present conflict is here, too, in different ways. **********On the street the visitor might see young men, tired of eye, relieved to be safe, just back from the battle for Faya-Largeau. Around their necks they wear amulets, clustered on thongs of leather: military planning in the Western sense is not, appparently, sufficient protection for these desert fighters. **********Or, in one of the few restaurants, a group of men might enter, gaunt and spindly in the manner of their tribe. They wear robes of khaki and olive green and cloth wrapped around their heads like turbans, with pistols at their belts and, in one case, with backless wedge-heeled shoes. ''We are just simple soldiers,'' one says. ''We will return to the north when we are ordered to.'' They are the President's men. **********But there is more insidious testimony to the long years of war. In the market, hot and teeming, they sell Korans and canned fish and bolts of cloth and cool drinks and cigarettes and much, much more. All of it is imported, or smuggled. Nothing is produced here, save for cotton and beer in the south. **********The children, too, show their side of the story. **********In the city center a child, perhaps 1 year old, is carried on the back of an elder sister, perhaps 4 or 5. The young one's hair is fringed with a gingery halo, the sign that what food there is does not sustain it. Infants here, as elsewhere in Africa, die of measles. There is rinderpest and famine in parts of the land. The war drains the last drop of hope, but not the will to survive. **********Chadians are a bit like the Reagan Administration. Their Public Enemy No. 1 is the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. **********''If I had a gun, I would kill Qaddafi myself,'' says a 30-year-old accountant in a bar far from the side of the city where the foreigners usually stay. The taxi driver, with reverence for the language of colonialism, calls it ''the African quarter.'' **********The man has no gun and perhaps the bravado is that of a person whose desire for the glory of battle is balanced by relief at the remoteness of the contest. ''The war is 600 miles away,'' the man says, shouting across the insistent rock music that roars from rooms lit with red and eerie green light bulbs. ''That is why it does not affect us.'' **********Salvation is not seen as being available from within this bruised nation. ''We need help from our friends,'' the man says. ''You Americans must help us.'' Self-help, or reconciliation, seems not to be a factor in the calculation. **********The Libyans occupied Chad between 1980 and 1981. They were not liked, did not pay salaries or make the telephones work. Twenty years before, the people who put the phones in, the French, took down their tricolor for the last time after the colonial occupation. But some things remained. **********''We were civilized by the French,'' says the accountant in the bar, a statement at odds with some modern- day revisionist views of colonialism. In some African countries, like Uganda, war and insurgency reduce the visitors' diet to rice and water. Not here. The headwaiter at H^otel du Chari sports a bow tie and offers an array of salads and fish and meats and baguette bread that is acceptable to the French palate. A French diplomat, by a slip of the tongue, talks of ''the metropolis'' in France as if Chad were still a colony. The main street is, after all, Avenue Charles de Gaulle. **********But it is not so strong, the Frenchness, to dilute a style that has survived centuries at this junction of caravan trails and trade routes built on a bend in the river between desert and savannah. The authorities did not permit reporters to see French troops arriving here today, as if salvaging some pride from a forlorn reliance on a former colonial master. The people cross from here to Cameroon by dugout canoe, poled by thin men in stained white robes who use the stream for their boatmen's trade and as a place to bathe naked. **********Farther north, in the deserts, the manner is more Arab. President Hissen Habre, in the posters of him that adorn the city, displays the nation's three faces: in one portrait he wears a Western-style suit, in another his battledress, while in a third he is clad in white robes and skullcap. Chad, thus, is a place where modernity has been bolted, but loosely, onto longer traditions and perennial conflict. **********But now it is the 20th century that presses and impinges. Each day huge Starlifter military transports from the United States, seeming almost to pause and hover in the sky before landing, thunder into Ndjamena, laden with miltary supplies. French Transalls, on secretive missions, lumber off the runway for distant outposts not yet threatened but possibly imperiled. French technicians scurry around at the military air base assembling machine guns and helicopters. Zairian soldiers, sent by President Mobutu Sese Seko, guard the airport in characteristically brusque manner. ''You are a journalist?'' one says. ''Then go away.'' **********The Libyans have gone but the French are here, and the American flag flies from the towering tails of the Starlifters. The Libyans are in the north, the Zairians in the south on the Government's side. The slogan on the streets says, ''No sellout of Chad.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/19/business/renault-model.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-07-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 85, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Renault Model", "print_headline": "Renault Model", "body_text": " **********The first 1984 Renault Encore hatchback rolled off the assembly line at the American Motors Corporation's Kenosha, Wis., plant to the cheers of A.M.C. autoworkers, the company said.

Such shareholders can sell shares in some regional companies and use the proceeds to buy shares in others. **********An A.T.& T. spokesman said that shareholders who own between 10 and 500 shares represent about 77 percent of all accounts. He said the consolidation option would reduce transaction costs. **********As previously announced, shareholders will receive one share in each of the holding companies for every 10 A.T.& T. shares they own, while retaining the same number of A.T.& T. shares. Shareholders holding less than 10 A.T.& T. shares, who are entitled to less than a full share in each regional company, will receive cash instead of a fractional share. Accounts with 500 or more shares will receive certificates for whole shares of regional company stock and cash for any fractional shares, the company said. Fee for Consolidation Option **********The company also said that in January all shareholders would receive a statement showing their A.T.& T. and regional company holdings. Those eligible will also receive an option card, returnable in mid-April, to rearrange their regional company holdings if they prefer to do so. **********A fee of 25 cents will be charged to exercise the consolidation option for every regional company share sold and another 25 cents for every share bought. The price of the regional company shares bought or sold through this method will be determined by the average of each company's high and low prices on the New York Stock Exchange on the day the option card is received. A.T.& T. has 930 million common shares outstanding. **********In addition, A.T.& T. said trading of its stock and the seven regional holding companies would begin on a when-issued basis in the second half of November. Distribution of stock in the regional companies is scheduled to begin in mid-February 1984. **********Each of the holding companies will offer a dividend reinvestment plan similar to A.T.& T.'s. The program allows shareholders to acquire additional stock at a discount and without paying brokerage fees. **********While it set about informing investors of its stock distribution, A.T.& T. said it was continuing to study the recent modifications to the overall plan of reorganization that were proposed by the Federal judge overseeing the case. One of those modifications was that A.T.& T. could no longer use the Bell name in corporate affiliates other than Bell Laboratories and foreign subsidiaries."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/10/business/trading-active-in-tymshare.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-09-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 116, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Trading Active In Tymshare", "print_headline": "Trading Active In Tymshare", "body_text": " **********Active trading in Tymshare Inc. was attributed by analysts and traders to reports that the company was an imminent takeover target. **********Tymshare, one of the biggest percentage gainers on the New York Stock Exchange, jumped $1.75, to $26.75.

The high bids on the 40 blocks they sought came to $71.1 million.  The auction took place under something of a legal cloud, since three states, New York, Virginia and Maryland, have filed lawsuits to block the sale of hundreds of parcels among the 4,050 leases on the outer continental shelf in the mid-Atlantic. But only four tracts in contested areas ended up attracting bids, all of them in New York regions. **********Money to Be Put in Escrow **********In effect, the decision not to bid on tracts in the Maryland and Virginia regions makes moot the lawsuits in those two states, an Interior Department spokesman said. ''The money bid on the four contested tracts in New York will be put in escrow, and we are constrained from issuing leases on these tracts before the court makes a ruling,'' he added. A hearing date on the suit has not yet been set. **********Some analysts were surprised that the bids were as high as they were.  ''We weren't expecting anything big from this auction,'' said Suzanne W. Wright, an oil analyst at the First Boston Corporation.

Dealers said that short-term Treasury discount rates were basically unchanged, while prices of long-term Treasury coupon issues closed moderately lower with attendant rises in yields after a late flurry of selling. Prices of tax-exempt and corporate bonds closed off as much as a quarter point in in equally dull trading. **********The confusion was heightened by warnings of further rises in short-term rates that were made yesterday by Martin S. Feldstein, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, before the Senate Banking Committee. **********Mr. Feldstein said that the current prime lending rate of 10.5 percent should normally be 2.5 percentage points above the Treasury bill rate, which is now just over 9 percent. Consequently, he said, a one-point rise in the prime rate could be expected at any time. Discount Rate Called Low **********Several prominent dealers agreed, saying that by the same token the Federal Reserve's discount rate of 8.5 percent, or 3 percentage points below long bond yields, was also too low to be sustainable for long. **********As the investors and dealers reassessed the interest rate structure, Three- and six-month Treasury bills were off one basis point, at 9.05 percent and 9.17 percent, respectively; the one-year bills inched up a basis point, at 9.27 percent. A basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point. The new 10 5/8 percent two-year notes fell to 99.32 from 10.62, which was the average yield produced at the monthly auction on Wednesday. **********At the longer end of the Treasury coupon issues, the 10 1/2 percent notes of 1988 slipped to 97 14/32 from 97 16/ 32; the 10 1/8's of 1993, to 94 4/32 from 93 9/32, while the benchmark long bond, the 10 3/8's of 2012, dropped to 91 25/32 from 92 5/32, with a concomitant rise in the yield to 11.34 percent from 11.30. **********Much of the late selling came after the Chicago financial futures markets closed. At the close there, the spot September Treasury bond futures were down 14/32 at 72 17/32, after having ranged between 73 2/32 and 72 16/32. Bill futures were steady, with the spot September contract closing at 90.70. **********''The retail buyers have demonstrated again today that they need higher yields before they will even take speculative positions, and when yields decline they sell,'' said Philip Braverman, bond market economist at the Chase Manhattan Bank. Bearish on Rates **********Dealers, he noted, remain bearish on rates and have become more fearful of inflation and are trying to reduce inventories or sell the market short. Noting that terms of the Treasury's early August refunding will be announced next Wednesday, Mr. Braverman said, dealers will have to lighten their stock further or sell more of it short before then as a precaution. **********(Yesterday, Treasury officials were in New York soliciting views of Government securities dealers on the auction terms.) ''The dealers are becoming preoccupied with the refunding, which may involve $15.75 billion of new paper, and with the prospects for higher yields, they prefer to lighten inventory and sell short, rather than be forced to do so afterward,'' Mr. Braverman continued. **********Many economists expect interest rates to ease or hold at current levels because of statements made by Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve, before Congress this week. They interpreted his testimony to mean that the central bank would not tighten credit further. Mr. Braverman, however, disagrees with that view. **********''I believe we will see further tightening. Although Mr. Volcker has rebased M-1 and increased other money supply targets, it does not preclude a rise in the discount rate or higher Federal fund levels,'' he said. **********Yesterday, the first day of the new banking week, this key interbank overnight lending rate remained steady at 9 3/8 percent.  Essentially, the Fed must serve as a counterweight to the growing inflation psychology that is overtaking investors in fixed-income securities because of the soaring Federal budget deficits and trade imbalances, Mr. Braverman stressed, adding: ''We believe that one way the Fed can serve as a counterweight to the inflation fears is by being less accommodative, while at the same trying to calm the fears of credit tightening.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/18/business/l-generating-bosses-173815.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-09-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 289, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": ";  Generating Bosses", "print_headline": ";  Generating Bosses", "body_text": " **********To the Business Editor: **********I cannot believe the situation is as simple as John Schreiner contends (''First Come the Bosses - Then the Jobs,'' Sept. 11).

Or is it lack of planning in a fiercely competitive environment? Isn't it partly lack of access to capital, skilled labor and markets? Tax policy is bogus. Even if Uncle Sam takes a greater percentage from me as my income goes up, I still take home more as I am successful in business. I get financial rewards.

The arguments have been familiar, the revelations tending to support the picture of a military machine hurtling forward beyond the control of the Cabinet. **********Predictably, former Defense Minister Ariel Sharon, the chief architect of the war's ambitious political and military goals, said in several interviews that he would do it all again in the same way if he had a second chance. He accused other Government ministers of trying to evade their responsibility as the war has become less popular. **********The newspaper Maariv ran a special section, called ''The Unfinished War,'' full of allegations that major decisions were made by Mr.  Sharon without Prime Minister Menachem Begin's knowledge. In early August, when the Palestine Liberation Organization was still refusing to leave besieged Beirut, the paper said, Mr. Sharon, on his own, ordered a large mobilization of reservists. Interior Minister Yosef Burg, hearing about the call-up, telephoned Prime Minister Begin in the middle of the night, and Mr. Begin reprimanded the Defense Minister, Maariv reported. Authorization 'After the Fact' **********Deputy Prime Minister Simcha Ehrlich said in a television interview that in the third week of June the Cabinet approved the army's taking of the Beirut-Damascus highway, in the central region, only ''after the fact.'' **********With Mr. Begin in the United States at the time, Mr. Ehrlich was Acting Prime Minister. He said he had been told, inaccurately, that the Syrians had started the fighting that gave Israel cause to attack. ''Afterward I received reports from the front, from the field, that fire had been opened not just from the Syrian side,'' Mr. Ehrlich said, ''that is, that there had been provocations.'' **********Mr. Sharon's early vagueness about his specific goals has emerged as a major theme of the current discussions. Maj. Gen. Amir Drori, head of the northern command, was quoted today by Israeli radio as saying that the army could have performed better, with fewer casualties, if its objectives had been more clearly defined. Units could have moved more quickly, staged more amphibious landings and taken land routes to avoid enemy concentrations, he said. **********Some accounts suggest that Mr. Sharon either miscalculated or engaged in duplicity before the invasion. In a briefing of opposition Labor Party leaders April 6, 1982, two months before the war, Maariv reported, Mr. Sharon estimated that the operation would take only 48 hours and the army would be in Lebanon only a week. The Labor Party called today for a state commission of inquiry into all aspects of the war. Army Suffering Casualties **********Waiting for the Syrians and the P.L.O. to withdraw, the army is stuck in place, taking daily casualties from guerrilla attacks. Even the United States, which urged an Israeli withdrawal all along, has reportedly asked the Begin Government not to pull back from the volatile Shuf Mountain area, lest the Syrians and the P.L.O. move in to fill the vacuum. Israel has promised to consult with Washington and Beirut before taking any action. **********From the Government's supporters, there are brave calls to national unity, dramatic declarations that after ''Operation Peace for Galilee,'' Israelis in the north need no longer sleep in underground shelters during rocket and artillery attacks from the ''terrorists'' - the military units of the P.L.O. **********Neither the supporters nor the opponents of the war seem to have the stomach for doing the brutal arithmetic: In the four years between the previous Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon in 1978 and the invasion June 6, 1982, a total of 29 people were killed in northern Israel in all forms of attacks from Lebanon, including shelling and border crossings by terrorists, according to the army spokesman's office. In the year since the invasion, 490 Israelis have been killed in Lebanon. Border Quiet for a Year **********Israelis from across the political spectrum say they cannot be expected to pay a tribute in dead civilians for the sake of avoiding war. Still, opponents note that during the year before the invasion - from July 1981 to June 1982-the border was quiet. The cease-fire with the P.L.O. held. Rockets and artillery shells were fired only after Israeli planes bombed guerrilla positions in retaliation for terrorist attacks in Europe and elsewhere. **********For the first time, conscientious objection has taken root in Israel. A movement called ''There's a Limit'' has got the signatures of 2,020 soldiers -mostly reservists - on a refusal to serve in Lebanon. The organization has counted 61 soldiers whom the army has jailed for their refusal. **********And in all the interviews and editorials and private comments on this bitter anniversary, it is hard to find any new argument being offered on any side, anything that was not said almost a year ago, shortly after Israeli troops accomplished their invasion."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/18/business/export-curbs-are-extended.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-10-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 133, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Export Curbs Are Extended", "print_headline": "Export Curbs Are Extended", "body_text": " **********Declaring that a national economic emergency exists, President Reagan signed an executive order last week that indefinitely extends export controls and other provisions of the Export Administration Act. **********Mr. Reagan acted under the 1979 International Emergency Economic Powers Act because the Export Administration Act, extended by Congress beyond its Sept. 30 expiration date, lapsed at midnight Friday. **********Congress has been trying to renew the act but the House of Representatives and the Senate disagree about some provisions. **********A White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said the executive order would remain in effect ''until the law is reauthorized.''

Such a cut would be an overt signal of the Fed's willingness to foster lower short-term interest rates. **********However, other Fed announcements in the late afternoon were enough to keep alive the hopes that the central bank would encourage lower interest rates. Another reason for optimism was seen in the fact that the rate for overnight bank loans in the Federal funds market continued to decline, slipping to 8 percent from 8 1/4 percent the day before. **********Decline in Money Supply **********A $1.5 billion decline in the basic money supply, to $489.5 billion, for the week ended Feb. 16 was slightly larger than expected. Although Fed officials say they have de-emphasised the M-1 basic money supply measure in favor of more broadly defined measures that are announced only monthly, analysts still concluded that the latest week's decline bodes well for more moderate money supply growth in coming weeks. **********The M-1 measure, which comprises currency plus non-interest-bearing checking accounts, and interest-bearing checking accounts with unlimited withdrawal privileges, is slightly above a level consistent with the Fed's 1983 growth target of between 4 percent and 7 percent. **********But according to Henry Kaufman, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, the Fed is not concerned with the rapid growth of money supply measures in recent weeks and has supplied enough funds to the banking system to keep rates from rising. **********''Moreover,'' Mr. Kaufman writes in the latest issue of Comments on Credit, ''official pronouncements seem to favor lower money market rates.'' Supplying Credit to Banks **********Other data published by the Fed showed that it continues to supply an ample supply of credit to the banking system. The provision of funds to the banking system is crucial to the direction of short-term interest rates, since a greater availability of funds would mean lower rates, while less availability would mean higher rates. **********In the week ended Wednesday, some banks held $400 million more reserves on deposit with the Fed than were required, while other banks borrowed an average of $96 million from the Fed discount window. The result was a combined net free reserve position of $304 million. **********By late in the day, prices of Treasury securities were slightly lower than the best levels set in the afternoon, with three and sixmonth Treasury bill rates reduced by a tenth of a percentage point, or less, to 7.87 percent and 7.9 percent, respectively. Bond and Note Prices Rise **********Prices of notes and bonds rose by 1/8 to 3/4 of a point. Among active issues, the new 9 7/8 percent notes due 1988 rose about 3/8, to a price of 100, to yield 9.88 percent, while the 10 3/8 percent bonds due 2012 rose to 98 7/8, to yield 10.49 percent. At one time, the bond issue was offered at 99 1/4; it is now trading at about the same level as early last November, when its average auction yield was 10.46 percent. **********Business credit demands grew slightly in the week ended Feb. 16, with large banks across the country increasing their loans outstanding by $247 million, while businesses raised another $367 million by selling commercial paper. Both measures of business borrowing remain well below the peak levels set in the fall of 1982. **********The money market accounts introduced at banks and thrift institutions last December continued to grow rapidly in the week ended Feb. 16, increasing $11 billion, to $267.4 billion. **********The inflow of funds to the new accounts has enabled commercial banks to reduce the amount of money they borrow through sales of large negotiable certificates of deposit.

Marcus Getting Coal To Burn Clean", "body_text": " **********IF acid rain is to be seriously reduced over the **********next decade, most experts agree, the job will depend largely on flue-gas desulfurization, or ''scrubbing.'' This is the only option that is both commercially available and capable of stopping much of the sulfur dioxide emitted by coal-burning power plants from escaping into the atmosphere. **********But scrubbing is costly and cumbersome, and it leaves prodigious quantities of sludge. Because it is an add-on system, treating a problem after the fact rather than preventing it, a scrubber has no effect on the combustion process itself. And although it accounts for more than 10 percent of a power plant's capital cost, it produces no electricity. **********So a better approach might be to burn coal more cleanly and efficiently in the first place. The greatest promise for the long term, says Richard E. Balzhiser, senior vice president of the Electric Power Research Institute, is to develop ''fundamentally different ways'' to get electricity from coal. **********The leading candidate is fluidized-bed combustion, in which fine particles of coal are fed into a bed of limestone. The mixture appears to percolate like a liquid, thus giving rise to the term fluidized, and much of the sulfur dioxide produced by the burning coal reacts with the limestone and is drawn off. **********The nominal reduction of sulfur dioxide in a fluidized bed is the same - about 90 percent - as the combination of scrubbers and conventional boilers. But the greatest promise of fluidized-bed boilers is their ability to burn many different kinds of fuel, from top-grade to run-of-the-mine coal, as well as a wide variety of solid wastes. **********Fluidized-bed units are being produced by established makers of conventional boilers such as the Foster Wheeler Corporation, the Babcock & Wilcox subsidiary of McDermott Inc., Combustion Engineering Inc. and the Riley Stoker Corporation, which is a subsidiary of Ashland Oil Inc. Other companies specializing in the new technology include the Johnston Boiler Company of Ferrysburg, Mich., which is a subsidiary of Stone International of Britain, and the Pyropower Corporation of San Diego, a member of the Ahlstrom group of Finland. **********Sales have been ''slow but substantial,'' says Herbert M. Kosstrin, principal process engineer with the engineering concern of Stone & Webster Inc., who estimates the total number sold to be ''in the hundreds.'' But Edward A. Zielinski, manager of fluidized-bed combustion development at Combustion Engineering, says that ''less than 15'' are of a type that could be useful for utilities. **********Indeed, fluidized-bed boilers are not yet commercially available in the sizes required for electric power plants. And for an industry in which reliability is of paramount importance, long periods of testing are needed first. Mr. Balzhiser of the Electric Power Research Institute estimates that at least 10 years will be required. **********In the United States, much will depend on two projects led by the institute, in cooperation with the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Duke Power Company and the State of Kentucky. The first, a pilot-scale generating station of 20 megawatts driven by a fluidized-bed boiler built by Babcock & Wilcox, is currently in the second year of a four- year test period near Paducah, Ky. Its results will be shared with the boiler industry to influence a larger demonstration project, a plant of about 160 megawatts, to be built at the same site. **********Progress in industrial and utility application is also being reported in Europe. In West Germany, a demonstration plant at Esertal powered by fluidized-bed technology is generating 129 megawatts of electricity, and another at Volklingen is being built to deliver 200 megawatts. ''We are motivated by the extensive damage that acid rain has done to our trees,'' says Heinz Riesenhuber, Bonn's Minister of Research and Technology, ''which to us is close to catastrophe.'' **********But these demonstrations largely involve the first generation of fluidized-bed boilers, which have exhibited problems such as incomplete combustion, lower-than-anticipated sulfur removal, a tendency to clog and sheer size. **********The inherent limitation of first-generation units, says Gordon B. Baty, president of Wormser Engineering Inc. of Woburn, Mass., is that combustion and desulfurization - two entirely different chemical reactions - take place in the same bed, meaning that each process must be compromised. His company's approach is to build boilers with two beds, one for each function, with consequent improvement in the efficiency of each. **********Another approach is the circulating bed, in which fuel and limestone recirculate throughout the reactor to extend the time, and thus the completeness, of combustion and desulfurization. This is being developed by two competitors: Pyropower and a joint venture of Combustion Engineering and the Lurgi Corporation of West Germany. **********A major impediment to progress is the depressed market. Utilities are simply not buying boilers, and William Axtman, executive director of the American Boiler Manufacturers Association, declines to predict when and how changes may occur. ''The boiler industry is just beginning to recover from the recession,'' he says. Analysts who watch the boiler industry tend to dismiss fluidized- bed combustion at present as ''a research and development'' market. **********Nevertheless, Wormser's Mr. Baty waxes confident, maintaining that there is nothing in principle to prevent rapid penetration. ''Fluidized beds today,'' he says, ''are where airplanes were in 1925 - post-Wright brothers but pre-DC3. And they don't involve twisting arms to buy scrubbers and hang them on obsolete pieces of equipment.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/12/world/around-the-world-reagan-to-name-envoy-to-mozambique.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-07-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 99, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Reagan to Name Envoy to Mozambique", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Reagan to Name Envoy to Mozambique", "body_text": " **********President Reagan said today that he would nominate Peter Jon de Vos, a career diplomat, as the first United States Ambassador to Mozambique since the Marxist Government expelled American diplomats more than two years ago. **********State Department officials said the move was part of a general warming of relations with Mozambique, which accused American diplomats of spying in March 1981. **********They said Mozambique was trying to attract private investment in the West and had aided Western efforts to arrange a peaceful move to independence for South-West Africa."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/31/business/market-place-still-no-letup-in-bull-market.html": {"writer_name": "Vartanig Vartan", "pub_date": "1983-05-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 796, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place; Still No Letup In Bull Market", "print_headline": "Market Place; Still No Letup In Bull Market", "body_text": " **********LAST August, when the budding rally in stock prices was only two sessions old and investors kept wondering if it was genuine, Albert M. Wojnilower of the First Boston Corporation forecast sharp declines ahead for interest rates. A day later, Henry Kaufman of Salomon Brothers weighed in with similar views and the bull market in equities, armed with the welcome opinions of Wall Street's two most prominent economists, was off and sprinting. **********Last week, fresh from a trip to Zurich and London where he met with representatives of financial institutions, Mr. Wojnilower summed up his views anew in New York. Most short-term interest rates are probably near their lows, he said, ''but although short rates may be higher a year from now, the net rise may only amount to 1 percent or so.'' **********Without setting any parameters, the First Boston economist went on to suggest that the most dynamic initial upthrust in stock prices since World War II still has room to run. ''Whenever institutional investors do not sense any serious risk of either rising interest rates or a renewed economic downturn,'' he stated, ''a speculative stock market climate is likely to predominate.'' **********Meanwhile, a look at market activity last week showed that the speculative spirit is alive and thriving. Last week, with volume on the New York Stock Exchange approaching 100 million shares daily, the Dow Jones industrial average finished at 1,216.14, up 26.12 points.  Its record closing of 1,232.59 on May 6 represents a 58 percent advance since Aug. 12. **********While demand for some of the Big Board's better-known issues has slackened somewhat, recently, brokers report that individual investors are becoming more venturesome. This is underscored by swelling demand for smaller-capitalization issues, many of which trade on the American Stock Exchange and the over-the-counter market. Last week, the Amex market value index and the Nasdaq composite index both set record highs. These two indicators, moreover, virtually have doubled since the start of the rally last summer. **********Cyclical stocks -comparative laggards in the market's sustained recovery - ranked as the week's best performers, according to Salomon Brothers. The steel group rose 8.2 percent, followed by chemicals and papers, each posting gains in excess of 4 percent. Only 6 of 38 stock groups declined, led by drugs and tobaccos, down 6.1 percent and 5.8 percent, respectively. **********For the most part, the wisest course of action so far in this bull market has been for investors to ignore selling advice and simply to hold on to their stocks. During the last nine months, legions of investors, from canny professionals to rank amateurs, have repeatedly ignored the Wall Street maxim of ''cut your losses and let your profits run,'' only to glance with regret at still-rising prices of stocks they once owned. **********One of the week's best gainers on the Big Board was Stop & Shop Companies, which surged 10 3/4 points, to 95 3/4, after it forecast ''significantly higher'' profits for the newly ended quarter. Early last year, shares of the discount retailer and supermarket chain traded as low as 14 1/4. **********Over a longer time frame, the merit of not selling too soon was demonstrated again by the action of MCI Communications. In the latest week, the stock rose 4 7/8 points, to 49 1/4, in over-the-counter trading. This compares with a split-adjusted price of 50 cents a share six years ago. The long-distance telephone and telecommunications company denied rumors last week that it would be acquired by either American Express or General Electric. Analysts at Prudential-Bache Securities expect MCI to show a 30 percent annual growth rate over the next five years. **********Meanwhile, the overriding question on both Wall Street and Main Street remains, ''When is this bull market going to stumble?'' Indicator Digest, an investment advisory service, has noted that, on average, ''almost one year passes between the birth of a bull and any correction of 10 percent or more,'' as measured by the Dow. **********Analysts at Merrill Lynch have estimated that, allowing for periods of price weakness, ''the current cyclical bull market, which began in August 1982, should last until some time in the second half of 1984.'' That projection would be in keeping with the historical pattern whereby the final two years of a President's first term generally are the most rewarding period for stock market investment. **********At Goldman, Sachs & Company, portfolio strategists regard a market correction of around 10 percent from recent highs as ''inevitable,'' but they believe its duration will be short. ''To us,'' they said, ''the primary direction of stock prices is up, with another 15 percent or so advance expected over the next 12 to 15 months.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/11/business/business-digest-monday-april-11-1983.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1983-04-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 439, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MONDAY, APRIL 11, 1983", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST; MONDAY, APRIL 11, 1983", "body_text": " **********The Economy **********A long fight is expected over legislation to withhold taxes on interest and dividends.
